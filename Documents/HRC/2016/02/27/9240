</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report supplements the main report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to the Human Rights Council. It reflects specific situations 
alleged to be affecting the independence of the judiciary or violating the right to a fair trial in 
62 countries. Further, it presents any replies received from the Government of the country 
concerned in response to specific allegations together with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments 
and observations. Readers will thus find in it: 
</p>
<p> (a) Summaries of the urgent appeals and allegation letters transmitted by the Special 
Rapporteur to governmental authorities between 16 January 2007 and 15 March 2008, and of 
press releases issued during the same reporting period. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to emphasize that the communications presented in the report exclusively reflect 
allegations he received and subsequently acted upon. Where information was insufficient and 
could not be supplemented, or where the information received was outside the mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur was not in a position to act. Hence such allegations were not included in the 
report; 
</p>
<p> (b) Summaries of the replies received from several States concerned between 
16 January 2007 and 30 April 2008. In certain instances, the Government reply was obtained late 
and referred to allegations that were presented in the previous report concerning the year 2006 or 
even earlier. In those cases, the Special Rapporteur has included the respective allegation in the 
section of communications sent, in order to facilitate the reader&#8217;s comprehension. On the other 
hand, it may be noted that certain responses to urgent appeals or allegation letters sent during the 
reporting period, and for which the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments, could 
not be included in the report owing to the fact that they were either not translated in time or 
received after 30 April 2008. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s regret, they will therefore be reflected 
only in next year&#8217;s report. Finally, due to restrictions on the length of the report, the Special 
Rapporteur has been obliged to summarize the details of all correspondence sent and received. 
As a result, requests from Governments to publish their replies in their totality could regrettably 
not be accommodated;  
</p>
<p> (c) Observations or specific comments by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. The report also includes five tables of statistical data so as to help the Human Rights 
Council to have an overview of developments in 2007 and the first trimester of 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. As may be seen from the tables, action has mainly been taken in the form of joint urgent 
action (65%). This reflects not only a personal choice of the Special Rapporteur to work in close 
collaboration with other special Rapporteurs and aimed at strengthening the functioning and 
impact of the special procedures, but also the fact that it is far from uncommon that situations 
affecting the judiciary occur in contexts in which other democratic institutions are also at risk, or 
where a wide range of human rights are being violated such as the right to life, the right not to be 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment, the right to freedom of expression, as well as the specific 
rights of women, indigenous people and minorities. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur notes that communications have been sent to Member States of all 
regions of the world. Asia and the Pacific (38%) and the Middle East and North Africa (25%) 
represent more than half of the total of communications sent (63%). Africa comes on third place 
with 17% of the communications. Finally, Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe, 
North America and Central Asia have received an equivalent number of communications from 
the Special Rapporteur (10%). 
</p>
<p>5. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur wishes to point out that, as compared to previous 
years, he has enjoyed increased cooperation on the part of Governments. In fact, 38 States of 
the 62 States referred to in this report have provided him with a substantive reply to his 
communications. Most of these States have offered detailed substantive information on the 
allegations received. The Special Rapporteur welcomes and further encourages cooperation from 
the Governments that have provided replies to his communications. The Special Rapporteur 
underlines that it is crucial that Governments share their views on the allegations received with 
him. He highlights his preoccupation in relation to the proportion of specific allegations of 
serious human rights violations that remain unanswered. The Special Rapporteur invites those 
States which are lagging behind to avoid situations in which they do not offer any form of 
substantive reply to allegations transmitted to them. Fearing that such lack of reply may expose 
these States to various interpretations ranging from administrative negligence to an admission by 
omission of the allegation relayed to them, he urges them to provide precise and detailed answers 
at the earliest possible date.  
</p>
<p>6. In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes that replies are often received with a considerable 
delay. This is certainly a matter of concern, in particular in situations in which the life or the 
physical integrity of a person or a group of persons is in danger. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages States to reply to his communications within reasonable deadlines. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur trusts that the situation described above demonstrates the 
relevance of the existence and the concrete impact of this special procedure which, in his view, 
should definitely be strengthened in the course of the review of mandates by the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  STATISTICAL DATA 
</b></p>
<p>8. The following four figures are aimed at helping the Human Rights Council to have an 
overview of developments in 2007 and first semester of 2008. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to clarify that these figures do not include the press releases issued by him. </p>

<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED  
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>9. On 28 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding Mr. Sayed Perwiz Kambaksh, a student 
and journalist at a local newspaper in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. According to the information 
received, on 22 January 2008, Mr. Kambaksh was sentenced to death on blasphemy charges by 
the city court of Mazar-i-Sharif in a trial reportedly conducted in camera and without the 
presence of a defence lawyer. The blasphemy charges are related to a report that Mr. Kambaksh 
printed off the internet and distributed to other journalism students at Balkh University, which 
was considered by the judges as having &#8220;distorted Quran verses&#8221; and &#8220;humiliated Islam&#8221;. 
According to reports, Mr. Kambaksh&#8217;s sentence may be related to articles written by his brother 
and published by the Institute of War and Peace Reporting criticizing Balkh provincial 
authorities for corruption and abuse of power. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>None. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Afghanistan to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end 
of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegations. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned and urges the Government to urgently 
provide detailed information regarding the trial process of the accused, especially considering 
that Mr. Kambaksh has reportedly been sentenced to death in a trial that does not seem to 
comply with article 14 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.

<p>11. Le 5 octobre 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du 
Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme a adress&#233; au 
Gouvernement alg&#233;rien une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant la situation de Me Hassiba 
Boumerdassi et Me Amine Sidhoum Abderramane, avocats alg&#233;riens et d&#233;fenseurs des droits de 
l&#8217;homme, membres de l&#8217;ONG SOS Disparu(e)s. Me Amine Sidhoum Abderramane avait d&#233;j&#224; 
fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une communication ant&#233;rieure envoy&#233;e conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial 
sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression et la

l&#8217;homme le 26 mai 2006 et d&#8217;une autre communication envoy&#233;e conjointement avec cette 
derni&#232;re le 8 septembre 2006. Selon les informations re&#231;ues de la source, le 10 septembre 2006, 
Me Hassiba Boumerdassi et Me Amine Sidhoum Abderramane auraient comparu devant le juge </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>d&#8217;instruction du tribunal de Bab El Oued en raison des poursuites initi&#233;es &#224; leur encontre pour 
avoir remis &#224; leurs clients retenus en prison des documents relatifs &#224; leur d&#233;fense. Ainsi, dans le 
cas de Me Hassiba Boumerdassi, il s&#8217;agirait du dossier du proc&#232;s verbal du d&#233;tenu concern&#233;, 
remis qui aurait &#233;t&#233; autoris&#233;e par un gardien de la prison ; dans celui de Me Amine Sidhoum 
Abderramane, il s&#8217;agirait de la remise de ses cartes de visite. Me Hassiba Boumerdassi serait 
accus&#233;e d&#8217;avoir viol&#233; l&#8217;article 166 du Code de l&#8217;organisation p&#233;nitentiaire et de l&#8217;insertion 
sociale des d&#233;tenus qui dispose qu&#8217;il est interdit de remettre, d&#8217;essayer de remettre ou de faire 
parvenir &#224; un d&#233;tenu dans des conditions ill&#233;gales, en quelque lieu que ce soit, des sommes 
d&#8217;argent, correspondances, m&#233;dicaments ou tout autre objet non autoris&#233;. De m&#234;me, elle serait 
accus&#233;e d&#8217;avoir viol&#233; l&#8217;article 16 de la Loi relative &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; des prisons qui &#233;tablit qu&#8217;il n&#8217;est 
pas permis d&#8217;introduire ou de faire sortir de sommes d&#8217;argent ou correspondances, sauf si elles 
sont permises par le r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur de la prison ou si elles sont autoris&#233;es express&#233;ment par 
le directeur de la prison. Me Hassiba Boumerdassi serait en outre poursuivie pour violation de 
l&#8217;article 31 de la Loi portant sur le r&#232;glement int&#233;rieur de prisons qui dispose que le prisonnier 
qui remet ou envoie dans des conditions ill&#233;gales ou tente de remettre &#224; un autre prisonnier ou &#224; 
toute autre personne des sommes d&#8217;argent, correspondances, m&#233;dicaments ou autre chose 
s&#8217;expose &#224; des sanctions p&#233;nales  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, Me Boumerdassi et 
Me Sidhoum devaient se pr&#233;senter devant le juge d&#8217;instruction le 25 septembre 2006. Cependant, 
leur audience aurait &#233;t&#233; report&#233;e au d&#233;but du mois de novembre 2006. La source exprimait la 
crainte que les charges retenues contre Me Hassiba Boumerdassi et Me Amine Sidhoum ne 
visent &#224; emp&#234;cher ces derniers de poursuivre leurs actions en faveur de la d&#233;fense des droits des 
familles de disparus au sein de SOS Disparu(e)s et affirmait qu&#8217;elles s&#8217;inscrivaient dans un 
contexte d&#8217;intimidation et de harc&#232;lement auquel sont confront&#233;s les d&#233;fenseurs alg&#233;riens, 
notamment lorsqu&#8217;il s&#8217;agit de d&#233;fendre les droits des familles de disparus. 
</p>
<p>12. Le 29 juin 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la 
torture, a envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant la situation de M. Mohamed Boucekkine, r&#233;sident 
de Fouka. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, deux individus en civil seraient entr&#233;s au domicile de la 
famille Boucekkine, &#224; Fouka, sans s&#8217;identifier. Ils auraient demand&#233; &#224; Mohamed Boucekkine de 
leur pr&#233;senter ses papiers et auraient proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; une fouille de la maison ; apr&#232;s quoi, ils lui 
auraient demand&#233; de les suivre. Interrog&#233;s par l&#8217;&#233;pouse sur le lieu o&#249; ils emmenaient son mari, 
les deux individus lui auraient r&#233;pondu qu&#8217;ils allaient simplement l&#8217;interroger. Selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, M. Boucekkine aurait &#233;t&#233; amen&#233; avec le visage couvert dans un endroit 
inconnu o&#249; il serait encore d&#233;tenu. Treize jours apr&#232;s son arrestation, il n&#8217;aurait toujours pas pu 
entrer en contact avec sa famille ni avec un avocat. Mohamed Boucekkine avait d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; et 
avait purg&#233; une peine d&#8217;emprisonnement de 7 ans avant d&#8217;&#234;tre lib&#233;r&#233; en 1999. En plus, son p&#232;re 
aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; en 1995 et serait &#224; ce jour toujours port&#233; disparu. Sa m&#232;re aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e en 
1997 et serait morte en d&#233;tention suite aux mauvais traitements qu&#8217;elle aurait subis. Des craintes 
ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;s quant au fait que Mohamed Boucekkine soit soumis &#224; la torture ou d&#8217;autres 
mauvais traitements entrainant des cons&#233;quences extr&#234;mement graves.

</b></p>
<p>16. El Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n el 7 de Julio de 2006, sobre la situaci&#243;n de la 
Dra .Marta Catella, quien fue suspendida el 12 de enero de 2006 en su cargo como Jueza del 
Superior Tribunal de la Provincia de Misiones por la Sala Acusadora de la legislatura provincial. 
Se se&#241;al&#243;, adem&#225;s, la preocupaci&#243;n por el caso de los Drs. Horacio Alarc&#243;n, Juez Penal de la 
provincia de Misiones y Lloyd Jorge Wicstr&#246;m, Fiscal de Estado en la misma provincia, quienes 
seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida son objeto de sendos juicios pol&#237;ticos promovidos por el gobierno 
provincial. La situaci&#243;n de las personas mencionadas hab&#237;a sido objeto de una previa 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada al Gobierno, el d&#237;a 24 de enero de 2006. En dicha comunicaci&#243;n se 
solicitaba la aclaraci&#243;n de varios puntos relacionados con las investigaciones y juicios iniciados 
en contra de dichas personas, as&#237; como con relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n general de la independencia 
del poder judicial en la provincia de Misiones. En dicha ocasi&#243;n el Relator indic&#243; que conforme 
a declaraciones p&#250;blicas, la acusaci&#243;n contra la Jueza Marta Catella se funda en dos votos 
emitidos por ella:. el primero, en un recurso de apelaci&#243;n interpuesto por el Intendente de 
San Vicente (provincia de Misiones), contra la decisi&#243;n del Concejo Deliberante de destituirlo 
(Resoluci&#243;n N 492-STJ-05). El segundo voto que se invoca en la acusaci&#243;n es el reca&#237;do en un 
incidente de nulidad, tambi&#233;n presentado por el Intendente de San Vicente en la misma causa, en 
virtud del cual se declar&#243; la nulidad de diversas actuaciones en el expediente principal, incluida 
la sentencia (Resoluci&#243;n N.&#186; 576-STJ-05). 
</p>
<p>17. En virtud de la declaraci&#243;n de nulidad, la cuesti&#243;n que origina el pedido de juicio pol&#237;tico 
(que contempla la falsedad o no del Acta 08/05 y de la Resoluci&#243;n 07/05 del Concejo 
Deliberante) se encuentra pendiente de resoluci&#243;n judicial. Las alegaciones se&#241;alan este aspecto 
como de suma gravedad por constituir al Poder Legislativo como una nueva instancia revisora, 
contrariando el principio republicano de separaci&#243;n de poderes, y vulnerando la independencia 
judicial de los magistrados que ya se han pronunciado. Pero adem&#225;s, sostener la acusaci&#243;n de </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Marta Catella por el contenido del voto emitido, podr&#237;a configurar una suerte de amenaza de 
destituci&#243;n a los jueces que actualmente entienden en la causa judicial, ya que correr&#237;an el riesgo 
de que, si votaran en sentido concordante a como lo hizo la magistrada Catella, podr&#237;an sufrir las 
mismas consecuencias, esto es ser denunciados con el prop&#243;sito de ser destituidos. Las 
alegaciones tambi&#233;n indican que este proceso fue iniciado por el Intendente de San Vicente, del 
partido de gobierno, pocos d&#237;as despu&#233;s que la Jueza Catella - a cargo del Tribunal Electoral de 
la Provincia - se pronunciara en forma adversa a las pretensiones del Gobierno provincial. Marta 
Catella aplic&#243; una cl&#225;usula de la Constituci&#243;n Provincial que reserva un m&#237;nimo de un tercio de 
la representaci&#243;n legislativa a la minor&#237;a - y que no establece un umbral m&#237;nimo de votos para 
acceder a un cargo - en contra de los intereses del oficialismo que aspiraba se le reconociera dos 
bancas: una en la C&#225;mara de Representantes y otra en el Concejo Deliberante de El Dorado. Este 
proceso se da en un contexto de persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica contra jueces independientes en la provincia 
de Misiones, que incluye el reciente pedido de destituci&#243;n del juez penal Horacio Alarc&#243;n, quien 
hab&#237;a ordenado el procesamiento por homicidio del hijo de una diputada del partido de gobierno 
y el juicio pol&#237;tico promovido contra el Fiscal de Estado Lloyd Jorge Wicstrom, quien ha 
denunciado p&#250;blicamente diversos casos de corrupci&#243;n administrativa del actual gobierno 
provincial. 
</p>
<p>18. El 18 de abril de 2007, el Relator especial envi&#243; conjuntamente con la Representante 
Especial del Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humanos, una carta de 
alegaci&#243;n sobre la situaci&#243;n del Dr. Pablo Gabriel Salinas, abogado defensor de derechos 
humanos en la provincia de Mendoza. El Dr. Salinas ha trabajado a favor de v&#237;ctimas de 
brutalidad policial, de ejecuciones extrajudiciales y de otras violaciones de derechos humanos 
cometidas durante la dictadura militar en la Argentina. El Dr. Salinas ya hab&#237;a sido objeto de un 
llamamiento urgente enviado el 27 de diciembre de 2005 por el Relator Especial sobre la 
independencia de magistrados y abogados y la Representante Especial del Secretario-General 
para los defensores de los derechos humanos. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el Dr. Salinas 
habr&#237;a recibido una carta an&#243;nima amenaz&#225;ndole a &#233;l y a su familia con que algo les suceder&#237;a si 
no dejaba su actividad. Al d&#237;a siguiente se habr&#237;a presentado la denuncia de la amenaza an&#243;nima 
ante la Unidad Fiscal de Delitos Complejos de la Primera Circunscripci&#243;n Judicial de Mendoza. 
Asimismo, a trav&#233;s de una petici&#243;n presentada ante la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos 
Humanos, se habr&#237;an solicitado medidas cautelares para proteger al Dr. Salinas y a su familia. De 
acuerdo a lo informado, &#233;ste habr&#237;a sido v&#237;ctima de reiterados actos de hostigamiento y 
amenazas. En el 2005 el Dr. Salinas habr&#237;a recibido llamadas telef&#243;nicas amenazantes y su 
oficina apareci&#243; cubierta de graffitis. Se teme que estos eventos puedan estar relacionados con la 
actividad en defensa de los derechos humanos del Dr. Pablo Gabriel Salinas y se expresa 
profunda preocupaci&#243;n por su seguridad e integridad f&#237;sica as&#237; como la de su familia.  
</p>
<p>19. El 3 de Mayo de 2007, el Relator Especial conjuntamente con el Representante Especial 
del Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; una carta de 
alegaci&#243;n, para se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de Argentina la informaci&#243;n que hab&#237;a 
recibido en relaci&#243;n con el aumento de actos de hostigamiento y amenazas en contra de jueces, 
fiscales y abogados vinculados a la defensa de los derechos humanos, sobre todo aquellos que 
han participado en los procesos judiciales contra integrantes de la dictadura militar argentina por 
delitos de lesa humanidad cometidos entre los a&#241;os 1976 y 1983. Entre ellos se destacan las 
amenazas dirigidas a dos jueces del Tribunal Oral que conden&#243; a Miguel Etchecolatz, el 
Sr. Norberto Lorenzo y el Sr. Horacio Insaurralde, as&#237; como al despacho del juez Arnaldo 
Corazza y del fiscal Sergio Franco, ambos pertenecientes al Tribunal Federal de Primera </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>Instancia de La Plata y a cargo de la instrucci&#243;n de causas contra ex represores. Asimismo, el 
juez Carlos Rozansky, presidente del Tribunal Oral que conden&#243; a Miguel Etchecolatz a 
reclusi&#243;n perpetua, recibi&#243; dos llamados telef&#243;nicos amenazantes provenientes del Servicio 
Penitenciario Federal: uno de la Unidad 2 de Devoto y otro de la Unidad 27 femenino, realizados 
desde tel&#233;fonos que utiliza el personal a los que los internos no tienen acceso. La escalada de 
amenazas y actos intimidatorios que desde marzo de 2005 vienen sufriendo en la ciudad de 
C&#243;rdoba, los abogados querellantes, la representante del Ministerio P&#250;blico y los activistas de 
derechos humanos en el marco de las causas judiciales que tramita la justicia federal con asiento 
en esa ciudad, en donde se trata de esclarecer las violaciones a los derechos humanos ocurridas 
en la &#250;ltima dictadura militar, bajo la jurisdicci&#243;n del 3&#186; Cuerpo del Ej&#233;rcito. Particularmente, la 
amenaza realizada el 11 de marzo de 2005 contra el Sr. Juan Mart&#237;n Fresneda, integrante de la 
agrupaci&#243;n H.I.J.O.S. y abogado querellante en las causas que tramita el Juzgado Federal N&#186; 3 de 
la ciudad de C&#243;rdoba, donde representa a familiares de desaparecidos por razones pol&#237;ticas de la 
&#250;ltima dictadura militar. En dicha ocasi&#243;n tres personas se dirigieron al estudio jur&#237;dico del Sr. 
Fresneda y advirtieron a un vecino que colocar&#237;an una bomba all&#237; si el Sr. Fresneda segu&#237;a 
actuando en causas judiciales contra ex represores. El hecho ocurri&#243; al d&#237;a siguiente de la 
detenci&#243;n de Arnaldo Jos&#233; L&#243;pez acusado de grav&#237;simas violaciones a los derechos humanos. 
Fresneda es el abogado querellante en esas causas. A ra&#237;z de estas amenazas, se efectu&#243; una 
denuncia judicial pero la misma se encontrar&#237;a paralizada en la Fiscal&#237;a Federal N&#186; 2 de C&#243;rdoba. 
Las intimidaciones contra abogados y fiscales en la ciudad de C&#243;rdoba se intensificaron en el 
a&#241;o 2006. El 4 de junio de 2006 se envi&#243; un correo electr&#243;nico al periodista Mariano Saravia, de 
parte de un supuesto polic&#237;a en actividad, en el que se advert&#237;a que se estar&#237;a preparando un 
atentado mortal contra la vida del abogado Claudio Orosz (abogado de las organizaciones 
Familiares de Desaparecidos-Detenidos por Razones Pol&#237;ticas de Cordoba, e H.I.J.O.S. y 
querellante en las causas de violaciones a los Derechos Humanos). El mensaje indicaba una serie 
de detalles de personas, veh&#237;culos y domicilios, los cuales habr&#237;an sido constatados como veraces 
por el Fiscal Federal N&#186;1, Sr. Enrique Senestrari. El 26 de junio de 2006 se recibi&#243; una nueva 
amenaza contra el Sr. Orosz, esta vez en el contestador autom&#225;tico de su estudio jur&#237;dico, donde 
se le advierte: &#8220;te vamos a matar, los voy a matar&#8221;. Asimismo, el 18 de junio, en el correo 
electr&#243;nico del periodista Saravia se recibi&#243; otra intimidaci&#243;n, en este caso dirigida a la Fiscal 
del Juzgado Federal N&#186; 3, Dra. L&#243;pez de Filo&#241;uk, quien lleva adelante causas de derechos 
humanos en la provincia de C&#243;rdoba. Por su parte, desconocidos ingresaron al estudio del 
abogado Juan Carlos Vega, el 23 de junio, y sustrajeron una computadora port&#225;til con material 
relativo a la causa judicial &#8220;Mackentor&#8221;. Posteriormente, el 29 de junio, la abogada de la 
asociaci&#243;n Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo C&#243;rdoba, Dra. Mar&#237;a Teresa S&#225;nchez, recibi&#243; una nota en 
su estudio jur&#237;dico en la que se advert&#237;a que har&#237;an volar su auto cuando ella se encontrara 
manejando. Su socia, la Dra. Mariana Paramio, fue golpeada y amenazada por un individuo que 
entr&#243; y destruy&#243; el estudio de ambas. Todos estos actos intimidatorios fueron denunciados en la 
Fiscal&#237;a Federal N&#186; 1 de C&#243;rdoba. En la ciudad de Mar del Plata, el Dr. C&#233;sar Sivo, abogado de 
las causas penales y de los Juicios por la verdad que se est&#225;n desarrollando en Tandil, Las Flores, 
Azul, Olavaria y Mar del Plata, fue perseguido e intimidado en reiteradas oportunidades. 
Tambi&#233;n fueron interferidas sus llamadas telef&#243;nicas y recibi&#243; en su estudio visitas de personas 
que se presentan como clientes y luego le informan haber participado de la dictadura militar y le 
advierten que emplear&#225;n con &#233;l los mismos m&#233;todos. Asimismo, recibe a diario llamadas 
intimidatorios de todo tenor, que van desde las amenazas directas, el silencio prolongado y la 
reproducci&#243;n de marchas militares hasta la informaci&#243;n de cuestiones de su vida privada y la 
reproducci&#243;n de conversaciones sostenidas con otras personas. En muchas ocasiones, se </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>advierten veh&#237;culos no identificados en la puerta de su estudio o gente sacando fotos al estudio o 
al abogado. Tambi&#233;n se registraron ingresos forzados en su estudio jur&#237;dico. Otro tanto ocurre 
con personas allegadas al Sr. Sivo, a las que se ha llegado a ofrecer dinero y servicios 
profesionales para que inicien juicios contra el abogado o hablen en su contra. En la provincia de 
Tucum&#225;n, la Dra. Laura Figueroa, abogada del Colegio de Abogados de Tucum&#225;n y querellante 
en las causas de Familiares de Desaparecidos en la Justicia Federal de Tucum&#225;n, ha sufrido 
amenazas con anterioridad y posterioridad al caso Julio L&#243;pez, a consecuencia de su activa 
intervenci&#243;n en las causas vinculadas con la violaci&#243;n de derechos humanos durante la dictadura 
militar. El 20 de octubre del 2002, mientras se encontraba sola en su domicilio particular, ingres&#243; 
un comando armado que la redujo violentamente, revolvi&#243; todo, le hizo saber que sus 
conversaciones eran escuchadas, y le efectuaron amenazas de muerte si continuaba con las 
causas. En el mismo mes ingresaron nuevamente a su domicilio particular, mientras ella no se 
encontraba, rompiendo y revolviendo toda la casa. Durante el mismo a&#241;o 2002, tambi&#233;n  
sufrieron actos de persecuci&#243;n una de las auxiliares del GIAAT (Grupo Interdisciplinario de 
Arqueolog&#237;a y Antropolog&#237;a de Tucum&#225;n) y el Fiscal de la Causa del Pozo de Vargas. Se 
presume que estas amenazas, ataques y persecuciones estuvieron vinculadas a la profundizaci&#243;n 
en la investigaci&#243;n de la causa judicial del &#8220;Pozo de Vargas&#8221; en el a&#241;o 2002. Desde el a&#241;o 2003 
la Dra. Laura Figueroa tiene una guardia permanente en su domicilio particular. En Enero del 
2006, dejaron una amenaza en el contestador telef&#243;nico de su estudio jur&#237;dico. La investigaci&#243;n 
de esta amenaza est&#225; en curso. En Octubre del 2006, recibi&#243; un nuevo mensaje en el contestador 
telef&#243;nico que dec&#237;a &#8220;ya no te llamaremos m&#225;s&#8221;. Por su parte, el Fiscal Federal N&#186; 1 de 
Tucum&#225;n, Dr. Emilio E. Ferrer, interviniente en causas por violaciones a los derechos humanos, 
recibi&#243; amenazas an&#243;nimas por carta en la que se le advierte que ser&#225; juzgado por un tribunal 
particularmente imparcial y que volver&#225;n a comunicarse con &#233;l. La Dra. Ana Mar&#237;a Figueroa, 
abogada defensora de los derechos humanos, miembro de la Asamblea Permanente por los 
Derechos Humanos y actual Directora General de Jur&#237;dicos de la Secretar&#237;a de Derechos 
Humanos de la Naci&#243;n recibi&#243; amenazas contra su vida y la de sus hijos. El Dr. Ciro 
Annicchiarico, abogado y miembro de la Comisi&#243;n de Pol&#237;tica Criminal de la Asociaci&#243;n de 
Abogados de Buenos Aires fue amenazado y su esposa, Nora Cervi&#241;o, fue atacada y golpeada 
por un sujeto que le dijo &#8220;esto es para Ciro&#8221;. Asimismo, en dos oportunidades aparecieron 
inscripciones intimidatorias dentro de su domicilio. Tambi&#233;n los miembros de la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos de la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados de Buenos Aires, Sr. Manuel Justo Gaggero y 
Sra. Liliana Beli, recibieron llamados y mensajes en sus contestadores telef&#243;nicos en los que se 
escuchaban marchas militares que sol&#237;an difundirse con frecuencia durante la dictadura militar. 
El Fiscal Federal del Chaco, Dr. Jorge Auat, quien interviene en varias causas por violaciones a 
los derechos humanos durante la &#250;ltima dictadura militar, entre ellas la investigaci&#243;n de la causa 
Margarita Bel&#233;n, recibi&#243; una carta amenazante en su oficina por su actuaci&#243;n en la investigaci&#243;n 
de cr&#237;menes de lesa humanidad. En la provincia de Neuqu&#233;n, el abogado del Centro de 
Profesionales por los Derechos Humanos (CEPRODH), Dr. Leopoldo Denaday, fue detenido sin 
causa por efectivos de la polic&#237;a neuquina cuando participaba pac&#237;ficamente de un evento 
cultural. Fue llevado a la Comisar&#237;a 1&#186; y mantenido en un calabozo durante varias horas en las 
que a sus abogados se les impidi&#243; acceder a informaci&#243;n alguna sobre su situaci&#243;n. El juez 
Marcos Quinteros y el Fiscal Neri Roberto L&#243;pez de la provincia de Formosa, recibieron cartas 
intimidatorias tras la desaparici&#243;n del testigo Jorge Julio L&#243;pez. En la provincia de San Luis, el 
defensor de derechos humanos y representante de v&#237;ctimas de la dictadura, Dr. Enrique Ponce, 
recibi&#243; un mensaje telef&#243;nico intimidatorio El Relator Especial y la Representante Especial 
temen que las sucesivas amenazas e intimidaciones de diversa &#237;ndole dirigidas contra jueces, </p>

<p>fiscales y abogados en diferentes regiones del pa&#237;s est&#233;n directamente vinculadas al ejercicio de

<p><b>Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b></p>
<p>20. El 8 de Agosto de 2007, el Gobierno de Argentina envi&#243; una respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n 
enviada el 7 de Julio de 2006. Por esta raz&#243;n el Relator la incluye en este informe, a pesar de que 
la comunicaci&#243;n no est&#225; comprendida en el periodo que cubre el mismo. De acuerdo con la 
respuesta del Gobierno, en lo que se refiere a la decisi&#243;n de admisibilidad del juicio pol&#237;tico en 
contra de la magistrada Catella, adelantado por el gobierno provincial, no fue declarado en 
sesi&#243;n reservada y se llev&#243; a cabo conforme a la Constituci&#243;n. Respecto a la notificaci&#243;n del 
pedido de juicio pol&#237;tico a la interesada, el Gobierno explic&#243; que ella no pod&#237;a ser notificada 
antes de que la Sala Acusadora realizara una acusaci&#243;n formal, por as&#237; disponerlo la Ley 120 y la 
Constituci&#243;n Provincial. La magistrada Catella no demand&#243; por inconstitucionalidad las 
mencionadas normas. En cuanto al traslado del dictamen acusatorio y dem&#225;s actuaciones 
relativas al juicio pol&#237;tico, el Gobierno indic&#243; que de acuerdo a la ley, si se decide formalizar la 
acusaci&#243;n, se corre traslado al denunciado con todas las pruebas correspondientes, para que 
ejerza su derecho a la defensa. Respecto a la posibilidad de la denunciada de conocer la identidad 
de las personas que intervinieron en el procedimiento de destituci&#243;n, el Gobierno indica que se 
trataba de actuaciones conocidas por todas las personas, con mayor raz&#243;n de un magistrado del 
tribunal Superior, como lo era la magistrada Catella. Sin embargo, en cuanto la Dra. Catella 
solicit&#243; la n&#243;mina para plantear una recusaci&#243;n, dicho pedido fue rechazado por unanimidad 
puesto que lo hizo de forma extempor&#225;nea, es decir, antes de tener la posibilidad de participar 
como parte en el proceso, antes de la acusaci&#243;n formal. Respecto a la alegaci&#243;n seg&#250;n la cual, la 
magistrada Catella no habr&#237;a tenido acceso a copias de varias de las actuaciones adelantadas en 
el juicio pol&#237;tico en su contra, el Gobierno indica que efectivamente se le neg&#243; dicha solicitud, 
puesto que lo hizo, un vez m&#225;s, antes de ser parte en el proceso. Sobre la pregunta del Relator 
relativa a la supuesta falta de notificaci&#243;n de la sesi&#243;n de la Sala Acusadora, el Gobierno afirma 
que la magistrada Catella tuvo conocimiento de la misma y adem&#225;s goz&#243; de todas las 
oportunidades para ejercer su derecho a la defensa. Sobre la preocupaci&#243;n relacionada con la 
existencia de alguna investigaci&#243;n respecto de las supuestas irregularidades en que se incurri&#243; 
durante el juicio pol&#237;tico en contra de la jueza Catella, el Gobierno informa que no se advierte 
ninguna trasgresi&#243;n a ninguna norma en el tr&#225;mite del juicio en menci&#243;n, en consecuencia no 
habr&#237;a raz&#243;n para iniciar ninguna investigaci&#243;n. En lo que se refiere al recurso de nulidad 
emitido dentro del proceso por prevaricato en contra del la magistrada Catella, el Gobierno 
indica que el mismo mejor&#243; la situaci&#243;n procesal de la misma. Sin embargo, deja claro que dicho 
recurso no sanea el accionar contrario a la ley en que pudieran haber incurrido los magistrados 
investigados. El Gobierno aclara que la acusaci&#243;n de delito de prevaricato en contra de la 
magistrada Catella efectivamente es por no haber declarado la falsedad del Acta 08/05 y la 
Resoluci&#243;n 07/05 del Consejo Deliberativo de San Vicente, en su voto de la resoluci&#243;n 492/05. 
Sin embargo, el Gobierno agrega que la decisi&#243;n de prevaricato tambi&#233;n es por haber incurrido 
en contumacia, puesto que cambi&#243; su voto de manera totalmente contraria a lo inicialmente 
expresado, sin que se hubiera alterado en nada la cuesti&#243;n en debate y las pruebas. En cuanto a 
las causas de pedido de enjuiciamiento en contra de Horacio Alarc&#243;n, Juez Penal de la provincia 
de Misiones y Lloyd Jorge Wicstr&#246;m, Fiscal de Estado en la misma provincia, el Gobierno 
indic&#243; que respecto del primero se le acusa de haber cometido varias irregularidades en el </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>proceso de la muerte de Mar&#237;a Elena B&#225;rbaro (en el cual uno de los imputados es Mat&#237;as Ortiz, 
hijo de la Diputada Provincial Marlene Carballo) a su cargo, entre ellas, la detenci&#243;n del Sr. 
Ortiz, puesto que la orden&#243; sin determinaci&#243;n de los indicios o causas que lo llevaron a tomar la 
decisi&#243;n. Asimismo, se le acusa de avalar la actuaci&#243;n irregular de un sub-comisario, de falta de 
investigaci&#243;n de una posible alteraci&#243;n de la escena del crimen, a pesar de estar al tanto de que 
personas ajenas a la administraci&#243;n de justicia tuvieron acceso a la misma y habr&#237;an podido 
modificar las pruebas. Tambi&#233;n se le acusa de haberse negado a recibir testimonios cruciales 
para el proceso en cuesti&#243;n, de haber dado un trato desigual a las partes del proceso, ya que 
mostr&#243; una preferencia evidente respecto de una de las partes. En resumen, para el Gobierno, el 
juez Alarc&#243;n no inici&#243; ninguna investigaci&#243;n de varios delitos que estaban en su conocimiento, 
con lo cual incumpli&#243; sus obligaciones y deberes como funcionario de la administraci&#243;n de 
justicia. En lo que respecta al juicio que enfrenta Lloyd Jorge Wicstr&#246;m, Fiscal de Estado en la 
misma provincia, el Gobierno indica que se le acusa de incumplimiento de funciones a su cargo 
y comisi&#243;n de delitos en el ejercicio de sus funciones. Entre las acusaciones que se le formulan 
est&#225; la emisi&#243;n de dict&#225;menes t&#233;cnico legales contradictorios sobre una misma causa sin 
fundamento jur&#237;dico, incumplir las instrucciones del Ejecutivo en el sentido de interponer 
recurso judicial, la habilitaci&#243;n al poder ejecutivo para que contrajere un empr&#233;stito contrario a la 
Constituci&#243;n Provincial, puesto que dobl&#243; el costo inicialmente estipulado, inejecuci&#243;n de fallos 
del Tribunal de Cuentas, omisi&#243;n de investigaciones relacionadas con denuncias sobre 
detrimento al patrimonio de la Provincia. Finalmente, en cuanto a la motivaci&#243;n de la derogaci&#243;n 
de la Ley 3964 que dispon&#237;a la reducci&#243;n de nueve a cinco miembros del Superior Tribunal de 
Justicia, el Gobierno afirma que de acuerdo con la exposici&#243;n de motivos del Proyecto de Ley 
que dio lugar a la derogaci&#243;n de la ley en cuesti&#243;n se expres&#243; que la misma era una de las 
normas centrales en el armado de ingobernabilidad que traz&#243; el poder legislativo al ejecutivo en 
la provincia. Existiendo una vacante en el Superior Tribunal de Justicia para cubrir, despu&#233;s que 
se enviaran los pliegos para su nombramiento, se reform&#243; el n&#250;mero de magistrados de 9 a 5, 
aleg&#225;ndose razones de econom&#237;a en el servicio de administraci&#243;n de justicia. No solo no se 
cumple la finalidad dispuesta por la norma, pues el poder judicial multiplic&#243; por 5 su 
presupuesto, sino que ella ha redundado en perjuicio de la justicia, porque se priv&#243; al tribunal 
superior de un magistrado. No ha sido beneficioso para la comunidad la reducci&#243;n operada y 
debido a la cantidad de causas judiciales es m&#225;s beneficioso que el tribunal superior de misiones 
cuente con 9 y no con los 5 establecidos por la ley 3964. 
</p>
<p>21. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 4 de Julio de 2007, el Gobierno proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n 
con respecto al llamamiento urgente enviado el 18 de abril de 2007. El Gobierno indic&#243; lo 
siguiente: 1. El Sr. Subsecretario de Justicia de la Provincia, Dr. Gustavo Casti&#241;eira de Dios, se 
comunic&#243; personalmente con el Dr. Pablo Salinas poni&#233;ndose a su disposici&#243;n y ofreci&#233;ndole las 
medidas protectoras que creyera convenientes. Se le propuso protecci&#243;n policial provincial y se 
le indic&#243; la posibilidad de requerir el auxilio de protecci&#243;n de la polic&#237;a federal si lo estimara 
pertinente. Ante la negativa del Dr. Salinas al respecto, se le comunicaron los tel&#233;fonos celulares 
de las m&#225;ximas autoridades provinciales en materia de seguridad y se le solicit&#243; que tanto &#233;l 
como su familia informaran cualquier movimiento sospechoso que entendieran que podr&#237;a 
implicar peligro potencial o real. A pesar del ofrecimiento de colaboraci&#243;n del gobierno 
provincial, el Dr. Salinas no ha puesto en conocimiento del mismo, la existencia de nuevas 
amenazas telef&#243;nicas o intimidaciones. Sin perjuicio de ello, las medidas protectoras aludidas o 
cualquier otra que se considera conveniente, se encuentran a disposici&#243;n del Dr. Salinas. </p>

<p>22. El Relator especial agradece al Gobierno de Argentina su grata cooperaci&#243;n y el env&#237;o en 
un plazo razonable de informaciones sustantivas respecto del llamamiento urgente enviado el 18 
de abril de 2007 relacionado con la situaci&#243;n del Dr. Pablo Gabriel Salinas, en su car&#225;cter de

objeto de una previa comunicaci&#243;n al Gobierno, del 24 de enero de 2006 y que este Relator hab&#237;a 
consignado como pendiente en el Informe anterior. Se ped&#237;a entonces aclaraci&#243;n sobre 
investigaciones y juicios iniciados en contra de magistrados de la provincia de Misiones y con 
relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n general de la independencia del Poder Judicial en dicha provincia. 
El Relator Especial espera que se logre una soluci&#243;n adecuada y que se le comunique. 
</p>
<p>23. Por otra parte, el Relator Especial manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n por la ausencia de respuesta 
oficial a la carta de alegaci&#243;n enviada el 3 de mayo de 2007 en la que se requer&#237;a la atenci&#243;n 
urgente del Gobierno argentino con respecto al aumento de actos de hostigamiento y amenazas 
en contra de jueces, fiscales y abogados vinculados a la defensa de los derechos humanos, en 
especial aquellos que han participado en procesos judiciales contra integrantes de la dictadura 
militar por delitos de lesa humanidad. Se urge, por lo tanto, al Gobierno de Argentina para que 
env&#237;e lo m&#225;s pronto posible, preferentemente antes de la finalizaci&#243;n de la novena sesi&#243;n del 
Consejo de Derechos Humanos, una respuesta sustantiva a la carta de alegaci&#243;n mencionada.

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>24. On 7 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, concerning Mr. Ali 
Jaffar Ali, 17 years of age, Mr. Jassim Mirza, 17 years of age, and his brother Mr. Mohammad 
Mirza, 16 years of age, who were arrested after participating in a demonstration regarding 
Mr. Hassan Mushiama, Secretary-General of an organisation calling itself &#8220;Movement of 
Freedoms and Democracy - HAQ&#8221;, and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja, President of an 
organisation called &#8220;Bahrain Center for Human Rights&#8221;. According to information received, 
Mr. Ali Jaffar Ali was arrested on 25 February 2007 after security forces had searched the home 
of his father in Sanabis for several times during his absence. On the same day he was formally 
ordered into custody for 15 days by the Public Prosecutor and charged after participating in a 
peaceful demonstration pursuant to article 178 of the Penal Code of 1976, which provides that 
anyone &#8220;shall be punished by a term of up to two years and a fine not exceeding two hundred 
Dinars, or both, who participated in a gathering in a public place consisting of at least five 
persons, the purpose of which is to commit crimes, or acts equipping or facilitating it, or to 
disturb public security, even if that was to fulfill a legitimate objective.&#8221; Mr. Ali Jaffar Ali is 
currently being detained at Khamees police station detention center. Mr. Jassim Mirza and 
Mr. Mohammad Mirza were arrested on 3 February 2007 at their homes in Sanabis by heavily 
armed Special Forces and have been detained at an unknown place of detention without having </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>access to lawyers or members of their family since then. The arrests were made following their 
participation in a peaceful protest on 2 February 2007 against the arrests of Mr. Hassan 
Mushiama and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja. 
<b>Communications received  
</b></p>
<p>None. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Bahrain to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of 
the 9th session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegations. The Special Rapporteur also urges the authorities to give the above mentioned 
detainees regular access to their families and lawyers and to provide information about the 
whereabouts of Mr. Jassim Mirza and Mr. Mohammad Mirza. Bearing in mind that the detainees 
should be bgought before a court in due time, he would also like to know if the respective trials 
have started.

<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>26. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the lack 
of independence of the judiciary, alleged political control of the prosecution and obstacles to the 
prosecution of crimes by public officials. According to the information received, despite the fact 
that section 22 of the Constitution provides that the State shall ensure the separation of the 
judiciary from the executive branch of the State, it is reported that the judiciary in Bangladesh is 
subject to interferences from the executive branch. Judges of subordinate courts and tribunals, 
who deal with the bulk of the cases in the judiciary in Bangladesh, both civil and criminal, are 
answerable to government ministries. In particular, the Courts of Metropolitan Sessions judges 
and the Courts of Metropolitan Magistrates, both criminal courts, are administratively attached to 
the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Home Affairs respectively. Furthermore, all magistrates 
throughout the country and in the four metropolitan cities, where they work in Chief 
Metropolitan Magistrate&#8217;s Courts, are allegedly answerable to the local district deputy 
commissioner. It has been reported that those judges discharge dual functions, judicial and 
executive ones, being also responsible for duties under a range of ministries, including home 
affairs, finance, establishment and law, justice and parliamentary affairs. They are allegedly 
appointed from the administrative services by the public service commission. The Ministry of 
Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs oversees the recruitment, posting and promotion of 
judges. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern that the lack of independence of the 
judiciary in Bangladesh stems from some constitutional provisions. Indeed, articles 95, 96, 115, 
and 116 enable the interference of the executive in the appointment and tenure of judges. 
Article 96 provides that the President man, by order, remove a Judge from office. Article 115 
provides that appointments of persons to offices in the judicial service or as magistrates 
exercising judicial functions shall be made by the President in accordance with rules made by 
him in that behalf. Finally, according to article 116, the control, including the power of posting, 
promotion and grant of leave and discipline of persons employed in the judicial service and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>magistrates exercising judicial functions shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised 
by him in consultation with the Supreme Court. Notably, he expressed concern by the reported 
appointment of a large number of judges without effective consultation of the Chief Justice, and 
by the appointment of 19 judges to the High Court Division of the Supreme Court only three 
days before the Annual Vacation in August 2005. It is alleged that the 19 judges were appointed 
without properly assessing the qualifications, experience and suitability of the candidates. It has 
been reported that some of the appointees lack seniority and the necessary experience. It was 
informed that since 1991, the major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party 
(BNP), promised in public meetings that they would separate the judiciary from the executive. 
This was even included in the BNP&#8217;s electoral programme. The separation of the judiciary was 
one of the most prioritized election pledges made by the BNP-led four-party alliance during the 
last general election, held in 2001. However, after winning the election and despite having a two 
thirds majority in the Parliament, which enables a political party to make amendments to the 
Constitution, the BNP did not proceed to the separation of the judiciary from the executive. 
I also wish to recall that the separation of the judiciary from the executive is spelled out in 
Point XVII of the Human rights pledges made by the Government of Bangladesh to the 
United Nations in 13 April 2006 in support of its candidature for membership in the 
Human Rights Council. In a judgement given by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court 
on 2 December 1999, in the case of the State versus Mr. Mazdar Hossain, the Supreme Court 
gave a 12 point order to the Government asking it to separate the judiciary, and to establish a 
judicial service commission to appoint judges and deal with promotions, transfers, leave, 
pensions, etc. It has been reported that the Government requested extension of time for the 
implementation of the decision and that the Supreme Court allegedly accepted at least 23 
extensions of time to delay the enforcement of this separation. However, according to 
information received, on 5 January 2006, the Supreme Court rejected a further request for time 
extension and called for the separation of the judiciary to be implemented. A contempt of court 
case has been opened against the Government over its failure to implement the 1999 order. 
Nevertheless, it has been reported that the Government has not implemented the decision up to 
now. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur calls the Government&#8217;s attention to allegations of 
political control over the prosecution. Prosecuting attorneys are reportedly replaced every time 
that a new Government comes to power. As a result, they lack independence. In addition, they do 
not accumulate experience or build institutional legacy. Furthermore, the prosecuting and 
investigating branches are not linked. If the police decide not to investigate a crime, the 
prosecutor has no obligation to do so. Finally, the Special Rapporteur drawn the Government&#8217;s 
attention on reported obstacles faced by victims and their family members when attempting to 
bring cases to the courts. In particular, the Special rapporteur expressed his deep concern by 
some provisions of the Constitution and of the code of criminal procedure which violate the right 
to access to a judicial remedy. Section 46 of the Constitution of Bangladesh empowers the 
government to extend immunity from prosecution to any state officer on extremely broad 
grounds : &#8220;Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this part, Parliament may by 
law make provision for indemnifying any person in the service of the Republic or any other 
person in respect of any act done by him in connection with the national liberation struggle or the 
maintenance and restoration of order in any area in Bangladesh or validate any sentence passed, 
punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered, or other act done in any such area to make the 
above-mentioned law.&#8221; Notably, it has been reported that Joint Drive Indemnity Ordinance 2003 
removed from the hands of victims and their family to take legal action against soldiers, 
police and other security forces responsible for the gross abuses that repeatedly occurred </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>from 16 October 2002 to 9 January 2003, under Operation Clean Heart. Aside from the passing 
of special laws under section 46, there are barriers built into ordinary criminal procedure that 
prevent people from making a complaint against an official, especially, sections 132 and 197 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898. Under section b 132, no criminal complaint can be lodged 
against any official without prior sanction from the Government. Furthermore, an accused person 
who is found to have been acting in good faith or on orders from a superior shall never be 
charged, and their actions shall never be considered a crime. I also note with great concern that 
the Judicial Probe Commission in charge of investigating the police response to the protest over 
rural electricity supply, in Chapainawabgani in February 2006, did not prosecute any 
perpetrators despite alleged cases of torture.  
</p>
<p>27. On 16 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding 
Mrs. Anita Rani Mondol (born 11 November 1989), wife of Mr. Jamini Mandol, from Khaliar 
Chak village, under the Paikgachha police station in Khulna district. According to information 
received, on 23 July 2006, Mr. Panchanan Mondol, member of a rich and influential family and 
reportedly not related to the victim, allegedly raped Mrs. Anita Rani Mondol when she was alone 
at home. Upon hearing her crying for help, her neighbours and her husband, who arrived home 
by then, apprehended Mr. Panchanan Mondol. Soon after, Panchanan Mondol&#8217;s brother, 
Mr. Krishnapado Mondol, the son, Mr. Bipul Mondol, and two relatives, Mr. Shivpado Mondol 
and Mr. Bhola Nath Mondol, allegedly arrived on the scene, physically assaulted the victim and 
her family, including her husband, and took Panchanan Mondol away thereby preventing him 
from being handed over to the police. The Investigation Officer of the rape case, Sub Inspector 
Mr. Mohsin Uddin, submitted the Charge Sheet No. 141 to the Paikgachha Magistrate&#8217;s 
Cognizance Court under section 9 (1) of the Women and Child Repression Prevention Act-2003. 
However, in his investigation report, Mr. Mohsin Uddin submitted the charge only against the 
alleged perpetrator, Mr. Panchanan Mondol. The assault charges against the other four alleged 
perpetrators of the assault have been dropped even though the report mentions that while 
Mr. Panchanan Mondol was raping the victim, he was apprehended by her family. Later, 
Mr. Panchanan Mondol&#8217;s brothers and nephews came to the house, assaulted the victim&#8217;s family 
members and took Mr. Panchanan Mondol away. The Superintendent of Police of Khulna 
district, Mr. Moynul Islam supervised the case in person by visiting the scene and, having 
interviewed the eyewitnesses, officially forwarded the police investigation report to the court, 
but failed to identify the involvement of the fellow perpetrators. The case has now been 
forwarded to the Women and Child repression Special Tribunal of Khulna for trial. As of 
6 December 2006, the perpetrators allegedly complicit in the incident have not been arrested or 
charged. It is alleged that the police officers who dropped the assault charges against the four 
accomplices might have been bribed. The victim, her family and the case witnesses are subjected 
to threats. Mr. Panchanan Mondol is allegedly pressuring the victim to withdraw the case by 
threatening to use his wealth and influence to bribe the police and ensure that they submit a false 
&#8220;Final report&#8221;. It is also alleged that Mr. Panchanan Mondol allegedly also threatens key 
witnesses trying to cause them to make false affidavits in his favour.  
</p>
<p>28. On 20 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture, on the situation of Mr. Nazmul Huda, Bar-at-Law and former Minister 
of Communications and several other individuals. According to information received, during the 
night of 3 to 4 February 2007, Mr. Huda was detained under Section 3 of the Special Powers </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>Act 1974 for a period of 30 days, which is likely to be extended. Four trucks carrying armed 
personnel entered the road where Mr. Huda lives and blocked all exits of the road. The armed 
personnel entered the family&#8217;s premises and apprehended Mr. Huda. Thereafter the premises 
were searched. The order of detention &#8220;for anti-state activities&#8221; was issued by a magistrate 
36 hours after the arrest of Mr. Huda. The detention order was delivered to the police authorities 
the next morning. Mr. Huda&#8217;s family was informed that Mr. Huda was being taken to the 
Cantonment Police Station, Dhaka. The family met him there. It has been reported that other 
individuals who have been arrested under the same detention order on the basis of Section 3 of 
the Special Powers Act 1974, have not had access to counsel, that they have been beaten, and 
needles have been pushed under their fingernails and into private parts. Moreover, detainees 
have reportedly been deprived of sleep. Mr. Huda has been subjected to deprivation of sleep for 
two nights and days. Mr. Huda&#8217;s wife, who is a lawyer, has applied several times to visit her 
husband in jail. On 12 February 2007, Mrs. Huda was granted permission to visit Mr. Huda 
briefly in her capacity as his wife. However, Mr. Huda has not yet had access to counsel. 
Mr. Huda&#8217;s wife filed an application of habeas corpus under section 491 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code on behalf of her husband with the High Court on 7 February 2007. Mrs. Huda 
did not file a writ since parts of the Constitution of Bangladesh concerning fundamental rights 
are currently suspended under the emergency provisions. The Lordships of the High Court issued 
a rule noting that an order will be issued within 10 days.  
</p>
<p>29. On 20 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding the situation of Mr. Aminul Islam and Mr. Abdul Kashem Palash Director and 
Chairperson of the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB). According to 
information received: on 12 January 2007, early in the morning, Mr. Palash and Mr. Islam were 
arrested from their respective homes in Dhaka city, by members of the Rapid Action Battalion 
(RAB). The RAB failed to produce a warrant for either arrest. The arrests were carried out the 
day after a state of emergency was declared. According to reports, Mr. Palash was detained at 
Mohammadpur police station until 4.30 p.m. whilst Mr. Islam was held in custody at the RAB 
headquarters in Moghbazar. At 8:30 p.m. that evening both men were transferred to Dhaka 
Central Prison, where they were issued with a 30 day preventive detention under Section 3 (1) of 
the Special Powers Act-1974 for &#8220;prejudicial acts&#8221;. On 20 January 2007, Mr. Palash and 
Mr. Islam received a document from the Home Ministry which outlined the reasons for their 
arrests under Section 8 of the Special Powers Act-1974. Under the Act they were considered as 
posing a threat to State Security. On 5 February 2007, in an order signed by the Senior Assistant 
Secretary of the Home Ministry&#8217;s Security Cell-3, Mr. Palash and Mr. Islam had their sentence 
extended by a further 30 days. On 26 February 2007 the High Court Bench of the Supreme Court 
ordered the immediate release of Mr. Palash and Mr. Islam claiming that their detention was 
unlawful. However on 28 February, following an application by the Government, the Appellate 
Division passed an order staying the High Court judgement. On 12 March 2007 the order of stay 
was extended until 29 March with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court having granted 
the Government of Bangladesh leave to appeal and requested that an appeal be prepared by 
3 May 2007. Mr. Palash and Mr. Islam are due to have their cases reviewed by the Advisory 
Board, comprising of two sitting High Court judges and a Government official, on 
19 April 2007. This process of review by the Board was carried out pursuant to Section 10 of the 
Special Powers Act 1974. Mr. Palash and Mr. Islam are currently being detained at Dhaka 
Central Prison, and both men are being denied access to legal representation. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>30. On 28 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
Mrs. Sigma Huda, lawyer and United Nations Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children. According to the information received, Mrs. Sigma Huda has 
been accused of corruption and has been summoned to appear before a court on 25 June. In view 
of her deteriorating health conditions, the court granted her six additional days. Ms. Huda, 
currently hospitalized, is now due to appear on 1 July 2007. Whilst not wishing to prejudge the 
outcome of the judicial procedure, based on the information received it is feared that Mrs. Huda 
will not be granted a fair trial. It is reported that a special court has been specifically set up to 
rule on corruption charges. This special court, which lies within the compound of the Parliament, 
would function as a closed court, where neither the public nor the media are allowed in. Also, as 
a consequence of the high number of militaries present in the court, the atmosphere would be 
particularly intimidating. It is also reported that judges and prosecutors in charge of this trial 
have been intimidated: they indicated that they cannot rule in an independent manner and that 
their hands are tied. Moreover, it is reported the Mrs. Huda&#8217;s lawyers have not had access to the 
files related to her case. Moreover, it is reported that the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption 
Commission, in a visit to different parts of the country, has addressed the lawyers of each district 
and asked them not to defend those accused by the current regime. Also, it is reported that the 
Chief of the Army has invited all lawyers of the Supreme Court to a gathering in which he told 
them not to take on cases of a list of accused among which Mrs. Huda is included. All lawyers 
would have been approached and requested to represent the Government side. As a consequence, 
the two lawyers hired by Mrs. Huda have withdrawn from the case explaining that they had 
received threats. Consequently, it is reported that Mrs. Huda faces difficulties finding a lawyer 
who would represent her.  
</p>
<p>31. On 11 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, on the arrest and detention of Mr. Milton Chakma, Assistant Coordinator of the Hill 
Watch Human Rights Forum and member of the United Peoples Democratic Front, an 
organization representing the Jumma people of the Chittagong Hill Tracks. According to 
information received, on 29 May 2007, at around 11.30 a.m., Mr. Milton Chakma and his wife, 
Ms. Sumana Chakma were waiting for a bus near Chengi Bridge, one kilometre west of 
Khagrachari bazaar, on their way to Chittagong for Ms. Chakma&#8217;s medical treatment. At the bus 
station, a Bangladesh army lorry reportedly came near them, and one of the army personnel 
asked Mr. Milton to identify himself. When Mr. Chakma told his name, the lorry went towards 
the direction of Khagrachari town. The lorry returned after a few minutes, and the military 
personnel arrested Mr. Chakma and took him away. No reason for his arrest was allegedly given 
at that time. In the afternoon of the same day, Mr. Chakma&#8217;s relatives proceeded to Khagrachari 
zone army headquarters to seek information on his whereabouts. The army personnel allegedly 
refused to provide information on the grounds that their offices were closed at 2.00 p.m. When 
Mr. Chakma&#8217;s relatives returned again to the headquarters the next day, the zone commander 
told them that Mr. Chakma was picked up by army personnel from Mahalchari zone. However, 
they went to Mahalchari zone army headquarters, the army officials denied having arrested 
Mr. Chakma. On 31 May 2006, Mr. Chakma was produced before the Court in Rangamati. The 
Court reportedly granted a 7-day police remand for interrogation on 6 June 2007. On 
12 June 2007, he was reportedly transferred secretly in an army vehicle to the Rangamati jail, 
allegedly with the intention to prevent his lawyer from appealing for bail. On that date, the Court </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>of Rangmati granted an additional remand for 4 days. Since the end of this remand, Mr. Chakma 
has been reportedly held in judicial custody at Rangamati jail and, to date, has not been 
produced before the Court. According to information subsequently received, Mr. Chakma was 
arrested on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR) filed by Md. Shadihul Islam, Sergeant 
(No. 3998686) of 24 Bengal Regiment. In this report, Mr. Chakma has been charged in relation 
to the alleged murder of an army officer in Ghilachari, Rangamati district, in December 2006 
(Case No. GR 304/06). The officials records reportedly show that this case was originally filled 
on 27 December 2006 under Sections 302-304 of the Bangladesh Penal Code. However, in the 
original FIR Mr. Milton Chakma was not reportedly included. It is alleged that the assassination 
charges brought against Mr. Chakma are manifestly unfounded, and that they may be related to 
his peaceful work in defense of the rights of the Jumma people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.  
</p>
<p>32. On 7 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders regarding Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash, journalist with CSB 
News Bangladesh and human rights defender. According to the new information received, in the 
night of 23 October 2007, at around 1.30 a.m., a group of 10 -12 Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) 
agents in plain clothes went to the house of Mr. Alam Akash in Rajsh. Reportedly, his wife did 
not let them in until they told her who they were; she asked for a search warrant but they refused 
to present one. Reportedly, the agents disclosed their identity and said that a reliable source had 
told them that there were some arms hidden in the house and alleged they had a search warrant 
issued by the concerned court. The RAB agents grabbed Mr. Alam Akash and began slapping 
him hard in the face. Then, they put him in handcuffs, wrapped a black cloth around this head 
and took him away. He was reportedly taken to a nearby army camp where he was severely 
beaten. It has been reported that he has suffered severe physical injuries and is unable to walk, 
having been moved to the Rajshahi hospital. Mr. Alam Akash remains detained on extortion 
charges and has not yet appeared in court. Prior to these attacks, Mr. Alam Akash had been 
broadcasting and publishing news on alleged abuses of power by the RAB. In particular, on 
2 May 2007 Mr. Alam Akash presented a report on an attempted extrajudicial execution by RAB 
agents that had allegedly taken place in Rajshahi. He has also received numerous death threats 
due to his work and has suffered physical assaults in the past after publishing critical articles 
regarding local politicians. Concern expressed that the alleged ill-treatment and detention of 
Mr. Alam Akash may be directly related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights.

<p>33. On 23 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR  
EXPRESSES CONCERN ON SIGMA HUDA&#8217;S TRIAL 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers wishes to express his 
concern concerning the proceedings of the trial of Ms. Sigma Huda, lawyer and Human 
Rights Council&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children. On 27 August 2007, the Special Anti Corruption Court of Bangladesh sentenced 
Ms. Huda to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment for aiding and abetting extortion found to have been 
committed by her husband. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur received information indicating that the right to legal 
representation and the independence of the court were severely affected during her trial. 
According to these reports, defense lawyers felt pressured. They had no opportunity to visit 
her in prison and could only meet with her at the end of the hearings. They also had 
difficulties accessing the case files and other relevant information, thus compromising their 
ability to ensure an adequate defence. The atmosphere during the trial was reportedly 
intimidating, with military and police presence both outside and inside the courtroom, and 
access of the public and the media to the courtroom was considerably restricted.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is concerned by these alleged irregularities which would amount to 
a violation of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified 
by Bangladesh. Against this background, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Bangladesh 
authorities to ensure the right of Ms. Sigma Huda to a fair and public trial during any 
ensuing appeal process.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 26 April 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter of 15 December 2006 
stating that in order to secure independence of judiciary and to protect human rights, the 
separation of the Judiciary from the Executive branch of the Governance is essential. It has been 
a long-standing demand from all stakeholders and international community. The last two elected 
Governments despite public commitment could not succeed in separating the judiciary from the 
executive. The directives of the Hon&#8217;ble Appellate Division, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, 
made in the historical judgement of Majdar Hossain&#8217;s Case remained unimplemented. The 
present interim Caretaker Government has taken a bold initiative in this direction and has made 
considerable progress in achieving the separation, which eluded the country for many years. 
After taking over the responsibility of the present Caretaker Government, Hon&#8217;ble President by 
promulgating Ordinance in February 11, 2007 brought about revolutionary change in the century 
old Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. Apart from this, the Caretaker Government on 
January 16, 2007 framed four rules namely (1) Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission 
Rules 207 (2) Bangladesh Judicial Service (Pay Commission) Rules 2007, (3) Bangladesh 
Judicial Service (Constitution, Appointment, Temporary Suspension, Suspension and Removal 
from service) Rules 2007 (4) Bangladesh Judicial Service (Place of Posting, Promotion, Leave, 
Control, Discipline and other Conditions of Service) Rules 2007. These Ordinance and rules 
have been promulgated with a view to separate the Judiciary from the Executive in an effective 
and efficient way. The Government has submitted the said Ordinance and those Rules before the 
Appellate Division, Supreme Court of the Bangladesh for necessary directives of the Hon&#8217;ble 
Court. In accordance with the provision of the aforesaid Ordinance and Rules, the Supreme 
Court will fix the date when the subordinate Judiciary will function independently being 
separated from the Executive. It has been the long practice in the country to appoint public 
prosecutors by the political Governments. Once the particular political Government changes, the 
prosecutors also lose their jobs. New Government appoints new prosecutors of their choice. So 
the system suffers from the Jack of continuity, commitment, skill, quality, efficiency and 
accountability on the part of most of the law officers. Often this results in the delay in legal 
process and the ineffective trial of offences. To remedy the situation, the Law Ministry has taken 
an initiative to create a separate and independent prosecution service. A draft Bill is now under 
consideration of the Government in this regard. There are some obstructions in prosecuting the 
criminals in the current legal system, which the country inherited and yet to make up to date. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>As for example Governmet officials cannot be prosecuted without prior sanction of the 
Government if the offences are committed in discharge of their official responsibility. The 
Government is very much aware of the shortcomings and pledge bound to improve the situation. 
In course of time, it will remove this sort of anomalies through reform of relevant laws. 
</p>
<p>35. On 25 May 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 16 January 2007, 
indicating that Mrs. Anita Rani Mondal wife of Mr. Zamini Mondal of village: Kahar Chak, 
Police Station: Paikgacha, District: Khulna lodged a First Information Report (F.I.R.) against 
Mr. Panchanan Mondal, son of late Jitendra Nath Mondal of the same village at Paikgacha Police 
Station under Section 9 (1) &#8220;Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 
(Amendment 2003)&#8221; on 25.7.2006. The Investigation Officer (I.O.) of the said criminal case 
submitted charge sheet (No. 141, dated 11.9.2006) against Mr. Panchanan Mondal under 
Section 8 (1) of the said Act in the concerned court. According to Medical Experts&#8217; opinion, 
there was no sign of forcible sexual intercourse with the victim Mrs. Anita Rani Mondal. On 
25 January 2007, Mrs. Mondal declared through an affidavit that she was not raped by 
Mr. Panchanan Mondal. In her affidavit she also mentioned that there were disputes between 
Mr. Panchanan Mondal and her husband on land property issues. Mrs. Mondal confirmed that 
she only had an altercation with Mr. Panchanan Mondal about the disputed property of her 
husband. The alleged rape incident is, therefore, categorically ruled out. The case against 
Mr. Panchanan Mondal is under trial in the Special Tribunal, Khulna. In the meantime, the 
alleged accused Mr. Panchanan Mondal has been granted bail by the Honourable High Court 
Division, Dhaka. The victim and the accused will receive fair judgement as guaranteed by the 
law of the land. 
</p>
<p>36. On 13 June 2007, the Government added in a separate communication the following 
declaration that was made under oath by Anita Rani Monda: I had submitted application 
No. 20812006 at the court under Women and Children, following case No. 15, dated 
25 July 2006, G.R. 124/2006 under Rule 9 (1) of Women and Children 2000 (amended in 2003). 
The application states that Mr. Panchanan Mondal, Son of late Jitendra Nath Mondal, Address: 
Khaliarchar, Thana: Paikgachha, District: Khulna, raped me in the evening of 23 July 2006. That 
is not true. No one raped me, and the incident of rape mentioned in the application is not correct. 
We had some property related disputes with Mr. Panchanan Mondal, a relative of my husband, 
and I had altercations with Mr. Panchanan Mondal on that issue on 23 July 2006. Later Mr. Abir 
Mondal, son of late Shanatan Mondal, came to my house in absence of my husband and advised 
me to keep the police station informed about the altercation. Then he took my thumb impression 
on a blank sheet of paper, and I did not have any ill motive. Later I came to know that an 
application had been submitted with my thumb impression on it stating that Mr. Panchanan 
Mondal had raped me. Actually Mr. Panchanan Mondal is not guilty. I did not have any 
complain against him earlier, and I do not have any even now. 
</p>
<p>37. On 24 July 2007, the Government replied to the urgent appeal of 28 June 2007 stating that 
on the basis of specific allegations the Anti-Corruption Commission, an independent statutory 
body, had filed formal complaints of corruption against Ms. Huda and her husband, 
Mr. Nazmul Huda, who was the former Minister of Communication. Ms. Huda is accused of 
aiding and abetting her husband in accepting bribes which investigation reveals were deposited 
in bank accounts controlled by her as signatory. Other allegations relate to misuse and abuse of 
power and extortion by her husband, Mr. Huda, to provide her with material benefits. There are 
several cases pending against her. The trial stage commences only when the court takes </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>cognizance of the offence and frames charges. The several other complaints and offences have 
been under investigation and the formal charge sheet has yet to be submitted in respect of these. 
The actual trial of one case has commenced: Special Case No. 02/07 arising out of Dhanmondi 
P.S. Case No. 70(93) 07 under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, read with 
Sections 161/109 of the Penal Code and Rule 15 of the Emergency Rules 2007. From the first 
information reports ledged with the Dhanmondi police Station (case No. 70, dated 21-03&#172;2007) 
against Mr. Nazmul Huda and his wife Ms. Sigma Huda, it appears that one Mr. Zahir Hossain, a 
construction contractor of Roads and Highways Department paid Mr. Nazmul Huda, the then 
Communications Minister, an amount of Tk. 2,40,00,000/- as bribe for gaining an illegal favour. 
This amount was discovered in the bank account of Ms. Sigma Huda. This is an offence of 
corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 [section 5(2)] under sections 26 and 27 
of the Anti Corruption Act of 2004 and under section 109 of Panal Code. Md. Wahidur Rahman 
(Azad), also a contractor of Roads and Highways Department filed a complaint to the Tejgaon 
Police Station of Dhaka (case No. 69 dated 26-6-2007 under section 385/109 of Penal Code) 
stating that Mr. Nazmul Huda, then Minister of Communications, forced him to build a 
conference room for the BSEHR (Bangladesh Society for Enforcement of Human Rights), of 
which Ms. Sigma Huda is the Chairperson. This cost him Taka 5,50,000/- which neither 
Mr. Huda, nor Ms. Huda paid to the contractor. Rather he was threatened by Mr. Huda that he 
would face problems in realization of other bills pending with Roads and Highways if he asked 
for the money he spent for construction of the conference room for the BSEHR. The same person 
ledged another complaint to the Shahbag Police Station, Dhaka (case No. 47 dated 26-6-2007 
under section 420/406/109 of Penal Code) stating that he had to build the boundary wall and a 
one-storied building of the BSEHR office of which Ms. Sigma Huda is the Chairperson. This 
cost him Tk. 41,26,000/- He was asked to claim only Tk. 21,90,000/- in his bill, which he 
complied. But he was not paid any amount for this purpose. Rather he was threatened when he 
asked for the money. Charges have been pressed by the Anti-Corruption Commission 
officials against Ms. Huda (along with her husband) for accepting illegal gratification.  
On 5 July 2007, the Special Tribunal Judge, Dhaka has framed charges against the accused 
Ms. Huda who appeared before the tribunal and has been taken to custody on 5 July 2007. In 
anticipation of proceedings being instituted against her, Ms. Huda had moved an application for 
anticipatory/pre-arrest bail. In her bail application she had pleaded ill health as the ground for 
grant of bail. The Court granted bail by its order dated 26 April 2007. Ms. Sigma Huda applied 
to the High Court Division on 10-5-2007 for permission to go outside the country to carry out 
her mandate as the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in persons. As the material time 
preparations for criminal proceedings against Ms. Huda were in progress, these proceedings 
would have been frustrated if she suddenly left the country. Hence, the Government was 
constrained to appeal against the above order dated 13 May 2007, which was stayed by the apex 
Court, the Appellate Division. In this connection it may be mentioned here that the Government 
has no objection to Ms. Huda&#8217;s functioning as a Special Rapporteur. Her presence in the country 
was necessary in relation to the legal proceedings. The Charge against Mrs. Huda is serious in 
nature. In the backdrop of the country-wide anti-corruption drive, it was apprehended by the 
investigator that Ms. Huda might be involved in some more corruption cases. If allowed to go 
abroad, she might not come back and thus would avoid the judicial proceedings. That is why, the 
prosecution preferred for a leave to appeal against the order of the Honourable High Court 
Division. The Government is mindful of the status of Ms. Huda and is adhering to strict legal 
principles in dealing with her case. She has been and continues to be represented, as of date, by </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>at least two of the most prominent attorneys in Bangladesh namely Mr. Rafique-ul-Haq, Senior 
Advocate and former Attorney General and Mr. Azmalul Hossain, Q.C. She has also been 
represented by Advocate Haji Nazrul Islam and Borhan Uddin. According to provisions of law 
the trial has to be completed within 45 days. The time can be extended by another 15 days in 
addition to the 45 days by assigning sufficient reasons. Since the Court took cognizance of the 
offences on 7 June 2007, the trial should be completed within a period of 60 days commencing 
from 7 June 2007. 
</p>
<p>38. On 16 August 2007, the Government added that Ms. Huda has been provided with proper 
and timely medical treatment as and when required, under the existing Jail Code of Bangladesh. 
She has also received specialized medical care. As desired by her, a renowned Cardiac Specialist 
of BSM Medical University, the country&#8217;s most reputed Medical Hospital, attended her on 
4 July 2007. She was also sent to this specialized hospital recently to obtain medical advice. 
On 6 August 2007, she was again referred to this specialized hospital. Subsequently, as per 
advice of the doctors, she was admitted in the same hospital, where she has received the 
necessary medical care. 
</p>
<p>39. On 31 August 2007, the Government added the Court Verdict on Mrs. Sigma Huda. In the 
bribery case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), a special Judge Court yesterday 
(on 27 August 2007) sentenced Mrs. Sigma Huda to three years simple imprisonment. 
Mrs. Huda&#8217;s spouse and former Communication Minister Mr. Nazmul Huda was sentenced to 
seven years rigorous imprisonment and was fined Tk. 2.50 crore in the came case. The Special 
Judge&#8217;s Court-2 pronounced the verdict on Mr. Huda under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 
for abuse of power and corruption and Mrs. Huda was sentenced under Bangladesh Penal Code 
for being the accomplice in the crime. Ms. Huda was represented in the trial by Barrister 
Azmalul Hossain, Q.C, a prominent lawyer in Bangladesh. The verdict was delivered in 
56 working days of trial. Depositions of 48 witnesses were taken during the period, eight of 
whom gave deposition in favour of Mr. and Mrs. Huda. The following charge was laid: 
Mr. Nazmul Huda, former Communication Minister, took Tk. 2.40 crore as bribe from one 
Mr. Mir Zahir Hossain at different times in exchange for awarding him five Government 
contracts for construction works including road renovations worth about Tk. 30 crore. The bribe 
was taken in phases between 12 February 2005 and 17 February 2005. Five work contracts were 
awarded to the plaintiff, the works of which were carried out between 2004 and 2005. The 
Government contracts included a work order for renovation of roads under DFID projects at 
Bhulta, Rupganj and Rampura worth Tk. 4.16 crore. The other contracts were for maintenance 
works of Rajshahi-Natore Road, Rajshahi-Nawabganj Road, and roads and highways in greater 
Rajshahi area worth Tk. 10 crore, for works of Faridpur-Kamarkhali Road worth Tk. 5.64 crore, 
for construction of Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge Building at Banani in the capital worth 
Tk. 4 crore, and another contract for works of Rajshahi-Natore Road worth Tk. 6.72 crore, 
prosecution sources said. Ms. Sigma Huda was charged in the same case for aiding and abetting 
her husband in taking the bribe, which was found deposited in an account of &#8220;Khoborer 
Ontorale&#8221;, a weekly newspaper owned by her. Later Tk. 1 crore of the bribe money was 
transferred to HSBC bank accounts of their daughters. The legal proceedings against Ms. Huda 
are being conducted impartially and her rights to a fare trial and due process of law are being 
respected. The Special Judge has awarded the jail sentence. The plaintiff has full right to appeal 
against the verdict in the higher courts. </p>

<p>40. On 5 October 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent on 20 April 2007, 
stating that Mr. Aminul Islam, son of Late Abdul Malek of Puradia, Police Station Nagarkanda, 
District- Faridpur, present address- D/3, House-8, Road-13, Dhanmondi, Dhaka was arrested and 
produced before the Court on 12 January 2007 in connection with Dhanmondi Police Station 
General Diary number 661 dated 12 January 2007 corresponding to detention case No. 02/2007 
because of his involvement in some acts subversive to the State. He, being a Director of ADAB, 
a sister concern of Proshika, organized and incited local slum dwellers and other people in 
Dhanmondi area in disguise and tried to create enmity between different classes of people there. 
He also patronized some acts of the violence, which endangered public safety and security in 
Dhanmondi area. This led to him being accused in four cases. Of the four, one case (No. 13 
dated 2 March 2004) already ended in framing prima-facie charge against Mr. Islam and others 
on completion of investigation while the rest of the cases are still under investigation as 
evidences are impeding. After the arrest, Mr. Aminul Islam was initially given one-month 
detention under the Special Power Act. Later on it was extended for another month. However, he 
challenged the verdict in the High Court. The High Court ruled in his favour and he was freed 
from Dhaka Central Jail on 27 April 2007. Mr. Abul Kashem Polash, son of Late Bazlur Rahman 
of Payerkhola, Police Station- Chowddagram, District- Comilla, present address: Quarter P/15, 
Noorjahan Road, Mohammadpur, Dhaka was arrested and produced before the competent Court 
on 12 January 2007 in connection with Mohammadpur Police Station General diary No. 737 
dated 12 January 2007 for his involvement in some acts subversive to the country and other 
feuds and fracas. He, in the grab of Deputy Director of ADAB, tried to jeopardize the law and 
order situation in the Mohammadpur area by provoking and inciting the local people and the 
Slum dwellers against the law enforcing agencies. Consequently, he was accused in three cases. 
Mr. Abul Kashem Palash is the Central Coordinator of Proshika. He played a vital role in 
bringing forth people for political programmes of the Awami League. He was arrested on 
12 January 207 by the Joint Forces for his alleged role in utilizing NGO activists for anti-state 
activities and creating unrest in the society. He was arrested from his house by Rapid Action 
Battalion (RAB)-2. Later on, he was handed over to Mohammadpur Thana Police. There were 
one General diary (No. 737 dated 12 January 207) and two cases (No. 13/06 and 54/06) against 
him at Mohammedpur Police Station and one case (number 13 dated 12 March 2004) at 
Dhanmondi Police Station. A Charge sheet against him was given on 7 July 2005 in the case 
filed with Dhanmondi Police Station. Mr. Abul Kahsem was sent to jail and given one month 
detention under the Special Power Act after the arrest. However, it was extended for another 
three months until 11 May 207. However, Mr. Abul Kashem challenged his detention in the 
High Court. After the hearing Hon&#8217;ble High Court ordered him to be released on bail. On 
23 May 2007 he was freed from Dhaka Central Jail. Mr. Aminul Islam and Mr. Abul Kashem 
Polash were arrested for their alleged role in creating unrest in the society. They violated the law 
of the country as NGO representatives and got involved in internal political activities, which 
were subversive to the State. They also forced poor people to be associated with their NGO for 
taking part in the destructive political activities to create chaos and unrest. However, they were 
given proper opportunity to fight their cases in the court. The legal proceedings against 
Mr. Aminui Islam and Mr. Abul Kashem Polash respectively will be conducted impartially and 
their rights to a fair trial and due process of law will be respected. 
</p>
<p>41. On 27 November 2007, Government replied to the communication sent 
on 7 November 2007. The Government referred to its previous communication dated 
2 May 2007. The Government informed that Mr. Akash has a record of toll collection, black </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>mailing and reporting false and fabricated stories, and therefore he was boycotted by his 
colleagues and was avoided by local people. The Government maintained that Mr. Akash has 
launched an international campaign to draw sympathy in his favour in order for the Government 
to refrain from taking action against him according to national law. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for its cooperation and its 
detailed responses to several of his communications. Regarding the communication of 
26 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the Government in 
order to separate the judiciary from the executive. However, he remains concerned by several 
obstacles that subsist. In particular, he is concerned by the lack of implementation of laws and 
judgements ensuring practical separation between the executive and the judiciary. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls the Government of Bangladesh to remove these obstacles in the shortest 
delay. He also requests the Government to keep him informed about the situation. Regarding the 
communication sent on 7 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned by the fact 
that the Government did not reply to the questions related to the respect of the guarantees of the 
due process of law in the case of Mr. Akash. He asks the Government of Bangladesh to provide 
at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the Human 
Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.  
</p>
<p>43. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of reply to its 
communications of 20 February and 11 July 2007 and urges the Government to provide at the 
earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights 
Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Belarus

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>44. On 23 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, on the situation of 
Mr. Aleksandr Sdvizhkov, editor at the weekly newspaper Zhoda, which has been shut down by 
the government. According to the information received, On 18 January 2008, Mr. Sdvizhkov was 
found guilty by the Minsk City Court of &#8220;incitement to religious hatred&#8221; for reprinting the 
cartoons of Prophet Mohammed that originally appeared on September 2005 in the Danish 
newspaper Jylland Posten. He was sentenced to three years in a high-security prison following a 
trial conducted in camera. The cartoons were published in the Zhoda newspaper in 
February 2006. A month later, the newspaper was shut down by the Government. Fearing 
prosecution, Mr. Sdvizhkov fled the country. He was arrested by the Security Service in 
November 2007 when he returned to Belarus to attend his father&#8217;s funeral. Mr. Sdvizhkov and 
the Zhoda newspaper were one of the few independent voices in the Byelorussian press, in 
particular during the presidential election of 2006, when the Zhoda newspaper decided to also 
give coverage to the opposition candidate who took part in the elections.

<p>46. El 12 de noviembre de 2007, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n 
con los magistrados del Tribunal Constitucional Walter Ra&#241;a Ara&#241;a, Artemio Arias Romano, 
Elizabeth I&#241;iguez de Salinas y Martha Rojas &#193;lvarez. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 
proceso impulsado desde la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n de la Honorable C&#225;mara de Diputados 
contra los magistrados constitucionales anteriormente mencionados, se habr&#237;a realizado sin las 
garant&#237;as debidas, llegando a vulnerar varios principios relativos al debido proceso y a la 
independencia del poder judicial. A trav&#233;s del memorial del 15 de mayo de 2007, Juan Evo 
Morales Ayma, Presidente Constitucional de la Rep&#250;blica, habr&#237;a formalizado una denuncia en 
contra de los cuatro magistrados por la supuesta comisi&#243;n de los delitos de resoluciones 
contrarias a la Constituci&#243;n y las Leyes, impedir o estorbar el ejercicio de funciones y 
prevaricato, que se habr&#237;an cometido al pronunciar la Sentencia Constitucional (SC) 0018/2007 
del 9 de mayo de 2007, que declar&#243; inconstitucional un Decreto Supremo del Gobierno que 
designaba de manera interina a cuatro ministros de la Corte Suprema de Justicia. El 28 de mayo 
de 2007, los magistrados habr&#237;an presentado ante la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n, Justicia y Polic&#237;a 
Judicial excepciones de incompetencia del &#243;rgano legislativo en raz&#243;n de la investigaci&#243;n y 
enjuiciamiento penal; incompetencia del &#243;rgano en raz&#243;n de la materia; y falta de acci&#243;n. Dichas 
excepciones habr&#237;an sido declaradas improbadas por la mencionada Comisi&#243;n. Notificados con 
esa decisi&#243;n, el 27 de junio de 2007, los magistrados habr&#237;an interpuesto recurso de apelaci&#243;n 
incidental ante la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n, recurso que no obstante los reclamos efectuados, no 
mereci&#243; el tr&#225;mite previsto en el art. 405 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal (CPP). Dicho 
art&#237;culo determina que presentado el recurso, el juez emplazar&#225; a las otras partes para que en el 
plazo de tres d&#237;as lo contesten, y, en su caso, acompa&#241;en y ofrezcan prueba; a&#241;adiendo que con 
la contestaci&#243;n o sin ella, dentro de las veinticuatro horas siguientes se remitir&#225;n actuaciones ante 
el Tribunal de apelaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n lo informado, ninguno de los memoriales presentados por los 
magistrados del Tribunal Constitucional denunciando la actividad procesal defectuosa al &#243;rgano 
encargado de ejercer el control de la etapa preparatoria habr&#237;a sido tramitado. Sin embargo, el 
Comit&#233; del Ministerio P&#250;blico y Polic&#237;a Judicial de la C&#225;mara de Diputados habr&#237;a librado 
mandamiento de aprehensi&#243;n contra los magistrados del Tribunal Constitucional, pese a que la 
Ley 2623 proh&#237;be la aplicaci&#243;n de medidas cautelares durante la etapa preparatoria. Los 
magistrados habr&#237;an planteado un recurso de amparo constitucional contra los miembros de la 
Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n, Justicia y Polic&#237;a Judicial. La tutela impetrada mediante el citado 
amparo, habr&#237;a sido concedida a trav&#233;s de la Resoluci&#243;n 027/07-SSA-I de 8 de agosto de 2007, 
que dispuso la inmediata tramitaci&#243;n del recurso de apelaci&#243;n incidental y su consiguiente 
remisi&#243;n a la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos. El 22 de agosto de 2007, la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos habr&#237;a emitido la Resoluci&#243;n 019/07, por la que declaraba admisible el 
recurso de apelaci&#243;n incidental interpuesta por los magistrados y procedente las excepciones de 
incompetencia en raz&#243;n de la materia y de falta de acci&#243;n, disponiendo el archivo de los obrados. </p>

<p>Sin embargo, el mismo d&#237;a 22 de agosto, algunos diputados habr&#237;an pronunciado la Resoluci&#243;n 
Camaral 049/02007, a trav&#233;s de la cual adoptaron y aprobaron como decisi&#243;n de la C&#225;mara de 
Diputados, el Proyecto de Acusaci&#243;n presentado por la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n, Justicia y 
Polic&#237;a Judicial, por la que se acusaba a los magistrados de los delitos de prevaricato y de 
impedir y estorbar el ejercicio de funciones, de manera que dispusieron a su vez, la suspensi&#243;n 
de los magistrados en el ejercicio de sus funciones. Finalmente, el 4 de septiembre de 2007, se 
habr&#237;a dictado la Resoluci&#243;n 059/2007, mediante la cual se dispuso el archivo definitivo de los 
obrados en el proceso penal en contra de los mencionados jueces de la Corte Constitucional, 
conforme lo decidido en la Resoluci&#243;n 019/2007 de 22 de agosto, y la restituci&#243;n de los 
Magistrados a sus funciones, ordenando se notificara a las autoridades competentes, en particular 
al Comandante General de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, para que se garantice el normal desempe&#241;o de 
funciones. En relaci&#243;n con las irregularidades alegadas, hay que a&#241;adir la supuesta aprobaci&#243;n 
por la mencionada Comisi&#243;n de una Resoluci&#243;n acusatoria sin el qu&#243;rum correspondiente. 
Adem&#225;s, seg&#250;n las fuentes, la Resoluci&#243;n emitida por la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n habr&#237;a 
desconocido del amparo constitucional establecido por la Corte Superior de Distrito a favor de 
los magistrados del Tribunal. El Relator Especial expres&#243;, ante todo, su gran preocupaci&#243;n por 
las irregularidades en torno a dicho proceso puesto que he recibido informaci&#243;n que apunta a que 
el cese de las funciones de los cuatro magistrados podr&#237;a tener como fin la neutralizaci&#243;n de la 
acci&#243;n del Tribunal Constitucional en la labor de defensa de la Constituci&#243;n. En este sentido, 
resalt&#243; la importante funci&#243;n del Tribunal Constitucional como m&#225;ximo guardi&#225;n de la 
Constituci&#243;n, del r&#233;gimen democr&#225;tico del gobierno y de la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos. 
Asimismo, destac&#243; el car&#225;cter independiente de dicho &#243;rgano en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones 
jurisdiccionales, y la necesidad de que otros poderes institucionales no interfieran con dicha 
independencia. En este contexto, expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que los cuatro 
magistrados del Tribunal Constitucional se encuentren nuevamente suspendidos del ejercicio de 
sus funciones. Seg&#250;n las &#250;ltimas informaciones recibidas, el pasado 26 de octubre las 
magistradas del Tribunal Constitucional, Elizabeth I&#241;iquez y Martha Rojas, habr&#237;an presentado 
su renuncia irrevocable al cargo que desempe&#241;an. Las magistradas habr&#237;an destacado las 
constantes presiones del Poder Ejecutivo al Poder Judicial, que coartan su libertad de 
desempe&#241;ar su cargo. En este contexto, tambi&#233;n expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por la situaci&#243;n actual 
del Tribunal Constitucional, que no puede funcionar con s&#243;lo tres miembros. En este sentido, 
hizo un llamamiento para que la elecci&#243;n de los dos nuevos miembros del Tribunal se realice sin 
demoras y de acuerdo con unos criterios de objetividad e imparcialidad. Sin embargo, tambi&#233;n 
expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por algunas de las disposiciones establecidas en la Ley 2623, de 22 de 
diciembre de 2003. El Relator Especial consider&#243; sumamente preocupante que la potestad 
judicial de dictar sentencia condenatoria en contra de magistrados, imponiendo sanciones 
penales de privaci&#243;n de libertad, corresponda al Poder Legislativo. Esto vulnera el principio de la 
divisi&#243;n de poderes, previsto en la Constituci&#243;n, y el derecho fundamental de cada persona de ser 
juzgado por un tribunal competente, independiente e imparcial, y no por el Poder Legislativo, 
que no ofrece las garant&#237;as de independencia y competencia necesarias. Igualmente consider&#243; 
preocupante que, conforme a lo dispuesto en esta Ley, la sentencia condenatoria pueda ser 
impugnada mediante recurso de apelaci&#243;n restringida ante la sesi&#243;n del Congreso, lo cual 
implica que la apelaci&#243;n es conocida por quienes actuaron como acusadores y por quienes 
emitieron la sentencia. Esto vulnera el derecho fundamental de cada persona de que el fallo 
condenatorio y la pena que se le haya impuesto sean sometidos a un tribunal superior. Por 
&#250;ltimo, se recibi&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre la adopci&#243;n de otras medidas que menoscaban la 
independencia del Poder Judicial en el pa&#237;s. En este sentido, el Relator Especial destac&#243; la severa </p>

</p>
<p>reducci&#243;n de los salarios de los magistrados que, seg&#250;n fuentes, se habr&#237;a llevado a cabo 
mediante Decreto Supremo. El Relator Especial subray&#243; que la independencia financiera de los 
jueces es un elemento fundamental de su independencia como representantes del poder judicial, 
que les permite no ser sujetos a presiones externas. Es entonces muy importante que se les 
garantice un salario de un cierto nivel, que corresponda al rol tan importante que desempe&#241;an 
dentro de la sociedad, y que garantice su independencia frente a las presiones a las cuales son a 
menudo sometidos.

<p>48. Le 16 mai 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement du Burundi, 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant la 
situation des mineurs incarc&#233;r&#233;s au Burundi. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, &#224; la fin du mois de 
d&#233;cembre 2006, environ 400 enfants, &#226;g&#233;s de 13 &#224; 18 ans, se trouvaient incarc&#233;r&#233;s dans les 
prisons du Burundi. Plus de 75 pour cent d&#8217;entre eux &#233;taient alors toujours en attente d&#8217;un 
proc&#232;s, apr&#232;s des mois, voire des ann&#233;es de d&#233;tention. La plupart d&#8217;entre eux n&#8217;auraient pas eu 
acc&#232;s &#224; un avocat. Le Gouvernement du Burundi a reconnu l&#8217;existence de probl&#232;mes li&#233;s &#224; la 
d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive, y compris des mineurs, dans un rapport au Comit&#233; contre la torture des 
Nations Unies en 2003 mais depuis lors, loin de s&#8217;am&#233;liorer, la situation se serait d&#233;t&#233;rior&#233;e de 
mani&#232;re significative. En l&#8217;absence d&#8217;un syst&#232;me de justice pour les mineurs, les enfants seraient 
trait&#233;s comme des adultes tant devant les tribunaux que dans les prisons. L&#8217;&#226;ge limite de la 
responsabilit&#233; criminelle est de 13 ans et les mineurs ayant entre 13 et 18 ans qui sont d&#233;clar&#233;s 
coupables d&#8217;un crime ne b&#233;n&#233;ficieraient pas des r&#233;ductions de peine normalement accord&#233;es aux 
adultes reconnus coupables des m&#234;mes crimes. Bon nombre de mineurs retenus prisonniers en 
attente de proc&#232;s seraient m&#233;lang&#233;s avec ceux ayant &#233;t&#233; reconnus coupables. Le recours rare &#224; la 
mise en libert&#233; sous caution occasionnerait un surpeuplement des prisons et les enfants n&#8217;ayant 
pas d&#8217;avocat ne seraient souvent m&#234;me pas tenus au courant de la possibilit&#233; l&#233;gale d&#8217;&#234;tre lib&#233;r&#233;s 
sous caution. Les enfants et les adultes en prison seraient d&#233;tenus ensemble pendant la plupart de 
la journ&#233;e, exposant ainsi les enfants &#224; des agressions physiques et sexuelles de la part de 
prisonniers adultes.  </p>

<p><b>Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>50. On 7 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, concerning two events affecting the functions of the Extraordinary Chambers in the 
Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). In particular the expulsion of the non-Governmental organization 
Open Society Justice Initiative (OSIJ). According to the information received, OSIJ issued a 
press release on 14 February 2007, calling for a thorough investigation of allegations that 
Cambodian officials may be obliged to pay &#8220;kickbacks&#8221; in return for their positions at the 
ECCC. The press statement also called for any investigation on the case to be made public and, if 
the allegations proved true, that immediate measures be taken by the ECCC to address the 
problem. The release was based on information gathered over several months from sources both 
within and outside of the ECCC. On 16 February 2007, the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An was 
quoted by Agence France Press as saying that OSJI was no longer allowed to enter the court. 
Meanwhile, ECCC Deputy Administrator Michelle Lee and Public Affairs Officer Peter Foster 
asserted that the OSIJ would still have full access to the Chambers and to international 
personnel. Later that same day, the ECCC Administrator Sean Visoth sent a letter to the OSIJ, 
which stated that the Cambodian side of the ECCC&#8217;s Office of Administration would &#8220;have no 
further cooperation with the OSIJ&#8221;. On 9 March 2007, OSIJ members were informed that, two 
weeks earlier, the Prime Minister Hun Sen had issued an oral order to expel OSIJ from 
Cambodia and had asked for a list of the names of everyone associated with OSIJ&#8217;s ECCC 
project. On 11 March 2007, OSIJ was told that the delivery of names to the Deputy Prime 
Minister might trigger a decision to execute the expulsion order.  
</p>
<p>51. On 23 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>52. The United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General for human rights in 
Cambodia and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers express 
concern over judicial independence in Cambodia in the light of recent judicial appointments </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>53. &#8220;The Special Representative and the Special Rapporteur are concerned that recent judicial 
appointments appear not to have been made in accordance with the Constitution, casting doubt 
on whether the constitutionally guaranteed principle of judicial independence is being fully 
respected in Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>54. According to Cambodian law, all judicial appointments, transfers, promotions, suspensions 
or disciplinary actions are decided by the Supreme Council of Magistracy and implemented by 
royal decree. Yet the royal decree of 9 August 2007 replacing the President of the Court of 
Appeal (NS/RKT/0807/339) appears not to have been made on the basis of a decision of the 
Supreme Council of Magistracy: prior to the issuance of the decree, no meeting of the Council 
was convened. 
</p>
<p>55. Instead, the decree states that the action was requested by the Chairman of the Supreme 
Council for State Reform, following proposals from the Co-Chairmen of the Council for Legal 
and Judicial Reform and the Minister of Justice. In other words, the replacement of the Appeal 
Court President was done at the request of the executive branch of government in contravention 
of the separation of executive and judicial powers specified in the Constitution. 
</p><p>56. Without commenting on the merits of the allegations made against the outgoing Appeal 
Court President, disciplinary action against judges is, according to the law, the prerogative of the 
Supreme Council of Magistracy, acting through a Disciplinary Council. The United Nations 
Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, which form part of Cambodian law, state 
that judges, like all citizens, are entitled to a fair hearing and other guarantees of due process. 
The Executive should not have a role in deciding whether any judge has acted inappropriately 
and should be dismissed. 
</p>
<p>57. The appointment of four new members of the Supreme Council of Magistracy by another 
royal decree (NS/RKT/0807/340), also issued on 9 August 2007, appears to have been made 
similarly at the request of the Executive rather than in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Representative has already expressed concern that the composition of the 
Supreme Council of Magistracy, which includes a government minister and a member of the 
ruling party&#8217;s Permanent Committee, does not inspire confidence that the judicial appointment 
process in Cambodia is free of political control. But these recent royal decrees actually sideline 
the Supreme Council of Magistracy, leaving it only a role in implementing, together with the 
Supreme Council for State Reform, a decision that it did not formally approve. 
</p>
<p>59. Three of the appointments to the Supreme Council of Magistracy were for positions which, 
according to the Law on the Supreme Council of the Magistracy, are reserved for members 
elected by the judges. No elections appear to have been held for these positions; indeed, no 
elections have ever been held for these three elected positions. 
</p>
<p>60. An independent judiciary is a fundamental guarantor for the protection of human rights in 
any country: without independent judges, it is not possible to ensure everyone&#8217;s right to a fair 
trial. Unless the Supreme Council of Magistracy is, and is seen to be, free of government control, 
the Courts of Cambodia cannot be recognized as independent. And if the courts are not 
independent and impartial, they cannot administer justice fairly in accordance with international 
human rights standards.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Representative and the Special Rapporteur call upon the Cambodian 
Authorities to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution, the Law on the Supreme Council of 
Magistracy, as well as international human rights law, are respected so that the independence of 
the Cambodian judiciary can be ensured.  
</p><p>62. They also associate themselves with the concerns already expressed by the United Nations 
about the implications of the transfer of the Co-Investigating Judge at the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia to the presidency of the Appeal Court. Legal and judicial 
reform is crucially important to the future development of Cambodia; but it should not be 
undertaken at the expense of the essential protections provided to judges, including guarantees of 
tenure, that enable judges to administer, and be seen to administer, justice efficiently, impartially 
and fairly, free of political interference.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received  
</b></p>
<p>None. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Cambodia to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end 
of the 9th session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegations.

<p>64. Le 29 ao&#251;t 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement du Cameroun, 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la situation des droits de l&#8217;homme et des libert&#233;s 
fondamentales des populations autochtones et de la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral 
concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, un appel urgent sur la situation des 
&#233;leveurs Mbororos Fulanis dans la province du Nord-Ouest du Cameroun, notamment sur les 
&#233;v&#233;nements ayant entra&#238;n&#233; la destitution du chef traditionnel des Mbororos, Lamido Adamu 
K. Buba. L&#8217;appel urgent signalait l&#8217;all&#233;gation selon laquelle ces &#233;v&#233;nements se d&#233;roulaient dans 
un contexte plus large de violations des droits de la population Mbororo, violations entra&#238;n&#233;es 
par la d&#233;possession de leurs terres traditionnelles au profit d&#8217;un entrepreneur priv&#233;. Il &#233;tait 
all&#233;gu&#233; que la situation mettait en &#233;vidence l&#8217;interf&#233;rence suppos&#233;e de M. Baba Danpullo, 
l&#8217;entrepreneur en question, dans le syst&#232;me de l&#8217;autorit&#233; traditionnelle de la communaut&#233; 
Mbororo, et d&#233;bouchait sur des pers&#233;cutions et arrestations de chefs traditionnels et d&#8217;autres 
membres de la Communaut&#233;. Selon les all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, le chef spirituel de la communaut&#233; 
Mbororo, Lamido Ahmadu Sabga, serait d&#233;c&#233;d&#233; le 13 juin 2007. En accord avec la loi 
coutumi&#232;re de la communaut&#233;, le Conseil traditionnel Mbororo aurait &#233;lu, le 15 juin 2007, &#224; la 
majorit&#233; des votes, M. Adamu Kawuyel Buba en tant que nouveau chef traditionnel. Il &#233;tait 
all&#233;gu&#233; que la nomination de M. Adamu K. Buba aurait &#233;t&#233; explicitement object&#233;e par 
M. Baba Danpullo, qui, depuis la mort de l&#8217;ancien Lamido, aurait essay&#233; d&#8217;influencer le 
processus et nomm&#233; l&#8217;un de ses collaborateurs pour le remplacer. Dans ce contexte, lors des 
condol&#233;ances de l&#8217;ancien Lamido Ahmadu Sabga, M. Adamu K. Buba aurait, selon les </p>

</p>
<p>informations rapport&#233;es, menac&#233; un des membres du Conseil traditionnel avec les mots suivants : 
&#171; Je vous conseille de choisir un bon chef et si vous choisissez une personne qui ne me convient 
pas, je ne l&#8217;accepterai pas &#187;. En accord avec leur pratique, apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;lection du nouveau Lamido, 
les autorit&#233;s des Mbororos auraient envoy&#233; une lettre au Chef Provincial de Mezam, l&#8217;informant 
de l&#8217;intronisation. Cependant, le 19 juin 2007, ce dernier aurait publi&#233; une D&#233;cision Pr&#233;fectorale 
(n&#176; 129 PD/E29/PS) d&#233;clarant la nullit&#233; de l&#8217;intronisation de M. Adamu K. Buba, interdisant 
toutes les r&#233;unions et les assembl&#233;es de la communaut&#233; Mbororo et fermant le palais traditionnel 
du Lamido. Un Recours Gracieux (R&#233;f. MLF/RG/001/07) aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; le 28 juin 2007 par 
les dirigeants de la communaut&#233; contre cette d&#233;cision pr&#233;fectorale. Sans tenir compte de cette 
plainte en cours, et, n&#233;gligeant les pratiques traditionnelles des Mbororos, le Chef Provincial de 
Mezam aurait, selon les informations re&#231;ues, annonc&#233; la vacance du poste du Lamido 
traditionnel. Le 12 juillet 2007, tous les membres du Conseil traditionnel Mbororo auraient &#233;t&#233; 
convoqu&#233;s &#224; la Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la Recherche Ext&#233;rieure du Poste de Liaison du 
Nord-Ouest-Bamenda. Pour n&#8217;avoir re&#231;u aucune information officielle sur les motifs de cette 
convocation, et par crainte de repr&#233;sailles pour l&#8217;intronisation du nouveau Lamido, les membres 
du Conseil traditionnel auraient choisi de ne pas se rendre &#224; la gendarmerie. Le 13 juillet 2007, 
aux alentours des 5h00 du matin, approximativement 500 personnes de la communaut&#233; Mbororo, 
y compris le Lamido r&#233;cemment &#233;lu, Adamu K. Buba, ainsi que les membres du Conseil 
traditionnel, auraient manifest&#233; contre la d&#233;cision pr&#233;fectorale annulant l&#8217;intronisation du 
nouveau Lamido. Au cours de cette manifestation, les protestataires auraient paisiblement bloqu&#233; 
la route principale qui traverse la communaut&#233; de Sagba. Tous les membres du Conseil

<p>73. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer and Director of the 
Shengzhi Law Office in Beijing, his wife Ms. Geng He, their children aged 13 years and two 
years and his 70 year old mother-in-law. Mr. Gao Zhisheng has represented victims of human 
rights violations; clients who sought to hold the State accountable for corruption and neglect 
including forced evictions; and represented clients involved in cases related to freedom of speech 
and the press. He has been the subject of three communications sent to your Government, the 
first sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, dated 
25 November 2005, a second communication was subsequently sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture on 21 December 2005 and the most recent communication dated 
22 August 2006 was sent by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. According to the new information 
received, on 24 November 2006 Ms. Geng was beaten by members of the State Security police 
who had been following her movements and keeping her under surveillance. It is reported that 
Ms. Geng, her 13-year-old daughter and her mother have been constantly followed by police for 
approximately three months. The incident reportedly took place on a street in Beijing (Jingsong 
Road, near the Lidu Hotel on bus route 408), after Ms. Geng told three police officers (two male, 
one female) to stop following her and her children. As a result of the beating by the two male 
police officers, Ms. Geng is reported to have loosened teeth, a bleeding mouth and gums, her 
fingernail on one hand completely torn off and her leather clothing ripped into pieces. It is </p>

</p>
<p>further reported that Mr. Gao and Ms. Geng&#8217;s 13-year-old daughter, Gege, has also been 
harassed by the State Security Police who accompany her at all times, including while she is 
in school. It is reported that they follow her to her classroom, in the school corridors and even 
to the bathroom, which makes her educational environment difficult. Furthermore, on 
21 November, it is reported that Beijing police showed their badges and attempted to pick up 
Tianyu, their 2-year-old son, but his kindergarten teacher refused to comply. It has also been 
reported that Ms. Geng&#8217;s 70-year-old mother is also tailed by police if she leaves the house. On  
12 October 2006, Mr. Gao Zhisheng was formally charged with &#8220;inciting to subvert the state&#8221;. It 
is reported that on 6 October 2006, Ms. Geng&#8217;s birthday, she was allowed to see her husband at 
the Beijing No. 2 Detention Centre where they were watched and interrupted by police officers 
throughout the visit which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. However sources indicate that 
Mr. Gao has still not had access to his lawyer Mr. Mo Shaoping despite the recent discovery of 
his current whereabouts, as the authorities have reportedly stated that his case concerns &#8220;state 
secrets&#8221;. Prior to 6 October 2006 he had allegedly been held incommunicado since  
15 August 2006 when he was arrested without a warrant at his sister&#8217;s house in Dongying City in 
Shandong Province, by more than 20 plainclothes police officers from the Beijing Public 
Security Bureau. According to reports the official Xinhua News Agency released a statement on 
18 August 2006 stating that Mr. Gao had been arrested &#8220;on suspicion of breaking the law&#8221; 
however details of the alleged crime he had committed were not provided. Concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Gao Zhisheng as it is feared that he 
may be subject to torture or ill-treatment while in detention. Concern was expressed that the 
charges against him may be fabricated and may represent an attempt to prevent him and deter 
others from carrying out legitimate legal work in defence of human rights. Further concerns were 
also expressed for the safety of his family, particularly his wife, Ms. Geng and his children as it 
is feared that they may be subject to further acts of intimidation, harassment or violence because 
of Mr. Gao&#8217;s aforementioned human rights work. 
</p>
<p>74. On 21 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr. Chen Guangcheng, 
a 34 year old blind self-taught human rights lawyer in Linyi, Shandong province, and his wife 
Ms. Yuan Weijing, his lawyers Mr. Li Jinsong and Mr. Li Fangping, a member of his defence 
team, Dr Teng Biao, and witnesses to his trial, - Mr. Chen Gengjiang, Mr. Chen Guangdong, 
Mr. Chen Guangyu and Mr. Chen Guanghe. Mr. Chen Guangcheng has a long history of 
campaigning for the rights of farmers and the disabled. He assisted villagers in solving drinking 
water pollution problems when he was attending Najing Chinese Medicine University in 2000. 
He created and ran the &#8220;Rights Defense Project for the Disabled&#8221; under the auspices of the 
Chinese Legal Studies Association between 2000 and 2001. Since 1996, he has provided free 
legal consultation to farmers and the disabled in rural areas. In 2004, he ran a &#8220;Citizen 
Awareness and Law for the Disabled Project&#8221;. In April 2005, Mr. Chen Guangcheng and 
Ms. Yuan Weijing began to investigate villagers&#8217; claims that Linyi City authorities were 
employing extensive violence in implementing government birth quotas. The first report was 
published by them on 10 June 2005 through the Citizens Rights Defence Network (gongmin 
weiquan wang) and they brought law suits against officials involved. Mr. Chen Guangcheng has 
been the subject of four previous communications to your Government, the most recent of which </p>

</p>
<p>were sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders dated 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
14 July 2006. Previous communications were also sent on 7 April 2006 by the Special 
Representative on the situation of human rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, on 31 October 2005 by the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and on 19 September 2005 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. The mandate holders acknowledge 
receipt of the Government&#8217;s replies dated 12 December 2005, 14 June 2006 and 3 October 2006. 
The Government states that &#8220;(i)n dealing with Chen and his associates, the public security 
authorities acted in compliance with the law, in remanding them in custody or holding them for 
questioning. Throughout this period their lawful rights were fully protected and there is no 
substance to the allegation that Chen Guangcheng was subjected to beatings and placed under 
house arrest.&#8221; While the mandate holders welcomed the Government&#8217;s observations, they were 
afraid that they do not alleviate their concerns with respect to this case, particularly so in the 
light of consistent reports that a number of individuals involved in his trial have allegedly been 
targeted by the security forces including his wife, his lawyers, a member of his defence team and 
witnesses to his trial. According to new information received: On 27 November 2006, Chen 
Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial before the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court lasted approximately 10 hours. It 
is reported that on 1 December 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months&#8217; 
imprisonment for &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. 
According to reports, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Yuan Weijing, has been under de facto house 
arrest from 12 August 2005 until 25 November 2006. Since then, she had been continuously 
followed by local security personnel and persons in civilian clothes believed to have been hired 
by the police. On 28 November 2006, around midday, she was arrested by members of the Yinan 
County Public Security Bureau and detained for questioning. Their one-year-old child was also 
taken but was sent home later that day. Approximately eight hours later, Yuan Weijing, was 
dragged out of police car and left in a barely conscious state on the side of the road near her 
village. She was taken to the Mengyin County Menglianggu Hospital where she was treated for 
extreme trauma however she was accompanied by up to 20 policemen as an order of &#8220;residential 
surveillance&#8221; had been issued while she was in detention. She is also suspected of committing 
&#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and for &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. Furthermore it 
is reported that the local authorities have intimidated witnesses and allegedly withheld evidence 
in order to prejudice Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial. It is further reported that four other key 
witnesses in the aforementioned trial have been subject to police harassment in relation to the 
most recent trial and were subjected to torture in order to provide false testimony against 
Mr. Chen Guangcheng in his previous trial. According to reports, Mr. Chen Gengjiang was </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>detained on 26 November 2006 and held until after the hearing had taken place. He was 
allegedly forced to sign papers in which he agreed not to participate in the case. On the same 
day, Mr. Chen Guangdong and Mr. Chen Guangyu reportedly disappeared after they had agreed 
to testify on behalf of the defence. Later the same evening, Mr. Chen Guanghe was allegedly 
abducted by undercover police officers as he was on his way to meet with Mr. Li Fanping 
regarding the upcoming trial in which he was scheduled to testify the following day. He was 
reportedly formally arrested on 28 November but his family was not informed of his arrest or his 
whereabouts until 3 December 2006. Previously, it is alleged that Mr. Chen Guanghe was 
detained and tortured before the first trial by members of the Yinan police in order to procure a 
false confession and to testify against Mr. Chen Guangcheng. He was convicted on the basis of 
the false confession but granted a suspended sentence. It is feared that his recent detention may 
be related to the fact that that he has submitted written testimony stating that his prior evidence 
had been coerced through torture. Members of Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s defence team have also 
allegedly been harassed, including his lawyers Mr. Li Jinsong, Mr. Li Fangping and 
Dr Teng Biao. The two lawyers were apparently prevented from interviewing witnesses and 
obtaining further evidence for the retrial. On 27 November 2006, as the trial was taking place, 
Dr Teng Biao was reportedly detained for five hours during which he was allegedly pushed to 
the ground by six or seven policemen who held him down while they searched him. They also 
apparently searched his bags and computer and confiscated his mobile phone. Grave concerns 
were expressed that the charges against Chen Guangcheng and his wife Yuan Weijing are 
fabricated and are solely related to their legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular their defending villagers&#8217; rights. Serious concern was expressed that 
Chen Guangcheng did not receive a fair trial as his lawyers were obstructed in all aspects of 
their work from collecting evidence from witnesses to meeting with their client. Concern was 
also expressed by the allegations his lawyers were subjected to physical abuse and detention to 
prevent them from representing their client at trial. Similar concerns were expressed for the fate 
of his wife, Yuan. Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
any witnesses for the defence as it is feared that they have been subjected to acts of torture or 
brutality by the Yinin County PSB.  
</p>
<p>75. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, concerning the enactment of tightening regulations regarding the legal profession, 
procedural obstacles to its exercise and an increase in the harassment of lawyers. It is alleged that 
the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code have been misused by authorities, in order 
to undermine lawyer&#8217;s defense work, especially in sensitive political or social unrest cases. 
Article 306 of the Criminal Code, article 96 of the Criminal Procedure Law and article 45 of the 
Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Lawyers, would allow prosecutors to arrest lawyers 
on grounds of perjury or false testimony. According to these provisions, lawyers can be 
prosecuted for destroying or fabricating evidence and of forcing or inciting a witness to change a 
testimony. These acts are punishable by imprisonment up to seven years and by the revocation of 
the lawyer&#8217;s licenses. It is reported that at least 100 lawyers have been accused of violating this 
article on the fabrication of evidence. These incriminations are reportedly used by authorities as 
a method to silence defense lawyers. It is also reported that article 96 of the Criminal Procedure 
Law, which applies to State secret cases, compels defendants who wish to be provided and meet 
with a legal counsel to request the approval of the investigative organ, which in general is the </p>

<p>public security authority. Moreover, both the Law on the protection of State secrets and a notice 
issued by the Ministry of Public Security and the National Administration for the Protection of 
State secrets in 1995 entitled &#8220;Regulation on State secrets and the scope of each level of 
classification in public security work&#8221; contain a definition of &#8220;State secrets&#8221; which is very broad. 
As a consequence, criminal defense lawyers are very much exposed to being accused of 
disclosing State secrets. Moreover, several restrictive regulations on the legal profession have 
been issued by national and local authorities. On 20 March 2006, the All China Lawyers 
Association (ACLA) issued a &#8220;Guiding Opinion on Lawyers handling Collective Cases&#8221;, which 
allegedly aims to ensure that sensitive cases do not threaten social stability. According to these 
rules, lawyers taking on collective cases (cases involving more than 10 people) and &#8220;major 
sensitive cases&#8221; are required to immediately report and accept the supervision and guidance from 
judicial administrative organs. Collective cases are reportedly linked to land requisitioning, 
levying of taxes, building demolitions, forced evictions, migrants&#8217; enclaves, enterprise 
transformation, environmental pollution and rural laborers. According to the guidelines, only 
&#8220;politically qualified&#8221; lawyers are allowed to deal with these kinds of cases and before accepting 
them, they need the approval of at least three law firm partners. In addition, the guidelines 
allegedly warn lawyers to not encourage their clients to participate, or participate themselves in 
petitions before Government offices and not to contact foreign media. Lawyers who violate the 
rules face sanctions. Besides, it is alleged that more restrictive regulations have been issued by 
local public authorities. These regulations are generally called &#8220;Opinions on strengthening the 
guidance of lawyers handling major and collective cases&#8221; and reportedly limit lawyer&#8217;s freedom 
of expression, because they are not allowed to talk to the media about their views on collective 
and sensitive cases. It is also reported that several procedural obstacles are preventing lawyers 
from performing their duties, in particular conducting investigations and gathering evidence. 
Lawyers are compelled, inter alia, to request an authorization to the investigative organ to meet 
their clients in prison and reportedly face restrictions on photocopying and recording case 
materials, necessary for the defense work. Besides, in order to carry out their work lawyers 
reportedly often need to pay to officials and judges &#8220;file retrieval fees&#8221;, &#8220;services fees&#8221; and fees 
for referrals from judges. Furthermore, it has been reported that the national lawyer&#8217;s association 
ACLA is not independent, since its Secretary General is also the Deputy Director of the division 
in charge of lawyers and notary publics in the Ministry of Justice. Finally, it is alleged that some 
lawyers are being harassed by authorities, because of their professional activities as legal 
representatives. Lawyers allegedly have no system of immunity linked to their professional 
activity. They are assimilated to their clients and like the suspects they defend, they are allegedly 
often held in prolonged pretrial detention and have difficulty meeting with their own lawyers. 
When released, they and their families may be subjected to intimidation by the authorities. One 
of the consequences of this situation would be that some defendants may have been unable to 
find a lawyer willing to take their case because of its sensitive nature.  
</p>
<p>76. In this context, the mandate holders brought to the Government&#8217;s attention some cases of 
lawyers who have been allegedly victims of intimidation and harassment. According to the 
information received, Mr. Yang Maodong, a lawyer in charge of human rights cases, also known 
as Guo Feixiong, who was the subject of previous communication by the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, dated 6 March 2006, was detained on 2 August 2006 after 
four days of &#8220;disappearance&#8221; following a protest outside the Xinhuamen Gate to the central 
Government residential compound in Beijing. On 9 August 2006, he was reportedly beaten by </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>the train police and then taken to Shaoguan, Guangdong Province, where he was detained 
overnight. On 10 August 2006, he was allegedly forcibly sent back home in Guangzhou, after 
being accused by the police of holding a fake train ticket. 
</p>
<p>77. On 18 August 2006, the police announced that Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a well known human 
rights lawyer, was arrested &#8220;for suspect involvement in criminal activities&#8221;. Mr. Gao Zhisheng 
was already the subject of three previously transmitted communications by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders dated 25 November 2005, 
21 December 2005 and 22 August 2006. In response to his arrest, dozens of persons have signed 
a petition asking for his release. Several of them have been reportedly put under house arrest, as 
well as his wife and two children who allegedly are under permanent surveillance and have been 
harassed by numerous female police officers based in front of their home. 
</p>
<p>78. On 19 August 2006, the trial of Chen Guangcheng, a well-known human rights lawyers in 
Linyi, took place. Shandong province of China, who has been instrumental in highlighting 
human rights violations committed in the course of the implementation of the one-child per 
couple policy, reportedly took place without the presence of his legal team, because all of them 
have been either detained by the police or denied access to the court. On 24 August 2006, he was 
sentenced to four years and three months in prison. Moreover, two other lawyers associated with 
Mr. Chen&#8217;s case, Yan Zaixin and Zhang Jiankang have been reportedly harassed and forcibly 
returned to their home. Chen Guangcheng was already the subject of several communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and other 
mandate-holders on 14 July 2006, 7 April 2006, 31 October 2005 and 19 September 2005. 
</p>
<p>79. On 27 June 2006, Li Jinsong resigned as Chen Guancheng&#8217;s chief Counsel after reportedly 
being attacked by 20 men who overturned his car while he was inside. On 19 August 2006, 
Mr. Jinsong and another defense lawyer working on Chen Guancheng&#8217;s case, Zhang Lihui, were 
allegedly denied access to the trial. They were allegedly surrounded by the police after dinner the 
night before the trial. They were allegedly detained without charged and then released. 
Xu Zhiyong, who replaced Li Jinsong in defending Chen Guancheng, was allegedly beaten 
and taken into police custody by unidentified men on 18 August 2006, the day before Chen&#8217;s 
trial began. They were released 22 hours later, after Chen&#8217;s trial had already ended. 
Mr. Zheng Enchong, a lawyer who deals with human rights cases, served three years in prison 
for &#8220;leaking State secrets abroad&#8221; after he contacted an overseas human rights group about 
illegal forced evictions in Shanghai. Released in June 2006, he has since been reportedly under 
virtual house arrest and is allegedly being constantly monitored and harassed by the police. 
Mr. Zheng Enchong was the subject of two urgent appeals sent by Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and other 
special procedures mandate holders on 16 March 2004 and 20 July 2006. Li Baiguang was 
detained on 14 December 2004, allegedly because he provided legal representation to 
approximately 100,000 peasants seeking damages for forced land evictions. It is reported that 
since his release he has been detained and physically attacked several times. Ma Guanjun, who 
represented a rape suspect in 2003, was detained and accused of &#8220;obstructing justice&#8221;. It is </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>alleged that at the trial he produced seven witnesses who testified in favour of his client, but that 
during the trial recess, local police officers questioned the witnesses. The result was that 
witnesses changed their testimonies. According to the information received, at the retrial, the 
witnesses said in their testimonies that the suspect could not have committed the rape, however 
police officers interrogated them and once again they changed their testimonies. Afterwards, 
Ma Guanjun was convicted of violating article 306 of the Criminal Code. He served 210 days in 
prison until a lawyer&#8217;s association launched an investigation on his case which lead to his release 
in March 2004. 
</p>
<p>80. On 19 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, on the secret trial and 
execution of Mr. Chen Tao, a Sichuan farmer found guilty of killing a policeman during a 
demonstration. According to the reports we have received, Mr. Chen Tao and three other 
protesters were arrested in 2004 after mass protests against a hydropower plant project in 
Sichuan province. The protesters had clashed with police, and a riot-control policeman was 
killed. The four men were tried behind closed doors in June 2006; Mr. Chen on the charge of 
&#8220;deliberately killing&#8221; the policeman. Their lawyers were not informed of the trial (in fact, they 
learned of the trial and the sentences inflicted on 4 December 2006, when the lawyer of a 
co-defendant received the sentence sheet), nor were the families notified. Mr. Chen was 
sentenced to death, the other three defendants to prison terms. On 20 November 2006, 
Mr. Chen Tao&#8217;s father, Mr. Chen Yongzhong, received a court notice asking him to claim the 
ashes of his son and to pay 50 Yuan for the bullet. Mr. Chen Yongzhong declined, arguing that 
he could not be sure whether the ashes would actually be his son&#8217;s. 
</p>
<p>81. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, regarding Ms. Mao Hengfeng, a 
well-known petitioner against family planning policies and forced evictions in Shanghai 
since 1989. Ms. Mao Hengfeng was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture together with the Special Representative to the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 9 June 2005. According to 
information received, on 16 April 2007, Ms. Mao Hengfeng was informed by the Municipal 
No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in Shanghai that her original sentence of two and half years 
was to be upheld. The court session lasted 10 minutes during which time the judgement was read 
out. Neither Ms. Mao Hengfeng nor her lawyer was authorized to present an argument in her 
defence and only family members were allowed to attend the hearing. On 12 January 2007, 
Ms. Mao Hengfeng was sentenced to two and a half years in prison by Shanghai Yangpu District 
Court for allegedly damaging hotel property whilst in detention by Shanghai&#8217;s Yangpu Public 
Security Bureau at a guest house in Beijing. It was alleged that Ms. Mao Hengfeng had broken 
two table lamps in the guesthouse and she was subsequently arrested on 30 June 2006 on charges 
of &#8216;intentionally destroying property&#8217;. During the trial Ms. Mao Hengfeng was prevented by 
prison guards, from verbally protesting against the mistreatment and abuse which she was 
subjected to whilst in detention. According to reports, prior to her trial on 16 April 
Ms. Mao Hengfeng was detained in a small cell in which the floor was covered with excrement 
with the smell preventing her from sleeping. Reports also claim that prison guards had covered 
the only window in the cell. Ms. Mao Hengfeng&#8217;s current conditions of detention are unknown.  </p>

<p>82. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights, in 
relation to Mr. Liu Dehuo, Mr. Cui Yongfa, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, Mr. Chen Ningbiao, 
Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia and Mr. Guo Jianhua, human rights defenders working to 
protect their land from forced annexation. According to the information received: on 
10 April 2007, the District Court of Sanshan, in Nanhai County, Guangdong province sentenced 
Mr. Dehuo, Mr. Ningbiao and Mr. Zhibiao to four years in prison, Mr. Yongfa, Mr. Xixia and 
Mr. Jianhua received a sentence of three years and six months, whilst Ms. Xiaobing was 
sentenced to two years and six months in prison. They we are all charged with illegally 
obstructing an approved construction project in Sanshan District. Upon hearing the verdict all of 
the defendants announced that they would appeal the sentence. According to reports, the seven 
defendants were detained by Nanhai police in June 2006 and have been in detention since then. 
They were charged with extortion and blackmailing the Yingshun Tank Farm, a gas and 
petrochemical company, which had reportedly taken over 1 hectare of land in Sanshan without 
official approval for use as a construction site. The company was reportedly requested by 
villagers to hand over 50,000-yuan to compensate them or the plan to develop a construction 
site on the land would be exposed. However the company filed a complaint for blackmail 
against the defendants before making any payment. Mr. Liu Dehuo, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, 
Mr. Chen Ningbiao, Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia and Mr. Guo Jianhua were tried on 
6 December 2006 without legal counsel. Mr. Yongfa&#8217;s wife acted as his legal representative. 
Concern is expressed that the aforementioned events form part of an ongoing campaign against 
human rights defenders in China. Concern is also expressed at reports that Mr. Liu Dehuo, 
Mr. Cui Yongfa, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, Mr. Chen Ningbiao, Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia 
and Mr. Guo Jianhua did not receive a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>83. On 27 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, to information received regarding 
Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a human rights lawyer who was sentenced to four years and three months 
of imprisonment after taking legal action against Linyi City authorities for their practice of 
forcing women to have abortions in order to meet the national birth quotas. 
</p>
<p>84. On 28 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a 
human rights lawyer. According to the information received: On 22 September 2007, 
Mr. Gao Zhisheng was taken from his apartment in Beijing by plainclothes policemen. His 
whereabouts remain unknown and concern is expressed that he is being held incommunicado 
detention. Reportedly, Mr. Gao&#8217;s arrest is directly related to an open letter he sent to the 
United States Congress last week expressing his deep concerns over the worsening deterioration 
of human rights in China ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It has also been reported that prior 
to that letter, the police had threatened Mr. Gao with jail if he released any more open letters or 
statements.  
</p>
<p>85. On 3 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and counter terrorism, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, regarding the case of Mr. Husein Dzhelil, ethnic-Uighur of Canadian </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p>nationality. According to the allegations received on 19 April 2007, he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment for &#8220;plotting to split the country&#8221; and to 10 years of imprisonment for joining a 
&#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;. These sentences were the result of an unfair trial which was based on a 
confession extracted through torture. However, the High People&#8217;s Court of Xinjiang Uighur 
Autonomous Region (XUAR) denied Mr. Dzhelil&#8217;s appeal, assessing that the facts were clear, 
and that the evidence was reliable and adequate. Allegedly, during the trial, the court-appointed 
lawyer did not make any statements on behalf of Mr. Dzhelil.  
</p>
<p>86. On 5 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding Mr. Li Heping, a human rights lawyer practicing at the Gaobo Longhua law firm in 
Beijing. According to information received on 29 September 2007, at approximately 5.30 p.m., 
Mr. Li was abducted in the car park of the offices of his law firm by twelve men in civilian 
clothes. The men allegedly put a hood over his head and forced him into an unregistered car. 
After about an hour&#8217;s drive, the men stopped at an unknown location and took Mr. Li to a 
basement where they beat him and tortured him using electric rods. While torturing Mr. Li the 
men demanded him to promise to stop practicing law and leave Beijing. If he refused, they 
threatened him with systematic attacks. At approximately midnight, they drove Mr. Li to the 
woods at Xiao Tang Mountain in the suburbs of Beijing and left him there. Mr. Li managed to 
get a taxi to the Beijing hospital where he was treated for his injuries. Days prior to his abduction 
and assault, Mr. Li was reportedly approached by policemen from the National Security 
Protection Unit of the Beijing Public Security Bureau and instructed that he and his family were 
to leave Beijing. When Mr. Li refused to leave the city, the policemen proceeded to follow him, 
keeping him under constant surveillance. According to Mr. Li, the policemen who followed him 
witnessed his abduction as he had just talked to them. Upon his return home, Mr. Li discovered 
that his lawyer&#8217;s identification card as well as some other personal belongings had been taken. In 
addition, all of the files saved on his computer had been erased.  
</p>
<p>87. On 4 December 2007, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a 
joint urgent appeal regarding Mr. Li Guohong. Mr. Li Guohong is a representative of former 
workers of the Zhongyuan Oil Field. According to information received, on 31 October 2007, 
Mr. Li Guohong went to Puyang City, Henan Province, where the headquarters of the 
Zhongyuan Oil Field are located, in order to gain information with regard to a lawsuit being 
taken by dismissed workers against the oil field company. When Mr. Li Guohong went to 
Zhongyuan Oil Field Public Security Bureau (PSB) to investigate the detention of Zhongyuan 
Oil Field workers, he was placed in administrative detention for fifteen days. On 
16 November 2007, when he was due to be released, he was instead sent to a &#8220;Re-education 
Through Labor&#8221; (RTL) camp for one and a half years by the Zhongyuan Oil Field PSB. Since 
2001, the Zhongyuan Oil Field has reportedly unfairly carried out the dismissal of 10,000 
workers without providing them with adequate compensation. According to the regulations in 
place for RTL camps, there is no the right to have the decision ordering the transfer to such a 
camp be reviewed by a judicial body. 
</p><p>88. On 22 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
the situation of Mr. Li Jinsong and Mr. Li Fangping, who are lawyers of the detained </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>pro-democracy campaigner and HIV-Aids activist Mr. Hu Jia, who was the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the working group on arbitrary detention, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture, on 4 January 2008. According to the information received, On 10 January 2008, 
Mr. Li Jinsong was reportedly placed under house arrest for several hours in a Beijing hotel, 
after inviting foreign journalists to confirm that it was impossible for him to see Mr. Hu Jia&#8217;s 
wife, Ms. Zeng Jinyan. He is allegedly under surveillance by the police. According to reports, 
Mr. Hu Jia&#8217;s other lawyer, Mr. Li Fangping, was not detained but he was allegedly strongly 
urged not to try to approach Ms. Zeng Jinyan&#8217;s home. Previously, the authorities prevented them 
from visiting Mr. Hu in prison on 4 January on the grounds that the case had been classified as a 
&#8220;state secret&#8221;. Furthermore, foreign journalists and friends and relatives of Ms. Zeng Jinyan and 
her husband were reportedly prevented by police from visiting or communicating with her on 
11 January 2008. The police allegedly stated that it was because a &#8220;criminal investigation&#8221; was 
underway. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned arrest of Mr. Li Jinsong and the 
intimidation of Mr. Li Fangping may be directly related to their human rights activities, 
particularly their defence of Mr. Hu Jia. Further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Hu Jia while in detention, as well as that of the members of his 
family. 
</p>
<p>89. On 5 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, regarding Mr. Zheng Enchong, a 
human rights lawyer in Shanghai. Mr. Zheng Enchong had been the subject of three 
communications sent by mandate holders; an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions on 16 March 2004, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 20 July 2006, and an 
urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right 
to an adequate standard of living on 27 July 2007. According to new information received, on 
16 and 17 February 2008, Mr. Zheng Enchong was reportedly assaulted by police officers who 
were following him and his wife, Ms. Jiang Meili. Later on 17 February 2008, he was summoned 
to the police station and detained for over 12 hours, during which time he was beaten by 
unidentified men. The police reportedly questioned Mr. Zheng Enchong about legal aid he 
recently provided to petitioners and victims of land grabs. The questions also focused on an 
interview Mr. Zheng Enchong had given to the Epoch Times on 12 February 2008, in which he 
discussed the corruption case of Shanghai tycoon Mr. Zhou Zhengyi and the possible 
involvement of former Chinese Communist Party leader Mr. Huang Ju. On 19 February 2008, 
the interview to the Epoch Times was published and the following day, Mr. Zheng was again 
arrested. While in detention, he was once more beaten by an unidentified person, sustaining 
injuries as a result, before being released that evening. 
</p><p>90. On 13 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders Mr. Teng Biao and Mr. Li Heping. Both of the aforementioned are human rights </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 49 
 
</p>
<p>lawyers. Mr. Teng Biao was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by several experts on 
21 December 2006. Mr. Li Heping was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 5 October 2007. According to 
information received, on the night of 6 March 2008, Mr. Teng Biao was reportedly abducted 
from outside his home. Neighbours reported seeing Mr. Teng Biao being put into an unmarked 
black car. No information on Mr. Teng Biao&#8217;s whereabouts is available. Reports received also 
indicate that, on 7 March 2008, an unmarked car crashed into Mr. Li Heping while he was 
driving his son to school. It as also reported that there were three people in the unmarked car, 
who may belong to a group reportedly following Mr. Li Heping since January 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>91. On 12 February 2007, the Government responded to the joint urgent appeal of 30 
November 2006, regarding Gao Zhisheng, male, aged 42, born 20 April 1964, ethnic Han 
Chinese, lower-level university education, resident in room No. 202, unit 7, building No. 11 in 
Xiaoguan Beili, Chaoyang district, Beijing, prior to his arrest a lawyer with the Zhisheng law 
firm in Beijing. On 15 August 2006, Gao was placed under investigation by the Beijing public 
security authorities, in accordance with the law, on suspicion of the commission of a criminal 
offence, and, on 21 September, his arrest warrant was approved by the procurator&#8217;s office. 
Beijing people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office No. 1 laid charges against Gao for the offence of fomenting 
subversion of the authority of the State and instituted proceedings against him with Beijing 
people&#8217;s intermediate court No. 1. Beijing people&#8217;s intermediate court No. 1 determined, 
following its consideration of the case in open proceedings, that: from December 2005 to 
May 2006, Gao had composed and published on websites such as &#8220;dajiyuan.com&#8221;, 
&#8220;kanzhongguo.com&#8221; and others, nine articles with such titles as &#8220;Three open letters from 
Gao Zhisheng to Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao&#8221; and &#8220;This administration never stops killing 
people&#8221;. In these articles, Gao engages in rumour mongering and slander, vilifying the current 
Chinese State political and social system and inciting his readers to overthrow the authority of 
the State. At the same time, on 10 separate occasions, both from his home and in other places, 
Gao had given interviews to foreign media, such as &#8220;Radio Free Asia&#8221;, &#8220;Voice of Hope&#8221;, and 
other outlets, which held discussions with him and recorded his incitements to subvert the 
authority of the State. Those had been recorded by the foreign media as audio files and placed on 
their websites, for other people to listen to or download. For the offence of incitement to 
subversion of the authority of the State, he was sentenced to three years&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment, to be suspended for five years, and stripped of his political rights for one year. 
After the court handed down its judgement at first instance, Gao declared himself willing to 
accept the verdict and did not lodge an appeal. The judgement has since become enforceable. In 
the course of the proceedings against Gao on the charge of incitement to subversion of the 
authority of the State, the public security authorities fully upheld his rights in litigation and those 
of his family and conducted the proceedings in strict compliance with the law, applying the law 
in a civilized manner. Three days before proceedings opened in this case, the court of first 
instance, in accordance with the stipulation of the law, notified the procurator&#8217;s office and the 
defence counsel and published in advance the dates and venue of the trial. When the court 
rendered its judgement, Gao&#8217;s family were present in the public gallery. When serving papers on 
Gao, the court expressly informed him of his rights in litigation to appoint a lawyer to conduct 
his defence. Gao indicated that, as he was himself a lawyer, he did not need to assign a lawyer to 
conduct his defence and he did not agree to his family appointing a lawyer for him. For that </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p>reason, the lawyers Mo Shaoping and Ding Xikui, from the Mo Shaoping law firm in Beijing, 
appointed by his brother Gao Zhiyi, were unable to act in his defence. Under these 
circumstances, the court decided, in order to ensure that Gao&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully 
upheld, that it should still appoint two lawyers to defend him, Qian Lieyang, from the Tianda law 
firm in Beijing (which goes by the English name &#8220;East Associates&#8221;), and Yang Xiaohong, from 
the Chao Yang law firm in Beijing, and Gao agreed to this appointment. In the course of the trial, 
in addition to conducting his own defence, Gao also received full defence services from his two 
defence lawyers. The allegations in the letter that we have received that the police harassed 
Gao&#8217;s family members and others are unfounded.  
</p>
<p>92. On 14 February 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 21 December 2006 (A/HRC/4/25/Add.1), regarding Chen Guangcheng, male, born 
November 1971, ethnic Han Chinese, technical college graduate, blind, resident of Dongshigu 
village, Shuanghou township, Yinan county, Shandong province. In the evening of 
5 February 2006, because he was unhappy with the work of poverty alleviation officials sent to 
his village, guided by his wife Yuan Weijing and others, he stormed into the offices of the 
Dongshigu village committee in Shuanghou township, Yinan County, and started smashing the 
glass panes in the doors and windows. Shortly after this, upon returning to Chen Guangyu&#8217;s 
home in his village, he called on Chen Guanghe, Chen Guangdong, Chen Gengjiang and other 
villagers and urged them to go and smash up police cars in service at the Yinan county police 
station and minibuses belonging to the Shuanghou township local authority. Chen Guanghe, 
Chen Guangdong and their associates went round the village, shouting and urging people to go 
and smash up cars, set on local officials, chasing them to the municipal offices, and then charged 
across to the east end of the village, bearing wooden clubs, rocks and other implements, and 
proceeded to smash the windows in three police cars belonging to the Shuanghou police station, 
rolled these vehicles over into the roadside ditch, and then set about attacking and beating up 
police officers on duty at the Yinan county public security bureau. In the evening of 
11 March 2006, Chen Guangyu, who had been drinking, claimed to have been beaten up in 
Dongshgu village and burst into the offices of the local village committee, where he started 
smashing office property. Claiming to be seeking an explanation for Chen Guangyu&#8217;s beating, 
Chen Guangcheng seized the opportunity to gather together Chen Guangyu, Chen Guangjun, 
Yuan Weijing and others and, at 6 p.m. that same evening, they charged over to the Yinghou 
village section of State highway 205, where they proceeded to block the movement of traffic. 
First Chen Guangcheng took up a position in the middle of the road and stopped the traffic, then 
he directed Chen Guangjun, Chen Guangyu and the others to stand and shout in the middle of the 
road and to block the passage of all vehicles. Police officers from the public security bureau 
arrived on the scene to direct the traffic and instructed Chen Guangcheng to halt what he was 
doing, namely, urging a crowd of people to block the passage of vehicles. Chen Guangcheng 
totally ignored their instructions and continued calling on Chen Guangjun, Chen Guangyu and 
the others to block the traffic. This had the consequence that more than 290 motor vehicles, 
including ambulances attending to pregnancy and childbirth emergencies, were unable to move 
and that a section of State highway 205 was blocked for a period of three hours. On 
10 June 2006, Chen was arrested, in accordance with the law, by the Yinan county public 
security bureau in Shandong province on suspicion of the offences of wilful damage to property 
and assembling a mob to disrupt the flow of traffic and, on 21 June, he was taken into custody 
with the approval of the procuratorial authorities. After his case had been referred to the Yinan 
county people&#8217;s court, Chen&#8217;s wife assigned as his defence counsel the lawyers Li Jinsong, from </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p>the Yitong law firm in Beijing, and Zhang Lihui, from the Beijing office of the Xingyun law 
firm, also known as the &#8220;Astrorhyme&#8221; law firm, based in Zhejiang province. Before the 
proceedings opened at first instance, Chen requested the replacement of his defence lawyers by 
one Xu Zhiyong, a lecturer at the State Posts and Telecommunications College. In accordance 
with the provisions of the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, only a lawyer, person 
recommended by a civic organization or the defendant&#8217;s or suspect&#8217;s work unit and duly 
nominated by him or her, or the defendant&#8217;s or suspect&#8217;s legal guardian or close relative or 
friend, may act in his or her defence. Xu Zhiyong, however, only had his office pass and 
personal identity document and was unable to produce any official letter of introduction or other 
credentials; the court had no means of verifying his identity or his relationship to Chen and for 
that reason was unable to approve his attorneyship. The court appointed Li Jiasheng, a lawyer 
from the Yangdu law firm in Shandong, and Zhu Baolun, a lawyer from the Shandong 
Tonglixing State law office, as defence counsel for Chen, but Chen refused their services. On 
19 August 2006, the Yinan county people&#8217;s court, meeting at first instance, found Chen guilty of 
the offence of causing wilful damage to property and sentenced him to seven months&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment; it also found him guilty of the offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow of 
traffic and sentenced him to serve four years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment; the court decided that he 
should serve a combined sentence of four years and three months&#8217; fixed term imprisonment. 
Following his sentencing at first instance, Chen refused to accept the court&#8217;s verdict and lodged 
an appeal. The Linyi city people&#8217;s high court in Shandong province, meeting at second instance, 
found that the court of first instance had restricted Chen&#8217;s right to defence (the assigned defence 
counsel had not been accepted by Chen), a factor which might have adversely influenced the 
fairness of the proceedings, and, on 31 October 2006, it quashed the original judgement and sent 
the case back to the court of first instance for retrial. The allegations in the letter that we have 
received that the case was sent back to the original court because there had been insufficient 
evidence to convict Chen Guangcheng for the offence of gathering a mob to disrupt the flow of 
traffic are unfounded. On 27 November 2006, sitting at a reconstituted bench, the Yinan county 
people&#8217;s court reopened the case in open proceedings, Chen&#8217;s brother attended the court in the 
public gallery, and Chen&#8217;s defence was conducted by the lawyers Li Fangping from the Beijing 
Ruifeng law firm and Li Jinsong from the Beijing Yitong law firm. During the proceedings, 
Chen&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully upheld: he exercised his own rights to defence and the 
lawyers appointed by him also made submissions in his defence. On 1 December 2006 the court 
ruled at first instance and made public its verdict: for the offence of wilful damage to property, it 
sentenced Chen to seven months&#8217; fixed term imprisonment and, for the offence of gathering a 
mob to disrupt the flow of traffic, it sentenced him to four years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment, ruling 
that he should serve a combined term of four years and three months. After sentencing at first 
instance, Chen refused to accept the court&#8217;s verdict and once again lodged an appeal. As the 
original court judgement had been based on clear facts, the conviction had been correct, the 
sentence had been commensurate with the offence and the trial proceedings had followed due 
process, the court dismissed the appeal and ruled that the original judgement should stand. This 
ruling was published on 12 January 2007. During the proceedings at second instance, the court 
also heard the views of Chen&#8217;s defence counsel and, in accordance with the applicable evidence, 
found that the facts set out in the accusation by the procuratorial authorities and the charges 
brought against the defendant were sound and accordingly handed down the judgement referred 
to above. With regard to the allegations in the letter which we have received to the effect that, on 
30 October 2005, Chen&#8217;s lawyers endeavoured to lay charges with the Yinan county court 
against public security officials from Shuanghou township for having caused intentional bodily </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>harm to Chen, but that the court ignored this suit, it is our understanding that the Yinan county 
court did indeed receive an application from the lawyers to bring charges, but because the 
lawyers did not have Chen&#8217;s power of attorney, following an investigation the court determined 
that the lawyers were not authorized to act for the plaintiff and rejected the application. With 
regard to the allegations in the letter to the effect that Li Jinsong and Li Fangping filed an 
administrative and civil action with the Linyi city intermediate people&#8217;s court against the Linyi 
city public security bureau (including the bureau chief, Liu Jie) and other Government agencies, 
it is our understanding that the court did indeed receive such an application from the lawyers, in 
December 2006, which had been sent by expedited mail service, and that the matter is currently 
being investigated and no conclusion has been reached as yet. The allegations in the letter that 
public security officials have been harassing members of Chen&#8217;s family, his lawyers and other 
persons are entirely without substance. 
</p>
<p>93. On 26 February 2007, the Government replied to joint allegation letter  
of 1 December 2006 (A/HRC/4/25/Add.1), explaining that the received allegation letter 
stating that the Chinese Criminal Code and the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure have been 
misused by authorities in order to undermine lawyers&#8217; defence and that there are procedural 
obstacles to the exercise by lawyers of their profession, especially with regard to the gathering of 
evidence and conduct of investigations, have no substance in fact. The Constitution of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China expressly stipulates that defendants have the right to defence; the 
Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of 
Administrative Procedure set out specific provisions on all aspects of the right of lawyers to 
engage in litigation; the Lawyers Act gives detailed provisions on all aspects of the lawyers&#8217; 
right to exercise their profession; the People&#8217;s Supreme Court, the People&#8217;s Supreme 
Procuratorate and other bodies have also issued various normative instruments guaranteeing the 
right of lawyers to exercise their profession, which set out special provisions on the participation 
of lawyers in criminal proceedings, clearly stipulate what is meant, in the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, by the term &#8220;cases involving State secrets&#8221;, and also set out clear provisions 
guaranteeing, in criminal proceedings, the right of lawyers, in accordance with the law, to meet 
their clients, to have access to files, to conduct investigations, to obtain evidence and to conduct 
other procedures, thus providing effective guarantees of the right of lawyers fully to exercise 
their profession. In the performance of their professional services, effective safeguards are 
provided to lawyers, and in this way the development of a State democratic legal system is 
effectively promoted. Regarding the &#8220;Guiding Views on the Conduct of Class Actions by 
Lawyers&#8221;, issued by the All China Lawyers&#8217; Association. The All-China Lawyers&#8217; Association, 
in its capacity as the organization overseeing self discipline in the legal profession, issued its 
&#8220;Guiding Views on the Conduct of Class Actions by Lawyers&#8221; (hereinunder referred to as the 
&#8220;Guiding Views&#8221;), putting forward suggestions and setting out requirements on issues meriting 
particular attention by lawyers conducting class actions. The Guiding Views are designed to 
support and guide lawyers in enhancing their conduct of class actions, to promote the work of 
lawyers in resolving social conflicts and disputes, from the standpoint of a more extensive 
defence of the lawful rights and interests of parties to legal proceedings, and to help all parties to 
disputes to settle their conflicts and disputes in a lawful, appropriate, peaceful and sensible 
manner. They serve both as a standard for, and means of ensuring oversight of, lawyers&#8217; 
professional activities, and also as a safeguard for lawyers&#8217; professional rights and interests. At 
the same time, they provide a tangible manifestation of the endeavour by lawyers to ensure self-
discipline in their profession, and also reflect a wide range of lawyers&#8217; views and aspirations. </p>

<p>The Government Yang Maodong, male, born August 1966, resident of Gucheng County in 
Hubei province, non-practising lawyer. In January 2006, the Guangdong province public security 
authorities learned that Yang, who in 2001 in Guangzhou had unlawfully published a book 
entitled Political Upheaval in Shenyang, as a special 2001 issue of the Chinese legal journal Fal&#252; 
Zongheng, was the prime culprit in a case involving the operation of an unlawful business under 
investigation by the Liaoning public security authorities and was currently on the run. Following 
a thorough investigation, conclusive evidence was gathered against him. In September 2006, the 
Guangzhou public security authorities, working together with the department responsible for 
comprehensive enforcement of administrative law in cultural activities, launched its city-wide 
programme to counter pirated publications. In the course of this undertaking it apprehended 
Yang Maodong, who, in collusion with Jiang Wei, Zhang Zhitao and others, had set up a 
counterfeit publication outfit, misappropriating lawful publications and publication numbers, and 
illegally publishing, printing and distributing more than 20,000 separate books and pamphlets. 
On 14 September 2006, the Guangzhou province public security authorities, acting in accordance 
with the law, took Yang into criminal detention on suspicion of the offence of operating an 
illegal business, on 28 September his arrest warrant was approved by the procuratorial 
authorities and his case is currently in progress. Zheng Enchong, male, born in September 1950, 
ethnic Han Chinese, resident of Shanghai, formerly a lawyer with the Siwei law firm in 
Shanghai. On 7 March 2001, Zheng on his own initiative terminated his employment with the 
Siwei law firm and formally arranged to be relieved of his functions. Since he has not submitted 
any application to resume his professional functions, he is no longer entitled to practise as a 
lawyer. On 28 October 2003, because he had committed the offence of providing State secrets 
abroad, Zheng was sentenced by Shanghai city people&#8217;s intermediate court No. 2 to three years&#8217; 
fixed term imprisonment and stripped of his political rights for one year. On 5 June 2006 he was 
released on completion of his sentence. Li Baiguang, male, born 1968, resident of Beijing, 
formerly head of the legal centre (as a non-practising lawyer) of Modern Civilization Pictorial, 
published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, currently unemployed. In December 
2004, Li was arrested by the Fujian province public security authorities, in accordance with the 
law, on suspicion of the offence of fraud; in January 2005 he was released on his own 
recognizance with restricted freedom of movement pending trial and in January 2006, the 
restriction order against him was lifted. The public security authorities are not currently applying 
any measures against Li. There does not appear to be any lawyer by the name of Ma Guanjun, as 
mentioned in the letter that we have received. Following a verification of the circumstances in 
question, it would appear that the person intended is Ma Guangjun, a lawyer from the Songyuan 
law office in Inner Mongolia. In December 2002, Ma took on the responsibility of representing a 
suspect, Xu Wensheng, in a rape case. On 22 August 2003, the Ningcheng county procuratorial 
office took Ma into custody on suspicion, as the counsel for the defence, of the offence of 
interfering with the giving of testimony and, on 5 January 2004, instituted proceedings against 
him with the courts. On 10 March, the Ningcheng county people&#8217;s court tried Ma on the charge 
of interfering with the giving of testimony and found him not guilty. On 23 March, the 
Ningcheng procurator&#8217;s office challenged the court&#8217;s verdict. On 24 May, the Chifeng city 
intermediate people&#8217;s court delivered its final ruling in the case: the challenge was dismissed and 
the original judgement stood. Ma was acquitted of the charges against him. 
</p><p>94. On 6 April 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 19 January 2007, 
stating that Chen Tao, male, born 20 February 1985, ethnic Han Chinese, from Hanyuan county 
in Sichuan province, lower secondary education, farmer, residential address: unit 2, Maiping </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>village, Dashu township, Hanyuan county. For commission of the offences of wilful homicide 
and malicious damage to property he was sentenced to death and stripped of his political rights 
in perpetuity and, on 16 November 2006, he was executed. The three other persons referred to in 
the communication that we have received are Cai Zhao, Liu Yong and Wang Xiujiao, all farmers 
in Dashu Township, Hanyuan County in Sichuan province, who have all received sentences. The 
Pubugou hydroelectric station on the Dadu River, which is situated in Hanyuan county, Ya&#8217;an 
municipality, in Sichuan province, on the boundary with Ganluo County in Liangshan prefecture, 
is a State priority construction project. On 3 November 2004, a number of the persons being 
relocated from the area of the hydroelectric dam in Hanyuan County decided that the 
compensation being paid to them was insufficient, and gathered at the power station to stage a 
sit-in, with a view to obstructing work on the dam. At noon that same day, Cai Zhao, Chen Tao, 
Liu Yong and Wang Xiujiao, bearing twisted iron bars and kitchen choppers, set off in pursuit of 
the armed police and public security officers who were on duty. After catching Zhang Zhiming, a 
police officer from the anti-riot squad of the Xichang city public security bureau, Cai Zhao 
struck him violently on the head with an iron bar and knocked him to the ground, whereupon 
Chen Tao, Liu Yong and Wang Xiujiao joined Cai Zhao in attacking Zhang Zhiming with iron 
bars, pounding him with rocks, kicking him and injuring him in other ways, fracturing his skull 
and causing loss of blood. They finally left when Zhang&#8217;s life was hanging by a thread. Cai 
Zhao, Chen Tao and the others then attacked a passenger coach of the Emei make, parked at that 
spot, with the registration number W16995. Chen Tao set fire to the seats of the coach, which 
was then completely destroyed in the flames. After this, Chen Tao noticed another policeman 
trying to rescue Zhang Zhiming, lying on the ground, so he rushed at him, brandishing his 
kitchen chopper, and chased him away. He then turned back to Zhang Zhiming and slashed at 
him three times, kicked him ferociously with both feet, and then left. Zhang Zhiming was rushed 
to hospital but efforts to save his life proved unavailing and he died. According to the forensic 
examination, Zhang Zhiming&#8217;s death was caused by repeated blows to his head, chest and back 
with a heavy, club-like and irregularly shaped blunt instrument, which fractured his skull causing 
fatal craniocerebral injuries and led to closed hematopneumothorax. On 5 November 2004, the 
co-defendants Cai Zhao and Wang Xiujiao again gathered a mob to attack the Yayuan guest 
house, a public facility jointly operated by the provincial and city headquarters. After committing 
this offence, Chen Tao was apprehended and brought to justice. In June 2005, the Sichuan Ya&#8217;an 
city people&#8217;s intermediate court passed judgement, sentencing Chen Tao to death for the offence 
of wilful homicide and to deprivation of his political rights in perpetuity; for the offence of 
causing malicious damage to property it sentenced him to three years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment, 
and ruled that the death sentence was to be carried out and that he was to be stripped of his 
political rights in perpetuity. After judgement was passed at first instance, Chen Tao refused to 
accept the court&#8217;s verdict and lodged an appeal, on the following grounds: there were 
discrepancies in the evidence confirmed in the judgement of first instance; Chen Tao had shown 
a good attitude in admitting his guilt; he had helped the investigation and solving of his case; and 
he had provided information which had led to the unmasking of other suspected offenders in the 
same case. Zhang Zhiming&#8217;s death had been due to head injuries, yet he himself had not struck 
Zhang in the region of the head, making his offence one of homicide by indirect intent; 
Zhang Zhiming&#8217;s death had been caused by a number of people, and Chen Tao had acted under 
instructions from others in committing his offence. Third, Chen Tao&#8217;s defence counsel, the 
lawyer Feng Yubin from the Yazhou law office in Sichuan, argued that, while Zhang Zhiming 
may have died from his head injuries, there was no conclusive evidence demonstrating that 
Chen Tao had caused this by striking him three times and that, at the proceedings at first </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p>instance, no weapons used in the offence had been exhibited. He called for clemency to be 
shown to his client. On 5 June 2006, the Sichuan provincial people&#8217;s high court handed down its 
definitive verdict, dismissing the appeal and ruling that the original judgement should stand. The 
court found that the co defendants Cai Zhao, Chen Tao, Liu Yong and Wang Xiujiao, motivated 
by dissatisfaction with the terms of the compensation awarded to people displaced by the 
Pubugou hydroelectric dam project and with the aim of obstructing work on the power station, 
had attacked armed public security police on duty at the site and, brandishing iron bars, kitchen 
choppers and lumps of rock, had attacked Zhang Zhiming, the public security policeman on duty 
at that spot, stabbing him and slashing at him, causing him fatal injuries, conduct which 
constituted the offence of wilful homicide, in aggravating circumstances and with severe 
consequences, an offence which, under law, had to be punished with severity. Chen Tao also set 
fire to a passenger coach, which was destroyed by fire, directly causing 50,901 yuan&#8217;s worth of 
damage, categorized as a very high level of damage, causing his conduct to constitute the offence 
of malicious damage to property. It decided, in Chen Tao&#8217;s case, to apply the principle of joinder 
of punishments for multiple offences. The grounds supporting Chen Tao&#8217;s appeal and the views 
put forward by his defence counsel did not tally with the facts ascertained in the investigation 
and the actual circumstances as demonstrated by the evidence, namely that Chen Tao and the 
others had kicked and attacked the deceased in the region of the head with blunt instruments, and 
were deemed to be untenable. As for the good attitude shown by Chen Tao in admitting his 
offence and his argument that Zhang Zhiming&#8217;s death had been caused by a number of people, 
these factors were insufficient to warrant a more lenient sentence. Accordingly, it was decided to 
uphold the verdict of first instance, handing down a combined punishment for wilful homicide 
and malicious damage to property, whereby Chen Tao should be sentenced to death and stripped 
of his political rights in perpetuity. In accordance with the notice of the People&#8217;s Supreme Court 
authorizing people&#8217;s high courts and military courts of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army to review 
and approve certain cases involving the death penalty, the Sichuan provincial people&#8217;s high court 
delivered its ruling that the death sentence should be carried out on Chen Tao and authorized the 
Ya&#8217;an people&#8217;s intermediate level court to pronounce the judgement on its behalf on 
17 November 2006. Statements in the communication to the effect that Chen Tao had been tried 
in secret and that his lawyers and family members were not notified of the trial and that, on 
20 November 2006, Chen Tao&#8217;s father, Chen Yongzhong, had received a court notice asking him 
to claim the ashes and had been asked to pay 50 yuan for the cost of his execution by shooting, 
are inconsistent with the facts. This case was tried at first instance by the Ya&#8217;an city people&#8217;s 
intermediate level court in Sichuan province, which, in accordance with the law, heard the 
proceedings in open court; the public prosecutor, the defendant and the expert witnesses all came 
to the court to attend the proceedings and members of the public were permitted to attend in the 
public gallery. After the proceedings at first instance, the defendant lodged an appeal. The 
Sichuan provincial people&#8217;s high court formed a collegiate bench to hear the case at second 
instance. In compliance with the provisions of article 187 of the Chinese Code of Criminal 
Procedure, the court of second instance, once it had gone over the case-files, questioned the 
defendants, heard the arguments of the defence counsel, found that the facts of the case were 
clear and ruled that proceedings in the case should proceed in closed court. After the proceedings 
at second instance had concluded, the Sichuan provincial people&#8217;s high court entrusted the Ya&#8217;an 
city people&#8217;s intermediate level court to pronounce the judgement on its behalf and transmitted 
to it the legal documents. The Ya&#8217;an city people&#8217;s intermediate level court, acting in accordance 
with the provisions of the law, three days prior to the passing of judgement, posted public notices 
and notified the family that they could visit the defendant. On 16 November 2006, the Ya&#8217;an city </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s intermediate level court, as part of the oversight proceedings conducted by the Ya&#8217;an 
city procurator&#8217;s office, asked him whether he had any last words or wished to write any letters. 
That evening, a meeting was arranged between Chen Tao and his father, Chen Yongzhong. On 
17 November 2006, the Ya&#8217;an city people&#8217;s intermediate level court, on behalf of the Sichuan 
provincial people&#8217;s high court, delivered a public reading of the judgement at second instance in 
one of its own trial chambers and proceeded to carry out the instruction to implement the death 
sentence: Chen Tao&#8217;s identity was verified and he was executed. Officials were assigned by the 
Ya&#8217;an city procurator&#8217;s office to attend the scene of the execution and to oversee the 
proceedings. Upon completion of the execution, the Ya&#8217;an city people&#8217;s intermediate court sent 
Chen Yongzhong, Chen Tao&#8217;s father, an official notice inviting him to collect his son&#8217;s ashes. 
On 4 December 2006, Chen Yongzhong called at the Ya&#8217;an city mortuary to collect Chen Tao&#8217;s 
ashes. During his legal proceedings at first and second instance, Chen Tao exercised his rights to 
defence in accordance with the law and received the services of a lawyer. During the proceedings 
at first instance, Chen Tao&#8217;s appointed defence counsel was the lawyer Zhou Dehua, from the 
Li Yuan law office in Sichuan; during the proceedings at second instance, the lawyer assigned to 
defend him by Chen Tao&#8217;s family was Feng Yubin, from the Yazhou law office in Sichuan. 
Throughout the proceedings, Chen Tao conducted his own defence and his defence lawyers also 
made defence submissions to the court on his behalf. Following their examination, the courts of 
both first and second instance found that Chen Tao&#8217;s defence - both his own exculpatory 
self-defence and the defence put forward by his defence counsel - was not consistent with the 
facts as demonstrated by the evidence and did not hold water; accordingly, they were unable to 
accept it. Under the provisions of articles 163 and 164 of the Chinese Code of Criminal 
Procedure, judgements must be pronounced in public and the written judgement must clearly 
indicate the time limit for appeal and the name of the court that will hear the appeal. When 
Chen Tao&#8217;s case was heard at first instance, the Ya&#8217;an city people&#8217;s intermediate court indicated 
in the written judgement and directly notified Chen Tao that, if he did not accept the verdict of 
the court of first instance, he could lodge an appeal, within a period of 10 days, with the Sichuan 
provincial people&#8217;s high court. Following pronouncement of the judgement, Chen Tao lodged an 
appeal. Acting on his behalf, Chen Tao&#8217;s family appointed a lawyer to conduct his defence in the 
proceedings at second instance. After reaching its final decision in the case, the court of second 
instance instructed the court of first instance to publish and to serve the judgement. Acting in 
accordance with the provisions of the law, the court of first instance posted public notices three 
days before pronouncing judgement, then arranged the reading of the judgement to Chen Tao in 
public and handed him a written copy of the judgement of the court of second instance. Before 
the sentence was carried out, Chen Tao&#8217;s family was informed and arrangements were made for 
Chen Tao&#8217;s father, Chen Yongzhong, to see his son. The proceedings in Chen&#8217;s case were in 
strict accordance with prescribed legal procedure and fully complied with the stipulations of 
Chinese law. 
</p>
<p>95. On 31 July 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter sent on 10 May 2007. The 
Government informed that the case of extortion brought against Chen Ningbiao and other 
persons, numbering seven in all, was considered by the Nanhai district people&#8217;s court in Foshan 
city, Guangdong province, and on 10 April 2007, in accordance with the law, the court rendered 
its judgement in criminal case Nan Xing Chu Zi (Nanhai criminal court of first instance) 
No. 1913. The court found that the facts of the case were as follows: At about 6 a.m. on 
16 May 2006, Liang Mingji, a driver employed by Fanghua elementary school in the Liwan 
district of Guangzhou city, was driving the school bus (registration Guangdong A24695), </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 57 
 
</p>
<p>transporting schoolchildren, when, at the Yidong Market intersection in the Sanshan area of 
Pingzhou, Guacheng neighbourhood, Nanhai district, he encountered Chen Ningbiao, sitting on 
his motorcycle, registration Y61470, and blocking the road. Liang sounded his horn and 
proceeded slowly forward, but Chen would not let him through, whereupon Liang brought his 
vehicle to a stop with a space of more than 10 centimetres between it and Chen&#8217;s motorcycle. 
Chen picked up a rock and use it to threaten Liang, preventing him from leaving, and, claiming 
that his motorcycle had been struck, demanded that Liang pay him 200 yuan compensation. 
When Liang refused to pay, Chen made telephone calls to Chen Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo and other 
residents of Sanshan village, totalling 10 in all, summoning them to his assistance. When 
Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo arrived at the scene, they saw that Chen Ningbiao&#8217;s motorcycle 
had sustained no damage, but the three men still gathered round the school bus and started 
making a commotion, pushing and shoving Liang Mingji and demanding that he pay the 
compensation, and also blocking the path of the traffic police who had come to investigate the 
incident. Following this, the owners of the bus, Zhao Jiandong and Zhao Jiannan, made their way 
to the scene, to find out what was going on. At this point, Chen Ningbiao let the air out of the 
bus&#8217;s tyres, to prevent it from proceeding into Sanshan, and threatened to smash it up, 
demanding 5,000 yuan in damages from the bus owners, while Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo 
noisily repeated his threats. Under duress, Zhao Jiandong and Zhao Jiannan agreed to pay 
3,500 yuan in compensation. On the suggestion of Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo, Chen Ningbiao 
used a false name, &#8220;Chen Yidong&#8221;, on the receipt slip. The plot of land situated in the area called 
&#8220;Meichong&#8221; in Pingzhounan village on Guacheng Street in the Nanhai district of Foshan city had 
been expropriated as State land on December 1997 by the Guangdong province cadastral office 
and was managed by the Nanhai district land resource centre. At a later date, because the land 
was not yet developed, it was allocated to the Nanhai farmer Li Bin for his use. In April 2006, 
Li Bin was granted permission to rent the piece of land to the Shunying fuel depot in Nanhai 
district. The general manager of the depot, Chen Zhujia, hired a digger to excavate a pond on the 
land for use as a fish farm. At about 9 a.m. on 20 May 2006, Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao, 
Cui Yongfa, Liu Dehuo, Guo Jianhua and other villagers from Sanshan, numbering more than 10 
in all, gathered at the fuel depot and started creating a disturbance, claiming that damage had 
been caused to the piece of land in &#8220;Meichong&#8221;, threatening to set fire to the digger and 
demanding compensation from the person who had rented it for the excavation of a fish-pond. 
The defendant Zhao Xiaobing then went up to a motor vehicle parked in front of the depot gates 
and threatened to let the air out of its tyres. Chen Zhujia was worried that the villagers might 
damage the fuel depot, so he pretended that the piece of land in question had been leased to 
someone else and undertook to go and call that person. All 10 and more of the defendants, 
Chen Ningbiao, Chen Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Guo Jianhua and the other villagers from Sanshan, 
forced their way on three separate occasions into the fuel depot and urged Chen Zhujia to go and 
fetch the person who had rented the land for use as a fish-farm. At about 3 p.m. that afternoon, 
Chen Zhujia realized that the safety of the fuel depot was under threat and was therefore 
constrained to try and find the depot&#8217;s legal adviser, Lin Jiaqing, and ask him to masquerade as 
the person who had rented the land for use as a fish farm and to enter into discussions with the 
villagers. Chen Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and other persons, claiming to be 
acting on behalf of the village, went up to Lin Jiaqing, standing on the embankment nearby, and 
demanded payment of damages. Basing the claim on the damage which Lin Jiaqing had 
allegedly caused to the plot of land, Liu Dehuo demanded that he pay 150,000 yuan in 
compensation. Chen Zhibiao and the other persons took up the same demands, but were met with 
refusal from Lin Jiaqing. Undeterred, Liu Duhuo, Cui Yongfa and the others, arguing that Lin </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>had allegedly signed an &#8220;illegal agreement&#8221;, demanded that he pay them at least 75,000 yuan. In 
the meantime, Shao Xiaobing and a group of villagers dragged over some water pipes which 
they found lying around in the vicinity and used them to block the main gate into the fuel depot. 
They then continued creating a disturbance, shouting and threatening. Chen Ningbiao and Guo 
Jianhua then joined the other villagers on the embankment, demanding payment of damages. 
Chen Zhujia realized what consequences all this might have for the safety of the fuel depot and 
its operation and, under duress, suggested to Lin Jiaqing that he pay 50,000 yuan in 
compensation. After Chen Zhibiao and the other persons had received the payment of 50,000 
yuan, the villagers present at the scene were each paid out an amount of 200 yuan by Shao Xixia. 
It has been ascertained in addition that, before this piece of land in &#8220;Meichong&#8221; was 
expropriated, it had been the property of the Nanshan village collective and none of the seven 
defendants belong to that village collective. The Nanhai district people&#8217;s court in Foshan city, 
Guangzhou province, determined that Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo had engaged 
in two acts of extortion, to an amount of 53,500 yuan; that the defendants Cui Yongfa, Shao 
Xixia, Guo Jianhua and Shao Xiaobing had engaged in one act of extortion, to an amount of 
50,000 yuan, and that the amounts obtained by extortion were substantial. In the course of jointly 
committing the offence of extorting money from the Shunying fuel depot, Chen Ningbiao, Chen 
Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and Shao Jianhua had played the main role and 
were therefore the primary culprits: they should be punished in a manner commensurate with the 
commission of the full offence; Shao Xiaobing had played a secondary role and was an 
accessory to the offence: in accordance with the law she should receive a lighter punishment. In 
accordance with the provisions of article 274, article 26, paragraphs 1, 3 and 4, and article 27 of 
the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, for the offence of extortion the defendants 
Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo were sentenced to four years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment, the defendants Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and Shao Jianhua were sentenced to 
three years&#8217; and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment and the defendant Shao Xiaobing received 
a sentence of two years&#8217; and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment. In the course of these 
proceedings, the court, acting in accordance with the law, informed the defendants of their right 
to receive the services of court-assigned defence lawyers or to appoint their own defence 
lawyers. Of the seven defendants in the case, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa and Shao Xiaobing 
separately appointed defence lawyers (Cui Yongfa appointed two defence lawyers). After being 
notified by the court as required by law, Zhang Jiankang and Wang Quanzhang, the lawyers 
appointed by Liu Dehuo and Cui Yongfa, respectively, still failed to appear in court. 
Huang Liuxiao, the other lawyer appointed by Cui Yongfa, and Zhu Daohua, the lawyer 
appointed by Shao Xiaobing, did appear in court and participated in the proceedings. The other 
defendants did not appoint their own defence lawyers but, in court, in accordance with the law, 
all fully exercised their right to conduct their own defence. Article 34 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure of the People&#8217;s Republic of China stipulates as follows: &#8220;In the event that the 
defendant is blind, deaf or mute or is a minor, and has not appointed a defence lawyer&#8221; or &#8220;may 
incur the death penalty and has not appointed a defence lawyer, the people&#8217;s court shall 
designate a lawyer, who shall be duty-bound to provide legal assistance in that person&#8217;s 
defence&#8221;. The above named defendants did not fall into the categories specified as necessitating 
the appointment or assignment by the court of defence lawyers. After the Nanhai district 
people&#8217;s court in Foshan city, Guangdong province, had passed sentence at first instance, the 
seven defendants lodged appeals within the time limit set by law. The case is currently being 
heard at second instance by Foshan city people&#8217;s intermediate court in Guangdong province. </p>

<p>96. On 12 December 2007, the Government replied the joint urgent appeal sent 
on 28 September 2007. The Government informed that Mr. Gao Zhisheng recently left Beijing to 
travel abroad to visit relatives on family business and he has been able to move freely and to 
communicate by letter without any impediment. The allegations in the communication which we 
have received to the effect that, because of an open letter which he sent, he has been taken from 
his home and is being held in incommunicado detention are not consistent with the facts.  
</p>
<p>97. On 13 February 2008, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent 
on 4 December 2007. At the time this report was finalized, this reply of the Government has not 
been translated.

</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its cooperation and its 
detailed responses to several of his communications, which indicates the Government&#8217;s 
continuous willingness to cooperate with the mandate. The Special Rapporteur is, however, 
concerned at the absence of reply to its communications of 10 May 2007 (joint allegation letter 
with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, concerning 
Mao Hengfeng), 27 July 2007 and 22 January 2008. He looks forward to receiving the remaining 
responses.  
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets that at time of finalizing the report, a number of 
replies still remain to be translated. This has made it impossible for him to make appropriate 
follow-up. However, in the light of the responses received, the Special Rapporteur notes with 
concern the important number of communications that had to be addressed to the Government of 
China in 2007 and three first months of 2008, which confirms the trend already noted in 2005 
and 2006. He reiterates his concern in relation to the lack of guarantees for lawyers to perform 
their professional duties without risking prosecution, including of a criminal nature. He is also 
particularly concerned about the responses given by the Government on the cases related to 
harassment of lawyers by security officials, because they are often limited to a simple denial of 
the facts, without explaining the measures taken to investigate such harassments.  
</p>
<p>102. In every case, it is stated by the Government that the Chinese judicial authorities have 
acted in strict compliance with the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal 
Procedure and other laws and regulations and in every case, the alleged victim&#8217;s lawful rights are 
said to have been upheld. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the question in this regard is 
whether the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure and other laws and 
regulations such as the Chinese Lawyers Act are compatible with international human rights </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>norms and standards such as those on the right to a fair trial, as contained on the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the basic principles on the role of lawyers, on the role of 
prosecutors and on the independence of the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur would welcome 
further information from the Government of China that demonstrates that lawyers are able to 
freely conduct their work and that the Government takes measures to protect them so they can 
exercise their activity According to international standards.

<p>103. El 24 de Noviembre de 2006, el Relator Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y 
abogados envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n sobre la situaci&#243;n del abogado Adalberto Carvajal 
Salcedo. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el abogado Adalberto Carvajal Salcedo de 72 a&#241;os 
de edad es un reconocido abogado laboralista, profesor y defensor de los intereses de los 
educadores en Colombia, miembro fundador de la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados Laboralistas de 
Trabajadores. En el ejercicio de su profesi&#243;n de abogado y en representaci&#243;n de 47 docentes de 
la Universidad del Magdalena habr&#237;a realizado una conciliaci&#243;n con dicha Universidad, 
relacionada con el monto de numerosas prestaciones laborales adeudadas a los docentes por parte 
de la instituci&#243;n. El acuerdo se habr&#237;a realizado con el Rector de la Universidad, el 
Sr. Carlos Eduardo Caicedo Omar. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, dicho acuerdo fue avalado 
con posterioridad por el Tribunal Administrativo del Departamento del Magdalena, en 
cumplimiento de la legislaci&#243;n relevante. Dicha conciliaci&#243;n habr&#237;a puesto fin a un proceso 
judicial que estaba siendo adelantado con el fin de reclamar el pago de las prestaciones laborales 
adeudadas por la Universidad a sus docentes. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, la 
Contralor&#237;a Departamental del Magdalena inici&#243; una investigaci&#243;n en contra del Rector de la 
Universidad, el Sr. Caicedo Omar, por diversos contratos y actos realizados durante su gesti&#243;n. 
Entre dichos actos se encontrar&#237;a la conciliaci&#243;n que realiz&#243; con el abogado Carvajal Salcedo. Se 
informa que paralelamente se habr&#237;a iniciado una investigaci&#243;n penal en contra del Rector de la 
Universidad, cuyo resultado ser&#237;a la acusaci&#243;n por parte de la Fiscal&#237;a de ser autor del delito de 
peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. Asimismo, se informa que la Fiscal&#237;a acus&#243; al abogado Carvajal de ser 
el &#8220;determinador&#8221; del delito, es decir que incit&#243; al Rector de la Universidad a cometer el delito 
de peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. La Fiscal&#237;a habr&#237;a argumentado que el abogado Carvajal, al actuar 
como representante de los docentes y realizar la conciliaci&#243;n sobre las prestaciones laborales, 
estaba actuando como determinador del delito. El 16 de marzo de 2005 el Fiscal a cargo del caso 
decidi&#243; precluir la investigaci&#243;n contra ambos acusados, por atipicidad de la conducta. El Fiscal 
habr&#237;a considerado que el abogado Carvajal hab&#237;a actuado de acuerdo con las leyes vigentes 
sobre conciliaci&#243;n administrativa y en ejercicio leg&#237;timo de su profesi&#243;n. Dicha decisi&#243;n fue 
recurrida por el Contralor del Departamento del Magdalena. El 18 de agosto de 2006 la Fiscal&#237;a 
revoc&#243; su decisi&#243;n anterior y orden&#243; la detenci&#243;n preventiva de ambos sindicados. El abogado 
Carvajal es sindicado de ser el determinador del delito de peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las 
informaciones recibidas, el defensor del abogado solicit&#243; que se suspendiera la medida de 
detenci&#243;n preventiva por razones de la edad y que se tomara en cuenta el reconocimiento p&#250;blico 
del acusado. La decisi&#243;n fue negativa, argumentando que &#233;ste hab&#237;a cometido una falta 
&#8220;grav&#237;sima&#8221; y que se tem&#237;a que evadiera la justicia. El abogado Carvajal podr&#237;a ser condenado a 
una pena que oscila entre 6 y 26 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n. El Relator Especial manifest&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n 
por el hecho de que el abogado Adalberto Carvajal Salcedo podr&#237;a estar siendo investigado 
penalmente por el ejercicio leg&#237;timo de su profesi&#243;n de abogado.  </p>

el Relator Especial quisiera solicitor al Gobierno que indique ampl&#237;e su afirmaci&#243;n seg&#250;n la cual 
el proceso penal se llev&#243; a cabo con el respeto de todas las garant&#237;as procesales y en qu&#233; medida 
el mismo se ajust&#243; a los est&#225;ndares internacionales en la materia. El Relator quisiera obtener 
informaci&#243;n sobre las posibilidades que tuvo el Sr. Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez de tener acceso 
a un abogado durante todas las etapas del proceso. Asimismo, el Relator Especial quisiera llamar 
la atenci&#243;n del Gobienro sobre un principio establecido por est&#225;ndares internacionales en materia 
de garant&#237;as judiciales, seg&#250;n el cual los tribunales militares en principio no tienen jurisdicci&#243;n 
para juzgar a civiles. De acuerdo con dichos principios, El Estado debe asegurarse de que en 
todo tipo de circunstancias los civiles acusados de un delito, sin importar su naturaleza, sean 
juzgados por tribunales ordinarios (Principio No. 5, E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/9).

<p>111. On 21 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning 
Ms. Iva Bro&#382;ov&#226; who on 30 January 2006 was dismissed from the position as President of the 
Supreme Court by the President of the Republic. According to information received, the 
President of the Republic dismissed Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; following Act No. 6/2002 Coll., section 106, 
which states that the Chairman of a Court may be recalled from his/her office by the person who 
appointed him/her, if he/she has seriously violated or repeatedly violates states&#8217; administration 
duties stipulated by law or fails to perform properly his/her duties. Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; was appointed 
by the President of the Republic on 20 March 2002. One of the reasons which was invoked by 
the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice their request to the President of the Republic 
for the dismissal of Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226;, was that she did not fulfill her duty to unify the decisions of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court. It is alleged that Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; was dismissed because she was deciding 
independently from the remainder of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judges. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur received reports about the existence within the judiciary of a strong pressure to 
achieve an unconditional uniformity of judicial decisions. It is reported that for Supreme Court 
judges it is not possible to propose a dissenting opinion vis-&#224;-vis an individual judicial decision; 
this would only be possible vis-&#224;-vis the decision of a Division (Criminal Division, Civil 
Division and Commercial Division), which is a collegiums of judges. On 7 February 2006, 
Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court against her dismissal. It appears 
that on 9 February 2006, the Constitutional Court, without anticipating the final result of the 
proceedings, decided to suspend the enforceability of the dismissal decision, highlighting the 
importance of the matter since it relates to the constitutional principle of separation of powers. 
On 12 September 2006 the Constitutional Court ruled that in dismissing Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226;, the 
president had violated the independence of the judiciary. According to the information received, 
the President in turn accused the judiciary of wanting to usurp political power. In the light of the 
foregoing, the Special Rapporteur expressed his deep concern regarding the faculty of the 
President of the Republic to dismiss the President of the Supreme Court form her/his office, 
which constitutes a serious attack to the fundamental principles of the separation of powers and 
the independence of the judiciary. These principles require that other powers, including the 
executive power, do not interfere with the administration of the courts and the administration of 
justice. Articles 81 and 82 of the Constitution of the Czech Republic reflect these principles 
which are fundamental to any democratic system. It is of fundamental importance that those 
provisions, which are in line with international norms and principles on the independence of the 
judiciary, be respected. Article 1 (2) and 10 of the Czech Republic Constitution compel the State 
to observe its obligations under international law. International norms and principles include 
article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the 
United Nations Basic Principles on Independence of the Judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>112. On 14 February 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter 
of 21 December 2006, stating that under no circumstance the decision to dismiss Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; 
from position of President of the Supreme Court was taken on the grounds of her independent 
decision making as an independent judge, as through this position she directly partook on 
decision-making activities of the Supreme Court, as is indicated in the last sentence of the fourth 
paragraph of your letter. The reason of dismissal of Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226; from the position of the 
President of the Supreme Court was not carrying out properly her duties at the performance of 
the state administration of the Supreme Court, which she is obliged to provide as a judicial 
official in the position of the body of the state courts administration (sec. 118, sec. 119 and 
sec. 124 of Act No. 6/2002 Coll. on Courts and Judges - annex I). Part of reproof to the way of 
performance of her function was a circumstance that under her presidency the Supreme Court 
failed to perform in a corresponding way task entrusted to it as a supreme element of the judicial 
system (sec. 14, para. 1 of the Act. No. 6/2002 Coll.) by sec. 14, para. 3 in relation with sec. 21 
of the Act No. 6/2002 Coll. (annex 11). These sections impose the obligation to the Supreme 
Court to monitor and evaluate final decisions of courts and on their base on behalf of the unified 
decision-making of courts to adopt standpoints in the decision-making of courts in cases of a 
certain kind. In this respect it entirely concerns implementation of a principle of foreseeability of 
court decision-making through methods thoroughly respecting the independence of the judiciary. 
In principle it is necessary to refuse a statement that the Ministry of Justice strived to achieve &#8220;an </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 65 
 
</p>
<p>unconditional uniformity of judicial decisions&#8221;. The conflict caused by the dismissal of 
Madame President from her position lies in the distinctness of understanding the position of the 
President of the Court. According to the authentic specific legislation the President of the Court 
is both an independent judge as well as the authority of state administration of courts, moreover 
in the position of the head of the structural unit of the state. In principle head of the structural 
unit of the state is a statutory body of the court. As it is impossible to separate the respective 
decision-making activity of the President of the Court - judge, at which lie arts as an entirely 
independent judge, and activity of the President of the Court - authority of the state 
administration of the court, ruled by the principle of superiority and subordination and 
responsibility for performance of these tasks to a body that carries the central responsibility for 
this sphere of action of court in face of the Government and through the Government of the 
lawmaking body, the mechanism of designation and dismissal of court officials was modified. 
The realization of this mechanism was in no way interfering with the position of court official as 
an independent judge. The regulation resulted from the opinion that the central authority 
responsible for the state administration of courts must have a tool how to ensure personal 
constitution so that it can truly carry this responsibility. This construct was challenged by the 
Judgement of the Constitutional Court (Judgement No. Pl. &#218;S 18/06), whereby section 106, para. 
1 of the Act No. 6/2002 Coll. was repealed (on bases of the motion filed by Judge Bro&#382;ov&#226;). 
According to this repealed section a court official could be dismissed from the office by the 
authority that appointed him, if the dismissed breached seriously or repeatedly his duties in the 
area of state administration of courts (annex III). Presently the amendment of the legal regulation 
which will ensure the compliance with the opinion of the Constitutional Court is being prepared. 
Therefore it will only be possible to dismiss judicial officials by the decision of an independent 
court, e.g. in the disciplinary proceedings. Madame President of the Supreme Court filed two 
more petitions to the Constitutional Court. By the first she demanded cancellation of the decision 
of the Minister of Justice of the 14 February 2006 by which a particular judge was appointed to 
the Supreme Court after her dismissal from the position of the President of the Supreme Court 
(2 February 2006), alter that the decision of the Constitutional Court on suspension of the 
enforcement of this dismissal entered into force (9 February 2006). In December 2006 the 
Constitutional Court satisfied this motion and ruled that for the decision of the Minister of 
Justice No. 57/2006-PERS-SO/6 to be valid, it requires consent of the President of the Supreme 
Court as the state authority competent to appoint a judge to the Supreme Court is the Minister of 
Justice with the consent of the President of the Supreme Court (sec. 70 of Act No. 6/2002 Coll.). 
The absence of the consent made the decision of the Minister contradictory to article 2, para. 3 of 
the Constitution and to article 2, para. 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic 
Freedoms (annex IV). Through the second petition Madam President of the Supreme Court 
demanded cancellation of the decision of the President of the Czech Republic by which this 
particular judge was appointed her Vice-president. She objected that by appointing Judge 
Jaroslav Bures a Vice-president of the Supreme Court her political rights and right to freedom of 
speech were violated. The Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional petition and on 
5 February ruled that Madam President of the Supreme Court is a person apparently 
unauthorized to file such a petition (the reasoning of the judgement has not yet been published). 
The nature of the problem rests in the examination of character of activities of the court officials 
at the state administration of the court, as outlined at the end of point 1. The dismissal of the 
President of Court from the position of an authority of the state administration of courts was not 
viewed as an interference with the independent position of a judge, because in its character both 
positions are profoundly different and in principle the content of activities connected with both </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>positions cannot collide. With respect to the opinion of the Constitutional Court expressed in its 
judgements on the aforesaid cases, the legal regulation will be made accordant with these 
opinions in the shortest possible time in such a way that no doubts about real and thoroughly 
guaranteed independence of the judiciary will arise.

<p>113. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Czech Republic for its response 
of 14 February 2007. The Special Rapporteur asks the Government to send him as soon as

aurait &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233; sur la route par des &#233;l&#233;ments de la Garde R&#233;publicaine apparemment en raison

</p>
<p>115. Le 12 septembre 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement de la RDC une 
lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant de r&#233;cents changements survenus au sommet du pouvoir judicaire 
militaire de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (RDC) dont il &#233;tait all&#233;gu&#233; qu&#8217;ils 
compromettaient l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire dans le pays. Selon les informations 
re&#231;ues, en juin 2007 le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique avait r&#233;voqu&#233; le Premier Pr&#233;sident de la Haute 
Cour Militaire et le Premier Avocat G&#233;n&#233;ral pr&#232;s l&#8217;Auditorat Militaire G&#233;n&#233;ral, et les avait 
remplac&#233;s par de nouveaux magistrats. Dans ce contexte, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial signalait avec 
pr&#233;occupation qu&#8217;il &#233;tait all&#233;gu&#233; que ces changements allaient &#224; l&#8217;encontre des principes 
constitutionnels d&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire et de s&#233;paration des pouvoirs, principes 
fondateurs de l&#8217;&#233;tat de droit et de la d&#233;mocratie. La nouvelle Constitution de la RDC stipule que 
le Pr&#233;sident peut r&#233;voquer et nommer des magistrats uniquement sur recommandation du Conseil </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 67 
 
</p>
<p>Sup&#233;rieur de la Magistrature, organe qui garantit l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire. Alors que 
ce Conseil n&#8217;avait pas encore &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;e, la r&#233;vocation et nomination de magistrats par le Pr&#233;sident 
de mani&#232;re unilat&#233;rale apparaissait contraire &#224; la lettre et &#224; l&#8217;esprit de la Constitution. Dans ce 
contexte, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial soulignait que l&#8217;adoption par le Parlement de la loi portant 
organisation du Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de la Magistrature devrait &#234;tre une priorit&#233; absolue, ainsi qu&#8217;il 
l&#8217;avait d&#233;j&#224; mentionn&#233; dans son rapport pr&#233;liminaire sur sa visite en RDC (A/HRC/4/25/Add.3 
du 24 mai 2007). En outre, il signalait que, dans l&#8217;attente de l&#8217;adoption de cette loi, aucun 
magistrat ne devait &#234;tre nomm&#233; ou r&#233;voqu&#233; de mani&#232;re unilat&#233;rale par le Pr&#233;sident, afin de ne pas 
contredire la Constitution. Concernant la nomination du G&#233;n&#233;ral Mukuntu au poste de Premier 
Avocat G&#233;n&#233;ral, il notait avec inqui&#233;tude que ce militaire n&#8217;avait pas d&#233;missionn&#233; de son poste 
au Conseil National de Securit&#233; (CNS) au sein de l&#8217;Ex&#233;cutif, afin de devenir un haut magistrat. Il 
soulignait la caract&#232;re incompatible de ces deux postes, fait clairement &#233;tabli par la Loi sur le 
Statut des Magistrats en son article 65. Pour le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, le fait qu&#8217;un magistrat, &#224; 
fortiori lorsqu&#8217;il est de haut niveau, exerce en m&#234;me temps des fonctions au sein du 
Gouvernement est une atteinte directe &#224; l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judicaire. Cela est encore 
plus grave quand on consid&#232;re qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agit d&#8217;un haut magistrat aupr&#232;s du bureau responsable de 
d&#233;finir la strat&#233;gie d&#8217;instruction des crimes les plus graves commis en RDC. En ce qui concerne 
la nomination du G&#233;n&#233;ral Nyemboau poste de Premier Pr&#233;sident de la Haute Cour Militaire 
(HCM), le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial r&#233;it&#233;rait sa pr&#233;occupation au sujet de la r&#233;vocation de son 
pr&#233;d&#233;cesseur, le G&#233;n&#233;ral Nawele. Outre les aspects d&#8217;inconstitutionnalit&#233; mentionn&#233;s plus haut, 
il indiquait qu&#8217;il trouvait inqui&#233;tant que la r&#233;vocation soit intervenue peu apr&#232;s l&#8217;acquittement de 
Ma&#238;tre Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se Nlandu, prononc&#233; par le Major Mbokolo, Pr&#233;sident du Tribunal Militaire 
de Garnison et Directeur de Cabinet du Pr&#233;sident Nawale. A la suite de cet acquittement, le 
Major Mbokolo avait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;mis de ses fonctions non seulement de Chef de Cabinet mais 
&#233;galement de Pr&#233;sident du Tribunal Militaire de Garnison, tribunal qu&#8217;il avait pr&#233;sid&#233; pendant 
cinq ans. Au moment de l&#8217;envoi de la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations, le G&#233;n&#233;ral Nawele et le Major 
Mbokolo &#233;taient en dsponibilit&#233; et n&#8217;avaient &#233;t&#233; r&#233;affect&#233;s &#224; aucun poste, alors que le pays 
souffre d&#8217;une grave carence de magistrats. De plus, le second juge qui si&#233;geait dans le proc&#232;s 
Nlandu avait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; r&#233;voqu&#233; de son poste, et r&#233;affect&#233; &#224; Lisala. A la lumi&#232;re de ces 
&#233;l&#233;ments, la source all&#233;guait que ces r&#233;vocations pourraient &#234;tre motiv&#233;es par le r&#244;le jou&#233; par ces 
magistrats dans la d&#233;cision d&#8217;acquittement de Ma&#238;tre Nlandu. Dans ce contexte, la Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial appelait l&#8217;attention des autorit&#233;s sur l&#8217;importance du r&#244;le que doit jouer le Conseil 
Sup&#233;rieur de la Magistrature dans la nomination et la r&#233;vocation des magistrats, car en l&#8217;absence 
d&#8217;une telle proc&#233;dure le pouvoir des magistrats de statuer en toute ind&#233;pendance, sans crainte de 
perdre leur poste, n&#8217;est pas garanti. Il signalait que, depuis que ces changements de hauts 
magistrats &#233;taient intervenus, la source &#233;voquait une possible tendance n&#233;gative concernant la 
lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233; et l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire militaire, illustr&#233;e par des 
d&#233;cisions prises dans plusieurs cas. En effet, cinq jours seulement apr&#232;s ces changements de 
magistrats, l&#8217;Auditorat Militaire G&#233;n&#233;ral avait fait appel de la d&#233;cision d&#8217;acquittement de Ma&#238;tre 
Nlandu, malgr&#233; le fait que le d&#233;lai de cinq jours pr&#233;vu par le droit militaire avait expir&#233; depuis 
longtemps. Peu apr&#232;s ces changements, le verdict d&#8217;acquittement de tous les accus&#233;s, militaires 
et civils, &#233;tait &#233;galement intervenu dans le cas du massacre de Kilwa, alors que de nombreuses 
preuves, dont notamment des t&#233;moignages oculaires, indiquaient de claires responsabilit&#233;s dans 
ces &#233;v&#232;nements tragiques. La source all&#233;guait &#233;galement que l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des magistrats 
n&#8217;avait pas &#233;t&#233; respect&#233;e dans ce proc&#232;s. L&#8217;Auditeur Sup&#233;rieur qui avait instruit et port&#233; devant 
les juges le dossier avait &#233;t&#233; rappel&#233; &#224; Kinshasa et r&#233;assign&#233; &#224; Kananga alors que le proc&#232;s &#233;tait 
encore en cours. Selon la source, les irr&#233;gularit&#233;s dans ce proc&#232;s avaient &#233;t&#233; si manifestes que la </p>

</p>
<p>Haut Commissaire aux droits de l&#8217;homme, Mme Louise Arbour, avait publi&#233; un communiqu&#233; de 
presse condamnant le jugement. L&#8217;auditeur militaire ayant interjet&#233; un appel, il &#233;tait d&#8217;une 
importance capitale que le proc&#232;s en appel se d&#233;roule de fa&#231;on &#233;quitable, et que les magistrats 
concern&#233;s puissent juger en toute ind&#233;pendance et uniquement sur la base de la loi applicable. 
Finalement, le 28 juillet 2007 la Cour Militaire de Kisangani avait &#233;mis un verdict que la source 
qualifiait d&#8217;inqui&#233;tant dans le cas de M. Khawa, d&#233;cidant de l&#8217;acquitter en ce qui concerne la 
plupart de charges retenues contre lui. Khawa Panga Mandro, plus connu sous le nom de Chef 
Khawa, avait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; &#224; la r&#233;clusion &#224; vie en janvier 2006, pour meurtre et enl&#232;vement, par 
le Tribunal de Grande Instance de Bunia. Il avait ensuite &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; par le Tribunal Militaire 
de Garnison de Bunia &#224; 20 ans d&#8217;emprisonnement pour &#171; mouvement insurrectionnel, d&#233;tention 
d&#8217;armes de guerre, crimes de guerre, crime contre l&#8217;humanit&#233;, assassinat et coups et blessures 
aggrav&#233;s &#187;. Le verdict du 28 juillet, qui annulait les charges extr&#234;mement graves retenues contre 
lui, n&#8217;&#233;tait motiv&#233; que par une erreur suppos&#233;e de proc&#233;dure, la Cour all&#233;guant que le droit de 
M. Khawa d&#8217;&#234;tre inform&#233; &#224; propos du mandat d&#8217;arr&#234;t &#224; son encontre avait &#233;t&#233; viol&#233;. Or, selon les 
informations &#224; la disposition des Nations Unies, M. Khawa aurait &#233;t&#233; inform&#233; du mandat d&#8217;arr&#234;t 
lanc&#233; contre lui pendant toute la proc&#233;dure, mais n&#8217;aurait pas voulu coop&#233;rer avec les autorit&#233;s 
judiciaires. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial signalait que l&#8217;affaire Khawa &#233;tait un &#233;l&#233;ment de r&#233;f&#233;rence 
dans la lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233; dans la mesure o&#249; il s&#8217;agissant du premier jugement contre un 
ancien chef militaire pour de graves violations des droits de l&#8217;homme. La source signalait que ce 
verdict semblait confirmer une inversion de la tendance tr&#232;s inqui&#233;tante au sein de la justice 
militaire, dans le sens de la destruction des l&#233;gers progr&#232;s qui avaient &#233;t&#233; constat&#233;s depuis la 
p&#233;riode de la transition dans la lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233; et en faveur de l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des 
magistrats. Enfin, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial exprimait sa plus vive inqui&#233;tude au sujet d&#8217;une p&#233;tition 
circulant au S&#233;nat et dont il &#233;tait all&#233;gu&#233; qu&#8217;elle proposait d&#8217;amender la Constitution afin qu&#8217;elle 
pr&#233;voie que le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique occupe le poste de Pr&#233;sident du Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de 
la Magistrature. Il manifestait qu&#8217;une telle proposition, si elle devait &#234;tre adopt&#233;e, aboutirait &#224; 
rendre vain l&#8217;ensemble des dispositions de la Constitution qui garantissent l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du 
pouvoir judicaire. Alors que la Constitution, vot&#233;e par referendum par le peuple congolais, se 
base sur le principe d&#233;mocratique de la s&#233;paration des pouvoirs et interdit explicitement toute 
interf&#233;rence avec le pouvoir judiciaire des autres pouvoirs et notamment du pouvoir ex&#233;cutif (art. 
149, al. 1), la nomination du Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique &#224; la t&#234;te de l&#8217;organe garantissant 
l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire violerait clairement ces principes, et donc l&#8217;esprit m&#234;me de 
la Constitution. Cela aboutirait &#233;galement &#224; revenir au syst&#232;me existant avant l&#8217;adoption de la 
ouvelle Constitution, quand le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique &#233;tait &#224; la t&#234;te du Conseil, situation, qui 
selon les analyses convergentes de tous les experts et observateurs, avait &#233;t&#233; caract&#233;ris&#233; par un 
manque quasi-total d&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire, et un niveau d&#8217;impunit&#233; tr&#232;s &#233;lev&#233;. La 
nouvelle Constitution visait justement &#224; changer cette situation, et une modification de la 
Constitution dans le sens propos&#233; d&#233;truirait tout espoir de pouvoir construire une justice 
ind&#233;pendante dans le pays. A ce propos, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial formulait les recommandations 
suivantes qu&#8217;il demandait au Gouvernement de bien vouloir partager avec les organes 
comp&#233;tents du pouvoir judiciaire et l&#233;gislatif : (i) la loi portant organisation du Conseil Sup&#233;rieur 
de la Magistrature doit &#234;tre adopt&#233;e d&#8217;urgence, car la mise en place de ce Conseil constitue un 
&#233;l&#233;ment fondamental de garantie de la s&#233;paration des pouvoirs et donc de la d&#233;mocratie et du 
respect des droits de l&#8217;homme dans le pays ; (ii) le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique ne doit &#234;tre ni 
membre ni pr&#233;sident du Conseil, afin de garantir l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de cet organe et donc de la 
magistrature ; (iii) tant que la loi portant organisation du Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de la Magistrature </p>

</p>
<p>n&#8217;aura pas &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233;e et le Conseil mis en place, aucun magistrat ne devrait &#234;tre nomm&#233; ou 
r&#233;voqu&#233; de mani&#232;re unilat&#233;rale par le Pr&#233;sident ; (iv) la Haute Cour Militaire devrait se 
prononcer sur la l&#233;galit&#233; les d&#233;cisions prises dans le proc&#232;s Khawa ainsi que dans l&#8217;appel 
interjet&#233; dans le cas Nlandu ; elle devrait aussi entendre au plus t&#244;t l&#8217;appel dans le cas du 
massacre de Kilwa ; (v) il est essentiel que la Haute Cour Militaire, dans l&#8217;ensemble de ces cas, 
montre aux citoyens congolais ainsi qu&#8217;&#224; l&#8217;opinion internationale qu&#8217;elle statue en toute 
ind&#233;pendance et dans le respect de la loi et du droit international ; et enfin, (vi) les civils ne 
devraient plus &#234;tre jug&#233;s par des tribunaux militaires, mais uniquement par des tribunaux civils, 
conform&#233;ment &#224; la Constitution de la RDC et des principes internationaux applicables en la 
mati&#232;re.

<p>116. Le 5 octobre 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement de la RDC, 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, un appel urgent sur la situation des 
magistrats militaires Guillaume Ngembo, David Kazadi, Julien Luemba, Joseph Nganama, de 
l&#8217;Auditorat de Garnison de Kisangani. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le dimanche 
30 septembre 2007, vers 16h30, le G&#233;n&#233;ral Jean Claude KIFWA, escort&#233; d&#8217;une quarantaine 
40 militaires lourdement arm&#233;s, aurait fait irruption en la r&#233;sidence du Magistrat Guillaume 
NGEMBO, au motif qu&#8217;il &#233;tait &#224; la recherche du Lieutenant Magistrat Julien LUEMBA. Bien 
qu&#8217;il ait &#233;t&#233; inform&#233; qu&#8217;il ne s&#8217;agissait pas du magistrat Julien LUEMBA, le G&#233;n&#233;ral KIFWA 
aurait train&#233; le Magistrat Guillaume NGEMBO sur la voie publique, sous la menace d&#8217;armes &#224; 
feu, en lui administrant personnellement des coups de poings. Il aurait ensuite ordonn&#233; &#224; son 
escorte de le ligoter, de le d&#233;culotter, de l&#8217;allonger par terre et de le fouetter, et ce devant toute sa 
famille et une foule nombreuse de passants et de voisins. Le pantalon baiss&#233;, le Magistrat aurait 
re&#231;u au moins 50 coups de matraque. Le G&#233;n&#233;ral aurait ensuite conduit sa victime &#224; l&#8217;Etat Major 
de la 9&#232;me R&#233;gion militaire o&#249; il l&#8217;aurait fait maltraiter devant ses collaborateurs ainsi que 
d&#8217;autres militaires et leurs familles r&#233;sidant dans l&#8217;enceinte de l&#8217;Etat Major. Il aurait dit pouvoir 
tout se permettre, y compris de tuer impun&#233;ment, au seul motif qu&#8217;il est cousin du Chef de l&#8217;Etat. 
Ensuite, le Magistrat Guillaume NGEMBO aurait &#233;t&#233; &#225; nouveau embarqu&#233; &#224; bord d&#8217;un v&#233;hicule 
et conduit sous la contrainte vers la r&#233;sidence d&#8217;autres Magistrats militaires, situ&#233; au num&#233;ro 4 de 
l&#8217;avenue KITIMA, Commune Makiso. Arriv&#233; sur les lieux, le G&#233;n&#233;ral KIFWA, rejoint un peu 
plus tard par son Adjoint charg&#233; des Op&#233;rations, le G&#233;n&#233;ral L&#233;on MUSHALE et le P2 NGOY 
KISULA de l&#8217;Inspection provinciale de la Police Nationale, se serait introduit dans l&#8217;immeuble 
pour arr&#234;ter le Lieutenant Magistrat David KAZADI, le Sous-Lieutenant Magistrat Julien 
LUEMBA et enfin le Sous-Lieutenant Magistrat Joseph NGANAMA. Ils auraient &#233;t&#233; tra&#238;n&#233;s 
dehors en pr&#233;sence de leurs familles et d&#8217;une foule nombreuse, o&#249; ils auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;shabill&#233;s, 
ligot&#233;s, maltrait&#233;s et humili&#233;s par le G&#233;n&#233;ral en personne et les &#233;l&#233;ments de son escorte. Leurs 
appareils t&#233;l&#233;phoniques et d&#8217;autres biens comme des sommes d&#8217;argent, trouv&#233;s sur eux, leur 
auraient &#233;t&#233; confisqu&#233;s. Profitant de l&#8217;inattention des militaires, les magistrats Guillaume 
NGEMBO, Joseph NGANAMA ainsi que le 1er Sergent-Major KUKWIKILA auraient r&#233;ussi &#224; 
se sauver. En revanche, les Magistrats David KAZADI et Julien LUEMBA, toujours ligot&#233;s et 
presque nus, auraient &#233;t&#233; embarqu&#233;s dans une jeep de la Police nationale et conduits &#224; l&#8217;Etat 
Major de la 9&#232;me R&#233;gion Militaire o&#249; ils auraient &#233;t&#233; battus et maltrait&#233;s toute la nuit, de 
19 heures du dimanche &#225; 8 heures du matin. Des manches &#224; balais et de raclettes auraient &#233;t&#233; 
utilis&#233;es pour la bastonnade. Le Magistrat David KAZADI aurait re&#231;u environ 1.000 coups de 
b&#226;ton sur toutes les parties de son corps. Il aurait de ce fait une c&#244;te gauche bris&#233;e. Au cours du 
trajet vers l&#8217;Etat Major, le Magistrat David KAZADI aurait tent&#233; de se sauver au passage d&#8217;un </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>v&#233;hicule de la MONUC. Le G&#233;n&#233;ral KIFWA aurait alors ordonn&#233; de l&#8217;abattre. Plusieurs coups 
de feu auraient &#233;t&#233; tir&#233;s sans atteindre le magistrat, mais une balle perdue aurait atteint au bras 
droit l&#8217;un des membres de l&#8217;escorte du G&#233;n&#233;ral. Le 1 octobre 2007, les deux magistrats auraient 
&#233;t&#233; amen&#233;s en tenue d&#233;braill&#233;e devant la troupe par le G&#233;n&#233;ral Jean Claude KIFWA, au cours 
d&#8217;une parade qu&#8217;il aurait pr&#233;sid&#233; au Camp Sergent KETELE. Le G&#233;n&#233;ral les aurait pr&#233;sent&#233;s 
comme de dangereux criminels incorpor&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;arm&#233;e parce qu&#8217;ils avaient &#233;tudi&#233; le droit, mais qui 
en r&#233;alit&#233; n&#8217;avaient pass&#233; leur temps &#225; l&#8217;Universit&#233; qu&#8217;&#224; tricher. Pendant cette parade, qui aurait 
&#233;t&#233; largement m&#233;diatis&#233;e sur les cha&#238;nes locales de radio et de t&#233;l&#233;vision, le G&#233;n&#233;ral se serait 
vant&#233; d&#8217;avoir arr&#234;t&#233; les magistrats qui pr&#233;tendaient ne pouvoir &#234;tre arr&#234;t&#233;s &#224; Kisangani, et aurait 
indiqu&#233; que ce m&#234;me jour, il les exp&#233;dierait &#225; Kinshasa o&#249; ils seraient jug&#233;s et condamn&#233;s. Le 
Gouverneur de Province serait pass&#233; rendre visite &#224; ces Magistrats au Centre de Sant&#233; CELPA, 
dans la commune Makiso. Emu par la situation, il leur aurait remis une somme d&#8217;argent pour 
leur permettre de payer la facture des premiers soins re&#231;us. Dans ce contexte, le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial faisait part au Gouvernement de sa pr&#233;occupation extr&#234;me quant &#224; la gravit&#233; des faits 
rapport&#233;s, qui constitueraient, s&#8217;ils &#233;taient confirm&#233;s, non seulement une violation grave de la 
dignit&#233; et l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique des magistrats concern&#233;s, mais &#233;galement une grave atteinte &#224; la 
dignit&#233; et &#224; l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judicaire en tant que tel. Il observait que ces faits, d&#8217;une 
gravit&#233; extr&#234;me, rev&#234;taient une importance encore plus significative du fait que les victimes 
&#233;taient des repr&#233;sentant du pouvoir judiciaire, des magistrats dont l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance et la s&#233;curit&#233; 
doit &#234;tre garantie par l&#8217;Etat, en tant que repr&#233;sentants d&#8217;une des trois principales institutions 
&#233;tatiques. Il indiquait que de tels agissements de la part d&#8217;un G&#233;n&#233;ral d&#233;pendant du pouvoir 
ex&#233;cutif, s&#8217;ils &#233;taient confirm&#233;s, constitueraient une atteinte inacceptable &#224; la dignit&#233; et &#224; 
l&#8217;honneur de la magistrature, ainsi qu&#8217;une interf&#233;rence inadmissible du pouvoir ex&#233;cutif dans les 
affaires judiciaires, au m&#233;pris des principes fondamentaux de la s&#233;paration des pouvoirs et 
l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judiciaire, fondements de la Constitution et de tout &#233;tat de droit 
d&#233;mocratique.

<p>117. Le 11 fevrier 2008, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement de la RDC, 
conjointement avec Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, une lettre d&#8217;allegation concernant le d&#233;roulement du proc&#232;s en

des pr&#233;sum&#233;s assassins de M. Serge Maheshe s&#8217;&#233;tait ouvert le 6 f&#233;vrier 2008 devant la Cour de 
Justice militaire de Bukavu, plusieurs dysfonctionnements lors du proc&#232;s en premi&#232;re instance en

(iv) tous les pr&#233;venus avaient assist&#233; c&#244;te &#224; c&#244;te aux auditions et d&#233;bats de sorte qu&#8217;ils avaient 
entendu la version de tous les autres en direct, ce qui avait pu les influencer ou leur permettre de

c&#244;te &#224; c&#244;te ; (vi) le refus de l&#8217;administration p&#233;nitentiaire de s&#233;parer certains pr&#233;venus en cellule ; </p>

menaces prof&#233;r&#233;es par deux militaires de la Garde R&#233;publicaine peu de temps avant l&#8217;assassinat; 
(x) le blocage par le pr&#233;sident du Tribunal de nombreuses questions que les avocats des

avocats; (xiii) la condamnation &#224; mort de quatre civils par une juridiction militaire sur la seule 
base d&#8217;aveux non corrobor&#233;s par d&#8217;autres &#233;l&#233;ments de preuve alors m&#234;me que le tribunal avait 
reconnu dans son jugement les nombreuses contradictions persistantes et zones d&#8217;ombres, 
notamment sur l&#8217;arme du crime et l&#8217;identit&#233; de l&#8217;auteur ; (xv) le refus de mettre le jugement &#224; 
disposition des parties suite au prononc&#233; du verdict le 28 ao&#251;t 2007, le jugement ayant &#233;t&#233;

ce retard ayant oblig&#233; les parties &#224; faire appel sans avoir pleinement connaissance de la d&#233;cision 
du Tribunal. Par ailleurs, apr&#232;s le prononc&#233; du d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233; de premi&#232;re instance, MM. Freddy 
Bisimwa et Mastakila qui auraient avou&#233; avoir commis le crime et d&#233;sign&#233; les deux amis de 
M. Maheshe, MM. Serge Muhima et Alain Mulimbi, comme commanditaires, se seraient 
r&#233;tract&#233;s par courrier depuis la prison. Cette lettre adress&#233;e aux magistrats, qui serait sortie de 
mani&#232;re r&#233;guli&#232;re du centre de d&#233;tention avec le visa du directeur de la prison, disculperait 
MM. Muhima et Mulimbi, condamn&#233;s &#224; mort, et qui auraient toujours ni&#233; toute participation au 
meurtre de leur ami. Ce courrier mettrait aussi en cause deux magistrats de l&#8217;Auditorat militaire 
de Bukavu. En outre, des pressions seraient exerc&#233;es sur les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme 
qui participent ou suivent ce proc&#232;s, en l&#8217;occurrence des avocats des diff&#233;rents pr&#233;venus et de la 
partie civile, journalistes et membres d&#8217;ONG des droits de l&#8217;homme. La plupart des menaces 
seraient anonymes, mais pourraient avoir des origines diff&#233;rentes selon les personnes vis&#233;es.

<p>119. On 29 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, regarding the death sentences imposed against three men convicted on 
charges connected to the bomb attacks on the Sinai Peninsula in October 2004, 
Messrs. Muhammed Gayiz Sabbah, Usama &#8216;Abd al-Ghani al-Nakhlawi and Yunis Muhammed 
Abu Gareer. According to the information received, the three men were tried before the 
Emergency Supreme State Security Court (ESSSC) sitting in al-Islamiliya on charges arising 
from the bomb attacks committed in Taba and Nuweiba on the Sinai Peninsula in October 2004, 
which killed 34 people and injured more than 100. In September 2006, the ESSSC announced 
the death sentences against Messrs. Muhammed Gayiz Sabbah, Usama &#8216;Abd al-Ghani al-
Nakhlawi and Yunis Muhammed Abu Gareer, while other defendants were sentenced to long 
prison terms. The death sentences were then reportedly submitted to the office of the Mufti. On 
30 November 2006, the ESSSC announced that the Mufti had approved the death sentences and 
that it now confirmed them. It is the mandate holders understanding that there is no appeal 
against the sentences of the ESSSC, which can only be commuted by the President. Reports 
indicate that Messrs. Muhammed Gayiz Sabbah, Usama &#8216;Abd al-Ghani al-Nakhlawi and Yunis 
Muhammed Abu Gareer had their first contact with their lawyers when the trial began, months 
after their arrest, and were only able to communicate with their lawyers during court hearings. 
The majority of the defendants denied the charges against them and claimed that they had 
confessed under torture. Upon request of the defence lawyers, the court ordered medical 
examination of the defendants. The medical exams, which were carried out several months after 
the alleged torture, did not confirm the allegations of the accused. It have also been informed that 
the cases of Messrs. Muhammed Gayiz Sabbah, Usama &#8216;Abd al-Ghani al-Nakhlawi and Yunis 
Muhammed Abu Gareer were submitted to the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights, which has declared them admissible in May 2007. The African Commission has also 
issued provisional measures asking your Excellency&#8217;s Government to defer the executions until 
it has decided the merits of the case. Reports were received, however, that the Government&#8217;s 
delegation before the African Commission in May 2007 indicated that the legal adviser in the 
office of the President has advised to ratify the death sentences and that the President might 
ratify them at any time. 
</p>
<p>120. On 31 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, on the situation of Mr. Amr Tharwat, 
Mr. Abdel-Latif Mohamed Ahmed and Mr. Abdel-Hamid Mohamed Abdel-Rahman. According 
to information received, on 30 May 2007, Mr. Amr Tharwat was arrested by the State Security 
officers at his family&#8217;s home in the Matrya neighbourhood in Cairo, pursuant to an 
administrative detention decree issued by the interior minister under the emergency law. In 
addition to Mr. Tharwat, the authorities arrested further people staying at their home, including 
Mr. Abdel-Latif Mohamed Ahmed and Mr. Abdel-Hamid Mohamed Abdel-Rahman. 
Mr. Tharwat is member of the Quranic group, a movement reportedly advocating for peaceful 
reform in the Muslim world based on democracy and human rights and to offer practical 
strategies for such change. He was accused of &#8220;exploiting religion to promote extreme ideas in 
contempt of Islamic religion, denying the Sunna and considering the Quran to be the main source 
of legislation&#8221;. Further charges included &#8220;rejecting the penalty for apostasy&#8221; and &#8220;rejecting the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 73 
 
</p>
<p>stoning of adulterers&#8221;. Allegedly, during their detention, the detainees were not allowed to 
contact their families or lawyers until 21 June 2007, four days after their interrogations before 
the State Security Prosecution officer began. Reportedly, during the interrogations, questions 
were confined to the detainees&#8217; religious views. An appeal was filed against the administrative 
detention of the defendants, as they were detained for more than 30 days. On 12 and 
14 July 2007, the Emergency State Security Court ordered the release of the three persons. 
However, the interior Ministry appealed their release order. On 7 and 8 August, the court 
decided to release them immediately. Despite the release order, the three individuals remain 
detained in preventive detention by the State Security Prosecution Office. 
</p>
<p>121. On 2 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism regarding forty members of the organization 
Muslim Brothers (&#1606;&#1608;&#1605;&#1604;&#1587;&#1605;&#1604;&#1575; &#1606;&#1575;&#1608;&#1582;&#1604;&#1573;&#1575;) who, although they are civilians, are facing trial before the 
Supreme Military Court in Heikstep, northeast of Cairo, on charges of terrorism and money 
laundering. The forty defendants face charges that could incur the death penalty. Reportedly, 
some of the defendants were acquitted in January 2007 by a civilian court in Cairo, but their case 
was referred to a military court through a Presidential Order. The military trial commenced on 
26 April 2007 and has been adjourned on a number of occasions. It has been reported that 
authorities did not provide defense lawyers with details of the charges until the trial began and 
that observers have been repeatedly denied access to the court. Apparently, a criminal court in 
Cairo was to hear an appeal filed by some of these defendants against the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
decision to freeze their financial assets; the outcome of this appeal is not known. The military 
trial is still ongoing.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>122. On 11 July 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 29 June 2007, 
explaining that during this case of terrorism 34 persons were killed and 157 persons were 
injured. The case has been handled pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Law applied in 
the country after the state of emergency was declared and in conformity with article 4 of the 
International Convention on Civil and political Rights. The judicial circuits which consider 
emergency criminal cases are constituted of the same judges of the normal criminal courts. Every 
circuit is constituted of three counselors who are members of the competent court of appeal. The 
trial took place according to the provisions of the law and in harmony with the international 
standards for fair trials in public sessions densely attended by representatives of international 
organizations for human rights and journalists from local and foreign media. Death sentences are 
issued by the consensus of the court panel and the sentence is only uttered after the judgement is 
approved by the Mufti of the Arab Republic of Egypt who expresses his opinion on whether or 
not the penalty conforms with Islamic sharia. This opinion is consultative in all cases for the both 
the normal and the emergency judiciary. The judgements issued by the emergency courts are 
subject to the &#8220;judgements confirmation system&#8221; which is the counterpart of the methods of 
appeal before the ordinary judiciary. The judgements issued by the emergency courts are 
reviewed, according to the judgements confirmation system, by counselors who are members of 
the judiciary authority delegated to the Judgements Confirmation Office. The law stipulates that 
the Office shall deposit a memorandum on the results of the case examination before the 
judgement is presented for confirmation. The memorandum shall contain the reply to the 
grievances brought in relation with the judgement from all of its legal and objective aspects. The 
judgements confirmation body has the competence to mitigate the judgements or to order retrial, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 74 
 
</p>
<p>but does not have the competence to aggravate the penalty. The confirmation of a court 
judgement does not jeopardize the right of the convicts to petition the President of the Republic 
for granting amnesty or commuting the sentence by virtue of article 149 of the Constitution. It is 
evident from the presentation hereinabove that there was no assault on the individual freedom or 
on the inviolability of the private life of the complainants or any other rights and liberties, and 
that they were not treated in a degrading manner. This was confirmed throughout the stages of 
the case and in the investigations of the PPO, which is a branch of the judiciary, or during the 
criminal trial process to which they were subject. The documents indicate quite evidently that the 
right to litigation was not violated. The suspects had a fair and just trial before a legal national 
and competent court. The trial Sessions were public and were attended by the lawyers who 
represented the respondents; and the trial was concluded in a reasonable period. Hence this 
negates the occurrence of any violation by the trial of article 14 of the ICCPR which sets out the 
guarantees for fair trial. For all the above reasons, the allegations that the rights of 
Mohamed Cayez Sabah, Osssama Abdel Ghany al- Nakhlawy, and Mohamed Yunis Elayyan 
Abu Gareer were violated are incorrect and groundless.

Sra. Br&#237;gida Asongsua Elo, esposa del Sr. Guillermo Ela Nguema, quien cumple una condena de 
20 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n por conspiraci&#243;n contra el Gobierno. De acuerdo con las informaciones

de 2007 al salir de misa en la Catedral de Malabo por dos agentes de polic&#237;a vestidos de civil 
quienes no habr&#237;an mostrado orden de detenci&#243;n alguna. La Sra. Br&#237;gida Asongsua Elo no ha 
sido acusada de delito alguno y no ha sido presentada ante ninguna autoridad judicial. No se le 
han explicado los motivos de su reclusi&#243;n en la Comisar&#237;a Central de Polic&#237;a de Malabo ni se ha 
formalizado legalmente su privaci&#243;n de libertad. Se afirma que esta persona ha sido sometida a

que hab&#237;a tratado de entregarle ese plano a su esposa durante su visita del 15 de diciembre. 
Br&#237;gida Asongsua Elo se neg&#243; a admitir que el dibujo que le mostraban era el que hab&#237;a hecho su

<p>126. On 9 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, regarding the situation of Messrs. Tilahun Ayalew, 
Anteneh Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu, prominent members of the Ethiopian Teachers&#8217; 
Association (ETA), Ethiopia&#8217;s main teachers&#8217; trade union. Mr. Getnet was previously the subject 
of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
28 September 2006. That communication, in which it was brought to the Government&#8217;s attention 
allegations that Mr. Getnet was abducted and beaten by members of the security forces in 
May 2006 and again abducted and taken to an undisclosed location on 23 September 2006, has 
unfortunately remained without a reply from the Government. According to the information </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 76 
 
</p>
<p>recently received, Mr. Tilahun Ayalew was arrested on 14 December 2006 and 
Mr. Anteneh Getnet on 29 December 2006. Both have since then been held incommunicado by 
police at the headquarters of the Central Investigation Bureau (Maikelawi) in Addis Ababa. 
Mr. Tilahun Ayalew and Mr. Anteneh Getnet appeared before a judge, but they were reportedly 
neither charged, nor given access to legal counsel or their relatives. Since 15 December 2006 
Mr. Meqcha Mengistu has reportedly been detained by the police at a secret location after being 
under police surveillance for several days. His exact whereabouts is unknown and the authorities 
deny any information about it. In view of their incommunicado detention, concern was expressed 
as to the physical integrity of Messrs. Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh Getnet, and Meqcha Mengistu. 
Further concern was expressed that their arrest and detention might be related to their legitimate 
activities in defense of human rights, in particular the promotion of labour rights of teachers. 
</p>
<p>127. On 2 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding 
Mr. Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, a citizen of Canada, Ms. Halima Badrudine Hussein, a citizen of the 
Comores, and her children (names and age unknown), Mr. Ayub Abdurazak, a resident of 
France, Mr. Tesfaldet Kidane Tesfasgi, a citizen of Eritrea and television cameraman, 
Mr. Saleh Idris Salim, a citizen of Eritrea and television journalist, Mr. Osman Ahmed Yassin, a 
citizen of Sweden, and Ms. Sophia Abdi Nasir, also a citizen of Sweden, and her children (names 
and age unknown), Ms. Ines Chine, a citizen of Tunisia, Mr. Abdi Muhammed Abdillahi, a 
citizen of Kenya, and more than seventy others whose names have not been reported to the 
mandate holders. According to the information received, in December 2006, the conflict between 
the militias of the Council of Somali Islamic Courts and the Transitional Federal Government of 
Somalia, supported by armed forces of the Government, caused a large flow of refugees seeking 
to cross the border from Somalia into Kenya. On 2 January 2007, Kenyan authorities announced 
the closure of the border for security reasons. Since then, it is reported that the Kenyan security 
forces have been patrolling the border and have arrested a number of those seeking to cross it. 
Kenya has deported at least 84 of those arrested back to Somalia, from where they were taken to 
Ethiopia. In late March the Government released five persons arrested and detained under these 
circumstances. On 10 April 2007, the Government announced that 29 more of the transferred 
detainees would be released. However, so far none of the 29 has been freed. The persons named 
above were allegedly arrested between 30 December 2006 and February 2007 as they tried to 
cross the border from Somalia into Kenya. They were detained in various locations in Nairobi 
before being transferred to Somalia on three charter flights between 20 January and 
10 February 2007. Once in Somalia they were transferred to Ethiopia. They were not provided 
with an opportunity to challenge their forcible removal at any stage. Mr. Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, 
Mr. Tesfaldet Kidane Tesfasgi and Mr. Saleh Idris Salim are reportedly held at the facilities of 
the Central Investigation Bureau in Addis Ababa (also known as Maikelawi). Others are most 
likely held at the military bases of Debre Zeit, southeast of Addis Ababa, and Jijiga, about 60 km 
from the border with Somalia. They are all held incommunicado and are not known to have been 
given any opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention before a court. It would appear 
that the Government is detaining them on the suspicion that they might have links with the 
Council of Somali Islamic Courts or with al-Qa&#8217;ida, although no such charges are reported to 
have been formally filed against them. 
</p>
<p>128. On 20 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 77 
 
</p>
<p>expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, concerning the situation of Mr. Daniel Bekele, Head of the Policy Research and 
Advocacy Department for ActionAid International in Ethiopia, and Mr. Netsanet Demissie, 
human rights and environmental lawyer based in Addis Ababa, founder and director of the 
Organization for Social Justice in Ethiopia. Both men were arrested in November 2005, together 
with numerous human rights defenders and journalists, following demonstrations against alleged 
fraud in the general elections of May 2005 in which over 190 protestors were reportedly killed in 
clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement authorities. By the date when the 
communication was sent they were detained and were facing the charge of &#8220;crimes of outrage 
against the constitutional order&#8221; which carries a possible life sentence or death penalty. 
According to the new information received: In mid-July 2007, the 38 principal defendants in the 
trial were reportedly found guilty as charged, and most were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
Having signed a statement admitting their activities had been unconstitutional, they received a 
pardon and were freed with their civil rights restored. It is reported that international observers 
were barred from attending the trial. In August 2007, all the others accused, still on trial in the 
same case, were freed having gone through the same procedure of conviction, sentencing, pardon 
and release. However, Mr. Bekele and Mr. Demissie declined to sign any kind of statement 
admitting guilt. They appealed for bail, but on 6 August the Supreme Court heard and rejected 
their bail appeal. Few days later, the Court closed the defence case, and a verdict was scheduled 
to be delivered when the Court resumed its sessions on 9 October 2007. On 9 October 2007, the 
Court adjourned its verdict for a further 46 days to consider the evidence. A verdict is then 
expected to be given on 22 November. The charge against Mr. Bekele and Mr. Demissie carries 
a possible life sentence or death penalty. Serious concern is reiterated that Mr. Bekele and 
Mr. Demissie may not enjoy a fair trial because of their legitimate and peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights and because of their refusal to sign a statement admitting that their 
activities had been unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>129. On 24 January 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 9 January 2007, 
indicating that Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh Getnet and Meq&#233;ha Mengistu were detained by the 
Addis Ababa Police Commission for alleged violations of the Ethiopian criminal law in 
accordance with the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code and accepted international standards. 
Ethiopian law enforcement agencies have scrupulously followed appropriate legal procedures 
and due process rights while taking the aforementioned individuals to custody. Hence, the 
concern expressed regarding their physical integrity is unfounded. The detainees were brought 
before the Federal High Court within 48 hours in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code. 
The Court has allowed a remand period for police to undertake the necessary investigations. 
Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu are now held at Addis Ababa Police 
Commission&#8217;s headquarters. I would also like to assure you that Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh 
Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu are being treated humanly and in accordance with international 
norms and standards. While in detention, they are allowed visits by their family, friends and 
religious counselors.  
</p>
<p>130. On 23 May 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 2 May 2007, stating 
that the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia handed 41 individuals over to Ethiopia 
captured in the course of the conflict in Somalia. Most of these detainees have now been 
released. Only 8 of the detainees remain in custody by the order of the Court. The rest have been </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 78 
 
</p>
<p>released because of their marginal roles. These individuals were among the international 
terrorists who answered the call for Jihad by Al Shabab group of extremists against the 
Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and Ethiopia. The Government of Somalia, due to 
the lack of adequate and secure facilities or functional prisons, requested that the Government of 
Ethiopia hold these individuals and undertake investigations into their activities. However, the 
allegation that there are more than seventy others in addition to those mentioned by name in the 
communication is false. Moreover, the allegations that the detainees are held incommunicado 
and that they might be at risk of torture are without any foundation whatsoever. With the 
exception of three individuals, who refused to exercise their right, embassy or consular officials 
from their respective countries have visited the detainees. Their embassies or consular officials 
have been cooperating with the competent Ethiopian Government agencies in arranging the 
return of their nationals. It is also not true that they were not afforded the opportunity to 
challenge the legality of their detention. All detainees have appeared before the competent Court 
in obligations of the country. Although security experts from the respective countries of origin of 
the detainees have been involved in questioning some of the suspects, this was done in the 
presence of Ethiopian personnel in order to ensure that no detainee is subjected to torture, 
inhumane or degrading treatment. The physical and mental integrity of all detainees has been 
fully respected. Lastly I wish to assure you that the remaining 8 detained suspected internal 
terrorists will continue to have access to embassy or consular officials of their respective 
counties and that their due process rights are being fully respected and they have not been in any 
manner ill-treated.

its efforts to provide in a timely manner substantive information in response to the concerned 
expressed on letters sent on 9 January 2007 and on 2 May 2007. However, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the Government of 
Ethiopia, regarding the communication sent on 20 November 2007. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government of Ethiopia to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before 
the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the 
above allegation.

<p><b>Fiji 
Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>132. On 8 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the suspension 
of the Chief Justice of Fiji, Daniel Fatiaki following the takeover of the Government by the 
Republic of Fiji Military Forces on 5 December 2006. According to the information received on 
3 January 2007, Chief Justice Fatiaki was told by Deputy Commander Captain Teleni of the 
Republic of Fiji Military Forces to take leave pending an inquiry into complaints against the 
judiciary and the judicial system as a whole. Mr. Fatiaki was advised that if he refused to take 
leave, he would be removed from office. On 18 January 2007, Chief Justice Fatiaki was formally 
suspended by President Uluivuda. The President indicated that the suspension was based on 
section 138 (4) of the Constitution of Fiji. According to President Uluivuda&#8217;s note of 
18 January 2007, the suspension was processed on the grounds that the question of removing the 
Chief Justice from office ought to be investigated in terms of section 138 (3) of the Constitution. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 79 
 
</p>
<p>In this note, the President also appointed a tribunal to investigate and determine whether the 
Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki should be removed from office for breach of the provisions of 
section 138 (1) of the Constitution (&#8220;misbehaviour&#8221;). The establishment of this tribunal was 
confirmed in a letter from the Office of the President and the Vice President dated 
5 February 2007 to Chief Justice Fatiaki. However, at the time of the suspension of Chief Justice 
Fatiaki, this tribunal was not yet established, neither were its Chairperson or members appointed. 
Prior to the suspension, on 15 January 2007, the Judicial Service Commission chaired by Justice 
Nazhat Shameem met in the absence of Chief Justice Fatiaki and resolved to recommend to 
President Uluivuda the appointment of Justice Gates as Acting Chief Justice pursuant to 
section 132 (3) (a) of the Constitution of Fiji following the consultation of Attorney-General 
Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum. On 16 January 2007, Justice Gates was sworn in as Acting Chief Justice. 
Given the important role of the Judicial Service Commission, which is headed by the Chief 
Justice, for guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary as well as in the protection of human 
rights, it is also feared that irregularities in the suspension and replacement of the Chief Justice 
compromise the independence of the judiciary as a whole.  
133. On 19 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression regarding Ms. Tupou Draunidalo, vice-president of the Fiji Law Society and 
Mr. Graham Leung, lawyer in Suva. According to the information received: Mr. Aiyaz 
Sayed-Khaiyum, Interim Attorney General, has taken legal action against Ms. Tupou Draunidalo 
concerning a statement she made in May, when she allegedly said that &#8220;the confidence of 
lawyers in the judicial system, let alone the public, is shattered&#8221;. Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum allegedly 
said that in bringing this proceeding, he was acting in the public interest to protect the integrity 
and authority of the judiciary, which may be undermined by such statements. The High Court 
will hear the case on 16 August. Also, the Home Affairs Ministry imposed a travel ban on 
M. Graham Leung. On July 16, the lawyer was barred from leaving Fiji and traveling to 
Australia and New Zealand. Military spokesman Major Neumi Leweni allegedly said that 
Mr. Leung was stopped from leaving the country because he had made misrepresenting 
statements about the interim Government abroad. Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum allegedly also said that 
Mr. Leung, at the Law Asia conference, had made a number of misrepresentations in his paper 
which was printed in The Fiji Times. He indicated that Mr. Leung misinformed the gathering by 
stating that members of the legal profession representing clients in constitutional matters were 
being silenced. Finally, it is reported that on 18 July, the travel ban against Mr. Leung was lifted. 
Mr. Leung&#8217;s lawyer indicated that he will still pursue a judicial review of the matter, which is 
currently before a judge. 
<b>Communications received  
</b></p>
<p>134. On 31 October 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 19 July 2007, 
indicating that the legal proceeding against Ms. Tupou Draunidalo is in action for &#8220;contempt of 
Court&#8221;. The principle of judicial independence implies an obligation of the Attorney General to 
defend the courts. His intervention ensures that attacks on the judiciary are responded. In 
instituting contempt of court, the Attorney General was merely exercising a duty of protecting 
the integrity and authority of the judiciary. It will be the court that will adjudicate on whether 
there is contempt. Regarding Mr. Graham Leung, the Government stated that the matter is 
currently before the courts and the facts of the case are still not determined. However, it can be 
affirmed that there are currently no bans or restriction imposed on Mr. Leung&#8217;s movement or </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>travel. The Government has also affirmed that not complaint has been lodged by Ms. Tupou 
Draunidalo or Mr. Graham Leung. Regarding the measures taken to guarantee the freedom of 
expression and the freedom of movement, the Government stated that those rights have not been 
limited in any way to Mr. Graham Leung, nor to Ms. Tupou Draunidalo. In the case of 
Ms. Tupou Draunidalo, the court proceeding against her does not interfere with her freedom of 
express opinions. However, this proceeding demonstrates that the freedom of expression is not 
unlimited. In the case of Mr. Leung, is free to express his opinions subject to existing laws of 
Fiji. He can also travel when and if he pleases.

<p>138. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial remercie le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais pour sa coop&#233;ration et pour sa 
r&#233;ponse d&#233;taill&#233;e. Il souhaite cependant appeler son attention sur la Convention contre la torture 
et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, notamment l&#8217;article 2. De m&#234;me, 
il voudrait appeler l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement sur l&#8217;article 4 qui dispose que tout Etat partie 
veille &#224; ce que tous les actes de torture constituent des infractions au regard de son droit p&#233;nal. Il 
en est de m&#234;me de la tentative de pratiquer la torture ou de tout acte commis par n&#8217;importe quelle 
personne qui constitue une complicit&#233; ou une participation &#224; l&#8217;acte de torture. Le Rapporteur 
Sp&#233;cial est inquiet du fait que l&#8217;immunit&#233; diplomatique ne soit utilis&#233;e comme argument pour ne 
pas enqu&#234;ter sur la possible commission d&#8217;actes de torture. De la Convention contre la torture et

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>139. On 13 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, regarding an alleged 
violation of the independence of the judiciary which was brought to his attention in relation 
to a criminal complaint filed in Germany on 29 November 2004 against ten high ranking 
United States of America&#8217;s civil and military officials, including Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld. This communication was sent to the Government with some delay in relation 
to the facts, since the Special Rapporteur was hoping that other initiatives he took would lead to 
proper investigations of these and other similar complaints. However, faced with a lack of 
investigations and effective remedy for the victims after a prolonged period of time, and in light 
of the reiterated concerns expressed by a number of governmental and non-governmental 
organizations in this respect, he took the decision to submit to the Government&#8217;s attention the 
following serious concerns. According to the information received, the above-mentioned 
criminal complaint was filed with the German Federal Prosecutor&#8217;s office at the Karlsruhe Court 
by the Berlin attorney Wolfgang Kaleck, from Republican Attorneys&#8217; Association (RAV), the 
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), the International Federation for 
Human Rights (FIDH) and Lawyers Against the War (LAW), on behalf of first four and later on 
17 Iraqis plaintiffs who alleged they were victims of very serious crimes including torture by 
means of severe beatings, sleep and food deprivation, hooding and sexual abuse, when they were 
detained in Iraq by the United States military. The complaint was filed under the German Code </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 83 
 
</p>
<p>of Crimes against International Law (hereinafter &#8220;the German Code&#8221;). The charges include 
violations of the German Code which outlaws killing, torture, cruel and inhumane treatment, 
sexual coercion and forcible transfers. The German Code makes criminally responsible those 
who carry out the above acts as well as those who induce, condone or order the acts. It also 
makes commanders liable, whether civilian or military, who fail to prevent their subordinates 
from committing such acts. It is my understanding that the German Code grants German Courts 
what is called Universal Jurisdiction for the above-described crimes, in light of article 1, Part 1, 
Section 1 of the Code which states: &#8220;This Act shall apply to all criminal offences against 
international law designated under this Act, to serious criminal offences designated therein even 
when the offence was committed abroad and bears no relation to Germany.&#8221; This means that 
those who commit serious crimes under this Act can be prosecuted wherever found. Therefore, it 
is my understanding that the German Code places a prosecuting duty on the German prosecutor 
for all such crimes, irrespective of the location of the person, the crime, or the nationality of 
the persons involved. According to the information received, mainly originating from 
non-governmental organizations and the press, following the filing of the complaint, a strong 
pressure was exercised by the United States of America on Germany to obtain the dismissal of 
the complaint. Such pressures included open threats to the effect that the bilateral relations 
between the two countries could be at risk if the complaint was not dismissed. In addition, 
the Pentagon would have openly threatened the German prosecution by indicating that 
Donald Rumsfeld would not attend the Munich Security Conference in February 2005 if 
the complaint was not dismissed. Two days before the Munich Security Conference, 
on 10 February 2005, the German prosecutor issued a decision to dismiss the case. As a result, 
Donald Rumsfeld could attend the conference. In this context, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
his deep concern that a decision by the prosecutor on a case involving such serious crimes has 
been taken in a context of strong political pressure by the country of citizenship of the 
defendants. While the prosecutor was seized of the matter for little more than two months, it is 
hard to believe that it is a coincidence that a decision to dismiss the complaint intervenes just two 
days before the Munich conference, just in time to allow the United States of America Secretary 
of Defense to attend the meeting. In addition, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concern 
regarding the weakness of the legal justification of the dismissal. The prosecutor justified the 
dismissal by alleging that in virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, the German system should 
only prosecute under the universal jurisdiction when the State first called upon to adjudicate (in 
this case the State of citizenship of the defendants), or an international Court, are unwilling or 
unable to prosecute, and that in this case there are no indications that the authorities of the 
United States of America are refraining or would refrain to prosecute the violations described in 
the complaint. According to the prosecutor, the prosecution of the violations is therefore left to 
the judicial authorities of the United States of America, and he therefore dismissed the case. In 
relation to this analysis, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that the criminal procedures against 
low-ranking figures for crimes committed in Abu Ghraib and other detention facilities have 
shown the unwillingness of the military criminal justice system to look into the involvement of 
those up the chain of command. Moreover, in the United States of America&#8217;s military criminal 
justice system, the main defendant, Donald Rumsfeld, sits as the ultimate convening authority: 
therefore, the basic requirements for an independent trial cannot be fulfilled. Also, the 
United States of America Congress, vested by the Constitution with oversight authority, failed to 
seriously investigate the abuses and none of the various commissions appointed by the military 
and the Bush administration has been willing to investigate up the chain of command to consider 
what criminal responsibility lies with the military and political leadership. Finally, there are </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 84 
 
</p>
<p>no international or Iraqi courts that can carry out investigations and prosecutions of the 
United States of America role, since the United States of America has not joined the 
International Criminal Court, thereby foreclosing the option of pursuing a prosecution in 
international courts, and Iraq has no authority to prosecute since the United States of America 
gave immunity to all its personnel in Iraq from Iraqi prosecution. In the light of the elements 
mentioned above, which suggest that the prosecutorial authority would have failed to act in an 
impartial, independent and objective manner, The Special Rapporteur expressed his deep 
concern regarding the violation of the principle of the independence of the judiciary, as 
enshrined in recognized international norms and standards, including article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the United Nations Basic Principles on 
Independence of the Judiciary. Moreover, the elements mentioned above, added to the unusual 
short length of the decision to dismiss and the lack of reference to the extensive arguments and 
documents submitted by the plaintiffs, suggest that the prosecutor has failed to comply with his 
obligations of independence, impartiality and objectivity. 
<b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>140. On 18 June 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter sent on 13 July 2006. The 
Government apologized for having missed by mistake to present the translations of the response 
before. The Government presented 3 documents: translation of the decision of the Public 
Prosecutor General of 10 February 2005, translation of the decision of the Sttuttgart Higher 
Regional Court of 13 September 2005 and response to the letter sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on 16 July 2006. According to the response, on 30 November 2004, Mr. Wolfang Kaleck, 
brought criminal charges on behalf of the Center of Constitutional Rights and four Iraqi citizens, 
against ten high ranking United States of America&#8217;s civil and military officials and the Secretary 
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The charges were the perpetration of very serious crimes including 
torture, allegedly occurred when the complainants were detained in Iraq by the United States 
military. According to the decision of the Public Prosecutor General of 10 February 2005, the 
charges will not be followed up, because there is no room for the German investigative 
authorities to take action. The application of the principle of universal jurisdiction established in 
the CCAIL, depends upon the principle of subsidiarity. The purpose of the CCAIL is to close 
gaps in punish ability and criminal prosecution. Nevertheless, this must be done without 
intervening in the affairs of other States. This also follows from article 17 of the Statute of 
Rome, which establishes that ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction is subsidiary to the jurisdiction of the State of 
the perpetrated act or of the perpetrator, the ICC can only act if the nation-states initially called 
upon to pass sentence are unwilling or unable to prosecute. The ICC Statute constitutes the 
guiding principle for the interpretation and application of section 153f StPO (Criminal 
Procedural Code). According to these principles, the primary jurisdiction for the criminal 
prosecution is with the United States of America as the defendants&#8217; home country. In the present 
case there are no indications that the courts or authorities of the United States of America 
refrained or would refrain from taking penal measures as regards the assaults described in the 
complaint. Regarding the individuals indicted who are residing in Germany, as personnel of the 
US Army, they are subject to follow their employer&#8217;s orders. The United States of America, as 
the prosecuting State, has unrestricted access to these individuals. Moreover, according to the 
decision of the Sttuttgart Higher Regional Court of 13 September 2005, the representative of 
complainants appealed the decision of the Public Prosecutor General of 10 February 2005, 
initially by filing an application dated 10 March 2005 with Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court for 
a Court decision. By decision of 27 June 2005 Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court declared that it </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 85 
 
</p>
<p>was no competent in the matter. Mr. Kaleck filed an application with Sttutgart Higher Regional 
Court for a preliminary decision of the Constitutional Court (article 102 Basic Law), 
regarding the relationship between the principle of worldwide uniform law under CCAIL and 
section 153f StPO. The application also requested a court decision ordering the preferment of 
public charges against the indicted individuals or rather ordering the Public Prosecutor General 
to launch investigations. The Public Prosecutor has been given the opportunity to submit an 
explanation. He stated that the procedure for compelling public charges is inadmissible. The 
High Regional Court decided that it was competent on the matter. According to the court, the 
procedure for compelling public charges is not permitted, because the contested order is subject 
to the principle of discretionary prosecution under section 153f StPO. As regards the individuals 
who do not reside in Germany the conditions of section 153f first sentence StPO are fulfilled. As 
regards the individuals who reside in Germany, the contested order issued by the Prosecutor 
General was based on section 153f second sentence StPO. Even if these four individuals are 
stationed at US based in Germany, they are subject to US jurisdiction. There is thus not gap in 
punishability, which must be avoided by universal jurisdiction. Therefore, the decision of the 
Public Prosecutor General of 10 February 2005 is legally correct. The same would apply, if one 
of the six indicted living out Germany were to spend a fixed period residing in the area in which 
the CCAIL had jurisdiction. Moreover, the Court decided that there is no legal cause for 
complaint regarding of the Public Prosecutor General&#8217;s discretionary decision. This decision can 
only be examined against the background of a court&#8217;s competence to carry out an examination as 
to whether or not discretion has been exercised or whether or not the line has been overstepped 
and arbitrary action has been taken. The contested order in the present case can be classified 
neither as subject to a lack of exercise of discretion, nor to that arbitrariness. The German 
legislator introduced section 153fStPO in order to limit the massive enlargement of jurisdiction 
of German criminal prosecution. The Public Prosecutor General is competent to decide on 
matters affecting section 153fStPO, as the highest prosecution authority. He is the sole master of 
the proceedings, even after the main proceedings have been opened, as illustrated by his 
competence of withdrawing a complaint at any stage in the proceedings. Neither the approval 
of the court nor that of the indicted individual or the joint plaintiff is required for a complaint to 
be withdrawn. Finally, according to the response to the letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
16 July 2006, the Public Prosecutor was not in fact issued with any instructions by the Federal 
Ministry of Justice, nor was any other influence exerted on him by the federal Government to 
persuade him not to launch investigations in on the Abu Gahrib allegations. The response retakes 
the legal reasons on which the decision of the Public Prosecutor General of 10 February 2005 
and the decision of the Sttuttgart Higher Regional Court of 13 September 2005 were based. In 
addition, explains that the Public Prosecutor office in Germany is an organ of the criminal justice 
system, equal in ranks to the courts. It is charged of investigating and presenting cases before the 
courts. It is a sui generis body, with similarities both the Executive and the Judiciary, and leases 
between this two branches. Public Prosecutors are not independent as is the judiciary, but are 
bound by the instructions of their superiors (ultimately the Minister of Justice) and are thus to 
that extent part of the Executive. It is accountable to the Parliament through the Minister of 
Justice. Neither the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, nor article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulate that 
prosecutors must be independent and cannot be given orders by their superiors. As regards the 
UN Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, it should be clearly stated that the inclusion of the list 
of means of exerting undue pressure does not mean that prosecuting agencies must in all 
situations be entirely independent and subject to no instructions from superiors whatsoever. </p>

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations 
</b></p>
<p>141. The SR thanks the Government of Germany for its response of 18 June 2007. However, he 
remains concerned by the fact that the Government while affirming that the Public Prosecutor 
was not issued with any instructions by the Federal Ministry of Justice, nor the Federal 
Government, affirms that in Germany prosecutors are not independent and are subjected to their 
superiors, in particular the Minister of Justice. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the fact 
that in several countries the Prosecution Office is not considered to be as part of the judicial 
system. Nevertheless, according to international human rights standards, in particular, the 
Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in Havana, Cuba on 27 August 
to 7 September 1990, they are obliged to carry out their functions impartially and avoid all 
political, social, religious, racial, cultural, sexual or any other kind of discrimination. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to reiterate his concern that in the light of the facts mentioned above, the 
decisions of dismissing the case has been taken in a context of an allegedly strong political 
pressure, which could have compromised the impartiality of the competent organ.

<p>142. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
related intolerance concerning Mr. Theo Alexandridis, legal counsel with the Greek Helsinki 
Monitor (GHM) and other staff members of the GHM. The GHM is an organisation that 
monitors and reports on human rights violations in Greece, including violations against the 
Roma community. According to the information received, on 19 April 2005 the Greek Minister 
of Health and the Secretary General of Social Solidarity, publicly accused non-governmental 
organisations of &#8220;existing only on paper&#8221; and of &#8220;publishing negative reports on the basis of 
unreliable, exaggerated and misleading information on the victims of the smuggling of human 
beings in Greece, in order to obtain an increase in funding from the Greek Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs&#8221;. It is reported that the GHM was specifically named in these accusations. It is further 
reported that GHM lodged a complaint against the Minister of Health and the Secretary General 
of Social Solidarity. On 13 October 2005 Mr. Alexandridis was arrested and detained in the Psair 
neighbourhood in Aspropyrgos, near Athens. It is reported that Mr. Alexandridis had gone to the 
police station to lodge a complaint against parents of non Roma children who had allegedly 
committed violent acts against demonstrators who were protesting against the expulsion of 
Roma children from a school in the area. It is alleged that after he had filed the complaint 
Mr. Alexandridis was told he was under arrest and was detained for four hours before being 
released without charge. Moreover, the president of the Pupils&#8217; Parents Association allegedly 
lodged a complaint against Mr. Alexandridis for &#8220;libel&#8221; and &#8220;defamation&#8221;. On 20 January 2006 it 
is reported that the Head of the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, during a radio interview, stated that 
all Roma are crime perpetrators and announced that &#8220;perpetrators, instigators and accomplices&#8221; 
of Roma people who helped the latter in a case concerning the alleged forced expulsion of Roma 
families in the Makrigianni area of the city of Patras, would be &#8220;called on to take the stand&#8221;, 
specifically including as potential targets representatives of GHM. It is reported that the Head of 
the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s stated in the same radio interview that he had opened an inquiry into </p>

  page 87 
 
</p>
<p>the involvement of the GHM in petitioning the First Instance Prosecutor to open a criminal 
investigation into alleged illegal evictions and attacks against Roma people in Makrigianni. 
Concern was expressed that the above mentioned events are connected with the legitimate 
activities of Mr. Alexandridis and the GHM in defence of human rights, in particular because of 
their involvement in defending the legal rights of the Roma community in Greece.

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>143. On 29 August 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 2 June 2006 
stating the following facts regarding the detention of Mr. Alexandridis: At the beginning of 
the 2005 school year among the 360 Greek children attending the 10th and 11th Primary Schools 
of Aspropyrgos, there were 24 Roma children. These schools operate in a single building 
complex at the city of Aspropyrgos, near Athens. A large number of parents have objected to the 
attendance of the Roma Children. As a result, on 13 October 2005 at 15.30 about 60 persons 
assembled to prevent the entry of 8 Roma pupils in the school. These pupils were accompanied 
by the representative of the Greek Helsinki Monitor Mr. Theodoros Alexandridis, who was a 
trainee lawyer. Half an hour later, following consultations between those assembled, the school 
Direction and after the intervention of the Greek police, the Roma pupils entered the schools and 
attended classes. At about 18.30, Mr. Alexandridis went to the Police station of Aspropyrgos and 
filed charges against the President of the Parents and Guardians Association of the 
aforementioned Primary Schools, Mrs. Eleni Panda, who was consequently arrested. Charges 
were also filed against unnamed men, for violation of articles 330, 361 and 33 of the Greek Penal 
Code. Three persons were also arrested for violation of article 330 of the Penal Code (illegal 
violence), because along with others, they tried to prevent the access of pupils in the school. 
At the Police Station of Aspropyrgos, Mrs. Eleni Panda filed charges, as well, against 
Mr. Theodoros Alexandridis, for insult and false complaints and, as a result of that action, 
Mr. Alexandridis was also arrested. At 21.45 of the same day, the Public Prosecutor of Criminal 
Proceedings was informed by phone and ordered the Police not to initiate the &#8220;flagrante delicto&#8221; 
procedure. Therefore, the arrested persons were released after registering their pleas. The brief 
was submitted to the Public Prosecutor of the Magistrate Court of Athens for follow up action. It 
should be noted that following that incident, the Officers of Aspropyrgos Police Station, 
whenever so requested by representatives of the Greek Helsinki Monitor, have always provided 
assistance so that registered Roma pupils could enter their schools and attend classes, despite 
reactions of some parents. Moreover, police officers have been at the school on a daily basis and 
took appropriate measures to protect Roma pupils when they enter and leave the schools.

que la comunicaci&#243;n no est&#225; comprendida en el per&#237;odo que cubre el mismo. De acuerdo con la 
respuesta del Gobierno, se han adelantado investigaciones de los hechos arriba mencionados, 
incluyendo el an&#225;lisis de la escena del cr&#237;men, an&#225;lisis por parte del Departamento T&#233;cnico 
Cient&#237;fico de las evidencias encontradas en la escena del crimen, diligencias con el fin de

investigaci&#243;n que permitir&#237;a identificar a los responsables de los hechos punibles. En respuesta a 
la pregunta de si se han indemnizado a los familiares de las v&#237;ctimas, el Gobierno respondi&#243; que 
de conformidad con la Consitutci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica (art&#237;culo 101.b), es obligaci&#243;n del empleador 
otorgar al c&#243;nyuge, conviviente o hijos menores de un trabajador que fallezca estando en

embargo, lamenta que la respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada haya llegado dos a&#241;os despu&#233;s de

respuesta hace alusi&#243;n a ciertas acciones que se han tomado en el marco de las investigaciones 
iniciadas por el Ministerio P&#250;blico, pero no indica respecto de qu&#233; casos. Tampoco queda claro 
el tema de la indemnizaci&#243;n, puesto que no se aclara en qu&#233; casos la misma ha sido adjudicada a 
las v&#237;ctimas y/o sus familias. Es por ello que el Relator solicita al Gobierno que por favor 
proporcione informaciones detalladas respecto de cada uno de los casos mencionados, 
incluyendo las medidas que se han tomado para identificar a los responsables de los cr&#237;menes 
mencionados, as&#237; como las medidas que se han tomado para reparar a las v&#237;ctimas y a sus

<p>150. On 18 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women on violence against Dalit Women in India. According to the information 
received, Dalits women and men suffer descent based discrimination in various aspects of their 
lives; they are also victims of violence and untouchability practices (based on notions of Dalits&#8217; 
supposed impurity) arising out of the caste system. While both men and women are 
discriminated and suffer from social exclusion, Dalit women are confronted with discrimination, 
exclusion and violence to a larger extent than men. They are indeed not only discriminated by 
people of higher casts but also by men of their own communities. The case of Dalit women is </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 92 
 
</p>
<p>specific because of their socio-economic positioning at the bottom of the caste, class and gender 
hierarchies. Dalit women face violence in the community and in their family, from State and 
private actors alike belonging to various castes and socio-economic groupings, and of both sexes. 
The major forms of violence that Dalit women are subject to are: physical and verbal abuse, 
sexual harassment, abduction, and sexual violence, including rape. On many occasions, cases of 
violence against Dalit women are not registered by the police and opportunities for intervention 
in the legal system are inexistent due to a general lack of law enforcement. Women are unaware 
of the laws protecting their rights and their ignorance is easily exploited by the perpetrators, and 
some members of the police and the judiciary. Allegedly, even if the cases are reported to the 
police, and the perpetrators arrested, they are usually released on bail and women do not receive 
justice as a result. The Indian government adopted the &#8220;Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled 
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act&#8221; in 1989, to prevent atrocities against Scheduled Castes 
and Tribes. According to this act, in cases of violence against Dalits, including physical or sexual 
violence against Dalit women, the police are obliged to register the case. However, the police 
often refuse to register the case under this act, because the act imposes high prison sentences and 
fines and the police may not agree with the purpose of the act and may try to protect the 
perpetrators (who are their fellow caste members) by not registering cases at all, or registering 
them under a different act. If a case is not registered under the Prevention of Atrocities Act, it is 
possible for the perpetrator to receive anticipatory bail which, especially in rape cases, in 
practice means that the case remains in full impunity. This goes against a Supreme Court 
judgement that ruled that anticipatory bail should not be available in cases within the Prevention 
of Atrocities Act (Case 1995-1198, State of M.P. &amp; anr. vs. Respondent, Ram Krishna 
Balothia &amp; anr, judgement of 6 February 1995). The Supreme Court also ruled that anticipatory 
bail can be denied for the purpose of investigation (Case 2005-326), which would apply to most 
rape cases, but this is allegedly not implemented in practice (Appeal (crl.) 326 of 2005, Adri 
Dharan Das v. State of West Bengal, judgement of 21 February 2005). The experts brought to 
the Government&#8217;s attention some specific cases which outline the impunity that seems to prevail 
with respect to ensuring protection and redress for Dalit women victims of physical and sexual 
violence. The common elements of these cases are the lack of investigation, not prosecution of 
alleged perpetrators. The experts expressed serious concern that the perpetrators of these acts of 
violence against members of the Dalit community continue to enjoy impunity and asked the 
Government to take all necessary measures to ensure accountability of any person guilty of the 
alleged violations. Moreover, they called the Government to take all necessary measures to 
prevent similar attacks on persons belonging to the Dalit caste in the future and to guarantee that 
the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected.

<p>153. On 23 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
regarding the persons mentioned below. According to the information received, 
Ali Farahbakhsh, former reporter of the banned dailies Yas-e No and Shargh, was detained in 
November by security officers after he returned from a civil society conference in Bangkok 
about &#8220;Media and the Government&#8221;. Since then and for more than 40 days, Mr. Farahbakhsh has 
been reportedly detained under the suspicion of espionage, though no charges have been filed 
against him. The Director of prisons in Teheran province has allegedly confirmed that 
Mr. Farahbakhsh is still in custody. Concerns have been expressed that his detention may be 
related to his work as a journalist and his recent participation in the said conference in Bangkok. 
On 18 December 2006, Mr. Javanmard, a journalist of the daily Krafto, which is based in the 
capital of the Kurdish region Sanadej, was arrested at his home by officials from the ministry of 
intelligence. Mr. Javanmard is still being held at Sanandej prison without charges. 
On 27 October 2006, Mr. Hesen Rashidi, a journalist and writer, was sentenced to one year 
imprisonment and 5 years of suspended sentence. Mr. Rashidi has appealed the sentence during 
the first week of November. Reportedly the charges and the sentence brought against him are 
related to his activities on the promotion of the Azerbaijani identity, his engagement in research 
about Southern Azerbaijani history and culture and his articles and conferences on this question. 
It has been reported that Mr. Rashidi had no access to a lawyer during the interrogations and the 
proceedings, and that the court hearings were held in closed sessions.

<p>154. On 6 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding 
Mr. Abdul Rasoul Mazraeh, also known as Mr. Abdullah Abdulhamid Al Tamimi, which is the 
name under which he was registered with the file registration number 15010 by the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&#8217; office in Damascus, Syria. According to the 
information received, Mr. Mazraeh is an Ahwazi from the south-western region of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and was accepted by UNHCR&#8217;s Damascus office in Syria as refugee. He was 
arrested by Syrian security forces on 11 May 2006 and handed over to Iranian authorities in 
Tehran on 15 May 2006. Since his arrest he has not had access to a lawyer and has been detained 
in solitary confinement. Mr. Mazraeh is expected to go on trial in March, however, it remains 
unclear what charges are put against him. He was physically and mentally ill-treated while in 
detention. As a result, he reportedly carries blood in his urine, his liver and kidneys are not 
functioning and he lost all of his teeth. Furthermore, he is paralysed because his spine has been 
damaged. Grave concerns are expressed with respect to the physical and mental integrity and 
health of Mr. Abdul Rasoul Mazraeh, particularly in view of his reportedly continued 
incommunicado detention in solitary confinement. 
</p>
<p>155. On 30 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding 
Mr. Mohammad Hassan Fallahiya, journalist by profession, managing editor of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p>&#8216;Aqlam al-Talaba&#8217; (&#8220;The Students&#8217; Pens&#8221;), a publication issued by students from Ahvaz 
University in the Khuzestan province, correspondent for several Arab television and radio 
broadcasting news agencies including Abu Dhabi TV and Radio in the United Arab Emirates, 
and journalist for the Lebanese &#8216;al-Mustaqbal&#8217; broadcasting corporation. According to the 
information received, Mr. Mohammad Hassan Fallahiya was detained in November 2006 and 
held in Section 209 of Evin Prison in Tehran. On 21 April 2007, Mr. Fallahiya was sentenced to 
three years&#8217; imprisonment with hard labour on charges related to allegations of publishing 
articles criticizing the Government and allegedly contacting opposition groups based outside 
Iran. He was not afforded legal representation at any point in the judicial process. Mr. Fallahiya 
is serving his sentence at Evin Prison. Mr. Fallahiya suffers from sickle cell anaemia, an 
inherited blood disorder that affects red blood cells, for which he needs regular antibiotics and 
access to medical examinations. In addition, he suffers from heart problems. According to his 
family, the prison authorities have refused to allow them to bring in supplies of his medication. 
</p>
<p>156. On 5 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr. Ali Shakeri, a peace activist and founding 
board member of the University of California, Irvine, Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, and 
Dr. Kian Tajbakhsh, a social scientist at the New School in New York who has worked as a 
consultant for the Open Society Institute and the World Bank. According to the information 
received, since early May 2007, Mr. Shakeri and Dr. Tajbakhsh have been held in section 209 of 
Evin Prison in Tehran on charge of &#8220;acting against national security by engaging in propaganda 
against the Islamic Republic through spying on behalf of foreigners&#8221;. Both men are being 
detained incommunicado and denied access to their lawyers and families. With a view on 
Mr. Shakeri&#8217;s and Dr. Tajbakhsh&#8217;s incommunicado detention, concern was expressed for their 
physical and mental integrity. Further concern was expressed that their arrest and detention may 
be related to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, and may form part of a pattern 
of harassment against human rights defenders who promote respect for human rights norms in 
the country.  
</p>
<p>157. On 30 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, regarding Shi&#8217;a cleric Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni 
Boroujerdi, Iranian citizen, aged 49. According to the information received, Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s 
trial was held on 10 June 2007 before the Special Court for the Clergy. He was denied legal 
counsel. It is unclear whether he was sentenced to death or whether his case is still under 
consideration. Allegedly the trial is related to Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s religious views since he supports 
freedom of religion and the separation between religion and politics. Mr. Boroujerdi is currently 
detained in Evin prison, where, on top of the severe conditions of detention, he has been beaten 
and had cold water spilled on him while he was sleeping. Although he suffers from Parkinson&#8217;s 
disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart problems, Mr. Boroujerdi had reportedly been 
denied permission to seek treatment at the prison&#8217;s medical facility until he started a hunger 
strike on 22 July 2007. </p>

<p>158. On 8 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding 
Ms. Masoume Mansoori, student from Amir Kabir University. According to the information 
received: Ms. Mansoori was arrested on and has been detained incommunicado since 
25 October 2007 in Tehran at an undisclosed place of detention after having attempted to collect 
her father&#8217;s belongings from the public prosecutors&#8217; office. Mr. Mansoori had been detained for 
reasons yet unknown in September 2007. Mr. Mansoori&#8217;s family had been threatened with 
detention before when they inquired with the competent court about his whereabouts. Officials 
from the Ministry of the Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran had previously telephoned 
the Mansoori family a number of times insisting either to cease following up on Mr. Mansoori&#8217;s 
situation or to face detention. They were also warned not to discuss his arrest with the media. 
Ms. Mansoori received a call 14 days prior to her arrest and detention from members of the 
Ministry and was threatened not to participate in any demonstration. It is believed that her recent 
arrest is connected with her activities in the recent demonstrations. After her arrest, officials 
from the Ministry also called her brother and urged him not to speak with anyone about her 
arrest or to seek the legal counsel of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani taking-up Mr. Mansoori&#8217;s case. 
Ms. Mansoori is suffering from nervous predicaments. In view of her alleged incommunicado 
detention at an unknown place, concern is expressed that Ms. Mansoori might be at risk of 
ill-treatment. Further concern is expressed for her state of health since it is reported that she 
would face grave consequences should her medical treatment be discontinued. 
</p>
<p>159. On 15 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, concerning the situation of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer at the Bar of Tehran 
and a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). According to the 
information received, Mr. Soltani was invited by the non-Governmental organisation 
International Federation of Human Rights to participate in a conference on &#8220;Freedom of 
expression in Iran&#8221; that was held at the Sorbonne university on 27 October 2007 in Paris. 
However, Mr. Soltani was unable to travel to France because his identity documents 
(i.e. passport and family record book) have not been returned to him yet after his acquittal on 
28 May 2007 of all charges that were pending against him since July 2005. Concern was 
expressed that the abovementioned interference with the freedom of movement of Mr. Soltani 
may be linked to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>160. On 23 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, regarding Mr. Sa&#8217;id Metinpour, a human rights defender 
advocating Azerbaijani linguistic and cultural rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. According 
to new information received, Mr. Metinpour, who has been in detention for eight months, has 
had no access to a lawyer. He was transferred to Section 209 of Evin Prison in Tehran 
on 4 December 2007, where he was permitted his first family visit since his arrest. Before being 
transferred to Evin prison Mr. Metinpour spent 205 days in solitary confinement. He also had 
objects, such as slippers and jugs, inserted into his mouth by officials. The mandate holders 
highlighted that Mr. Metinpour was in urgent need of medical attention due to a dermatitis 
contracted during his detention. The mandate holders expressed their serious concern for 
Mr. Metinpour&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity while in detention. </p>

Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the arrest of 
Mr. Behrouz Seferi, Iranian Azerbaijani human rights activist and his wife, Ms. Layla Heydari. 
According to the information received, Mr. Behrouz Seferi, who had campaigned for Iran&#8217;s 
Azerbaijani minority to be given greater rights to use their mother tongue, has been detained 
without charge or trial since late May or early June 2007. He has not been allowed to consult a 
lawyer. Mr. Seferi was arrested shortly after demonstrations around the first anniversary of the 
publication of a cartoon in an Iranian newspaper which many Iranian Azerbaijanis found 
offensive. He was held in his home town of Zanjan until 4 December 2007, when, according to 
sources, he was moved to Evin Prison. Reportedly, his wife, Ms. Layla Heydari, has been 
detained since 28 August 2007. According to the information received, Ms. Heydari ran a 
shop selling Azerbaijani books, music and other cultural material until the authorities closed it 
down in 2006. She obeyed official warnings not to publicise her husband&#8217;s arrest, but on 
28 August 2007 she was summoned to visit him at the Ministry of Intelligence detention 
centre where he was held at the time, and was arrested. She too was moved to Evin Prison 
on 4 December 2007.  
</p>
<p>162. On 12 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on

electronic journal called &#8220;ArtCult&#8221;, and prominent member of an organisation called &#8220;Students 
for Freedom and Equality&#8221; (&#8220;Daneshjouyan-e Azadi Khah va Beraber Talab&#8221;). According to the 
information received, Mr. Amin Ghaza&#8217;i was arrested in Tehran on 14 January 2008 at a 
meeting along with 14 other students. He is currently being held without charge or trial in 
solitary confinement in Section 209 of Evin Prison in Tehran and has been ill-treated. 
On 15 January 2008 the police searched Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i&#8217;s home and confiscated his computer and 
papers. On 30 January 2008, Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i was allowed a three minute telephone conversation 
with his family in the presence of guards, during which he appeared to be intimidated. Apart 
from this phone call Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i has not been allowed access to his family or a lawyer. 
Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i suffers from a peptic ulcer, heart problems, and asthma. Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i has published 
articles on the internet and written books about gender identity and has translated into the Persian 
language books on the subject, which are banned in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p><p>163. On 10 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the arrest of 
Mr. Reza Daghestani, an Azerbaijani rights activist, at his family&#8217;s house in the city of 
Oroumiye. Mr. Reza Daghestani is the editor of a student newsletter, Chamlibel, published in 
both Azerbaijani Turkic and Persian and he has written for several other publications; he started 
a series of Azerbaijani Turkic classes in the town of Naghadeh and established groups to 
organize peaceful demonstrations in the province of West Azerbaijan in connection with 
International Mother Tongue Day on 21 February. He was a member of the committee of a 
campaign group called Urmu Azerbaijan Sesi, which actively supported several would-be </p>

</p>
<p>candidates from Oroumiye who all were disqualified from standing for the Majles (parliament) 
elections to be held on 14 March. According to information received, during Mr. Daghestani&#8217;s 
arrest on 21 February 2008, his house was searched and his computer, CDs, papers and books 
were confiscated, along with printouts of his newsletters. Mr. Daghestani called his family 
on 22 February 2008, saying he was being held in a detention centre belonging to the Ministry of 
Intelligence in Oroumiye. Mr. Daghestani has had no access to a lawyer and his family. When 
his family tried to visit him on 25 February, they were told that visits would not be allowed until 
at least 10 March. The experts expressed their fear that Mr. Daghestani may have been tortured 
to force him to provide information, as security forces searched his house a second time 
on 26 February and appeared to know where to find other papers and books.  
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>164. On 28 February 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 23 January 2007 indicating that Mr. Ali Farahbakhsh has been charged with &#8220;espionage&#8221;. 
His legal dossier has been examined by the Office of Public Prosecutor and has been sent to the 
relevant court. Regarding Mr. Javanmard, he has been charged with &#8220;measures against the 
security of the country&#8221; by participating in the riots in the City of Sanandaj (Western Iran) on 
1st August 2005. He has been sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment. This sentence has been 
commuted by the appellate court to 2 years. It is important to note that the above mentioned 
person continued his actions against the country even during the period of his trial and was 
detained again for his second charge. He is serving his prison term for his first sentence. 
Regarding Mr. Hesen Rashidi, the local judiciary authority of both Western and Eastern 
Azerbaijan have announced that they did not find any record of such person in their database. 
The issue will be re-examined if the source can provide complete details of this person. The first 
name is an irregular name in Iran.  
</p>
<p>165. On 23 August 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 6 March 2007 
indicating that Mr. Abdul Rasoul Mazraeh is the head of the military wing of the terrorist group 
known as &#8220;MIAAD&#8221; and following participation in several terrorist operations, he had illegally 
fled from Iran to Syria, where, subsequent to his identification by the local pertinent authorities, 
as well as the issuance of writ of arrest by INTERPOL, he was arrested and extradited to the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. All the allegations reflected in the above-mentioned letter, including 
torture, his illness in prison, lack of access to lawyer as well as to his family are categorically 
denied. Mr. Mazraeh has been in good health. He has, frequently, met his family, and has made 
phone calls to them. Besides, he has enjoyed two times of city leave (out of prison, under police 
control) in December 2006 and March 2007. This case is presently going through investigation 
and legal proceeding in the competent court with the information and presence of Mr. Mazraeh&#8217;s 
defense lawyers at different stages. No final verdict is, yet, issued. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>166. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iran for its cooperation and its response 
to his communication of 23 January 2007 and of 6 March 2007. However, regarding the response 
dated on 28 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the long 
period of time in which Mr. Ali Farahbakhsh and Mr. Javanmard have been detained without any 
formal charges. He is also very concerned by the affirmation made by the local judiciary 
authority of both Western and Eastern Azerbaijan that Mr. Hesen Rashidi has no records in their </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 98 
 
</p>
<p>database. The Special Rapporteur requests the Government to indicate whether he continues to 
be detained, as well as to indicate which measures have been taken to guarantee his rights. The 
Special Rapporteur is also concerned at the absence of reply to its communications of 
30 May 2007, 5 July 2007, 30 August 2007, 8 November 2007, 15 November 2007, 
23 January 2008, 5 February 2008, 12 February 2008 and 10 March 2008, and urges the 
Government to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth 
session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>167. On 9 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Mr. Muhammad Shami, a lawyer in Iraq. According to the information received, on 
4 April 2007, Muhammad Shami left work earlier then usual. The same afternoon, two of his 
colleagues were shot dead at their desks in his office. Since then, Mr. Shami has not returned to 
his office for fear of being attacked. Mr. Shami and his colleagues have received many threats 
over the past three months for exercising their profession. Mr. Shami has been informed by his 
colleagues that after 4 April, masked men have come to his office and have been looking for 
him. These men left a message on the door saying: &#8220;You remained and should be killed&#8221;, when 
they could not find him in the office. 
</p>
<p>168. On 13 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Muhammed Khalid Shelal, born in 1973, 
who is the brother of a staff member of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq 
(UNAMI). According to information received, Mr. Shelal was arrested by Iraqi authorities 
6 March 2007 at 4 am without an arrest warrant produced and is currently held at Al-Harthia 
detention centre, where he has reportedly been ill-treated. Mr. Shelal received one visit by 
members of a Ministry of Justice&#8217;s Observatory Committee, who took pictures from Mr. Shelal, 
allocated case number 14111 to him and submitted information on his case to the Ministry for 
Human Rights. On or around 17 April 2007, the Ministry for Human Rights&#8217; Prison Monitoring 
Team conducted its own visit to Al-Harthia. Mr. Shelal has been denied access to legal counsel 
and to his family. In view of his incommunicado detention and the allegations above, concerns 
were expressed that Mr. Shelal might be a risk of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>169. On 13 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Ghasan Ibrahim Hussein, Mr. Ibrahim 
Mustafa Abdulrahman Ayash, a 70 year old man, a retired teacher, Mr. Jamal Khalil 
Abdulrahman, Mr. Mohammed Khalid Ahmed, Mr. Kamal Ribhi Asa&#8217;ad, Mr. Ra&#8217;fat Mohammed 
Awath, and Mr. Salih Mustafa Lutfi, all of whom are Palestinian refugees. According to 
information received, the seven men mentioned above were among a group of Palestinians, who 
were arrested on 13 and 14 March 2007, respectively, at the compound Al-Baladiyat in Baghdad. 
The arrests were carried out by the 4th Brigade of the Special Forces of the Ministry of the 
Interior, and police officers from al-Rashad Police Stations. These forces were accompanied by 
MNF-I troops. The men were initially detained in the near-by al-Rashad Police Station. Starting 
from 23 March 2007 the Ministry of the Interior began to transfer them to the Serious Crimes </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 99 
 
</p>
<p>Unit detention facility in Al-Adhamiyah, and from there to the Serious Crime Unit - Eastern 
Canal (the former Al-Hakimiyah Directorate) in Baghdad, where they are currently detained. 
Both detention facilities are run by the Ministry of the Interior. Seemingly the detainees are 
shifted back and forth between the two facilities. The exact dates of transfers and persons 
concerned are not known in its entirety, but it has been reported that, on 24 April 2007, upon an 
order of the competent judge attached to the Serious Crimes Unit at Al-Adhamiya, these men 
were transferred from there to the Serious Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal. At the Serious Crimes 
Unit - Eastern Canal they were interrogated and ill-treated for four hours. Thereafter, they were 
taken back to the Serious Crimes Unit office building in Al-Adhamiya. On 29 April 2007, the 
authorities decided to transfer the above-mentioned detainees again to the Serious Crimes Unit - 
Eastern Canal, however, their lawyer successfully instituted legal proceedings to prevent the 
transfer. On 2 May 2007 they were transferred from the Serious Crimes Unit in Al-Adhamiya, to 
the Serious Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal. On 8 May 2007 and on the following day, the 
detainees&#8217; lawyers went to the Serious Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal to provide their clients 
with food and money, however, they were prevented by the officers to meet with them. 
On 9 May 2007 one of the lawyers was briefly detained for two hours by officials at the Serious 
Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal. The Palestinians are charged with terrorism related crimes. Until 
end of May, none of them have yet been allowed to receive visits from their lawyers or families. 
In the absence of any incriminating evidence against them it is believed that the competent judge 
would have been willing to issue a decision for a release on 24 April 2007. It is also believed, 
however, that the judge has declined to do so out of fear of reprisals and ordered their transfer 
to the Serious Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal. It is alleged that the investigating officer, 
Mr. Khalid Al-Jaffari, and another officer, Mr. Ahmed Al-Asady, were involved in fabricating 
evidence against the detained Palestinians. Mr. Al-Jaffari reportedly made photomontages of the 
detained Palestinians, seemingly holding explosives, for use as evidence of guilt in court. After 
their interrogation and ill-treatment at the Serious Crimes Unit - Eastern Canal on 24 April 2007, 
two of the detainees, Mr. Ghasan Ibrahim Hussein and Mr. Jamal Khalil Abdulrahman, were 
allegedly severely ill-treated again by the investigator, Mr. Al-Jaffari, in order to extract false 
confessions from them. In view of their incommunicado detention grave concerns were 
expressed that the seven men might be subjected to ill-treatment. Further concerns are expressed 
as regards their state of health, specifically with respect to Mr. Ibrahim Mustafa Abdulrahman 
Ayash, who is reportedly an elderly man suffering from schizophrenia. 
</p>
<p>170. On 13 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding Mr. Jihad Mahmoud Humadi Al-Dulaimi, 
Mr. Munther Khudair Abbass Al-Dulaimi, Mr. Talal Khudair Abbass Al-Dulaimi, Mr. Abd

</p>
<p>and Mr. Ali Ewai&#8217;ed, all of whom are Sunni men, aged between 20 and 30 years. According to 
the information received: the above-mentioned persons, together with about 20 to 24 other young 
Sunni men, who have since been released, were arrested on 3 March 2007 at about 1:30 a.m., by 
Iraqi Army Forces in Baghdad, Street No. 15 and 17, Q. 324, Dis. Al-Shamasiya, Al-Sulaik area. 
While Multi-National Forces in Iraq (MNF-I) cordoned off the area, the Iraqi Army Forces 
carried out the arrests and searched their homes. It is not known whether an official arrest 
warrant was shown. Allegedly, 1.5 million Iraqi dinars were taken by the forces from one of the 
searched homes. Thereafter, the arrested persons were transferred to the Iraqi Army Investigation 
Centre, which is located in the Security School in the Sader Al-Qanat area. While the first group 
of detainees was released on 4 March 2007, the remaining 29 detainees mentioned above were 
transferred to an undisclosed detention centre of the National Police Force of the Ministry of the 
Interior, possibly in the al-Qanat area. There is reportedly a release order for at least some of the 
detainees issued by a competent judge about a month ago. It is not clear whether the release 
order covers all of the detainees or just some of them, but no detainee has yet been released. 
Some of the detainees&#8217; families are still unable to visit their detained relatives. The family 
members were told that they could make their visits only after the court proceedings. In view of 
their incommunicado detention, grave concerns were expressed that these persons might be 
subjected to ill-treatment in order to extract confessions. 
</p><p>171. On 28 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, concerning the situation 
of judicial staff, in particular lawyers that are being targeted through threats against their safety, 
for exercising their profession in accordance with national legislation. According to information 
received, as a consequence of tensions between the Sunni and the Shia communities in Iraq, 
lawyers are being put under intense pressure, in particular when they handle cases concerning 
women&#8217;s rights, issues of inheritance and the division of assets in a divorce, honour killings and 
adultery. Since the views on the resolution of those cases differ based on divergent 
interpretations of Islam, some lawyers are not taking on such cases for fear of violent reprisals. 
In this context, every day, hundreds of lawyers in Iraq are being threatened and many have been 
asked to abandon their cases. In some cases, lawyers have been violently attacked. Hence, many 
lawyers have already left the country because of threats and fears of persecution. This situation 
causes important delays in judicial processes so that rights of defendants and clients are being 
denied. Over the past year, the number of lawyers offering services in Iraq has reportedly 
decreased by at least 40 percent. At least 210 lawyers and judges have been killed since 2003, 
in addition to dozens injured in attacks against them. For example, on 29 July 2006, 
the well-known lawyer and professor Salah Abdel-Kader was shot dead in his office. 
Mr. Abdel-Kader had handled cases of honour killings and cases of child custody claims. After 
he was killed, a note was found near his body, saying &#8220;this is the price to pay for those who do 
not follow Islamic laws and defend what is dreadful and dirty&#8221;. Furthermore, on 18 April 2007, 
two unnamed lawyers were killed after winning a case for a family who had had their house and 
belongings taken over by another family. The lawyers were shot to death by the other party of 
the case while leaving the court, in the middle of the street. Concern is expressed that those 
responsible for the murders of Mr. Abdel-Kader and the other two lawyers have not been 
charged, nor is any investigation procedure put in place. Furthermore, it is of grave concern that 
lawyers in Iraq are not provided the opportunity to work in safety, without risking their lives or 
without interference. Concern were also expressed that citizens do not appear to receive adequate 
legal assistance from lawyers who take up their cases. </p>

Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding 
Mr. Said Mustafa Said, representing detainees who were the subject matter of a joint urgent 
appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture on 13 June 2007. While the mandate holders appreciate that all the 
detainees mentioned in this urgent appeal were released on 18 June 2007 from the detention 
facility at the Serious Crime Unit - Eastern Canal/al-Hakimiyah, they expressed their concern 
about Mr. Said&#8217;s killing on or after 21 June 2007. According to information received, 
on 21 June 2007, Mr. Said left his office and has reportedly been last seen in the Serious Crime 
Unit - Eastern Canal. On 24 June, Mr. Said&#8217;s body was found by his family in the Medical Legal 
Institute in Baghdad. He had received death threats for representing his clients before. Grave 
concerns were expressed that the death of Mr. Said Mustafa Said is related to his activities in 
defense of human rights.

<p>173. On 24 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS REITERATE CONCERN OVER DEATH SENTENCES 
IMPOSED BY IRAQI HIGH TRIBUNAL 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
Le&#239;la Zerrougui, issued the following statement today: 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
Le&#239;la Zerrougui, remain concerned about the death sentences imposed upon 
Saddam Hussein and two co-defendants linked to his regime and are deeply alarmed by the 
manner in which the executions were carried out. 
</p>
<p>&#8216;International law allows the imposition of capital punishment only within rigorous legal 
constraints, including respect of fair trial standards. However, these standards were not 
guaranteed by the Iraqi High Tribunal.&#8217;, the independent human rights experts highlight. 
</p>
<p>Former Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan is likely to be sentenced to death at a 
hearing before the Iraqi High Tribunal on 25 January, according to a statement by the 
court&#8217;s spokesperson. Taha Yassin Ramadan was convicted in November in connection 
with crimes against humanity committed in the town of Dujail in 1982, but the Tribunal&#8217;s 
Appeals Chamber ruled in its decision of 26 December that a life sentence for Ramadan 
was too lenient and ordered the court to re-sentence him. 
</p>
<p>A number of international bodies and experts have pointed to irregularities concerning the 
Iraqi High Tribunal&#8217;s trial against Saddam Hussein and seven other defendants and to the 
lack of respect for due process rights. Among the main concerns highlighted by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers is the violation of a number of 
international human rights standards on the right to be tried by an independent and 
impartial tribunal and on the right to defense. In this regard, there have been numerous </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 102 
 
</p>
<p>reports of external pressure imposed upon the judges of the Iraqi High Tribunal, which 
appear to have led to the removal and resignation of some of them. Also, the right to an 
appropriate and independent defense is severely undermined, in particular by the extremely 
serious attacks against defense lawyers. 
</p>
<p>Also, on 1 September 2006 in its Opinion No. 31/2006, the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention considered that the non-observance of the relevant international standards during 
Saddam Hussein&#8217;s trial was of such gravity as to confer his deprivation of liberty an 
arbitrary character and invited the Governments of Iraq and the United States to give 
serious consideration to the question of whether a trial of Saddam Hussein in conformity 
with international law is at all possible before an Iraqi tribunal in the current situation in 
the country, or whether the case should not be referred to an international tribunal. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also 
indicated that when defense lawyers are murdered, the rule of law is doubly at stake. The 
assassination of defense attorneys appearing before the Iraqi High Tribunal threatens the 
entire procedure, since the role of defense lawyers is critical to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>Finally, at the beginning of January, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Louise Arbour, and the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, both 
called on the Government of Iraq to refrain from carrying out the death sentences imposed 
by the Iraqi High Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>In light of the gravity of the shortcomings of the trial against Saddam Hussein and his 
seven co-defendants, the experts strongly call upon the Iraqi authorities to suspend without 
delay any further executions until it is ensured that a fair trial is provided to those accused 
under their jurisdiction, in full respect of all due process guarantees required by 
international human rights law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>174. On 16 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS INDEPENDENT EXPERT REITERATES 
CONCERNS ABOUT DEATH SENTENCE ON FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF IRAQ 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the recent dismissal of the appeal by Taha Yassin Ramadan against the death 
sentence imposed by the Iraqi High Tribunal, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers deems it necessary to reiterate his concerns expressed earlier in his 
press statements of 28 December 2006 and of 24 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>In its decision of 12 of February 2007, the Appeals Chamber of the Iraqi High Tribunal 
had not addressed the grave shortcomings of the first instance trial, but had expressed 
dissatisfaction with the life sentence imposed on Ramadan, describing it as too lenient, and 
had sent his case back to the trial court for it to be increased to death, shortly after the 
much criticized executions of Saddam Hussein, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and 
Awad Hamad al-Bandar. On 14 March 2007, all nine members of the appeals court ratified 
the death sentence on Taha Yassin Ramadan. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 103 
 
</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the trial are related to the lack of observance of international human 
rights standards and principles, in particular the right to be tried by an independent and 
impartial tribunal and the right to adequate defense, as stipulated inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>The Iraqi High Tribunal has violated international standards on due process: therefore it is 
not in a position to sentence Taha Yassin Ramadan to death. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur urges the Iraqi Government not to carry out the death sentence 
imposed upon Taha Yassin Ramadan following what appears to have been a procedurally 
flawed legal process.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>175. On 19 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS 
CALLS FOR HALT IN APPLICATION OF DEATH PENALTY IN IRAQ 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of the continued application of the death penalty in Iraq following procedurally 
flawed legal processes, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
deems it necessary to reiterate his concerns in this regard, as expressed earlier in his press 
statements of 16 March 2007, 28 December 2006 and of 24 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>In those statements, the Special Rapporteur described the most serious shortcomings of the 
procedure followed by Iraqi High Tribunal. He notably referred to the lack of observance 
of the right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal and of the right to adequate 
defense, as stipulated inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The violence, threats and intimidation 
to which judges and lawyers are subjected in the country, illustrated amongst others by the 
very high number of assassinations of defense lawyers in the country, greatly contribute to 
impinge on their independence. 
</p>
<p>In this context, the Special Rapporteur urges the Iraqi Government to stop carrying out 
death sentences imposed following trials conducted in violation of international human 
rights standards and principles, including the death sentence against Mahmoud Sa&#8217;eed who 
has confessed having participated to the deadly attack against the headquarters of the 
United Nations in Baghdad in August 2003, where Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq, and a number of other UN staff members 
have been killed. 
</p>
<p>The application of the death penalty, beyond its illegality under circumstances where strict 
due process standards have not been followed, also attempts to the right to the truth of the 
victims and their families, notably the victims of the Saddam Hussein regime. In the 
present case, it would also deprive the families of the victims of the attack to the 
UN headquarters in Baghdad of the only information they could have on those tragic 
events.&#8221;

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Iraq to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the 
9th session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations. 
Particularly he expresses his concern in relation to the lack of guarantees for lawyers to perform 
their professional duties without risking prosecution, including of a criminal nature. He fears that 
human rights victims have more and more difficulties in finding a legal counsel to defend their 
rights. In this context and taking into account that recently there have been several cases of 
lawyers and judges arrested because of their professional activities, he urges the Government to 
adopt as soon as possible appropriate measures to guarantee that lawyers can perform their duties 
safely and independently, without being prosecuted.

<p>177. On 17 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
concerning the closing down of the offices of the organisation Ansar Al-Sajeen (Prisoners 
Friends&#8217; Association) in Israel and in the West Bank, and the search of the house of 
Mr. Munir Mansour, Chairperson of Ansar Al-Sajeen. Ansar Al-Sajeen is registered under Israeli 
law, and is one of the largest providers of legal representation to Palestinian detainees in Israeli 
military courts. It pays legal visits to Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel and advocates 
for their rights. It also works with prisoners&#8217; families in need and has facilitated Palestinian 
family visits. According to the information received, on 8 September 2006 in the early morning, 
the offices of Ansar Al-Sajeen in Tirah, Majd El-Kurum and throughout the West Bank were 
raided and closed down by the police and the Israeli Shin Bet following the issuance by the 
Israeli Defense Minister of an administrative order, in accordance with article 84-2B of the 
Defense (Emergency) Regulations (1945), declaring Ansar al Sajeen as illegal. The police 
reportedly confiscated the organisation&#8217;s assets, including 14,000 shekels dedicated to prisoners 
and their families, hundreds of legal files and documents, telephones, photocopying machines 
and computers. It is reported that the closure occurred soon after the association launched a 
campaign to include the cases of 1948 Palestinian prisoners, citizens of Israel, in the current talks 
for the exchange of prisoners. The organisation would have reportedly decided to appeal the 
order. On the same day, reports indicate that the house of Mr. Mansour, Chairperson of Ansar 
Al-Sajeen, was searched by the police and members of the Shin Bet. Mr. Mansour was 
reportedly questioned for one and half hour, and his mobile telephone was confiscated. Concerns 
were expressed that the closing down of the offices of Ansar Al-Sajeen in Israel and in the West 
Bank as well as the search of the house of its Chairperson may be in retaliation for the legitimate 
activities of the organization in defence of the rights of Palestinian prisoners detained in Israel. 
</p>
<p>178. On 25 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
concerning the detention of Mr. Ahmad Abu Haniya, a Palestinian human rights activist and 
Youth Project Coordinator in the Alternative Information Centre, a joint Palestinian-Israeli </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 105 
 
</p>
<p>organisation based in Jerusalem which promotes human rights and advocates social change in the 
region. According to the information received, on 22 May 2005 Mr. Haniya was arrested at an 
Israeli military checkpoint on his way to work. He was subsequently detained under an 
administrative detention order and has been accused of membership of the Palestinian Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP) and also membership of a group called Al-Islamia. He is 
reported to be detained at Ketziot detention centre in the Negev. The administrative detention 
order against him has been renewed twice since he was first detained. Under the terms of an 
administrative detention order, the authorities are neither required to file charges against the 
detainee nor to bring the case to trial. The order is usually for a determined period of time but is 
often renewed before it expires and it can be renewed indefinitely. Neither the defendant nor his 
legal representative are entitled to view the &#8220;classified&#8221; evidence against the defendant. The 
current order is due to expire on 15 November 2006 but it is feared that it may be renewed. 
Concern is expressed that Mr. Ahmad Abu Haniya may be detained in order to prevent him from 
carrying out peaceful activities in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>179. On 7 February 2007, the Government responded to the joint allegation letter 
of 17 October 2006, stating that on 31 August 2006, based on the authority granted to him by 
Regulation 84 of the Defense Regulations (Emergency) 1945, Minister of Defense 
Mr. Amir Peretz declared Ansar al-Sajeen, an association registered and incorporated in Israel, to 
be an illegal organization. Soon alter the above declaration of the Defense Minister, the 
Commander of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in Judea and Samaria also declared the 
organization to be illegal in the West Bank, and ordered the shutdown of all eight branches of the 
association in Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus, Salfit, Qalgilya, Tul Karem and Jenin. 
Ansar AI-Sajeen is headed by Munir Mansour, a former security prisoner who currently resides 
in Majad al-Karum. Its branches in the West Bank are operated by known members of Hamas, 
some of whom are also former security prisoners. On the night of 7 September 2006, following 
the outlawing of the association, Israeli police from the Galilee district, together with the Israel 
Security Agency (ISA), seized the association&#8217;s property in Israel. At the same time, IDF closed 
down its branch offices and seized its property in the West Bank. The association was outlawed 
due to the fact that it operates a well-oiled apparatus for the transfer of money primarily from 
Hamas to security prisoners in Israeli prisons and their families. The ISA and Israel&#8217;s security 
apparatus view the transfer of money from Hamas to security prisoners in Israel as a reward for 
committing terrorist acts and an encouragement to others to follow suit. Therefore, Israel&#8217;s 
security services are compelled to continue their operations in an effort to thwart this kind of 
support for terrorist activity. However, it should be emphasized that the right to assembly is 
recognized as a fundamental right in Israel which can be limited only in extreme cases due to 
security considerations and concerns about public safety. Such decisions to limit this right must 
be based on concrete information and reviewed by the Minister of Defense. Any decision 
regarding such decisions can be challenged by the association in question and brought before the 
Israeli Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>180. On 9 August 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 25 October 2006, 
explaining that Israel has been struggling with terrorism from the day it was founded. In recent 
years, the number of terrorist attacks grew significantly, and Palestinian terrorists have been 
targeting Israeli civilians more viciously than ever before, including in pizzerias, shopping malls, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 106 
 
</p>
<p>cafeterias, and buses. Particularly horrendous was March 2002, when more than 80 Israeli 
civilians were killed, and more than 400 were injured. Overall, from September 2000 until 
February 2007, 1,121 Israeli civilians were killed and 8,147 were injured. One of the most 
effective and lawful counter-measures against such continuous terrorist attacks is the use of 
administrative detentions. However, it is important to note that this measure is only used in 
exceptional circumstances. Where sufficient and admissible evidence exists against an 
individual, the authorities are required to bring that individual to trial, rather than adopt such 
measures as administrative detention. Nonetheless, in some situations, there may be clear, 
concrete and trustworthy evidence against an individual, but for reasons of confidentiality and 
protection of intelligence sources, it cannot be presented as evidence in ordinary criminal 
proceedings. It is under such circumstances that administrative detentions are imposed. Issuance 
of administrative detention orders against detainees who pose a danger to public security in a 
defined area, in situations such as outlined above, are recognized by international law and are in 
full conformity with article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949. Moreover, the measure is 
only used in cases where there is corroborating evidence that an individual is engaged in illegal 
acts that endanger the security of a particular area and the lives of civilians, and each order is 
subject to judicial review. It is important to note that an administrative detention order is limited 
to six months in duration, and its extension requires a re-evaluation of the relevant intelligence 
material, as well as further judicial review. Furthermore, local legislation governing the process 
grants all relevant individuals the right to appeal the order to the Military Court of Appeals, for 
judicial review. Petitioners may be represented by counsel of their choice at every stage of these 
proceedings. All detainees have the additional right to petition the Israeli High Court of Justice 
for a repeal of the order. The judicial organs reviewing each and every order carefully examine 
whether the criteria outlined in case law and legislation are fully met.  
</p>
<p>181. Regarding the case at hand, according to information forwarded to us by the relevant 
authorities, Mr. Abu Haniya was arrested on 18 May 2005, and an order for his administrative 
detention was issued for six months. This order was extended three times and on 
13 November 2006, the military commander of the Area issued an order renewing Mr. Hanyia&#8217;s 
administrative detention for a further six months, until 14 May 2007. The order was renewed 
in light of the danger Mr. Haniya posed to the security of the Area, as an activist in the 
Popular Front terror organization. The order was judicially reviewed by a military court 
on 20 November 2006, who ruled that the detention period should be reduced, unti1 
30 November 2006. The prosecution appealed this decision, and on 28 November 2006, it was 
overturned by the military court of appeals. The court examined confidential material and stated 
that it included many details, from various credible sources, some of which intersected and 
verified each other. Some of the details were of substantial severity. The court examined the 
information in the presence of agents from the Israel Security Agency. Based on it, and the 
agents&#8217; clarifications, the court concluded that the military commander of the Area had 
reasonable grounds to assume that in light of decisive security justifications and the future 
danger assessment, the safety of the Area and the public required that Mr. Haniya remain in 
custody. Thus the military court of appeals ruled that the detention order, as it was originally 
issued by the military commander of the Area, should remain in effect until 14 May 2007. When 
this administrative detention order expired on 14 May 2007, it was not renewed and Mr. Haniya 
was accordingly released. </p>

<p>183. On 25 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, concerning 
intelligence and espionage activity in relation to Italian and European magistrates and 
magistrates&#8217; associations, including the Italian association Magistratura democratica (Md) and 
the European association Magistrats europ&#233;ens pour la d&#233;mocratie et les libert&#233;s (MEDEL). 
According to the information received: on 5 July 2006, the Office of the Prosecutor of Milan, 
during a search in the offices of the Italian Intelligence and Military Security Services (SISMI), 
found material that reveals illegal espionage activity by SISMI concerning judges and judges 
associations in Italy and in Europe. As a consequence, on 7 November 2006, the Consiglio 
Superiore della Magistratura (CSM) opened an investigation in relation to those allegations, and 
requested the Office of the Prosecutor of Milan to provide it with documentation relating to the 
above-mentioned search and the related investigation. On the basis of the material received, 
which includes documents taken during that search, on 4 July 2007 the CSM unanimously 
adopted a resolution condemning the alleged serious illegal espionage activities undertaken by 
SISMI, which were aimed at interfering with the independence of the Italian judiciary. In 
particular, according to that resolution, from July 2001 until May 2006 SISMI conducted 
intelligence activity vis-&#224;-vis Italian and European judges, as well as the judges&#8217; associations 
they had joined, in particular Magistratura democratica and MEDEL. The director of SISMI was 
regularly informed of this activity. It appears that no specific or illegal act was reproached to the 
magistrates that have been included in the SISMI list: the only justification for this intelligence 
activity was that the magistrates were considered to be from the &#8220;centre-left&#8221;, based on decisions 
they had taken or opinions they had expressed in public fora. The activity of SISMI consisted in 
filing information about each of these magistrates, closely monitoring their activities, their 
movements and their electronic correspondence, including through infiltrating the internal 
mailing list of judges&#8217; associations such a MEDEL. This appears to amount to a serious violation 
of the right to privacy of the mentioned magistrates. Moreover, the SISMI activity also 
specifically aimed at obstructing the professional activity of those magistrates and associations, 
by dissuading them from carrying out activities or taking decisions considered to be against the 
interest of the Government. Among others, the documents would explicitly refer to neutralizing 
politico-judicial activities of Italian magistrates, or coming from abroad, that directly concern 
members of the Governmental coalition in place at that time and/or members of their families. 
They would also refer to trying to prevent the financing of such activities, at the national and 
European level. This strategy was followed by concrete interventions, such as accessing 
confidential emails of magistrates and mailing lists of MEDEL, disseminating reports containing 
false information about activities of MEDEL, preventing magistrates from participating in the 
work of international institutions, or discrediting them thus damaging not only their dignity but 
also the independent exercise of their profession. As a matter of fact, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed his deep concern to note that such kind of activities, which do not seem to fall within 
the sphere of competency of SISMI, a body in charge of informative and security tasks aimed at </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>protecting, from the military perspective, the independence and integrity of the State from any 
threat or aggression, have been conducted for almost 5 years in the country, the Director of 
SISMI being allegedly aware of it. As you&#8217;re the Government is fully aware, monitoring, 
influencing and blocking judicial activities and opinions expressed by magistrates, as well as 
interfering in their nomination, amount to a very serious violation of the basic principle of the 
independence of the judiciary, which is a cornerstone of the Italian Constitution and its 
democratic system, and of the human rights conventions ratified by Italy.

Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Issam Mahamed Tahar Al Barquaoui 
Al Uteibi, aged 49, writer and theologian, detained at an unofficial place of detention. According 
to the allegations received, he was arrested on 5 July 2005 following an interview with 
Al Jazeera, in which he criticised the US occupation of Iraq. The Vice Prime Minister indicated 
in a public statement that he was charged with &#8220;contacts with foreign entities considered 
terrorist&#8221;. He was then held incommunicado for more than a year, following which the General 
Intelligence Directorate authorized his family to visit him. Mr. Al Uteibi was repeatedly 
ill-treated while in detention. Notably he was severely beaten in his cell on 25 April 2007 
because he asked to see a judge or be released. He went on a hunger strike on 15 May 2007 to 
protest his detention without a judicial decision and lack of access to a lawyer. Mr. Al Uteibi had 
been arrested already on 28 November 2002 together with 11 other persons and accused of 
&#8220;plotting to commit terrorist acts&#8221;. He was acquitted by the State Security Court on 
27 December 2004. However, after the acquittal he was transferred to a secret detention centre, 
where he was held without new charges until 28 June 2005. He was repeatedly ill-treated while 
in secret detention. With a view to the allegations of repeated ill-treatment, the detention at an 
unofficial place without access to a lawyer and the reportedly deteriorating health of 
Mr. Al Uteibi, concern was expressed for his physical and mental integrity.

and intolerance. He was arrested after an arrest warrant that had been issued by the public 
prosecutor on charges of conspiring with the objective to commit terrorist acts. On the time of 
arrest, he was promptly informed of charges against him and had been shown the arrest warrant 
as required by article 9(2) of ICCPR. Mr. al Barqaoui was not deprived of the right of the visit by 
his family members or any national or international human rights organization. Indeed, 
Mr. Barqaoui has been granted the right to be visited like any other inmate in the correctional 
and rehabilitation center. Representatives of the ICRC and the National Center for Human rights 
have been visiting Mr. al Barqaoui regularly. As for the legality of Mr. al Barqaoui arrest, it was

efforts to provide substantive information in response to the concerned expressed on letter sent

<p>188. On 14 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and counter terrorism and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture regarding the detention of over 70 persons, Kenyans and non-Kenyans. 
According to the information received, during the month of January 2007, about 70 individuals 
of Kenyan and other nationalities were arrested by units of the Kenyan Police apparently for 
terrorism-related reasons. A significant number of these individuals have been held or continue 
to be held incommunicado. In view of their incommunicado detention concern is expressed for 
their physical and mental integrity. In this context, we have also received information about 
Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, aged 42, Canadian citizen, born in Dagahbur, Ogaden, Abdi Abdulahi 
Osman, aged 41, Somali citizen, born in Gunagado, Dagahbur, Ogaden, Ali Afi Jama, aged 33, 
Somali citizen, born in Godey, Ogaden and Hussein Aw Nuur Gurraase, aged 35, Somali citizen, 
born in Gunagado, Ogaden., all ethnic Ogadenis trading in second hand clothing in the Horn of 
Africa. According to the information received, the four men were arrested by Kenyan authorities 
on 31 December 2006. They were held in custody for three weeks without official charges. For 
two weeks the authorities interrogated them in the absence of lawyers, or Canadian Embassy 
officials for Mr. Makhtal, who holds a Canadian passport. Mr. Makhtal was denied access to the 
Canadian High Commission for the first two weeks. Only on 15 January 2007 Mr. Makhtal was 
granted a brief meeting with a Canadian High Commission Official and a lawyer his family hired 
for him. On 21 January 2007, Mr. Makhtal, Mr. Osman, Mr. Jama and Mr. Gurraase were 
transferred to the Ethiopian armed forces in Mogadishu without any legal basis and without 
having been given the opportunity to appeal the transfer.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>189. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Kenia to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the 
9th session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above urgent 
appeal. Particularly, the Special Rapporteur expresses his concern over the detention for 
apparently terrorism-related reasons of about 70 individuals that have been held or continue to 
be held for a long period incommunicado. While being conscious of the fact that States&#8217; 
obligation to protect and promote human rights requires them to take effective measures to 
combat terrorism, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline that General Assembly 
resolution 591191, in its paragraph 1, stresses that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to 
combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular 
international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as does Security Council 
resolution 1456 (2003) in its paragraph 6.

<p>190. On 23 November 2006, he Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, regarding Ms. Raisa Germanovna Dergousova, an 82-year-old 
woman living in Ananievo, Issyk-Kul. According to the information received, during the night of 
April 22, 2005, Ms. Dergousova was raped in her home by a man she was able to identify as 
Mr. Salamat Avasovich Akmataliev. The alleged perpetrator ordered her to cover her eyes with a 
blanket and demanded to know whether she recognized him. She denied knowing him, and 
promised not to report him to the police, fearing for her life. The next morning, Ms. Dergousova 
reported the incident to the police. She underwent a physical examination, which confirmed that 
she was raped. Ms. Dergousova then turned to the Oblast Prosecutor&#8217;s office. The Prosecutor 
informed her that Mr. Akmataliev was under investigation, and that he had provided a written 
undertaking not to leave the area. He claimed that the case would be sent to court once the 
investigation was completed. Later, however, the Assistant Prosecutor in Cholpon-Aty 
Mairambek informed Ms. Dergousova that her case had been transferred to the Oblast 
authorities. To date, there has been no trial regarding this matter. Reportedly, Mr. Akmataliev 
was interrogated by three investigators, but bribed them in order to terminate the investigation. 
Sources allege that Mr. Akmataliev publicly boasted that he has enough money to guarantee his 
impunity. According to information received, the rape case referred to above is not a singular 
incident. Rather, we understand that impunity for rape and alleged impunity in the other forms of 
sexual violence has recently intensified. Specifically, we are concerned about the increasingly 
widespread practice of &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221;, whereby a woman or girl is taken against her will 
through deception or force and forced to marry one of her abductors. Sources allege that the 
abductors are often intoxicated and act in groups, using physical or psychological coercion to 
compel the woman to &#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage. These marriages are reportedly rarely registered 
with the state. Instead, a Muslim cleric conducts the ceremony or the occasion is privately 
celebrated. It is further alleged that kidnapped women are often raped by the abductors, but fail 
to report the crime for fear of repercussions. The abductions occur within all parts of Kyrgyzstan, 
both urban and rural. The women involved are typically under the age of 25. Some victims are </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 111 
 
</p>
<p>also minors. Despite the fact that article 155 of the Criminal Code, outlaws non-consensual 
marriage by force or kidnapping, it is reported that the perpetrators are typically not prosecuted 
for the crime and enjoy impunity for the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation that is committed. 
It was also informed that the police often fail to even investigate reported cases of bride 
kidnapping. Sources state that many police officers do not view bride-kidnapping as an issue for 
law enforcement, but consider it to be a legitimate traditional practice. 
</p>
<p>191. On 5 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Mukumdzhon Makhmudov, aged 43, 
currently in custody of the Committee of State Security in Osh. According to the information 
received, Mr. Makhmudov was arrested around end of June 2007 by officials of the Committee 
of State Security in the city of Jalalabad. The charges against him include terrorism, sabotage 
and the establishment of a criminal organization under Sections 155, 161 and 242 of the 
Criminal Code for his involvement in an organization calling it self &#8220;Hizb ut Tahrir&#8221;. 
Mr. Makhmudov faces extradition to Uzbekistan. The authorities deny him access to a lawyer 
and his arrest has not been confirmed by court. The Committee on Migration and Employment, 
the state body responsible for registration of asylum claims, has not responded to the request to 
see Mr. Makhmudov and he is therefore unable to file an asylum claim. UNHCR is equally 
denied access to Mr. Makhmudov. Concern is expressed that Mr. Makhmudov may be at risk of 
torture or ill-treatment if he is returned to Uzbekistan.

<p>192. On 22 March 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 23 November 2006 regarding Raisa Derguzova, aged 82. In accordance with the requirements 
of Kyrgyz criminal procedural legislation, a police line-up of suspects was held, during which 
Ms. Derguzova identified Mr. S. Akmataliev. Forensic medical and biological examinations 
were ordered. Subsequently, Mr. D. Kasymaliev, an investigator of the district internal affairs 
office repeatedly took unwarranted decisions to terminate criminal proceedings against 
Mr. Akmataliev on the grounds of lack of sufficient evidence. The Issyk-Kul district procurator&#8217;s 
office made a recommendation to the Issyk-Kul provincial internal affairs office concerning 
investigator D. Kasymaliev; as a result, Mr. Kasymaliev was subjected to a disciplinary measure, 
which took the form of a reprimand. On 20 December 2006, Mr. Akmataliev was indicted for the 
commission of an offence contrary to article 129, paragraph 1, of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure and was placed under house arrest. On 23 December 2006, Mr. Akmataliev was 
arrested and, on the basis of article 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, placed in pretrial 
detention. On 21 December 2006, the criminal case involving the rape of Ms. Derguzova was 
referred to the Issyk-Kul interdistrict court, where it is being heard. With regard to the enquiry 
concerning &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221; in Kyrgyzstan, the following information is provided. In 2006, 
73 statements and communications from citizens concerning the coercion of women into 
marriage were registered. With regard to 57 of the reported incidents, investigators of internal 
affairs offices took decisions not to institute criminal proceedings because citizens withdrew 
their original statements. Criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with the remaining 
16 incidents. The results of investigations of nine incidents were referred to the courts (in five 
cases, the courts handed down the verdict of guilty; four cases are still being heard). In two </p>

<p>criminal cases, the investigation was suspended in connection with the search for the accused 
persons. Five criminal cases are being investigated. For the period under consideration, no 
criminal cases have been terminated and no defendants have been acquitted by the courts.

Egalement ils auraient &#233;t&#233; contraints de rester debout contre un mur durant de longues p&#233;riodes

conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, un appel urgent sur la situation de

isra&#233;liens. Sa famille aurait pu effectuer des visites sous surveillance entre juillet 2006 
et mai 2007, mais &#224; partir de mai 2007 les autorit&#233;s leur auraient refus&#233; toute visite en all&#233;guant 
des motifs s&#233;curitaires. L&#8217;avocat de M. Mahmoud Abou Rafeh n&#8217;aurait jamais pu obtenir de 
permission pour rencontrer son client. Celui-ci aurait eu plusieurs audiences devant une cour 
militaire sans la pr&#233;sence de son avocat. Au moment de l&#8217;appel urgent, compte tenu de la 
d&#233;tention au secret de M. Mahmoud Abou Rafeh depuis mai 2007, des craintes &#233;taient exprim&#233;es 
quant &#224; son int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale. Sans pr&#233;juger des faits l&#8217;appel urgent sollicitait des

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>199. On 30 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Independent expert on technical cooperation and advisory services 
in Liberia concerning 37 persons, among them Ms. Oldlady Parker Geieh, aged 85, 
Ms. Kargonal Jargue, aged 75, Ms. Tuakarseh Gborgan, aged 70, Ms. Martha Suomie, aged 49 
and Mr. Zaye Bonkre, aged 75, resident in Boutou, Nimba County. According to the information 
received, in September 2006, the Buotou Town Chief, Mr. George Olathe Morris, the Zone 
Chief, Mr. Deemie Zoue, and the Youth Leader, Mr. George Tomah, demanded money from 
various members of the community to cover the fees of a trial by ordeal practitioner, payment of 
which would save the victims from being subjected to the trial. 34 women and three men, who 
were unable to pay the fee demanded, were detained by local authorities in Buotou. A team of 
witchdoctors from Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, headed by Mr. Gbah Anthone, was hired to perform the trial by 
ordeal. The town authorities later claimed that the persons to be subjected to the trial by ordeal 
had committed witchcraft and were responsible for causing a lack of development and 
employment in Buotou. The 37 persons were then severely assaulted and forced to sit outside in 
the rain and sun and were denied food (only some received some food from their relatives). Their 
heads were shaved and mud and chilli pepper was rubbed on their heads, into wounds caused 
during the beating and into the women&#8217;s vaginas. They were threatened that they would be 
subjected to the &#8220;sassywood procedure&#8221;, wherein the victim must prove his or her innocence by 
consuming poison without dying, and were ordered to confess to being witches. They were 
released on 24 October 2006 following the intervention of LNP and UNPOL. On 
24 December 2006, Tuakerseh Gborgan died in Sanniquillie, apparently as a result of the injuries 
sustained during the trial by ordeal. Hunger and lack of adequate medical treatment may also 
have contributed to her death. On 24 November 2006, police arrested eight people alleged to 
have participated in this procedure: Gbah Anthone, Tiah Francis, George Olathe Morris (Town 
Chief), Deemie Zoue (Zone Chief), Anthony Blah, Wesley Mobai, John Ola Alfred and 
Soun Wonue. The eight men were charged with aggravated assault on 27 November 2006 and 
released on bail by the Sanniquillie Magistrates&#8217; Court the same day. The Youth Leader was not 
arrested. On 22 June 2007, Gbah Anthone was indicted for murder in the Nimba County Circuit 
Court. However, on 16 July, he was acquitted after the Circuit Court Judge granted a defence 
motion to dismiss the case on the ground that there was inadequate evidence to prove the charge 
beyond a reasonable doubt. In his decision, the Judge referred to the lack of a valid coronial 
report and forensic investigation. There is neither a morgue nor a forensic practitioner in Nimba 
County. The prosecution case had also been weakened by a medical report it had tendered which 
was inconclusive in its findings regarding the deceased&#8217;s condition at the time she first sought 
medical treatment. That medical report had been prepared by the son-in-law of one of the men 
who ordered the trial by ordeal, raising further concerns that the available medical evidence was 
neither impartial nor comprehensive. None of the other alleged perpetrators has been brought to 
justice as of now. In accordance with the Executive Law, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) 
has responsibility for overseeing &#8220;tribal Government&#8221; and &#8220;administering the system of tribal </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 116 
 
</p>
<p>courts&#8221; in Liberia. The MIA&#8217;s role includes the issuance of licences to sassywood practitioners 
and herbalists, among others, and it would appear that in practice this includes authorizing 
instances of trial by ordeal. Use of poison sassywood was publicly declared illegal at the end of 
2006, but, in spite of the fact that the Ministry of Justice has initiated some prosecutions against 
practitioners of sassywood, it is reported that the Government has failed to send a strong and 
unambiguous message regarding the illegality of all forms of trial by ordeal and other arbitrary 
practices. Furthermore, MIA officials still authorize such ceremonies to go ahead. For example, 
in the case of Mr. Varney Quoy, a farmer and security guard who lives in the Po River area of 
Montserrado County, MIA officials allegedly were going to authorize a trial by ordeal to take 
place, until the Solicitor-General was seized of the matter and the case was transferred to the 
Office of the County Attorney in Monrovia. Judging by the description given by MIA personnel 
to UN personnel, the intended ceremony appeared to resemble a trial by ordeal in that there was 
a threat of serious harm as punishment, the procedure was arbitrary and it was to take place in 
the context of witchcraft or supernatural phenomena. It further appears that Mr. Varney had been 
deemed to be guilty and the aim of the ceremony was not to determine guilt or innocence but 
was an attempt to prevent alleged future crimes. He was to take an oath and consume a substance 
that would punish him in the future if he broke that oath. The ceremony, which would not be 
permitted even under the Revised Rules and Regulations of the Hinterland, clearly violates the 
human rights guarantees contained in the Constitution and the international human rights treaties 
ratified or acceded to by Liberia. It is also reported that trial by ordeal that is of a &#8220;minor nature&#8221; 
and does not &#8220;endanger life&#8221; is permitted by Art. 73 of the Regulations. Article 2 of those 
Regulations provides that they are to be applied to &#8220;such areas as are wholly inhabited by 
uncivilized natives&#8221;. The discriminatory basis of the Regulations is a breach of human rights 
guarantees under the Constitution and international treaties, such as the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which has been ratified by Liberia. Moreover, the Regulations, 
which are subordinate legislation, are contrary to provisions of a variety of national Acts, 
including the Judiciary Law, the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Law. 
</p>
<p>200. On 26 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning Justices of 
the Peace that continued to hear cases in spite of having been decommissioned. According to the 
information received, On 20 and 22 August 2007 respectively, a Justice of the Peace in Suakoko, 
Bong County, sentenced Gbeg Mu-Gang and Peter Tokpah to prison terms of two and three 
months respectively for theft of property. At a case-flow management meeting, the County 
Attorney declared the sentences illegal as the Justice of the Peace does not have jurisdiction over 
such cases, but apparently failed to address the fact that such courts should not be operating at 
all. On 17 September 2007, the Justice of the Peace in Foequelle, Bong County, allegedly 
arrested a man and handcuffed him overnight because he had failed to pay a L$3,000 (US$ 50) 
fine imposed by the Justice of the Peace earlier this year. The man reportedly escaped from the 
Justice of the Peace&#8217;s illegal detention facility and reported the incident to the Circuit Court and 
the President of Bong County Justice of the Peace Association. The President of the Justice of 
the Peace Association reportedly offered to mediate in the matter. On 3 September 2007, the 
Liberian National Police (LNP) reported that on 30 June 2007 they detained a rape suspect at the 
request of a Justice of the Peace in Lowee, Saclepea District, Lofa County, who later released the 
suspect on bail on 2 July 2007. The case was never transferred to the Magistrates&#8217; Court or the 
Circuit Court. The suspect has reportedly returned to his community. Also, a Justice of the Peace 
in Soul Clinic, in Montserrado County, stated that he handles both civil and criminal cases, 
including cases of aggravated assault, terrorist threats, and theft of property. Finally, </p>

</p>
<p>following an altercation between a 63 year old man and 3 members of the Sande society on 
13 September 2007, the matter was taken before a person who was posing as a Justice of the 
Peace in Compound # 3B in Grand Bassa County. The 63 year old man reportedly insulted the 
Justice of the Peace who subsequently ordered his beating. Following a report to the LNP by the 
63 year old man, the Justice of the Peace was arrested on charges of aggravated assault. 
According to the New Judiciary Law of 1972 that governs their appointments and tenure, 
Justices of the Peace hold office for a term of two years. It is reported that the current 
Government has not appointed or otherwise extended the mandates of any Justice of the Peace 
since it came into power beginning of 2006. Justices of the Peace were working with the 
mandates issued by the previous Government, and all of them have now expired. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur was concerned that persons continue to operate as Justices of the Peace 
even after they have been decommissioned, and that they operate even in areas that fall outside 
their competency and within the competency of the magistracy, in particular with regard to 
serious offences. It is also reported that the Government is planning to request that Justices of the 
Peace submit their applications for extension of mandate, and that it will then vet the 
applications. The Special Rapporteur urged the Government to do so, in particular against 
complaints made about some Justices of the Peace. In this context, the Government should put in 
place a new strategy concerning Justice of the Peace, to prevent abuses and to make sure that the 
Justices of the Peace are properly trained and act within a clearly established legal framework. 
Also, Justices of the Peace should not cover areas covered by magistrates and that therefore fall 
outside their competency, and their number should be limited to what is strictly necessary - 
against allegations that there would be too many and that in various cases two Justices of the 
Peace operate in the same area.  
</p>
<p>201. On 2 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning Justices 
of the Peace that continued to hear cases even though their commissions had expired. According 
to the information received, on 20 and 22 August 2007 respectively, a Justice of the Peace in

According to the New Judiciary Law of 1972, Title 17, that governs their appointments and 
tenure, Justices of the Peace hold office for a term of two years. It is reported that the 
Government has not appointed or otherwise extended the mandates of any Justice of the Peace

<p>None. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>202. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the above 
allegations. The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns any system of administration of justice 
that endanger physical and psychological integrity of the accused. He urges the Government of 
Liberia to take effective measures to ensure that trial by ordeal is not longer taking place. The 
Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the legal proceedings against eight of the perpetrators 
were not conducted in compliance with article 14 of the ICCPR, particularly the right to an 
impartial tribunal. Therefore, he recommends that the proceedings be reviewed. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government of Liberia to provide at the earliest possible date, and 
preferably before the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed 
substantive answer to the above allegations. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>203. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, concerning Mr. Malik Imtiaz 
Sarwar, one of two lawyers currently representing Ms. Lina Joy, in the Federal Court of 
Malaysia. Ms. Lina Joy is a Malay woman who has renounced her Muslim faith and embraced 
Christianity, and the court proceedings are concerned with whether she can renounce Islam and 
has the right to have the religious affiliation on her identity card deleted. According to the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 119 
 
</p>
<p>information received, Malik Imtiaz is the subject of death threats by an unknown group, which 
openly calls for the death of Mr. Imtiaz because of his role as a lawyer in the Lina Joy court case. 
Such threats include posters, titled &#8220;Wanted Dead&#8221;, that describes Mr. Imtiaz Sarwar as a 
betrayer of Islam for his involvement in the Lina Joy court case and an email message which 
circulates in the Internet and offers a monetary reward to anyone who is willing to kill him. 
Concern was expressed that such threats are linked to the lawful professional activity of 
Mr. Imtiaz Sarwar as a lawyer and may represent an attempt to intimidate lawyers who take on 
cases in defence of right to freedom of religion and belief. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>204. On 13 February 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 23 August 2006, stating that Mr. Sarwar had lodged a police report about the threat against 
him at the Dang Wangi Police Station (Report No. 24495/96) following his meeting with the 
Inspector-General of the Royal Malaysian Police, Tan Sri Musa Hassan, on 21 August 2006. 
During that meeting, Mr. Sarwar, who was accompanied by Ms. ivy Josiah and Mr. Yeo Yang 
Poh, Chairman of the Malaysian Bar Council, informed the Chief of Police that two posters were 
being circulated through e-mails which incited action towards his death, thus constituting a direct 
threat to his life. 2. The police assigned Assistant Superintendent Sohaimi as the Investigating 
Officer of the case. Following initial investigations carried out by the Royal Malaysian Police, it 
was found that a poster entitled &#8220;Islam Denigrated! Muslims Threatenedl&#8221; had been 
disseminated at the Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory Mosque on 23 July 2006. The same poster 
appeared on the Anti-Apostasy Action Front (FORKAD) website, at the following address: 
Forkadwahoo.Qfog2S.cOM. 3. The police has classified the case under Section 507 of the Penal 
Code (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication), and is currently conducting 
further investigations to determine the identity of the person who had uploaded the posters onto 
the website. The police has also recorded statements from 13 witnesses about the case thus far. 
At the same time, the police also sought the assistance of Telekom Malaysia to ascertain the 
identity of the source of the e-mails circulated. 4. Mr. Sarwar has expressed satisfaction with the 
level of cooperation extended to him by the Royal Malaysian Police in finding a resolution to the 
case. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply of 13 February 2007 and notes 
with satisfaction that police have conducted investigations to determine the identity of the 
authors of the threats to Mr. Sarwarthe. He would appreciate receiving further information on 
these investigations at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth 
session of the Human Rights Council.

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>206. On 10 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal 
regarding 21 members of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP): Mohamed Arif (branch 
president of MDP), Mohamed Manik (party member); Ahmed Ibrahim (party member), 
Abdul Majeed Shameem (branch president of MDP), Imran Zahir (Mal&#233; constituency secretary </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>of MDP), Hussain Shahid (branch president of MDP), Abdullah Zakariyya (party member), 
Ali Mohamed (party member), Abdul Razzaq Abdul Rahman (party member), Mohamed Adam 
(party member), Ahmed Ibrahim (party member), Fathimath Shiuna (secretary of an MDP 
constituency), Areesha Ali (party member), Mohamed Saeedh (branch president of MDP), 
Ali Riffath (party member), Mohamed Saleem Ali (president of an MDP constituency), 
Ali Shifah (party member), Ibrahim Sahreef (party member and Member of Parliament, 
Mal&#233; Atoll), Ahamed Rasheed (party member), Abdulla Hassan (party member), and 
Abdul Hameed (party member). From 2005 to 2007, these 21 members of the MDP have been 
arrested several times. Some of them had been held repeatedly for up to 2 months before being 
released. In most cases, the release has reportedly not been ordered after the lawfulness of the 
detention was reviewed by a court, but after an order made by the detaining officer exercising his 
discretion. Furthermore, in most cases, the above mentioned individuals had access to legal 
counsel only 15 to 20 days after the arrest, when they were brought to a detention centre close to 
the capital. Most recently, the 21 individuals have been charged with disobedience to order, 
unlawful assembly or obstructing duty of governmental officials. The verdicts were expected 
before 12 December 2007. Concern was expressed that the above mentioned individuals will not 
enjoy a fair trial because of their activities as members of the MDP. 
</p><p>207. On 2 March 2007, The Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS EXPERT SUPPORTS CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO 
ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IN THE MALDIVES 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
Leandro Despouy, conducted a visit to the Maldives from 25 February to 1 March 2007 at 
the invitation of the Government. He thanks the Government of the Maldives for the 
excellent cooperation they extended to him. 
</p>
<p>During his visit in the capital, Mal&#233;, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of the 
Maldives, Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, a number of Government ministers, judges from 
various levels of courts, the Attorney General, prosecutors, lawyers, international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations. He travelled to Addu Atoll, in the 
south of the archipelago, to meet with judges of that region as well as civil society 
representatives. He also visited the Maafushi detention centre where he met with several 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>The Maldives is in the process of adopting fundamental constitutional and judicial reforms 
which are of key importance for the transition of the country towards democracy. The 
judiciary, which is presently under the control of the Executive, would under the reforms 
become independent. After a long time of isolation, the country has opened up due to 
tourism and foreign investments. This requires a modernization of society, including its 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the following preliminary 
observations: 
</p>
<p>(1) The Constitution puts the judiciary under the control of the President: this seriously 
affects the independence of the judiciary. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 121 
 
</p>
<p>(2) There is a serious lack of trained judges and lawyers. 
(3) The right to defence is seriously affected: most of the detainees are tried without the 
assistance of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>(4) Preventive detention is the rule rather than the exception. 
</p>
<p>All sectors of Maldivian society are conscious of the need for reform. Judges themselves 
recognize the need for change and are seeking better conditions of service, including 
training, greater independence and better personal and professional security. The 
Government authorities are committed to a far-reaching reform of the Constitution, and the 
various leading members of the opposition with whom the Special Rapporteur met are also 
convinced that there is no way these reforms can be delayed. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur, considering that the social and economic conditions to carry out 
the reforms are in place, presents the following preliminary recommendations: 
</p>
<p>(1) The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages prompt adoption of the constitutional 
reforms and the urgent adoption of legislation which has already been submitted to 
Parliament, including the criminal code and the criminal procedure code. The adoption of 
an appropriate police bill is also of key importance to prevent current abuse cases. 
Constitutional and legislative reforms must conform to applicable international norms and 
principles. 
</p>
<p>(2) He recommends that the constitutional reform consecrate the principle of real 
separation of powers. In this context, the independence of the judiciary should be 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>(3) He recommends the establishment of an independent body that would be responsible 
for appointing, promoting and disciplining judges. 
(4) He recommends that financial autonomy be given to the judiciary, for example as a 
fixed percentage of the GDP, which should be managed by the judiciary itself. This would 
also imply higher salaries for judges. 
(5) He urges that posts be secured for women as judges, contrary to the current practice 
which has been criticised by international human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>(6) Judges and prosecutors should be involved in police investigations in order to ensure 
respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>(7) The status of the Attorney-General should be enhanced and a separate post of 
prosecutor established. 
</p>
<p>(8) Noting that drug consumption affects almost every family, he recommends the 
strengthening of prevention and rehabilitation programmes, since criminalization has 
proved unsuccessful. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 122 
 
</p>
<p>In this context, it is essential that the reforms be completed within the specified time 
period. It is therefore necessary to create an appropriate climate in which all sectors can 
participate and that a formal text be drawn up in accordance with the wishes for change of 
all Maldivians. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur will present his report on the mission to the Maldives to the 
Human Rights Council in the spring of 2007.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>208. On 13 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UN EXPERT WELCOMES FIRST-EVER APPOINTMENT OF WOMEN JUDGES 
IN MALDIVES AND AGREEMENT ON NEW DEADLINE FOR ADOPTION 
OF CONSTITUTION 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers welcomes the 
appointment of the first-ever women judges in the Maldives. Two women were appointed 
judges on 11 July, and a third one is due to be appointed next week. The Special 
Rapporteur visited the Maldives in February this year to provide advice to the Government 
on the judicial and constitutional reforms it has embarked upon. In a report he presented to 
the Human Rights Council last month (document A/HRC/4/25/Add.2), the Special 
Rapporteur emphasized the urgent need to end gender discrimination within the Maldivian 
judiciary and to promptly nominate women judges. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
congratulates the Maldivian authorities for having promptly implemented this very 
important recommendation, which is part of the broader judicial reform. He invites them to 
continue along this path by appointing other women judges, in order to reach an 
appropriate gender balance within the judiciary, in accordance with international 
obligations to which the Maldives have subscribed. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, with regard to the constitutional reform, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
decision of the Special Majlis (constitutional assembly) to adopt the new Constitution of 
the Maldives by 30 November 2007. The decision was adopted with a vast majority of 
votes from both the ruling party, the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP), and the main 
opposition party, the Maldives Democratic Party (MDP). In his mission report, the 
Special Rapporteur emphasized the importance and urgency of the adoption of a new 
constitutional framework for the country, to allow it to make a successful transition 
towards a democratic system of governance, based on a separation of powers. The earlier 
deadline of May 31 2007 set by the Government was not met because of the inability of 
both parties to reach an agreement on various aspects of the draft constitution. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur believes that the adoption of a new Constitution is essential in 
order to guarantee to the Maldivian people the establishment of democratic institutions and 
the respect for human rights in their country. Moreover, the timely adoption of the new 
Constitution is a key prerequisite for the first ever multi-party elections of the country, 
planned for the end of 2008, to take place in an appropriate institutional and legal setting. 
The Special Rapporteur notes however with concern that the constitutional reform process 
has been held up again since last Sunday 8 July, and that the Special Majlis speaker </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 123 
 
</p>
<p>indicated his intention not to resume the work of the body before ten days, although the 
Special Majlis had recently agreed to convene four times a week in order to meet the 
November deadline. 
</p>
<p>In this crucial point in time in the history of the country, the Special Rapporteur calls upon 
all members of the Special Majlis, and in particular the representatives of the two main 
political parties, urgently to resume their work and to spare no efforts, in a spirit of 
consensus, to reach the fundamental goal of adopting the new Constitution by the end of 
November.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>209. On 14 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UN EXPERT WELCOMES ACQUITTAL IN THE MALDIVES 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers welcomes the 
decision of the Criminal Court on 5 March 2008 to acquit a Maldivian Democratic Party 
(MDP) member, Imran Zahir, of the accusation made earlier of &#8216;causing disharmony 
through an unlawful assembly&#8217;, which is punishable under the penal code. It demonstrates 
the progress made by Maldives towards the independence of the judiciary since the Special 
Rapporteur visited the country in February last year. Since 2004, a number of political 
activists were charged under the current penal code with offences such as disobedience to 
order, disruption of religious harmony, unlawful assembly, peace disruption and 
obstructing police duty. The current effort of the Government of the Maldives, through the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office, to review these cases represents an important step towards the 
effective implementation of the human rights obligations of Maldives under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>The political determination of the Government of the Maldives to comply with its 
international human rights obligations prior to the first multi-party election is very 
encouraging. The Special Rapporteur is committed to offer his assistance to support the 
current effort of the Government to review the remaining cases.&#8221;

<p>210. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Maldives to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of 
the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegations.

<p>relaci&#243;n con las supuestas amenazas en contra de la Sra. Maria Luisa Garc&#237;a Andrade y la 
Sra. Marisela Ortiz Rivera, miembros de la organizaci&#243;n Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa con 
sede en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, y de los miembros de la Asociaci&#243;n Nacional de Abogados Democr&#225;ticos 
(ANAD). La organizaci&#243;n Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa y ANAD trabajan para pedir 
justicia para las mujeres secuestradas y asesinadas en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, estado de Chihuahua. De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 22 de junio de 2007, la Sra. Ortiz Rivera habr&#237;a recibido 
un mensaje de texto amenazante en su tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil, el cual supuestamente dec&#237;a lo siguiente: 
&#8216;Disfruta de la vida mientras puedas&#8217;. Asimismo, el 20 de junio de 2007, desconocidos habr&#237;an 
forzado el coche de la Sra. Garc&#237;a Andrade, sustrayendo documentaci&#243;n sobre el asesinato de su 
hermana, la Sra. Lilia Alejandra Garc&#237;a Andrade, perpetrado en el a&#241;o 2001. Seg&#250;n se informa, 
cuando la Sra. Garc&#237;a Andrade denunci&#243; el incidente en la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del 
Estado de Chihuahua uno de los funcionarios le habr&#237;a preguntado por qu&#233; no dejaba las 
cosas por las paz advirti&#233;ndole que &#8220;total ma&#241;ana apareces muerta, o yo muerto!&#8221; Adem&#225;s, 
el 10 de junio de 2007, una abogada de ANAD habr&#237;a recibido un mensaje en el m&#243;vil que 
conten&#237;a el siguiente texto &#8216;T&#250; ser&#225;s eliminada&#8217;. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, desde el 
10 de junio de 2007, tanto los miembros de la organizaci&#243;n Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa 
como los abogados y abogadas de ANAD habr&#237;an estado recibiendo mensajes v&#237;a correo 
electr&#243;nico amenaz&#225;ndoles con que les suceder&#237;a algo si no dejaban su actividad. 
La Sra. Ortiz Rivera, ha sufrido presuntas intimidaciones desde el 2003. De hecho, el 
24 de octubre de 2003, dos individuos enca&#241;ando armas de fuego le habr&#237;an atacado mientras 
viajaba en coche con sus dos hijas. Se alega que los perpetradores, le habr&#237;an apuntado con un 
arma a la cabeza y otra en la boca, amenaz&#225;ndole con que iba a conocer lo que sufren &#8216;las 
muertas de Ju&#225;rez&#8217;. Despu&#233;s de un tiempo los agresores la dejaron marcharse. Los expertos 
manifestaron que se teme que estos eventos puedan estar relacionados con la actividad en 
defensa de los derechos humanos de la organizaci&#243;n Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, y en 
particular la de la Sra. Maria Luisa Garc&#237;a Andrade y de la Sra. Marisela Ortiz Rivera y se

con supuestos actos de hostigamiento contra los miembros del Corporativo de Estudios y 
Asesor&#237;a Jur&#237;dica A.C., organizaci&#243;n que trabaja para la defensa de los derechos laborales y 
contra las violaciones graves a los derechos humanos. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas: en la 
ma&#241;ana del 3 de septiembre, los abogados del equipo del Corporativo de Estudios y Asesor&#237;a 
Jur&#237;dica A.C. se habr&#237;an percatado de que la chapa de la puerta de sus oficinas hab&#237;a sido forzada 
y los archiveros que normalmente se encuentran cerrados bajo llave, hab&#237;an sido tambi&#233;n 
abiertos y rebuscados. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, debido al desorden, a&#250;n no se habr&#237;a 
podido determinar con exactitud qu&#233; documentos o expedientes habr&#237;an sido sustra&#237;dos. A 
excepci&#243;n de una computadora port&#225;til y dos memorias usb, ning&#250;n otro objeto de valor habr&#237;a 
sido robado a pesar de que se habr&#237;an abierto cajones cerrados con llave donde hab&#237;a dinero en 
efectivo. Ese mismo d&#237;a, el equipo de abogados que integra el Corporativo habr&#237;a presentado una 
denuncia penal ante la cuarta Agencia del Ministerio P&#250;blico de la Procuradur&#237;a General de 
Justicia del Distrito Federal. Los expertos independientes manifestaron preocupaci&#243;n de que

<p>213. El 14 de Noviembre de 2007, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n junto con el 
Representante Especial del Secretario-General sobre la tortura en relaci&#243;n con el defensor de 
derechos humanos, Pedro Alvarado Delgado, mexicano y de 59 a&#241;os de edad, se encontraba 
tomando fotos e im&#225;genes en video de la operaci&#243;n policial llevada a cabo en San Salvador 
Atenco, en la que resultaron detenidas y agredidas m&#225;s de 150 personas, cuando fue detenido de 
forma arbitraria por agentes de la polic&#237;a. Seg&#250;n fuentes, al ser detenido, el Sr. Alvarado aleg&#243; su 
condici&#243;n de observador de derechos humanos. Los agentes de la polic&#237;a lo habr&#237;an golpeado 
repetidas veces en diversas partes de la cabeza y le habr&#237;an propinado patadas hasta arrojarlo al 
suelo, donde habr&#237;an vuelto a golpearlo y lo habr&#237;an amenazado de muerte. Al igual que a otros 
detenidos, despu&#233;s de esposarlo y obligarlo a taparse la cabeza, lo habr&#237;an obligado a permanecer 
acostado boca abajo, encima de las otras personas detenidas, durante las cinco horas que dur&#243; el 
trayecto en autob&#250;s hasta la prisi&#243;n de Santiaguito. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, durante el 
trayecto, le habr&#237;an golpeado y amenazado. El Sr. Alvarado habr&#237;a escuchado a la polic&#237;a 
amenazar a las mujeres detenidas con violarlas as&#237; como los gritos de dolor de las otras personas 
que se encontraban a su alrededor. Posteriormente, en la c&#225;rcel, se le habr&#237;a denegado el acceso a 
una atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica adecuada, a pesar de las heridas que presentaba, as&#237; como tambi&#233;n se le 
habr&#237;a denegado el derecho a un abogado defensor elegido por &#233;l. Seg&#250;n las informaciones 
recibidas, tampoco se le habr&#237;a informado de los motivos de su detenci&#243;n. El 5 de mayo de 2006, 
representantes de la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos habr&#237;an documentado las 
lesiones f&#237;sicas que hab&#237;a sufrido el Sr. Alvarado. El 8 de mayo el Sr. Alvarado habr&#237;a prestado 
declaraci&#243;n judicial pero sin la presencia de un juez. El 10 de mayo de 2006, en una audiencia 
conjunta de m&#225;s de 200 personas detenidas en San Salvador Atenco, se le habr&#237;a acusado 
formalmente del delito de ataques a las v&#237;as de comunicaci&#243;n y medios de transporte. El juez no 
habr&#237;a tenido en cuenta las pruebas de malos tratos de que fue objeto el Sr. Alvarado, las cuales 
constan en un certificado m&#233;dico, ni su declaraci&#243;n, seg&#250;n la cual, en el momento de la 
detenci&#243;n, llevaba a cabo actividades leg&#237;timas de derechos humanos. El 13 de mayo de 2006, 
quedar&#237;a en libertad bajo fianza. El proceso en su contra contin&#250;a abierto. A pesar de que habr&#237;a 
sido presentada una solicitud presentada por parte de la defensa para dar vista al Ministerio 
P&#250;blico, a efectos de investigar la alegaci&#243;n de torturas, el juez estatal neg&#243; dar intervenci&#243;n al 
Ministerio P&#250;blico para que fueran investigadas las supuestas violaciones de las que fue objeto el 
Sr. Pedro Alvarado. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la defensa habr&#237;a pedido juicio de 
amparo. En el fallo, el juez federal de amparo no habr&#237;a reconocido la obligaci&#243;n del juez estatal 
de informar a la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del Estado, de las pruebas sobre las supuestas 
torturas sufridas por Pedro Alvarado. El tribunal federal habr&#237;a resuelto que los tribunales 
estatales no est&#225;n obligados a informar al Ministerio P&#250;blico sobre la necesidad de iniciar una 
investigaci&#243;n por tortura. Seg&#250;n las informaciones, no existen pruebas que vinculen al 
Sr. Alvarado con los delitos que se le imputan. El juez habr&#237;a sostenido que corresponde al 
Sr. Alvarado probar su negativa de haber participado en el delito que se le imputa, lo cual podr&#237;a 
transgredir sus derechos a un debido proceso y a la presunci&#243;n de inocencia. En tal virtud, 
inconforme con su procesamiento, el se&#241;or Alvarado promovi&#243; un juicio de amparo contra la 
resoluci&#243;n del 10 de mayo de 2006. El Sr. Alvarado gan&#243; dicho juicio, en el que el juez federal 
habr&#237;a reconocido la ausencia de pruebas en la acusaci&#243;n formal y habr&#237;a ordenado que el juez 
competente precisara los elementos de prueba que acreditaran su responsabilidad y dictara una 
nueva resoluci&#243;n sobre el formal procesamiento. Sin embargo, el juez estatal habr&#237;a dictado una 
nueva resoluci&#243;n el 28 de noviembre de 2006, ordenando de nuevo el procesamiento de 
Pedro Alvarado, sin precisar las pruebas de la imputaci&#243;n como lo ordenaba la autoridad federal. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 126 
 
</p>
<p>El Sr. Alvarado habr&#237;a vuelto a promover juicio de amparo contra esa resoluci&#243;n, volviendo a 
ganar dicho juicio. La autoridad federal habr&#237;a ordenado al juez estatal, por segunda vez, precisar 
las circunstancias espec&#237;ficas que demostraran la supuesta responsabilidad del Sr. Alvarado. 
No obstante, el 10 de mayo de 2007, el juez estatal habr&#237;a emitido una resoluci&#243;n en la que se 
ordena el formal procesamiento de Pedro Alvarado, omitiendo nuevamente precisar los 
elementos probatorios que acreditan su supuesta responsabilidad. Contra dicha resoluci&#243;n, 
Pedro Alvarado se inconform&#243; ante un tribunal federal, por considerar que el juez estatal omiti&#243; 
dar cumplimiento a la sentencia de amparo en la que se ordenaba precisar las circunstancias 
espec&#237;ficas de la conducta que se le imputaba. Sin embargo, el tribunal federal declar&#243; 
improcedente tal inconformidad. El Sr. Alvarado, por tercera vez, habr&#237;a promovido juicio de 
amparo por no existir prueba que acreditara su participaci&#243;n en el delito que se le imputa. Dicho 
juicio se encuentra pendiente de resolver. Tras haber transcurrido m&#225;s de un a&#241;o desde que tuvo 
lugar la detenci&#243;n, acusaci&#243;n y torturas del Sr. Alvarado, los responsables a&#250;n no han sido 
enjuiciados y no existe una investigaci&#243;n al respecto.

erradicar la violencia contra las mujeres en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, solicit&#243; al Secretario de Seguridad 
P&#250;blica de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez que proporcionara vigilancia policiaca en los domicilios de Maria

Sr. Manuel Eduardo Fuentes Muniz por el delito de robo ocurrido en las oficinas del Corporativo 
de Estudios y Asesor&#237;a Jur&#237;dica A.C. Para dar con los probables responsables, el Ministerio

de la PGJDF, a menos que pudieran recibirse mayores elementos a trav&#233;s de la ampliaci&#243;n de la

<p>222. On 19 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Myanmar, regarding Ms. Khin Sanda Win, a 21 year-old university student, who is 
being tried under section 336/511 of the Penal Code in connection with the protests of 
September 2007. According to the information received, on 29 September 2007, a group of men 
in plain clothes stopped Ms. Win and searched her bag. Although they did not find anything, 
they tied her hands behind her back and took her to the Yangon Town Hall, where they put her 
together with ten unknown men and photographed each along with various weapons. They </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 129 
 
</p>
<p>forced them to sign confessions that the weapons had been found in their bags. Ms. Win refused 
to sign and subsequently one of the men in plain clothes hit her on the head with a bamboo rod. 
That night Ms. Win was sent to the Kyaikkasan Interrogation Camp, where she was kept without 
charge or warrant until 7 October. Afterwards, she was transferred to Insein Prison and held 
there until 25 October without charge, warrant or any other legal orders. On 25 October, she was 
sent to the Hlaing Township Peace and Development Council office where she was told to sign a 
pledge that she would not take part in any anti-state activities, after which she was released. 
During the 26 days of her detention, she was denied access to a lawyer and not allowed to 
contact her family. On 1 November, two police officers from Kyauktada Township Station came 
to Ms. Win&#8217;s house and informed her that she would be charged with illegal possession of arms 
as per section 19(e) of the Arms Act, although the &#8220;arms&#8221; they claimed to have found were a 
slingshot and some pellets, which are not listed under the act. Instead, when Ms. Win went to 
court the next day, the charge put against her was acting &#8220;to endanger human life or the personal 
safety of others&#8221; under section 336/511 of the Penal Code. She was granted bail for five million 
kyat, an amount that exceeds what a judge can legally order in such a case. On 12 November, the 
judge unilaterally revoked the bail on the grounds that Ms. Win constituted a threat to security 
forces personnel because the charge against her relates to the disturbances of September. Since 
then, she has been held in Insein Prison in solitary confinement.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations

<p>223. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of Myanmar to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of 
the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegation. Particularly, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned on the alleged long period in 
solitary confinement of Ms. Khin Sanda Win. He urges the Government to provide information 
whether there has been a judicial review of this detention, as required under international law; 
and whether she could have access to a lawyer and could be visited by her family.

<p>224. On 12 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights regarding alleged 
threats against Mr. Jitman Basnet, a lawyer, journalist and human rights defender. Mr. Basnet 
has been involved in working for the victims of conflict in Nepal for a number of years and in 
September 2006 he filed a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court, requesting that a High 
Level Committee be established to investigate human rights abuses that took place during the 
recent conflicts in the country. Mr. Basnet was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression on 26 January 2005. According to information received, on 
21 May 2007, at approximately 18:15pm, Mr. Basnet received a threatening phone-call in which </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 130 
 
</p>
<p>the caller informed him that he would &#8220;bear the consequences&#8221; of his work in defence of human 
rights in Nepal. The call was allegedly made from a public phone booth in Swayambhu, 
Kathmandu. In March 2007, Mr. Basnet published a book entitled 258 Dark Days, in 
collaboration with Advocacy Forum Nepal and the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC). 
The book provides an account of the 258 days he spent in incommunicado detention and the 
alleged torture and mistreatment he was subjected to during his time at Bhairabnath Battalion&#8217;s 
facilities. He was arrested in Kathmandu by members of the Bhairabnath Army Battalion 
on 4 February 2004. The book also refers to allegations of torture, rape, killings and/or 
disappearances at the hands of the Bhairabnath Barracks&#8217; personnel. 
</p>
<p>225. On 24 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders regarding Mr. Jitman Basnet. Mr. Jitman Basnet is a lawyer, journalist, and the 
Secretary General of the Lawyer&#8217;s Forum for Human Rights (LAFHUR), in Babarmahal, 
Kathmandu. Mr. Jitmas Basnet was the subject of a communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture on 16 February 2004. Mr. Basnet was also the subject of an 
allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, together with the 
Special Representative to the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 26 January 2005, and of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, together with the Special Representative to the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 12 June 2007. According to 
information received, on 7 August 2007, Mr. Jitman Basnet received a threatening telephone call 
from an unidentified woman. On 11 August 2007, Mr. Basnet received another call from a 
different unidentified woman who informed him that both he and his wife would be killed. 
Mr. Basnet officially reported these calls to the authorities on 13 August 2007, filing a complaint 
at Tinkune police station. On 18 August 2007, Mr. Basnet received another telephone call, this 
time from an individual identifying himself as both Khadga Mahato and Mahat, who informed 
him that he had been named in a book entitled 258 Dark Days, written by Mr. Basnet in 2007. 
The book chronicles his period of extended custody in Bhairabnath Batallion&#8217;s facilities and also 
details human rights violations allegedly committed against other detainees by personnel at the 
Bhairabnath Barracks. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned incidents may be directly 
related to Mr. Jitman Basnet&#8217;s legitimate and non-violent human rights work, in particular his 
work to investigate the human rights violations that have allegedly been committed during times 
of recent conflict in Nepal. Further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Jitman Basnet and his family.

<p>226. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply and invites the Government 
of Nepal to provide substantive and detailed information on the urgent appeals of 12 June 2007 
and 24 August 2007 at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth 
session of the Human Rights Council. With this respect, the Special Rapporteur expresses his </p>

</p>
<p>concern in relation to intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference suffered by

to be advised whether Mr. Basnet has received adequate safeguards by the authorities, in 
accordance with the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, in particular principle 17.

<p>227. On 9 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding 
Mr. Khalid Khawaja, a resident of Rawalpindi, currently detained in a high security detention 
facility in Faisalabad. Mr. Khawaja has reportedly been active with an organization called 
Defence for Human Rights, which brings together relatives of people who were subjected to 
enforced disappearance, especially those who were allegedly held by the security forces on 
suspicion of having links with terrorist networks. According to the information received, 
Khalid Khawaja was taken into custody by security forces at daybreak on 26 January 2007 
outside his family home in Rawalpindi. After some hours of inquiries his family was told that he 
was held in Adiala Jail, in Rawalpindi, charged with &#8220;distributing pamphlets that incite sectarian 
violence&#8221;. On 21 February 2007 the Islamabad Additional and Sessions Court granted him bail, 
but instead of being released that night he was moved to a different detention facility on the 
orders of the Home Secretary of Punjab. News reports claimed that he had been moved to a 
high-security detention facility in Faisalabad, but when his lawyer called the detention centre 
to confirm the reports, he was told that no one by that name was in custody there. 
On 22 February 2007 the District Magistrate of Islamabad ordered that Mr. Khawaja&#8217;s detention 
be extended by 30 days under the Maintenance of Public Order Act 1960. Mr. Khawaja&#8217;s family 
and lawyer filed an appeal at the Lahore High Court (Rawalpindi Bench). On 28 February 2007 
the High Court directed the provincial and federal authorities to establish Khalid Khawaja&#8217;s 
whereabouts and produce him in court by 2 March 2007, and make known the charges against 
him. The authorities did not present Mr. Khawaja in court. However, in a hearing on 
2 March 2007 they disclosed that he is currently held in a high security detention facility 
in Faisalabad. The High Court ordered that he be transferred to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi by 
5 March at the latest. Mr. Khawaja remains detained incommunicado with no access to his 
lawyer or family. Concern was expressed that Mr. Khawaja&#8217;s detention might be linked to his 
human rights activities on behalf of persons allegedly subjected to enforced disappearance and 
their families. Further concern was expressed about his physical integrity, both in the light of his 
prolonged incommunicado detention and especially because he is diabetic and might not be 
receiving adequate medical care.  
</p>
<p>228. On 16 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
suspension of Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Chaudhry, who on 9 March 2007 was removed 
by President Pervez Musharraf for alleged &#8220;misuse of office&#8221;. According to the information 
received, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, after being summoned to President Pervez 
Musharraf&#8217;s Camp Office in the military premises, was declared non-functional and 
subsequently suspended by President Musharaff on 9 March 2007. This was followed by another 
decision referring Mr. Iftikhar Chaudhry&#8217;s case to the Supreme Judicial Council to investigate </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 132 
 
</p>
<p>allegations of the Justice&#8217;s misconduct under article 209 of the Constitution. When the 
communication was sent, details about the actual allegations had not been made public by the 
authorities. At the time of his removal, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was involved in the 
hearing of several cases relating to disappearances allegedly conducted by intelligence agencies, 
gang rape and torture. After his suspension, Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is said to being 
prevented from meeting anyone including his closest relatives, being held in house arrest. 
On 13 of March 2007, Mr. Chaudhry was expected to appear before a panel of senior judges who 
were investigating allegations that he misused his authority. A large number of lawyers were 
present at Supreme Court building, waiting for his arrival. Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has named 
Munir A Malik, Tariq Mehmood, Aitizaz Ahsan and Hamid Khan to assist him during hearing of 
presidential reference against him. Mr. Chaudhry was stopped by police trying to walk to court 
and was taken to another official building before being forced into a car and taken to the court 
buildings. The lawyers that had gathered outside and around the court building were also 
demanding that the hearings be made open to the public. Furthermore, information has been 
received that on 12 March 2007 Pakistani lawyers took part in a demonstration, which was said 
to be one of the largest ever by High Court lawyers in Lahore. The lawyers were marching down 
the main road when police used batons to try and break up the procession. More than 20 lawyers 
were injured. Rallies attended by hundreds of lawyers were also held in the capital, Islamabad, 
and in other cities including Karachi and Quetta. Several courts are said to have discontinued 
functioning as a reaction to the suspension of the Chief Justice.  
</p>
<p>229. On 7 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders in 
relation to Mr. Ali Ahmed Kurd, Vice-President of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and a lawyer 
acting on behalf of Mr. Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial 
Council who was removed from his position as Chief Justice on 9 March 2007; and Mr. Ghulam 
Mustafa Kundwal, a member of the Bar Association in Pakistan. Both Mr. Kurd and 
Mr. Kundwal have been involved in a campaign advocating for the independence of the judiciary 
in Pakistan. According to the information received, on 28 April 2007, Mr. Kurd was arrested at 
the district court in Quetta for his alleged involvement in a violent incident during the funeral 
of Mr. Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, a political leader in Balochistan who was killed on 
30 August 2006. Mr. Kurd was detained at Quetta district court before being released later the 
same day after lawyers across Pakistan staged protests at various locations throughout the 
country against his detention. It is reported that unknown individuals had made several failed 
attempts to abduct Mr. Kurd prior to his arrest. According to reports, in a separate incident on the 
evening of 27 April 2007, Mr. Kundwal, was severely beaten by uniformed men and left for dead 
in a ditch near the Cantonment area in Rawalpindi. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned events are directly related to the work of Mr. Kurd and Mr. Kundwal defending 
human rights in Pakistan and in particular their attempts to ensure independence of the judiciary 
in the country.  
</p>
<p>230. On 14 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding 
Mr. Munir Malik, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and one of the lawyers 
representing, Mr. Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Council 
who was suspended on 9 March 2007. Mr. Malik has also been instrumental in leading the 
movement for the protection of the independence of the judiciary in Pakistan. According to the 
information received, on 9 May 2007, Mr. Malik&#8217;s office, in the Southern Port of Karachi, was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 133 
 
</p>
<p>blockaded, without prior warning, by the Karachi Building Control Authority (KBCA) on the 
grounds that the building was being used for commercial purposes in a residential area. Later 
that same day the Sind High Court issued an interim order in favour of Mr. Malik, stating that 
the authorities had no legal basis on which to close the office considering that the office had been 
in use since 2002, and the premises were restored. The closure took place three days before the 
office was due to host a reception for the suspended Chief Justice Chaudhry. According to 
reports, in the early hours of the morning, on 10 May 2007, Mr. Malik&#8217;s house was sprayed with 
bullets. Mr. Malik was at home at the time along with his wife and young children. A complaint 
has been lodged with Darakhshan Police Station, Karachi, however as yet the perpetrator has not 
been identified.  
</p>
<p>231. On 6 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on 
human rights and counter terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the imposition of the 
state of emergency by the President of Pakistan on 3 November 2007 and the suspension of 
fundamental freedoms, including the right not to be deprived of one&#8217;s liberty, save in accordance 
with the law and to the enjoyment of safeguards as to arrest and detention, the right to freedom 
of movement, the right to assemble in public and the freedom of expression. Further, the 
proclaimed state of emergency entails an attack on the independence of the judiciary. The State 
of Emergency declared by President Musharraf is said not to be a constitutional emergency 
envisaged in the Constitution, which has now been declared to remain in abeyance and replaced 
by a &#8220;Provisional Constitution Order&#8221;. According to the information received, seven members of 
the Supreme Court issued a declaration against the emergency rule order stating that it appears 
not to be legal, neither under the Constitution nor under international law. In particular, the 
mandate holders expressed their concern about the situation of some 70 human rights defenders 
who were arrested during a meeting inside the premises of the NGO Human Rights Commission 
of Pakistan (HRCP) in Lahore. They were taken to the police initially, and requested to sign a 
declaration not to engage in any human rights activities. They all refused to sign it and were 
verbally abused by police officers. Those arrested on 4 November include the following 
55 human rights activists (31 male and 24 female): Mr. I.A. Reham, Director of 
HRCP, Mr. Syed Iqbal Haider, Secretary General of HRCP, Ms. Shahtaj Qazalbash, 
Mr. Mehboob Khan, Mr. Nadeem Anthony, Ms. Saleema Hashmi, Ms. Rubina Saigol, 
Ms. Samina Rehman, Brig Rao, Abid Hameed, Faisal Akhtar, Waseem Majeed Malik, 
Irfan Barket, Dr. Naseem Ali, Dr. Khurram Iftikhar, Dr. Yousaf Yaseen, Mr. Irshad Choudhry, 
Imran Qureshi, Shams Mahmood, Zaffar ul Hassan, Khalid Mehmood, Bilal Hassan Minto, 
Muhammad Bashir, Ali Cheema, Shahid Hafeez, Syed Mozam Ali Shah, Mansoor Ali Shah, 
Shahzeb Masood, Javed Amin, Suleman Akram, Muhammad Bilal Sabir, Shahid Amin, Khawaja 
Amjad Hussain, Mahmood Ahmed, Rahim ul Haq, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, Alia Ali, Samia Ali, 
Azhra Irshad, Jona Anderyas, Ayra Anderyas, Zeba, Neelam Hussain, Gulnar, Sonobar, 
Sadaf Chughtai, Nasreen Shah, Shaista Parvaiz Malik, Iram Sharif, Amina Sharif, Taina Sabah 
ud Din, Tamkant Karim, Lala Raukh, Huma Shah, Nasreen Shah, and Samia Ameen Khawaja. 
All 55 human rights activists were produced before the Judicial Magistrate on 5 November 2007 
and were sent to Kot Lakhpat Jail Lahore. A hearing took place on 6 November 2007 and 
these 55 activists have reportedly been released on bail. The practising lawyer and 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ms. Asma Jahangir, has </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 134 
 
</p>
<p>been placed under house arrest for a period of 90 days, and her house has been declared a sub-
jail were some of the activists mentioned above are currently detained. Two women defenders, 
Ms. Shahtag Qizilbash and Ms. Salima Hashmi, were shifted to a police owned residence at an 
unknown location. None of them have been charged. Neither a warrant, nor a judicial order were 
issued. The activists have not had access to lawyers or to their families and were detained for 
several hours without receiving food. Concern was expressed at the health of some of these 
leaders who are rather elderly. One of the detained activists, Mr. Ashtar Ausaf Ali advocate was 
sent to the hospital after suffering a heart attack in police custody. The Proclamation of 
emergency states that some members of the judiciary have undermined the executive and 
legislative branches in the fight against terrorism and extremism, thereby weakening the 
Government&#8217;s ability to address this grave threat. Immediately after the imposition of the State 
of emergency judges were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Provisional Constitutional 
Order to continue exercising their functions as judges. A high percentage of the judges refused to 
take the oath, as they refused to accept the state of emergency order, declaring it 
unconstitutional. In particular, only four out of the 17 judges of the Supreme Court took the oath. 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was among those who did not accept taking the oath. All 
the judges of the Supreme Court who refused to take oath have been immediately replaced by 
new judges. They are not allowed to leave their homes and are prevented by Government forces 
from doing so. Eight out of the 27 judges of the High Court of the Sindh Province took oath, 
while the other, including the Chief Judge, refused. In Balochistan, all five judges of the High 
Court accepted to take oath. In the Punjab Province, 17 out of the 31 judges of the High Court, 
including the Chief Judge, took oath. The most senior judge among those who refused to take 
oath, Mr. Bokhari, is now under house arrest. In the North West Frontier Province, around 50% 
of the 17 judges have not taken oath. On 5 November 2007, lawyers protested against the 
declaration of the state of emergency. There are indications of extreme brutality in the repression 
by the police and extensive arrests of lawyers. Some 150 lawyers have been arrested in Karachi 
and 50 in Lahore, including Ms. Hifza Aziz and Ms. Abid Saqi. Lawyers have been attacked by 
the police also inside the Court and the bar premises. All office bearers of the Bar Associations 
have been arrested. The Government has suspended the transmission of privately owned local 
and international television channels, in particular news stations. Agents of the Electronic Media 
Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) alongside police officers raided the premises of television and 
radio channels to confiscate equipment. Internet service providers were also ordered to stop their 
service, interrupting Internet access for a large number of users. The President promulgated a 
new ordinance under which the print and electronic media have been barred from printing and 
broadcasting &#8220;anything which defames or brings into ridicule the head of state, or members of 
the armed forces, or executive, legislative or judicial organ of the state&#8221;. The ordinance 
stipulated up to 3 years in prison as punishment for non-compliance.  
</p>
<p>232. On 14 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism regarding the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Ordinance, 2007. 
According to the information received, on 10 November 2007, President Pervez Musharraf 
issued Ordinance No. LXVI amending the 1952 Army Act. This measure was taken in the 
context of the proclamation of a state of emergency by President Musharraf on 3 November this 
year. This amendment will broaden the scope of the Act for civilians to be tried and convicted by 
military tribunals. Previously, the Army Act contained provisions enabling the army to try 
civilians, but only if at least one of the accused belonged to the armed forces. Under the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 135 
 
</p>
<p>amendment, a sub-clause (iia) was be inserted into the sub-clause (ii) which reads: &#8220;Any offence, 
if committed in relation to defence or security of Pakistan or any part thereof or Armed Forces of 
Pakistan, punishable under the Explosive Substance Act, 1908 (VI of 1908), prejudicial conduct 
under the Security of Pakistan Act, 1952 (XXXV of 1952), the Pakistan Arms Ordinance, 1965 
(W.P.Ord. XX of 1965), the Prevention of Anti-national Activities Act, 1974 (VII of 1974) or 
Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act 
abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its 
punishment), 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public, or by more than ten persons), 
120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging or attempting to wage war or abetting 
waging of war against Pakistan), 121A (conspiracy to commit offences punishable by 
Section 121), 122 (collecting arms, etc., with intention of waging war against Pakistan), 
123 (concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war), 123A (condemnation of the 
creation of the state and advocacy of abolition of its sovereignty), 124 (assaulting president, 
governor, etc., with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power), 
124A (sedition), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 302 (punishment of Qatl-i-amd), 
353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 505 
(statement conducive to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code or attempt to commit any of 
the said offences.&#8221; Under the amended Army Act, the military courts will not have to honour the 
strict requirements of due process of law and the examination of evidence as under civil 
adjudication. Moreover, lawyers would only be allowed to represent the accused in the capacity 
of a &#8220;friend&#8221;. Furthermore, according to the ordinance, the amendment will have retroactive 
effect and include any of the above mentioned offences that have been committed since 
1 January 2003. Government officials state that one of the reasons for the amendment to the 
Army Act is the inability of the existing anti-terrorism courts to hold proper or speedy trials of 
the people involved in acts of terrorism or armed militancy in the country. Concern was 
expressed that the new amendment be used to curb protest against the Government and the 
proclamation of the state of emergency, and to prevent individuals from pursuing political 
activities. With respect to the retroactive effect, concern was expressed that the amendment be 
used to cover the hundreds of cases of &#8220;disappearance&#8221; that the Supreme Court under Chief 
Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry was inquiring into.  
</p>
<p>233. On 23 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, Special Rapporteur on torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the situation of lawyers and judges in 
Pakistan, including the lawyers Mr. Munir A. Malik, Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, Mr. Tariq Mahmood, 
Mr. Ali Ahmed Kurd, Mr. Abrar Hassan and Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, and Mr. Ifetkhar Choudhry, 
chief justice of Pakistan, other judges of the Supreme Court, Mr. Sabih Uddin Ahmed, 
Chief Justice of Sindh, Mr. Justice Shahani, Mr. Justice Musheer Alam and Ms. Noor Naz Agha, 
judges of the Sindh High Court. According to the information received on 3 November 2007 
President Musharraf declared the state of emergency. Since then, more than 3000 lawyers have 
been arrested and detained, which constitutes an unprecedented attack to the legal profession in 
Pakistan. Many of them are being held for up to 90 days under the Maintenance of Public Order 
law. Among them are numerous lawyers affiliated with political movements striving for the 
restoration of the constitution. It is reported that these lawyers have been arrested and put in 
detention without having committed any offense, for the sole fact of having expressed their 
opinion about the recently promulgated state of emergency. Furthermore, it is reported that a </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 136 
 
</p>
<p>new professional ordinance is to be passed giving the High Courts and the Supreme Court the 
power to remove the licences of practicing lawyers, which would be in violation of the 
independence of lawyers and their right to exercise their functions without interference. In this 
context, information was received about the situation of senior lawyers Mr. Munir A. Malik, 
Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, Mr. Tariq Mahmood, Mr. Ali Ahmed Kurd, Mr. Abrar Hassan and 
Mr. Ahsan Bhoon. It is reported that Mr. Munir A. Malik, former president of the Supreme Court 
Bar Association (SCBA), is being held in Attock Fort under the custody of the military 
intelligence service. Numerous instances of torture are said to have occurred at Attock Fort 
during the past months. Munir A. Malik, who is known to suffer from a heart condition, was 
reportedly visited by Government doctors on 10 November. There have been no further reports 
on his current condition. Aitzaz Ahsan, current president of the SCBA, is being held in Adiala 
prison in Rawalpindi. His lawyer has repeatedly been denied access to him. On 6 November, the 
authorities at the Adiala prison are said not to have admitted Atizaz Ahsan&#8217;s lawyer, even though 
the Deputy Commissioner of Islamabad Administration had given permission for the visit. 
Mr. Tariq Mahmood, former President of the Supreme Court Bar Association had allegedly been 
imprisoned in Adiala prison. No one has been allowed to see him and it is reported that he has 
been transferred to an unknown place. The whereabouts of Ali Ahmed Kurd, former Vice Chair 
of the Pakistan Bar Council, who was also detained on 3 November, continue to be unknown. 
Information received suggests that Mr. Ali Ahmed Kurd has been handed over to intelligence 
agencies and has been maltreated. Mr. Abrar Hassan and Mr. Ahsan Bhoon are said to be held 
incommunicado since their arrest on 3 November. The mandate holders have also received 
worrying information according to which not less than 417 lawyers have been arrested and are 
detained in the city of Lahore. The list of the detained Lahore based lawyers is included in the 
annex. Many more lawyers have been arrested in the rest of the province of Punjab. Although 
some lawyers would have been freed on 20 November, it appears that many of them have been 
re-arrested, and that many others remain in detention. It is also reported that lawyers have been 
severely beaten during demonstrations, including women lawyers, and that they would be 
subjected to cruel and degrading treatment while in detention. Concerning the situation of 
judges, it is reported that Mr. Ifetkhar Choudhry, Chief Justice of Pakistan, remains in detention, 
as well as other judges of the Supreme Court who have refused to take the new Oath under the 
new state of emergency regulations. Other judges are detained in the country, including the 
following judges of the Sindh High Court that have been brought under house arrest: Mr. Sabih 
Uddin Ahmed, Chief Justice of Sindh, Mr. Justice Shahani, Mr. Justice Musheer Alam and 
Ms. Noor Naz Agha. Finally, the mentioned judges have been dismissed in violation of the 
Pakistan Constitution and legislation that do not provide the President of Pakistan with the 
authority to dismiss judges and that guarantee the security of tenure of judges, in particular of 
Supreme Court judges. Grave concern was expressed at the numerous arrests and detentions of 
lawyers and judges under provisions that allow detention without charge or trial. Of further 
concern is the reported frequent incommunicado detention, which includes denial of visits by 
family and lawyers. With respect to the lawyers and judges mentioned above and in the annex, 
grave concern was expressed that they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. As regards 
Mr. Malik, concern is expressed with regard to his health. Great concern is also expressed at the 
dismissal of judges. In this regard, we call upon the Government to reinstate all judges that have 
been illegally dismissed. </p>

<p>234. On 21 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS EXPERTS EXPRESS DISTRESS ABOUT RECENT EVENTS IN 
PAKISTAN 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders express 
serious distress about recent events in Pakistan. On 9 March 2007, President Pervez 
Musharraf suspended the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Chaudhry, over unspecified 
allegations of &#8216;misuse of office&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>Demonstrators, including lawyers, journalists, political activists and civil society actors, 
have taken to the streets since 12 March to protest against this presidential decision, which 
is broadly seen as constituting an attack against the independence of the judiciary. Law 
enforcement authorities, in some instances, have used force in an excessive manner against 
peaceful demonstrators, and have arrested several of them. Also, journalists were 
physically hindered from reporting on the events. 
</p>
<p>In this context, several judges have resigned in the past few days and lawyers in various 
parts of the country are boycotting court proceedings in sign of protest against the 
suspension and against police abuses against demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative wish to remind the Government of 
provisions enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan that establish a specific procedure as a 
safeguard to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and to protect judges from undue 
interference by the executive branch. In the present case, it is widely believed that the 
Chief Justice was suspended without respect for these procedures. 
</p>
<p>The circumvention of the Constitution constitutes a serious interference of the executive 
with the independence of the judiciary. This threatens the proper functioning of the 
country&#8217;s judicial system. 
Furthermore, the experts are concerned about the excessive force used against peaceful 
demonstrators. This is contrary to international standards, which guarantee the right to 
peaceful assembly for the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. It is the duty of the State to ensure the protection of everyone 
against any violence, threats or any other arbitrary action as a consequence for his or her 
exercise of these rights. 
</p>
<p>The two United Nations experts call upon the Government of Pakistan to follow 
scrupulously the constitutional procedures for an inquiry related to the Chief Justice&#8217;s 
conduct, to immediately halt the excessive force applied by law enforcement 
authorities and to investigate thoroughly these actions, and to do its utmost to ensure a 
continued functioning of the administration of justice in conformity with international 
standards.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>235. On 6 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p>UN EXPERTS WELCOME REINSTATEMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHAUDHRY OF 
PAKISTAN 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders 
welcome the reinstatement of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Chaudhry, after a 
majority decision of the Supreme Court on 20 July 2007. 
The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative see this decision of the Supreme 
Court as a significant step towards restoring confidence in the rule of law, but still wish to 
stress the importance of keeping the independence of the judiciary. 
In a press release issued on 21 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur and the Special 
Representative had expressed their concerns regarding the events that took place in 
Pakistan after 9 March 2007, when President Pervez Musharraf suspended the Chief 
Justice over unspecified allegations of &#8216;misuse of office&#8217;. The Special Rapporteur and the 
Special Representative called upon the Government of Pakistan, among others, to follow 
scrupulously the constitutional procedures for an inquiry related to the Chief Justice&#8217;s 
conduct and to do its utmost to ensure a continued functioning of the administration of 
justice in conformity with international standards. Furthermore, they called upon the 
Government to investigate thoroughly the reported cases of excessive force applied by law 
enforcement authorities against peaceful demonstrators.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>None. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>236. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply and urges the Government 
of Pakistan to provide substantive answers to the above allegations at the earliest possible date, 
and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council. The Special 
Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the interference of the executive in the judiciary, in breach of 
the Principle 1 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary. The suspension of 
judges and their effective house arrest violates international norms and standards for the 
independence of the judiciary. Judges should not be removed by the executive, except in cases of 
incapacity or if they are unfit to discharge their duty. He also expresses grave concern at the 
declaration of the state of emergency, which is said not to be constitutional. The Special 
Rapporteur is also deeply concerned about the numerous arrests and detentions of judges, 
lawyers and human rights activists under emergency provisions, which allow detentions without 
charges or trial, in the form of incommunicado detention. Detainees have neither access to 
lawyers, nor to their families. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
repeal the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Ordinance, 2007, since it allows military courts to try 
civilians. This Ordinance does not comply with international human rights norms and standards 
on the right to fair trial. </p>

<p><b>Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b></p>
<p>239. El 8 de Agosto de 2007, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada 
el 12 de Abril de 2007. Seg&#250;n dicha respuesta, el 24 de Abril de 2007 se solicit&#243; informaci&#243;n 
relativa a la situaci&#243;n de las se&#241;oras Iscra Chavez Loaiza y Evelyn Cevallos Enriquez, a la 
representante del Ministerio P&#250;blico ante el Consejo Nacional de Derechos Humanos, 
espec&#237;ficamente sobre las investigacions que se hubieren realizado respecto de las amenazas 
arriba mencionadas. El 24 de Abril de 2007 se hizo una solicitud similar al Ministerio del 
Interior, en el sentido de indicar si se hab&#237;an tomado medidas de seguridad personal a favor de 
las mencionadas abogadas. El 17 de Mayo de 2007 el Ministerio del Interior remiti&#243; un informe 
con fecha 26 de Enero 2006 en el que se da cuenta de las investigaciones realizadas respecto de 
las amenazas relacionadas con la denuncia interpuesta por la Sra. Iscra Chavez Loaiza ante la 
Segunda Fiscal&#237;a Provincial Mixta de Wanchacq - Cusco. Se informa que la Unidad X 
DIRTEPOL - CUSCO a cargo de la investigaci&#243;n de los hechos se entrevist&#243; con la Sra. Iscra 
Chavez Loaiza y lleg&#243; a la conclusi&#243;n de que las amenazas eran mensajes de texto efectuadas 
desde una cabina de Internet. Se determin&#243; que dos de los mensajes se habr&#237;an emitido desde una 
cuenta de la empresa CLARO y que no ha sido posible identificar a la persona autora de las 
amenazas, puesto que la empresa exige que se presente una orden judicial para proporcionar las 
informaciones relativas a la cuenta de Internet. Posteriormente se abri&#243; invetigaci&#243;n por parte de 
la Quinta Fiscal&#237;a Provicional de Cusco, la cual tambi&#233;n fue enviada a la Segunda Fiscal&#237;a penal 
de Wanchaw, en vista de que las agraviadas hab&#237;an interpuesto denuncia ante dicho organismo. 
Esta &#250;ltima, en resoluci&#243;n de 23 de Febrero de 2006 decidi&#243; archivar provisionalmente la 
investigaci&#243;n, debido a que t&#233;cnicamente no era posible identificar a las personas autoras de los 
mensajes de texto. Adem&#225;s, el 4 de abril de 2007 se recepcion&#243; otra denuncia interpuesta por las 
Se&#241;oras Iscra Chavez Loaiza y la Sra. Evelyn Cevallos Enriquez, la cual fue derivada a la 
comisar&#237;a PNP del Distrito de Wanchaq para investigaci&#243;n preliminar. Posteriormente la 
Segunda Fiscal&#237;a dispuso que se continuara con la investigaci&#243;n, a pesar de que la Sra. Iscra 
Chavez Loaiza no se hab&#237;a presentado a rendir declaraciones y de haber sido notificada varias 
veces. Finalmente el Gobierno afirma que la Quinta Fiscal&#237;a Provincial de Cusco viene 
realizando investigaci&#243;n policial del caso desde el 12 de abril de 2007, con el fin de identificar a 
los responsables del env&#237;o de los mensajes de texto. Para ello estableci&#243; contactos con el

toma nota de todas las diligencias policiales y judiciales que se han venido adelantando con el fin 
de esclarecer quienes son los autores de las amenazas a las abogadas Iscra Chavez Loaiza y

amenazas. Tampoco se ha tomado ninguna medida para proteger la vida e integridad personal de 
las abogadas. El Relator Especial hace un llamado para que se tomen todas las medidas 
necesarias para proteger a las se&#241;oras Iscra Chavez Loaiza y Evelyn Cevallos Enriquez, y llama a 
las autoridades para que redoblen esfuerzos con el fin de realizar investigaciones m&#225;s efectivas

que no se han tomado medidas concretas que protejan su integridad f&#237;sica. Por ello urge al

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>244. On 8 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders in 
relation to repeated killings of lawyers and judges in the country. During the past two months 
only, four individuals have been killed, namely Nathaniel Pattugalan, judge, shot dead by men 
on a motorcycle on 19 January 2007; Gil Gojol, human rights lawyer, killed in a similar manner 
on 12 December 2006, and Froiland Siobal and Leonito Tapel, attorneys, ambushed and killed 
on 19 November 2006 and 2 December 2006 respectively. Furthermore, we have been 
informed that an International Fact Finding Mission concluded in its report &#8220;From Facts to 
Action. Report on the attacks against Filipino Lawyers and Judges&#8221; issued on 24 July 2006, that 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government has not taken sufficient measures to address the continuing 
extrajudicial killings of lawyers and judges effectively. In particular criticism has been expressed 
that your Government has not responded seriously to strong allegations that its own security 
forces are involved in the killings nor taken effective measures to ensure that appropriate 
investigations and prosecutions of the perpetrators be conducted. It was also brought to our 
attention that a Special Commission of Inquiry, headed by former Supreme Court Justice 
Jose Melo, had been established to investigate the killings. According to information received, 
the Commission concluded its work in December 2006 and was expected to report its findings to 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government in the first week of 2007. So far, however, the findings and 
recommendations of the Commission appear not to have been made public. 
</p>
<p>245. On 3 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter in relation to 
continuous killings of lawyers in the country. According to the information received, on 
17 June 2007, Mr. Demetrio Hilbero, a lawyer, was killed in an ambush by two men on board a 
motorcycle in front of his office in Barangay Poblacion, as he was opening the gate of his law 
office near the public market. He was shot several times at close range. According to the 
police chief, the killing of Mr. Hilbero may have been related to the cases he was handling in 
Calamba City where he was working as a lawyer at the time of his death. On 18 June 2007, 
Mr. Luis Dote, also a lawyer, was killed by two unidentified men who fired multiple gunshots 
while he was onboard a passenger van, upon reaching Maingaran village. Mr. Dote was a lawyer 
connected with the Public Attorney&#8217;s office serving Philippine citizens with limited resources in 
Masabate City in eastern Philippines. According to the information received, the police have 
reason to believe that the attack was related to his work. Since 2001, dozens of prosecutors, 
judges and lawyers have been subject to murderous attacks of which Mr. Dote and Mr. Hilbero 
were the latest victims. In addition to the arbitrary violation of the right to life of the numerous 
lawyers that have been killed, those murders are depriving an innumerable number of citizens of 
their right to legal representation before the courts. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>246. On 4 April 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 8 February 2007, 
indicating that Judge Nathaniel Pattugalan, 60 years old and married, was killed on 
19 January 2007 at about 6:15 p.m. The incident occurred along Elliptical Road, in front of the 
Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Building in Quezon City. Initial investigation conducted 
by the Philippine National Police - Criminal Investigation and Detective Group (PNP-CIDG) </p>

</p>
<p>disclosed that the victim boarded a passenger jeepney and sat beside the driver. Two unidentified 
male suspects on board a motorcycle suddenly approached the right side of the jeepney and one 
of them shot Judge Pattugalan at close range. The suspects then sped off in an unknown 
direction. The victim was immediately rushed by the responding elements of the Quezon City 
Police District to Emilio Aguinaldo Medical Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival by 
the attending physician at about 6:55 p.m. on that same day. On 22 January 2007, the widow of 
the Judge, Mrs. Anastacia Pattugalan, was invited by the PNP to shed light on the circumstances 
prior to her husband&#8217;s death. She revealed that her husband was designated Acting Presiding 
Judge of the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) Branch 35 in September 2006. 
According to Mrs. Pattugalan, three days prior to Judge Pattugalan&#8217;s death, they had been 
receiving numerous anonymous phone calls, usually between 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Whenever 
they attempted to talk to the caller, the caller would hang up. In one instance, Judge Pattugalan 
volunteered to answer the call, but refused to discuss with his wife what the call was about. On 
15 January 2007, Judge Pattugalan sent a letter to Supreme Court Chief Justice Reynato Puno, 
requesting to be transferred to another Court in Manila. In said letter, he mentioned, among other 
things, the continuous threats to his life that may possibly be conducted to the ambush incident in 
which he survived unharmed on 27 October 2006 in Baggao, Cagayan. PNP is still validating 
information regarding the motorcycle used by the assailants as it was seen parked near a 
sidewalk at the vicinity of the DAR Building, a few hours before the incident. Continuous 
coordination among PNP Units is being undertaken for the early solution of the case. 
Atty. Gil Gojol, human rights lawyer and former legal counsel of the different labor unions 
in Sorsogon, was killed in December 2006 at around 12:09 p.m., along the national road at 
Barangay Beriran, Gubat, Sorsogon. Reports from the Police Regional Office 5 
disclosed that after attending a court hearing in Gubat, Sorsogon, Atty. Gojol&#8217;s van, driven by 
Danilo M. France, was blocked by a black Yamaha motorcycle driven by an unidentified person 
wearing a helmet along with two male backriders wearing caps. One of the backriders shot the 
driver causing the vehicle to stop. Seeing his driver wounded, Atty. Gojol jumped out of the 
vehicle and ran about 35 meters away towards the grassy portion of the road, but was chased 
alter by two gunmen who shot him in different parts of his body. The motive behind 
Atty. Gojol&#8217;s murder is said to may have been politically motivated. Atty. Gojol&#8217;s driver was 
also killed during the incident. One of the three suspects was identified as Mario Fortun, a.k.a. 
Omar. A case has been filed against the suspects at the Sorsogon Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
under IS No. 2007-1411. Results of the investigation conducted by Task Force Siobal 
headed by Police Sr. Supt. Noli G. Talino revealed that Atty. Froilan Siobal and his wife, 
Mrs. Erlinda Siobal were killed on 19 November 2006 at about 10:00 a.m. along Siobal St., 
Barangay Inerangan, Alaminos City, Pangasinan. Based on sworn statements by witnesses 
Reynaldo A. Dacon and Bernald A. Caballero, spouses Froilan and Erlinda Siobal were on 
board their vehicle when SPO1 Agapito &#8220;Pitong&#8221; Celino, member of the PNP and assigned at 
106th Police Mobile Group (PMG) based in Alaminos City, Pangasinan, together with 
Ojing Olivarez, both armed, suddenly appeared and shot the victims. Mrs. Siobal still managed 
to get out of their vehicle and tried to run but she stumbled on the ground. At this juncture, 
SPO1 Celino drew a short firearm and shot Mrs. Siobal twice killing her instantly. After the 
incident, the suspects casually walked away towards the north direction bringing with them the 
weapons they used in the killings. Witness Reynaldo A. Dacon further stated that he also saw 
Barangay Councilman Donald Sison and Edgar Parang at the crime scene, who also left after the 
incident. In a sworn statement by Froilan Francisco A. Siobal, eldest son of the victims, other 
persons alleged to be the conspirators in the killings of his parents were indicated. These persons, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 144 
 
</p>
<p>according to him, threatened his father by means of direct and indirect utterances and were seen 
near their place of residence before his parents were killed. The suspects allegedly used a red van 
with plate number XDL 564 usually driven by SPO1 Celino. The eldest son identified the 
conspirators of SPO1 Celino as Boyet Medrano, Bong Grate, Barangay Chairman Rico Aquino, 
Mading &#8220;Mading&#8221; Tobias, Daniel Luciano, Landong Losendo and a certain &#8220;Taba&#8221;, all residents 
of Barangay San Miguel, Bani, Pangasinan. He further stated that the motive behind the killings 
of his parents could be that his father was being suspected as one of the masterminds in the 
killing of one Rommel Rolda, a native of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, residing at Barangay San Miguel, 
Bani, Pangasinan, who was shot to death on 10 October 2003. On 29 November 2006, a case 
of double murder was filed before the Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, Alaminos City, Pangasinan 
against suspects SPOT Agapito Celino, Ojing Olivarez, Barangay Councilman Edgar Parang 
and other John Does under ID No. AC-06-341. SPO1 Celino is being re-assigned from the 
106th PMG to Pangasinan Police Provincial Office and will be restricted inside the camp 
pending the disposition of an administrative case against him.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>247. The Special Rapporteaur thanks the Government of Philippines for its cooperation and its 
response to his communication of 8 February 2007. However, he remains concerned by the fact 
that the investigations of the killings are being held by the Philippines National Police, security 
force suspected to be involved in the crimes. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
take effective measures to ensure that appropriate investigations be conducted. 
</p>
<p>248. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of publicity of the 
findings and recommendations of the Special Commission of Inquiry, headed by the former 
Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo. He urges the Government to make them public. In addition, 
the Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the allegation letter sent 
on 3 September 2007 and urges the Government of Philippines to provide at the earliest possible 
date, and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed 
substantive answer to the above allegations.

<p>249. On 10 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding acts of harassment against human rights defenders in the Russian Federation 
including threats made against Mrs. Svetlana Gannuchkina, President of the Committee of 
Civil Assistance, Mr. Sergey Kovalov, a founder of the Memorial Society in Grozny and 
Mrs. Lidia Yusupova, lawyer, director of the Memorial Society and Nobel Peace Prize 
nominee. Further reports have also been received in relation to the harassment of 
Mr. Stanislav Dmitrievsky and the subsequent closure of the Russian-Chechen Friendship 
Society (RCFS), a non-governmental organization that monitors human rights violations in 
Chechnya and other parts of the North Caucasus. Mr. Stanislav Dmitrievsky, Executive Director 
of RCFS, and Ms Oksana Chelysheva, Deputy Director of RCFS, were the subjects of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 15 November 2005, and of an allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 145 
 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
9 June 2005. According to new information received, an ultra-nationalist group calling 
themselves &#8220;The Russian Will&#8221;, have recently published a list of 89 individuals on a website 
which include the names of several human rights defenders, including Svetlana Gannuchkina and 
Sergey Kovalov. According to reports the named individuals were categorized as &#8220;friends of 
foreigners&#8221; or &#8220;traitors to the Nation&#8221; and their personal data appears on a website where the 
group reportedly calls for the physical elimination of the listed individuals. It has also been 
reported that on 12 October 2006, Lida Yusupova reportedly received a threatening phone call 
on her mobile phone from an unidentified caller who said in Chechen: &#8220;Are you pleased to be a 
nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize? Presuming you&#8217;ll still be alive then!&#8221; Furthermore on 
13 October 2006, a court in Nizhniy Novgorod reportedly ordered the closure of RCFS, in 
accordance with a request from the regional Prosecutor&#8217;s office, on the basis that 
Stanislav Dmitrievsky had remained as Executive Director of RCFS despite being sentenced 
in February 2006, to a two year suspended sentence for &#8220;incitement to national hatred&#8221;. The 
court allegedly based its decision to close the RCFS on the &#8220;law to combat extremist 
activities&#8221;. Concern was expressed that the threats made against Mrs. Svetlana Gannuchkina, 
Mr. Sergey Kovalov and Mrs. Lida Yusupova should be treated as being serious, particularly in 
the light of the recent killing of Ms Politkovskaya and may represent attempts to deter human 
rights defenders in the Russian Federation from carrying out their legitimate activities. 
Furthermore, serious concerns were expressed that the amendments adopted this summer to the 
&#8220;law to combat extremist activities&#8221; may be used against human rights defenders, and the 
charges brought against the RCFS based on this law may set a precedent under which other 
human rights non-governmental organizations may also be closed. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>250. On 20 February 2007 the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 10 October 2006, stating that the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society was dissolved by 
the decision of the Nizhny Novgorod provincial court of 13 October 2006. After the decision 
was handed down, the respondent appealed against it by way of cassation. In January 2007, 
the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the decision. The Russian-Chechen 
Friendship Society was dissolved in accordance with article 44 of the Federal Act on 
Voluntary Organizations in connection with &#8220;repeated or gross violations of the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation, federal constitutional acts, federal acts or other laws and regulations&#8221;. 
The court found that the activities of the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society were not in 
keeping with the declared aims of the organization as contained in the Society&#8217;s statute; the 
Society&#8217;s activities grossly violated the legislation of the Russian Federation and had extremist 
tendencies. In accordance with the procedure contained in articles 144 and 145 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, the Maryinsky park district internal affairs office 
in Moscow is investigating the threats made against Ms. L. Yusupova. The Moscow procurator&#8217;s 
office is monitoring the investigation. The Office for Special Technical Measures of the Central 
Internal Affairs Office is taking the necessary measures to investigate the placement, on the 
Internet site of the magazine Russian Will, of the publication &#8220;Enemies of the nation&#8221;, 
containing basic information about, and the addresses and contact telephone numbers of, 
Mr. S.A. Kovalev, Ms. S.A. Gannushkina and other Russian human rights defenders. </p>

<p>252. On 13 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Ms. Nicole Sylvester, President of the St Vincent and the Grenadines Human Rights 
Association (SVGHRA), and the President of the St Vincent and the Grenadines Bar 
Association. According to the information received, on 25 January 2008, Ms. Nicole Sylvester 
received an anonymous telephone call at her home. The caller reportedly warned her to 
cease working on a particular case and reminded her that she had a family. On 2 February, 
Ms. Sylvester&#8217;s vehicle was followed by a white jeep, reportedly of the type used by the 
police&#8217;s Special Services Unit. On 4 February, she was approached near her office by 
a police officer who advised her to be careful as she was being followed. According to 
reports, Ms. Kay Bacchus-Browne, a lawyer and member of the SVGHRA, was also followed 
by a white jeep on the morning of 4 February. Ms. Sylvester and other lawyers from the 
SVGHRA have been representing a woman police officer who has alleged that she was raped by 
the Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines on 3 January 2008. The police reportedly 
refused to file her complaint and advised her to leave the country for a while. Her lawyers filed 
two private criminal complaints at the Magistrate&#8217;s Court on 31 January. The Director of Public 
Prosecutions reportedly halted the investigation, as permitted under the country&#8217;s Constitution, 
claiming that there was not sufficient evidence for the case to go to court. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>253. On 5 March 2008, the Permanent Mission of Saint Vincent and the grenadines to the 
United Nations responded to the communication sent on 13 February 2008. The Government 
affirms that the allegations contained in the communication sent on 14 February 2008 are false. 
According to the Government, Police investigations have revealed no evidence to suggest that 
either Ms. Sylvester or Ms. Bacchus-Browne, have been intimidated. In addition, the 
Commissioner of Police stated that no vehicles have been assigned to follow Ms. Sylvester or 
Ms. Bacchus-Browne. The alleged anonymous telephone call to Ms. Sylvester occurred priory to 
her notifying the Police Force that she was involved in the case. Moreover, to imply that the 
Police acted improperly in the handling of the accuser&#8217;s allegations against the Hon. Prime 
Minister, given the dearth of corroborating evidence and the accuser&#8217;s own refusal to provide 
the Police with their statement. The Government also states that a number of investigations 
have been undertaken, a medical examination has taken place and two judicial procedures 
are ongoing. Regarding the investigations, it is stated that the Police has investigated the 
accuser&#8217;s - Ms. Sylvester- allegations, even though the accuser requested the Police to refrain 
form doing so. All the evidence pointed out to the innocence of the accused - The Hon, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 147 
 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister- In consequence, the Police declined to arrest him. The Director of Public 
Prosecutors could not uncover sufficient evidence upon which to base a prosecution against the 
Hon. Prime Minister, thereby it exercised his Constitutional power to discontinue the criminal 
proceedings against him. The two ongoing procedures are a judicial review of the Director of 
Public Prosecutors decision of discontinuing the procedures against the Hon. Prime Minister, 
initiated by Ms. Sylvester and a civil proceeding against the Hon. Prime Minister, also initiated 
by Ms. Sylvester. The Government considers that neither the Special Rapporteur, nor the Special 
Representative can predict the outcome of a litigation. 
</p>
<p>254. On 17 March 2008, the Permanent Mission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines informed 
that the High Court of Justice in St Vincent and the Grenadines has dismissed the application for 
judicial review of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutors to discontinue private 
criminal complaints against the Hon. Prime Minister. The High Court found that the application 
had &#8220;... no arguable grounds for judicial review having a realistic prospect of success&#8221;. 
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>255. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for 
its answers to the communication. However, he remains concerned by the fact that the 
Government&#8217;s response mainly concerns the actions taken in the case in which the 
Prime Minister is accused of rape. However, the Government does not answer the questions 
related to the harassment suffered by Ms. Sylvester and Ms. Bacchus-Browne, attorneys of the 
alleged victim of the rape case. The Government only states that &#8220;Police investigations have 
revealed no evidence to suggest that either Ms. Sylvester or Ms. Bacchus-Browne, have been 
intimidated&#8221; without explaining why or what are the bases of this conclusion. In addition, the 
Government states that &#8220;the Commissioner of Police stated that no vehicles have been assigned 
to follow&#8221;; however, the Special Rapporteur considers this not constitutes a sufficient prove that 
Ms. Sylvester and Ms. Bacchus-Browne were not harassed by the police or other individuals. 
The Special Rapporteur requests the Government to provide him with information on the 
measures taken by authorities to protect these two attorneys.

the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding the case of Sufun Muhammed Ali Ahmed 
al-Zafifi, a Yemeni national who is reportedly at risk of imminent execution. He was arrested on 
25 April 2006 and allegedly confessed to the abduction and rape of a boy. He was convicted and 
sentenced to death on 11 July 2006 and his sentence was upheld on appeal. The experts received 
reports alleging that his confession was extracted under duress, that the trial took place behind 
closed doors and that he was not afforded defense counsel. According to the information 
received, the only remaining option for Mr. al-Zahifi was to seek a pardon from His Majesty, the 
King. If these allegations are correct there would be grounds for serious concern. The experts 
asked the Government to provide them with information indicating whether or not the defendant 
in this case was given the right to formal representation by a lawyer, and providing details of any </p>

</p>
<p>such access. In addition, they expressed their wish to establish whether the proceedings were 
open to observers including representatives of the Government of Yemen. Finally, they asked for 
information as to the nature of any right to an effective appeal which was exercised in this case. 
</p>
<p>257. On 8 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on Human Rights and counter terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders regarding Mr. Sulieman al-Rushudi, lawyer, Mr. Essam al-Basrawi, lawyer, 
Dr. Saud al-Hashimi, medical doctor, Mr. Al-Sharif Saif al-Ghalib, Dr. Musa al-Qirni, university 
professor, Dr. Abdel Rahman al-Shumayri, university professor, Mr. &#8216;Abdelaziz al-Khariji, and 
at least three other persons, whose identities are yet to be confirmed. All these individuals have 
been active as human rights defenders. In particular, they engaged in the past in signing petitions 
addressed to His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud calling upon him to initiate 
political and democratic reforms and to respect human rights. According to the information 
received, the above-mentioned persons were arrested in the cities of Jeddah and Madinah on 
3 February 2007 where they had met to discuss the organisation of peaceful activities in favour 
of political and democratic reforms in Saudi Arabia. The 10 men by the moment when the 
communication was sent, were being held incommunicado at the offices of the General 
Intelligence Service (al-Mabahith al-&#8217;Amma) in Jeddah. Requests for access by their 
families and to appoint lawyers have been denied by the General Intelligence Service. On 
5 February 2007 Mr. Al-Basrawi&#8217;s son asked for a visit and attempted to hand over medicine for 
his ill and disabled father. He was ordered to return home and warned never to ask again to meet 
with Mr. Al-Basrawi. The Ministry of the Interior has issued a statement alleging that the 
detainees were arrested on suspicion of fund raising to support terrorism. Mr. Al-Rushudi and 
Mr. Al-Ghalib had been detained before and released after several weeks following the signing 
of a petition in March 2004 calling for political change in Saudi Arabia. Concern was expressed 
that the detention of Mr. Al-Rushudi, Mr. Al-Basrawi, Dr. Al-Hashimi, Mr. Al-Ghalib, 
Dr. Al-Qirni, Dr. Al-Shumayri, Mr. Al-Khariji, and the three other persons mentioned above 
may be related to their legitimate and peaceful activities in defence of human rights. In view of 
their incommunicado detention concern was expressed that these individuals may be at risk of 
ill-treatment. Further concerns were expressed as regards Mr. Al-Basrawi&#8217;s status of health since 
he has reportedly been denied to receive medication from his son. Concern was also expressed 
that the charge of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is used in order to prevent them from pursuing human rights and 
political activities.

born in Kuwait, where he lived with his parents close to Al Dahr. According to the information 
received, he was arrested at Doha in Qatar on 20 June 2002 at 7.00 by several persons in plain 
clothes and taken to the airport to be sent to Riyad in Saudi Arabia. Since then he has been 
allegedly held in solitary confinement at the prison of Al Hayr, where he has frequently been 
subjected to ill-treatment. He has reportedly not had access to a lawyer and no charges have been 
brought against him. He has not been brought before a judge. On 1 March 2007 he went on a

commenced. </p>

<p>259. On 5 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions regarding the execution 
on 19 February 2007 of four Sri Lankan citizens, Messrs. Ranjith de Silva, Victor Corea, 
Sanath Pushpakumara and Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
had previously raised their concerns about this case in a communication to your Government of 
13 April 2005, which unfortunately has remained without reply. In the previous communication 
it was explained that, according to the information received, three Sri Lankan migrant workers - 
Mr. Victor Corea, Mr. Ranjith de Silva and Mr. Sanath Pushpakumara - had been involved in a 
series of armed robberies and had been arrested by the Riyadh police on 10 March 2004. In 
October 2004 they were sentenced to death on charges of possession of illegal firearms and 
attempted robbery by the Saudi Arabian High Court. Their sentences were reportedly upheld in 
March 2005 and an appeal for mercy was at the time pending before His Excellency, the King of 
Saudi Arabia. On the basis of the information received, the experts expressed their concern that 
&#8220;the three men were sentenced to death after trials that appear[ed] to have fallen short of 
international fair trial standards. It is reported that they did not have any legal representation 
during their trials, although a translator was provided. The translation of proceedings is no 
substitute for adequate legal representation as required by international standards. In addition, it 
is alleged that after their trial, the three men were asked to sign a document in Arabic, stating 
their acceptance of the death sentence which only Mr. Silva reportedly refused to sign&#8221;. More 
detailed reports we have recently received have added the name of a fourth defendant in the same 
case, Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara, state that the execution took place on 19 February 2007, and 
confirmed the concerns raised two years ago with regard to the lack of due process. It is reported 
that around nine months after their arrest in March 2004, an official in al-Ha&#8217;ir prison where the 
four men were held informed them that they had a court hearing. The hearing lasted around 
three hours. The judge interrogated the four men, who were allowed only to speak in reply to his 
questions. The judge also asked whether they had suffered beatings during interrogation, to 
which they replied that they had. Minutes were taken and proceedings were interpreted, but no 
prosecutor was present and the defendants did not have legal or consular assistance. At no time 
were the defendants told that they might face the death penalty, nor were they ever informed that 
they had a right to a lawyer or a right not to incriminate themselves. Several months after the 
first hearing, prison officials brought the four defendants to court a second time, again without 
prior notice. At this second hearing, two judges conferred for 20 minutes, then sentenced all four 
to death. In response to a query from the court, all four defendants refused to accept the verdict, 
and the court sent the case for review to the Court of Cassation. The four men were unaware how 
to conduct an appeal and were not invited to make any submissions to the Court of Cassation or 
informed whether there would be any hearing. Three months later, the men were advised by a 
judge in a third trial session that the cassation court had upheld the verdict. No copy of the 
judgement was given to the four defendants. The four defendants managed to contact the Sri 
Lankan embassy from prison after the trial. The Sri Lankan diplomats informed them that it was 
too late to appoint a lawyer and that instead they would issue an appeal for clemency. On 
19 February 2007, however, a royal order affirmed the death sentence. Ranjith de Silva, 
Victor Corea, Sanath Pushpakumara and Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara were executed on the same 
day. The mandate holders affirmed that International law further requires that the death penalty 
be imposed only for the most serious crimes. They stated that they certainly do not underestimate 
the seriousness of the crime of armed robbery. However, according to the information received, 
only one of the four defendants, Mr. Corea, has in fact caused bodily harm in the course of a </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 150 
 
</p>
<p>robbery. The two persons shot by Mr. Corea have reportedly recovered from their wounds, and 
one of the victims, an Indian man named Muhi al-Din, reportedly told the judge in a civil suit 
that he did not seek any damages and asked for clemency for the four Sri Lankan men after 
learning that they had been sentenced to death. If this information was confirmed, doubts could 
be raised as to whether the offences committed by the four defendants actually attained the 
seriousness required by international law for the imposition of the death penalty. The mandate 
holders asked the Government to answer if the proceedings were open to observers, including 
particularly representatives of the Government of Sri Lanka; if the proceedings in this case were 
in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and finally reiterated the request 
made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers in a communication of 24 January 2007 
for clarification of which offences carry the death penalty in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
which courts can impose it, and what percentage of those sentenced to death and executed are 
foreigners. 
</p>
<p>260. On 20 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants, regarding the case of Mr. Suliamon Olyfemi, a citizen of Nigeria, 
who is reportedly at imminent risk of execution. The case of Suliamon Olyfemi was previously 
brought to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government (together with the cases of 12 other 
Nigerian migrant workers) by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in 
a communication dated 30 November 2004. Regrettably, this communication has remained 
without reply. According to the communication of 30 November 2004, Suliamon Olyfemi and 
12 other Nigerian migrant workers resident in Jeddah, &#8220;[&#8230;] were among hundreds detained in 
Jeddah on 29 September 2002 after a policeman was killed in a fight between local men and 
African nationals. All the other men arrested on that occasion have been deported, including 21 
who served prison sentences ranging from six months to two years and flogging. Subsequent to 
their arrest, the 13 Nigerian nationals were tortured and ill-treated, including being hung upside 
down and beaten and subjected to electric shocks to the genitals. Since their arrest over two years 
ago, the men have not had access to a lawyer or consular assistance. Moreover, translators were 
present on only two of the four previous court appearances, and all proceedings and court 
documents are in Arabic. On 22 November 2004, a hearing in the case of the 13 men took place 
before three judges in a closed session, without the assistance of a lawyer, a consular 
representative or adequate translation facilities. They could not fully understand the proceedings, 
which were conducted in Arabic, and were not able to fully understand whether the hearing 
concerned the prolongation of their detention or constituted their trial.&#8221; According to information 
received since then, Suliamon Olyfemi was sentenced to death at a closed trial in May 2005. The 
twelve other Nigerian men were sentenced to prison terms and corporal punishment. During the 
trial, Suliamon Olyfemi and his co-defendants neither had access to legal representation nor to 
consular assistance, nor did they benefit from adequate translation. During interrogation they had 
been told to put their fingerprints, which can act as a signature, on statements written in Arabic, 
which they do not read. It is possible that these statements were used as evidence against them 
during the trial proceedings. Staff from the Nigerian consulate in Jeddah attempted to visit the 
men in prison, on 19 May 2005, but was not allowed to see them. The death sentence imposed on 
Suliamon Olyfemi has recently been upheld by the Court of Cassation and ratified by the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 151 
 
</p>
<p>Supreme Judicial Council. The mandate holders urged the Government to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee that the rights under international law of Suliamon Olyfemi are respected. 
Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the 
execution until the complaints regarding his right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law have been thoroughly investigated and all 
doubts in this respect dispelled. They also reiterated the request made by the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers in communications to the Government of 24 January 2007 
and 5 April 2007 for clarification of which offences carry the death penalty in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, which courts can impose it, and what percentage of those sentenced to death and 
executed are foreigners. 
</p>
<p>261. On 23 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding Mr. Saad Ben Zair, 
aged 28, resident in Riyad, defense lawyer, human rights defender, active in the Reform 
Movement and his father, Dr. Said Ben Zair. According to the allegations received, Mr. Saad 
Ben Zair&#8217;s car was stopped on 10 April 2007 when he was driving along King Abdullah Avenue 
in Riyad with his wife and his one year old daughter. The three of them were taken to the Secret 
Services premises and detained separately. Some days later Mr. Saad Ben Zair&#8217;s wife and 
daughter were released, but he is still being held in secret detention. When his father, Dr. Said 
Ben Zair, another prominent human rights defender, publicly protested against his son&#8217;s 
detention, he was arrested himself on 6 June 2007 and at the moment when the communication 
was sent, remained in secret detention as well. Before his arrest in April, Mr. Saad Ben Zair had 
worked as lawyer defending proponents of constitutional reform and other critics of the 
Government. In connection with his work as lawyer, he had regularly demanded that Royal 
decree n. M 39, which guarantees basic rights to detainees, including that a specific term of 
detention should be determined by a competent authority, and prohibits torture. He had already 
spent three years in secret detention without any judgement starting from 17 July 2002 
presumably for having protested against the imprisonment of his father, who had been 
imprisoned for 8 years without any legal process. He had been secretly detained again for several 
months starting from 19 June 2006. With a view to Mr. Saad Ben Zair and Dr. Said Ben Zair&#8217;s 
secret detention, concern was expressed for their physical and mental integrity. Further concern 
was expressed that their detention is related solely to their work in protecting and promoting 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>262. On 22 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief and Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences regarding 
a 19-year-old Shiite woman from Al-Qatif. According to the allegations received, in 2006, the 
Shiite woman and a male companion were kidnapped at knifepoint by a gang of seven Sunni 
men. The male companion was attacked by the gang, and later released. The woman, however, 
was repeatedly raped by the gang. Four members of the gang were at the time sentenced by the 
Qatif General Court to prison terms ranging from one to five years, with floggings of up to 
1,000 lashes. Three other gang members reportedly turned themselves in before the conclusion 
of the trial. The victim of the gang rape and her male companion were convicted in 2006 of 
being alone in private with a member of the opposite sex who was not an immediate family 
member, under an offence known as Khilwa in sharia law. Following the request of the review of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 152 
 
</p>
<p>the verdict by the woman and her lawyer, on 15 November 2007, a court in eastern Saudi Arabia 
increased the original sentence against the seven members of the gang, and also increased the 
sentence against the 19-year old woman from 90 lashes to 200 lashes and a six month prison 
term. In addition, it is reported that the court revoked the professional license of her lawyer and 
banned him from defending her. The mandate holders requested the Government to provide 
substantive detailed information on the grounds and the legal basis on which the lawyer of the 
victim had his professional license revoked and was banned from defending her. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>263. On 16 July 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 5 April 2007, stating 
that the charges brought against the said persons, namely burglary and armed robbery, the 
possession of unlicensed firearms and the fixing shots at a number of persons, were substantiated 
by cogent and conclusive evidence of their commission of the crime, including their legally 
certified confessions, the medical reports, the factual report on the crime, identification of the 
weapons used in its commission, the report on the examination of the accused, and reports on a 
visit to, and inspection of, the scene of the crime. Articles 155 and 182 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure stipulate that court hearings should be held in public and judgements should be read 
out in detail at a public hearing. Article 140 of the Code further stipulates that a person accused 
of a major offence should appear in person before the court, without prejudice to his right to 
defence counsel. Accordingly, judicial proceedings are open to observers. Judicial proceedings 
in the Kingdom are governed by a number of regulations (laws), the most important of which are 
the Basic Law, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Statutes of the 
Public Investigation and Prosecution Department and the Code of Practice for Lawyers. In this 
case, as in others, the judicial procedures were strictly observed with meticulous care in ail their 
formal and legal aspects and were conducted in accordance with the above mentioned 
regulations. Death sentences are handed down by the general courts in cases entailing the fixed 
penalties prescribed in the Islamic Shari&#8217;a and in cases of lex talionis and crimes involving 
repeated offences of drug smuggling and trafficking. 
</p>
<p>264. On 22 January 2008, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent on 23 August 2003. 
According to the response, Mr. Saad Ben Zair was detained under the provisions of article 35 of 
the Code of criminal Procedure, in accordance with an arrest warrant issued by the competent 
authority, for involvement in the crime of conspiring to blow up a refinery. The investigating 
authority deemed it advisable to extend his detention by up to one year. This decision was 
adopted according to the law, which establishes this possibility for crimes involving terrorism 
and State security (article 114 Code of Criminal Procedure and Royal Order N. 7560/MB of 5/6 
and 1426 A). The said person is being well treated, according to Code of Criminal Procedure, 
which prohibits subjection to torture. 
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>265. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Saudi Arabia for its cooperation and 
values its efforts to provide in a timely manner substantive information in response to the 
concerned expressed on communications sent on 5 April 2007 and on 23 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>266. However, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the absence of an official 
reply regarding the communications sent on 24 January, 8 February, 16 March, 20 April </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>and 22 November 2007, especially considering the seriousness of the above allegations in 
regards to Mr. Sufun Muhammed Ali Ahmed al-Zafifi who is reportedly at risk of 
imminent execution, Mr. Sulieman al-Rushudi, Mr. Essam al-Basrawi, Dr. Saud al-Hashimi, 
Mr. Al-Sharif Saif al-Ghalib, Dr. Musa al-Qirni, Dr. Abdel Rahman al-Shumayri, Mr. &#8216;Abdelaziz 
al-Khariji, and at least three other persons which are being held incommunicado, and 
Mr. Suliamon Olyfemi reportedly at risk of imminent execution. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government of Saudi Arabia to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably 
before the end of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to 
the above allegations. 
</p>
<p>267. Regarding the response sent on 22 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur further asks the 
Government to provide information on the legislation regarding the guarantees to the detainees 
accused of crimes involving terrorism and State security (article 114 Code of Criminal Procedure 
and Royal Order N. 7560/MB of 5/6 and 1426 A). Moreover, The Special Rapporteur would like 
to reiterate the request made by him and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions a in communications to the Government of 24 January 2007 and 5 April 
2007 for clarification of which offences carry the death penalty in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
which courts can impose it, and what percentage of those sentenced to death and executed are 
foreigners.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>268. On 5 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Mr. Dushyantha Basnayake, human rights defender and financial director of Standard 
Newspapers Private Limited (SNPL), which publishes the Sinhalese-language weekly Mawbima, 
in Colombo and Ms. Parameswaree Munusamy, journalist with Mawbima. According to 
information received: on 26 February 2007, Mr. Basnayake was arrested at his office in 
Colombo by officials from the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID). He is reportedly being 
detained incommunicado at the Terrorist Investigation Unit in Colombo where he has been 
denied access to a lawyer. Mr. Basnayake was questioned by officials from the Criminal 
Investigations Division (CID) several months prior to his arrest. He was later released 
without charge and the authorities allegedly apologised for any inconvenience caused. On 
13 March 2007 Mr. Basnayake&#8217;s bank accounts were frozen. Previously on 24 November 2006, 
Ms. Munusamy was detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) at the Terrorist 
Investigation Unit in Colombo. She was reportedly held without charge by the police Terrorist 
Investigation Division (TID). On 21 March 2007, an order was issued by the Supreme Court to 
release Ms. Munusamy on the basis that her arrest was illegal and that there was insufficient 
evidence in order to convict her. She was released on 22 March 2007. Ms. Munusamy is the 
only Tamil speaking journalist working for Mawbima and her arrest was related to the 
publication of articles by Mawbima in Tamil, which highlighted human rights abuses in 
Sri Lanka. On 24 February 2006, President Rajapaksa reportedly criticised the management and 
journalists of Mawbima newspaper for their coverage of human rights violations in Sri Lanka 
during a press conference. Newspaper staff has been receiving death threats since February. 
Concern is expressed that arrest and detention of Mr. Dushyantha Basnayake along with the </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 154 
 
</p>
<p>arrest, detention and subsequent release of Ms. Parameswaree Munusamy forms part of an 
ongoing campaign to silence human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, and in particular those who 
aim to highlight human rights violations in the country. 
</p>
<p>269. On 14 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, 
regarding the case of Mr. N. Jasikaren, a former journalist with the Tamil language bi-monthly 
&#8220;Sariniher&#8221; and journalist with the web news service &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221; and owner of the 
Outreach Multimedia and E-Kwality Graphics, a printing press; Ms. Valarmathi Jasikaren, his 
wife; Mr. J.S. Tissanaygam, journalist with the &#8220;Sunday Times&#8221; and the &#8220;Daily Mirror&#8221; and 
chief editor of the &#8220;Northeastern - Herald&#8221; an English-language regional newspaper and 
&#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; Mr. K. Wijayasinghe, a freelance journalist, who writes for the weekly 
newspaper &#8220;Ravaya&#8221;, the daily &#8220;Mawbima&#8221; and &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; Mr. Udayen, a video 
editor for &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; and Mr. A.G. Lasantha Ranga, a video journalist for 
&#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;. According to information received, Mr. N. Jasikaren was arrested by the 
Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) (a special police division that reports directly to 
the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence) at his office on the evening of 6 March 2008; 
during his arrest, his laptop and printed materials were seized by the TID. Mr. Jasikaren was 
being held at the TID offices in Colombo, by the moment when the urgent appeal was sent. 
Mr. Jasikaren&#8217;s wife, Valarmathi Jasikaren, a marketing officer with Maharaja Broadcasting, was 
arrested on 6 March at their home on the same day. Mr. Jasikaren was assaulted by TID officers. 
J.S. Tissanaygam and K. Wijayasinghe were arrested by TID officers on 7 March at 11.30 a.m. 
when they went to TID offices to inquire about the arrests of Mr. Jasikaren and his wife. 
Mr. Tissanaygam was detained incommunicado until late in the evening of 7 March, when his 
family was informed of his whereabouts. Both men were being detained at the TID offices in 
Colombo. Mr. Tissanaygam and Mr. Wijayasinghe&#8217;s wives were allowed to visit them. Udayen 
was arrested at his home on 7 March. He was detained incommunicado until midnight and by 
the moment when the urgent appeal was sent, he was being held at the TID offices in Colombo. 
A.G. Lasantha Ranga was requested to report to the TID offices before 3 p.m. on 8 March. When 
the urgent appeal was sent he was detained at the TID offices in Colombo. Mr. Ranga&#8217;s wife 
visited him on 10 March. Mr. Ranga was threatened by TID officers in front of her, stating that 
if Mr. Ranga had seen how Jasikaren and Tissanayagam were tortured &#8220;he would die on the 
spot&#8221;. TID officers told her that she should not visit her husband with a lawyer. A seventh 
person, Mr. Siva Sivakumar, journalist and spokesperson for the Free Media Movement and 
chief editor of the Tamil-language newspapers &#8220;Sarinher&#8221; and &#8220;Adhavan&#8221;, was also arrested on 
8 March 2008. He was, however, released after a detention period of 12 hours during which a 
statement was taken from him. TID officers had gone to his home on the evening of 7 March to 
arrest him, but took his cousin into custody instead as he was absent. TID officers informed 
Mr. Sivakumar&#8217;s relatives that his cousin would be released when he presents himself to TID 
offices, which he did in the morning of 8 March. The experts informed the Government that 
detention orders of the above mentioned persons have reportedly been prepared pursuant to 
Regulation 21 of the Emergency (Prevention and Prohibition of Terrorism and Specified 
Terrorist Activities) Regulations No. 7 of 2006. However, to date none of the accused has seen 
the detention order. It is also not clear if it was the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence or a 
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the police who issued detention orders in this case. If </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 155 
 
</p>
<p>detention orders have been issued, the detainees must be brought before a magistrate at least 
once every 30 days, but this is only to verify that the person is still being detained. Magistrates 
have no power to question, cancel or renew a detention order. Only the person issuing the 
detention order - the Secretary of Defence or the DIG - can renew, amend or cancel it. With 
regard to the cases of Mr. Jasikaren and his wife, TID officials have issued receipts 
acknowledging their arrests and citing as a reason aiding and abetting terrorist activities. The 
experts also stated that no information has yet been given concerning the reason for the detention 
of the remaining persons and their arrests and detention have not yet been acknowledged by the 
TID. However, a few weeks before the arrests, authorities proclaimed that some websites 
reporting on human rights violations were a hindrance to the ongoing war. Finally, the experts 
stated that all meetings with relatives were held in the presence of TID officers and that none of 
the above cited persons were allowed access to legal counsel.

<p>271. On 21 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences regarding the sentencing to death by stoning of Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum 
(23 years old) and Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul (22 years old from the Tama ethnic group), by the 
Criminal Court of Al-Azazi, in Managil province, Gazeera state. According to the information 
received: on 13 February 2007 and 6 March 2007 respectively, the Criminal Court of Al-Azazi, 
with Judge Hatim Abdurrahman Mohamed Hasan presiding, convicted Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul 
and Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum on charges of adultery and sentenced them to death by 
stoning. The two women are currently in detention in Wad Madani women&#8217;s prison in 
Wad Madani, Gazira State. Ms. Sadia Idriss Fadul has one of her children with her in prison. The 
two women were reportedly convicted under article 146 (a) of Sudan&#8217;s 1991 Penal Code, which 
states that &#8220;whoever commits the offence of sexual intercourse in the absence of a lawful 
relationship shall be punished with: a) execution by stoning when the offender is married 
(muhsan); (b) one hundred lashes when the offender is not married (non-muhsan)&#8221;. Sadia Idriss 
Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum do not fully understand Arabic, the language used during 
the entire judicial proceedings, and were not provided with an interpreter. The two women also 
had no legal representation. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, 
the mandate holders reminded the Government that it must be regarded as an extreme exception 
to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. </p>

<p>272. On 22 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders regarding the detention of eight persons in connection 
with protests against the construction of the Kajbar dam. These eight persons are: Mr. Saad 
Mohamed Ahmed, journalist with Ilaf weekly newspaper and activist on dam issue; two lawyers, 
namely Mr. Imad Al Deen Murgani and Mr. Alam Al Deen Abdulghani; Mr. Abdulaziz 
Mohamed Ali Khairi, engineer and head of foreign relations committee of the Kajbar Dam 
Popular Committee (a committee formed by the affected community which has not so far been 
recognized by the authorities); Mr. Raafat Hassan Abbas, information officer in the Khartoum 
support committee of the Kajbar Dam Popular Committee, Dr. Mohamed Jalal Ahmed Hashim, a 
leader of the Mahas community; Mr. Abdallah Abdelgayoum, a member of the Mahas 
community and former National Security officer; and Mr. Osman Osman, driver. According to 
the information received on 13 June 2007 four persons were reportedly killed and nine other 
civilians were injured when police used violence to disperse a protest by members of the Nubian 
population opposed to the building of the Kijbar Dam. Mr. Imad Al Deen Murgani, Mr. Alam 
Al Deen Abdulghani, Mr. Abdulaziz Mohamed Ali Khairi, Mr. Abdallah Abdelgayoum and 
Mr. Osman Osman were arrested on the same day in Dongola on their way to investigate and 
report on the demonstrations and the violence. After being questioned about the purpose of their 
trip, the five men were arrested. When the communication was sent, they were detained in the 
National Security Section in Kober prison. Mr. Raafat Hassan Abbas was arrested by National 
Security officers at a private house in El-Dim, southern Khartoum, at 2 a.m. on 15 June 2007. 
When the communication was sent he was believed to be in the custody of Khartoum State 
Security in Riyad, but a member of his family has been denied permission to visit him. 
Dr. Mohamed Jalal Ahmed Hashim was arrested at his home in Riyad after participation in a 
press conference organized by the SPLM on 16 June 2007. When the communication was sent 
his whereabouts were unknown. On 20 June, Mr. Saad Mohamed Ahmed was arrested at his 
office in Khartoum. When the communication was sent he was detained in the National Security 
Section in Kober prison. None of the detainees has been allowed to contact their families or a 
lawyer. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned persons may 
be related to their peaceful activities in defence of the human rights of the people protesting 
against the construction of the Kijbar dam. In view of the incommunicado detention of 
Mr. Saad Mohamed Ahmed, Mr. Imad Al Deen Murgani, Mr. Alam Al Deen Abdulghani, 
Mr. Abdulaziz Mohamed Ali Khairi, Mr. Raafat Hassan Abbas, Dr. Mohamed Jalal Ahmed 
Hashim, Mr. Abdallah Abdelgayoum, and Mr. Osman Osman, the mandate holders expressed 
their concern that they might be at imminent risk of torture or other treatment susceptible to 
cause extremely grave damage to their physical and mental health.

<p>273. On 18 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture on Mr. Marhui Gbryrham, Mr. Fitouy Fshai Yingbr 
Mikaeel, Mr. Dislby Tsfa Brhan Hagoss and Mr. Ablom Tfisty Gbry Slasy, all of whom are 
Eritrean nationals, and Mr. Haroun Idriss, Mr. Abdala Suliman, Mr. Badreldin Ali, 
Mr. Mohamed Amin Nardi, Mr. Ibrahim Atbana, and Mr. Argana Slfim, all of whom are 
Ethiopian nationals. According to the information received Mr. Marhui Gbryrham, Mr. Fitouy 
Fshai Yingbr Mikaeel, Mr. Dislby Tsfa Brhan Hagoss and Mr. Ablom Tfisty Gbry Slasy are </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>currently detained by the security forces at Port Sudan State Prison in Eastern Sudan after 
apparently evading compulsory military service in Eritrea. They were arrested around 
2 November 2007 at the Sudanese border and are held without charge pursuant to the National 
Security Forces Act of 1999. Lawyers have been denied access to them. Mr. Haroun Idriss, 
Mr. Abdala Suliman, Mr. Badreldin Ali, Mr. Mohamed Amin Nardi, Mr. Ibrahim Atbana and 
Mr. Argana Slfim have been detained at Dabak Prison in Khartoum since 21 December 2007 
under the National Security Forces Act. They were arrested at their homes in July 2007 together 
with three other individuals, namely Mr. Adam Pasilio, Mr. Minika Hailo, and Mr. Faisal 
Mohamed Osman. Mr. Adam Pasilio, Mr. Minika Hailo and Mr. Faisal Mohamed Osman were 
deported to Ethiopia on 27 September 2007 following a ruling by the Khartoum North Criminal 
Court after they had confessed to residing illegally in Sudan. When the communication was 
sent they were been detained by Ethiopian authorities at an unknown location. Mr. Haroun Idriss, 
Mr. Abdala Suliman, Mr. Badreldin Ali, Mr. Mohamed Amin Nardi, Mr. Ibrahim Atbana and 
Mr. Argana Slfim have been able to meet with at least one family member; however, they have 
been refused access to legal representation. Some of them have enjoyed refugee status in Sudan 
since 2004 and were granted permission to remain in the country, which was renewed 
periodically. All of the Ethiopians arrested are Muslims belonging to the Oromo ethnic 
group. Mr. Haroun Idriss suffers from irritable bowel syndrome, Mr. Abdala Suliman from 
diabetes mellitus, Mr. Badreldin Ali from rheumatism, and Mr. Mohamed Amin Nardi from 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and a skin allergy. The fact that the ten individuals have been 
detained under the National Security Forces Act and the deportation of Mr. Adam Pasilio, 
Mr. Minika Hailo and Mr. Faisal Mohamed Osman to Ethiopia indicate a high risk that 
removal to their respective countries of origin is imminent. Concerns were expressed that the 
four above mentioned Eritreans as well as the six Ethiopians might be at risk of prolonged 
detention and ill-treatment in their respective home countries should they be returned. In 
view of their reported previous political activities further concern was expressed that the 
Ethiopian nationals might face the death penalty. Concerns were also expressed as regards 
Mr. Haroun Idriss&#8217;, Mr. Abdala Suliman&#8217;s, Mr. Badreldin Ali&#8217;s and Mr. Mohamed Amin Nardi&#8217;s 
state of health.

<p>274. On 13 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding 
Mr. Afandy Farah Mohamed Issa, Ethiopian national, who has lived in Sudan since 2006 and is a 
member of a registered political party in Ethiopia called &#8220;Benishangul People&#8217;s Liberation 
Movement&#8221;. According to the information received, Mr. Afandy Farah Mohamed Issa was 
arrested on 22 September 2007 by members of the Sudanese Security Services in el-Showak in 
the eastern part of the country and detained in the prison of Dabak, in the north of Khartoum. 
Before entering the Sudan Mr. Issa spent two months in Asosa prison in Ethiopia for reasons of 
his political activities in the country. Since Mr. Issa was transferred to the custody of the 
immigration police in Khartoum on 4 February 2008 there were strong indications that his 
deportation to Ethiopia was imminent. Up to the date of the urgent appeal he has not been 
granted access to legal representation.

page 158 
 
</p>
<p>Ms. Sadia Idries Fadul. Following the completion of inquiries, the report was referred to 
a court of first instance of Jazirah State, which delivered its verdict on 13 March 2007, in case 
No. 10/2007, convicting the accused under article 146 (1) (a) of the 1991 Criminal Code (the 
penalty for adultery) and based on her confession. The accused is married and engaged in 
intercourse with others during the husband&#8217;s absence. Ms. Amouna Abdallah Daldoum was tried 
before a court of first instance of Jazirah State, in case No. 24/2007. She was convicted by the 
court on 6 March 2007 under article 146 (1) (a) of the 1991 Criminal Code (the penalty for 
adultery) and based on her confession. The accused is married and engaged in intercourse with 
others during the husband&#8217;s absence. The two women appealed the verdicts and the Jazirah State 
Appeal Court issued a ruling overturning the convictions and sentences and returning the case 
files for a retrial of the two women for a number of reasons, including the fact that they had not 
had legal assistance during the proceedings. The two women know Arabic very well and so the 
court did not have to appoint an interpreter, in accordance with article 137 of the 1991 Code of 
Criminal Procedures. The case files are before the Jazirah State court of first instance with a 
view to the retrial of the two women on instructions from Al-Jazirah Appeal Court. The 
Government stated that it shall provide any information on this subject in due course. 
</p><p>276. On 17 September 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 22 June 2007 
explaining that for several months, some inhabitants who had declared themselves as the 
representatives of the inhabitant of the Kajbar dam area, started rallying the inhabitants against 
the establishment of the Kajbar Dam the biggest developmental project in the long neglected 
area. When the Dam authorities started to conduct an initial survey, a big demonstration blocked 
such step. A group of people attacked the workers and the equipments and destroyed them. 
When the small group of police who escorts the equipments intervened, it was equally attacked. 
The police used force and as a result two individuals died. To prevent further escalation of the 
tensioned situation, the police arrested the leaders of the mob. Accordingly the security 
authorities took preventive measures under the provisions of the National Security Act in order 
to stop the escalation of violence by arresting some persons who incited the mobs to use violence 
through rumors and unauthentic information. All the detainees wore released on 1918/2007 
except Dr. Mohamed Jalal Hashim who was released on 24/8/2007. All the detainees were 
treated humanly and according to the law.

<p>278. On 8 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali, 21 years of age, </p>

of age, employee of a beauty salon, Mr. &#8216;Alam Fakhour, around 26 years of age, Mr. &#8216;Omar 
&#8216;Ali al-&#8217;Abdullah, around 21 years of age, student, Mr. Diab Sirieyeh, around 26 years of age, 
part-time student, all currently detained at Sednaya Prison near Damascus. The cases of Mr. &#8216;Ali 
Nizar &#8216;Ali and of Mr. Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim were already the subject matter of an urgent appeal by 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 21 February 2006. The mandate holders 
asked the Government for further clarification in view of new information received. In a 
Government&#8217;s reply of on 30 August 2006 it was explained that both persons have taken part in 
activities hostile to the State and incited public unrest using the Internet, which are acts penalized 
by article 307 of the Syrian Criminal Code as &#8220;any act, writing or correspondence aimed at, or 
resulting in, the creation of confessional or racial strife or encouragement of conflict between the 
confessional groups and different ethnic communities of the nation&#8221;. According to the 
Government, these two persons have further established a cell of an organization that advocates 
acts of terrorism against society and the State and solicits support from abroad, which is 
punishable under articles 306 and 364 of the Syrian Criminal Code. They have accordingly been 
arraigned before the Higher State Security Court on 4 April 2006. In addition to the expert&#8217;s 
request for additional information on the case of Mr. &#8217;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and Mr. Husam &#8216;Ali 
Mulhim they drew the Government&#8217;s attention to information received on the other persons 
concerned. According to (new) allegations received, the above mentioned individuals were 
arrested between 26 January and 18 March 2006 and have been detained incommunicado ever 
since, three months of which in solitary confinement. While in detention they were ill-treated 
during interrogation at the Air Force Intelligence Branch in the town of Harast near Damascus. 
The trial of the eight persons commenced on 26 November 2006 before the Higher State Security 
Court in Damascus. Each defendant denied the charges brought against him in court, since their 
confessions had been obtained by resorting to ill-treatment. The eight individuals named above 
had been denied access to counsel until the hearing in court, where they were able to meet briefly 
with their lawyers, in the presence of guards. At least one of the persons was allowed to meet 
with his parents inside the courtroom for three minutes with a guard present. The families of the 
defendants were not permitted to provide them with warm clothing on the occasion of the court 
hearing in order to protect them from the chilly conditions in prison. The trial has been adjourned 
until 14 January 2007. According to the Government&#8217;s reply Mr. &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and Mr. Husam 
&#8216;Ali Mulhim have been charged under articles 306, 307 and 364 of the Syrian Criminal Code. 
Reportedly however, all except Mr. &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali are charged under article 278 of the Syrian 
Criminal Code, which makes it a criminal offence to take action or make a written statement or 
speech which could endanger the State or harm its relationship with a foreign country, or expose 
it to the risk of hostile action by that country. Furthermore, all eight are reportedly charged under 
article 287 of the Syrian Criminal Code, which penalizes the &#8220;broadcasting of false news 
considered to be harmful to the State&#8221;. During the hearing the judge has accused the defendants 
of having established links with an opposition party based outside Syria. Concern was expressed 
as regards the physical integrity of the above-mentioned persons, particularly in view of their 
continued incommunicado detention and alleged ill-treatment in prison. Further concern was 
expressed with respect to their general status of health and well-being since they have reportedly 
not been provided with proper clothing against the cold or were allegedly not permitted to 
receive such clothing from their families. </p>

<p>279. On 16 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders concerning the conviction of 
Mr. Anwar al-Bunni, a lawyer and human rights activist, currently held at Adra prison near 
Damascus. According to new information received, on 24 April 2007, Mr. Anwar al-Bunni was 
sentenced to 5 years in prison by the First Damascus Criminal Court for &#8220;spreading false or 
exaggerated information that weaken the spirit of the nation&#8221;, and ordered to pay a fine of 
US$ 2,000 to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour for his membership in an unlicensed 
human rights centre. Earlier on, Mr. al-Bunni was charged with &#8220;spreading false news&#8221; for a 
statement he had made about the inhumane conditions that led to the death of a man in a 
Syrian prison. Furthermore, on 25 January 2007, prison guards made Mr. al-Bunni crawl on the 
ground and forcibly shaved his head as punishment during a crackdown on a ward where 
criminal detainees had mounted a protest after being excluded from a recent amnesty. Also, on 
31 December 2006, Mr. al-Bunni was pushed down some stairs and then beaten up by another 
detainee in the presence of prison guards who failed to intervene. Concern was expressed that the 
arrest and conviction of Mr. al-Bunni may be in reprisal for his legitimate and peaceful work as a 
lawyer and human rights activist. Concern was also expressed about the repeated ill-treatment of 
Mr. al-Bunni in detention. 
</p>
<p>280. On 25 February 2008, sent a joint urgent appeal together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on the question 
of torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, regarding Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi, aged 48, and Ms. Kawthar Taifour, aged 50, both 
members of the Kurdish minority in the Syrian Arab Republic. According to the information 
received, Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour were arrested by members of State 
Security Services on 28 November 2007. Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi was arrested at 4 a.m. at her home 
in &#8216;Ein al-&#8217;Arab (Qoubani); the place and exact time of the arrest of Ms. Kawthar Taifour is not 
known. Both women are believed to be currently held in incommunicado detention at the 
women&#8217;s wing of al-Maslamieh Prison in Aleppo without charge or trial. Both do not have 
access to legal counsel or contact with their families. When the communication was sent, they 
were held together with convicted criminals and pretrial detainees. By the moment when the 
communication was sent, the authorities have not disclosed any reason for their arrest and 
detention. It is believed that these measures might be linked to non-violent demonstrations 
by members of the Kurdish minority on 2 November 2007 in the cities of Qamishli and 
&#8216;Ein al-&#8216;Arab (Qoubani). Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour are members of an 
organisation calling itself &#8220;Democratic Union Party (PYD)&#8221;. Ms. Aisha Afandi&#8217;s husband, 
Mr. Saleh Muslim, is a leading member of the &#8220;PYD&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>281. On 27 April 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 8 January 2007, 
stating that Mr. Ali Nizar Ali was released pursuant to a presidential amnesty issued on the 
occasion of Id al-Adha. He had been convicted under article 287 of the Syrian Criminal Code for 
broadcasting false information regarded as damaging to the State. As for the remaining persons </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 161 
 
</p>
<p>mentioned above, they were referred to the competent court after a public prosecution case was 
brought against them, under article 287 of the Syrian Criminal Code, for committing criminal 
offences involving acts that are prohibited by the Government, since such acts could expose the 
Syrian Arab Republic to the threat of hostilities and damage its relations with foreign States. 
These individuals are currently on trial.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>282. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for its 
response of 27 April 2007. The Special Rapporteur is, however, concerned by the ongoing 
judicial process regarding the rest of the defendants. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to provide him with information regarding these judicial proceedings, in particular 
defendants&#8217; access to a lawyer, as well as how the measures taken in those proceedings are 
compatible with international norms and standards as contained, inter alia, in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>283. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is also concerned at the absence of reply to its 
communication of 16 May 2007 and 25 February 2008, especially considering the seriousness of 
the above allegations in regards to Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour who are believed 
to be currently held in incommunicado detention. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the 
Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.

<p>284. On 23 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
trial of Mr. Mah Dechanuphap, Mr. Nen Mahavilai, Mr. Apichit Angsutharangkul and 
Mr. Rangsan Torsuwan. According to the information received, on 16 July 1993, the four men 
were charged with planning to kill the then-Supreme Court president, Pramarn Charnsue. 
The Police Crime Suppression Division (CSD) in Bangkok learned of this plan in May 1993. 
On 25 May 1993, Mr. Spomphon Mah Dechanuphap and Mr. Nen Mahavilai were arrested. 
On 28 May, the police arrested Apichit Angsutharangkul. Rangsan Torsuwan surrendered to the 
police on 9 June 1993 after having been charged on the previous day. Since 1993, the four men 
have been prosecuted in the Bangkok South Criminal Court under Penal Code sections 288, 289, 
83 and 84 (Case No. 990/2536). Allegedly, between 1993 and the end of 2006, the case had been 
heard for 461 times, by a total of 91 different judges. Mah Dechanuphap and Nen Mahavilai 
were released on bail after having been detained for seven years. Concern was expressed at the 
extremely long duration of this trial, which has been lasting for 14 years, and at the very long 
period of detention of Mah Dechanuphap and Nen Mahavilai, who have been on pretrial 
detention for 7 years.

ancien membre du Conseil de l&#8217;Ordre des avocats et ancien Secr&#233;taire G&#233;n&#233;ral du Conseil

agression sur la personne du chef de poste de Bab Bnet, dont d&#233;pend le Palais de justice, aurait 
&#233;t&#233; ouverte contre Me Ayadi. Ceci se serait produit peu apr&#232;s une audition, le 12 juillet 2007, de

demand&#233; &#224; un agent de proc&#233;der &#224; l&#8217;ouverture de l&#8217;enveloppe, qui contenait un DVD. Alors que 
Me. Ayadi aurait demand&#233; &#224; ce que cet acte soit consign&#233; dans un proc&#232;s-verbal afin d&#8217;engager

contre l&#8217;ill&#233;galit&#233; de ce refus, et serait parti en laissant l&#8217;enveloppe avec son contenu sur le

aurait &#233;t&#233; victime d&#8217;un incendie qui aurait ravag&#233; son cabinet et dont l&#8217;origine serait 
vraisemblablement criminelle. Lorsque Me. Ayachi Hammami serait arriv&#233; &#224; son bureau, il

en partant. En revanche, la porte de son bureau personnel serait rest&#233;e ferm&#233;e, sans doute dans le 
but de d&#233;truire un maximum de documents avant que les pompiers ne puissent entrer et &#233;teindre 
le feu. Le cache de l&#8217;ordinateur professionnel de Me. Ayachi Hammami aurait &#233;t&#233; &#244;t&#233; et des 
journaux auraient &#233;t&#233; introduits dans le lecteur. Cela semblerait indiquer la volont&#233; de s&#8217;assurer 
de la destruction de toutes les donn&#233;es qu&#8217;il contenait. Les sources all&#233;guaient que le fait que le 
cabinet de Me. Ayachi Hammami ait &#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; une surveillance polici&#232;re permanente 
semblerait indiquer que les personnes qui mirent le feu l&#8217;auraient fait gr&#226;ce &#224; l&#8217;aide de complices 
travaillant au sein des autorit&#233;s de surveillance. Elles exprimaient leur crainte que cet acte ne 
vise &#224; intimider Me. Ayachi Hammami et &#224; l&#8217;emp&#234;cher de poursuivre son travail d&#8217;avocat et de 
d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme.

journal ind&#233;pendant Aldostur, qui devait se tenir le 24 octobre. La police aurait pr&#233;text&#233; que, 
&#233;tant en libert&#233; conditionnelle, Me Abbou ne pourrait circuler librement. Le 24 ao&#251;t 2007, 
Me Abbou aurait une fois de plus &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233; de voyager vers Londres o&#249; il devait participer &#224;

avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et 
d&#8217;expression, une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant la condamnation &#224; un an de prison du 
journaliste Slim Boukhdir, &#226;g&#233; de 39 ans et correspondant du journal panarabe bas&#233; &#224; Londres 
Al Quds Al Arabi et du site internet de la cha&#238;ne de t&#233;l&#233;vision satellitaire Al-Arabiya. Ce 
journaliste publie aussi des articles sur plusieurs sites Internet dont Tunisnews et Kantara. 
Selon les informations re&#231;ues, M. Boukhdir devait se pr&#233;senter au service comp&#233;tent pour 
r&#233;cup&#233;rer son passeport, dont il aurait &#233;t&#233; priv&#233; depuis 2004 et pour la remise duquel il aurait 
men&#233; une gr&#232;ve de la faim pendant deux semaines jusqu&#8217;au 14 novembre 2007. Le 26 novembre, 
alors qu&#8217;il se rendait au poste de police, il aurait subi un contr&#244;le d&#8217;identit&#233; des passagers d&#8217;un 
taxi collectif reliant Sfax et il aurait &#233;t&#233; conduit au poste de police en &#233;tat d&#8217;arrestation. 
Le 27 novembre, M. Boukhdir aurait &#233;t&#233; traduit devant le tribunal de Sakiet Ezzit (Sfax) et 
le 4 d&#233;cembre 2007, le juge Hatem Ouarda, du tribunal cantonal de Sakiet Ezzit, l&#8217;aurait 
condamn&#233; &#224; huit mois de prison pour &#171; outrage &#224; fonctionnaire dans l&#8217;exercice de ses fonctions 
&#187;, quatre mois pour &#171; atteinte aux bonnes m&#339;urs &#187; et &#224; verser cinq dinars d&#8217;amende pour &#171; refus 
de pr&#233;senter ses papiers d&#8217;identit&#233; &#187;. Selon les sources, le journaliste aurait de m&#234;me fait &#233;tat de 
mauvais traitements et de mauvaises conditions de d&#233;tention mais le juge aurait refus&#233; 
d&#8217;enregistrer sa plainte et d&#8217;en tenir compte. Elles indiquaient un possible vice de forme pendant 
le proc&#232;s, all&#233;guant que le juge n&#8217;aurait pas voulu &#233;couter les arguments de la d&#233;fense et aurait 
auditionn&#233; les t&#233;moins &#224; charge sans leur faire pr&#234;ter serment. M. Boukhdir serait d&#233;tenu depuis 
son interpellation, le 26 novembre, puisque le juge en charge du dossier aurait refus&#233; de lui 
accorder la mise en libert&#233; provisoire. Selon sources, il serait maintenu en d&#233;tention jusqu&#8217;&#224; la 
date du proc&#232;s en appel.

</b></p>
<p>294. On 5 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, regarding Ms. Eren Keskin, a lawyer who works with the project &#8220;Legal Aid 
for Women Raped or Sexually Assaulted by State Security Forces&#8221; in Turkey. This project 
provides legal assistance to victims of sexual violence and is funded by the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. Ms. Keskin was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by 
the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 22 April 2005. According to the information received, on 14 March 2006 Ms. Eren Keskin 
was sentenced to ten months&#8217; imprisonment by the Kartal 3rd Court of First Instance. The 
sentence of ten years&#8217; imprisonment was converted into a fine of 6,000 Turkish lira. It is reported 
that Ms. Keskin has refused to pay the fine. The sentencing results from charges brought against </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 166 
 
</p>
<p>Ms. Keskin of insulting the armed forces. These charges were brought against Ms. Keskin after 
she gave a speech at a meeting in Cologne, Germany in 2002 about cases of sexual violence 
against women inmates by the Turkish State Security Forces. It is reported that Ms. Keskin has 
appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal. Concern was expressed that the above decision is 
connected with Ms. Eren Keskin &#8216;s activities in defence of human rights, in particular the rights 
of women who have been the victims of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>295. On 19 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, regarding Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a lawyer, human rights defender and newspaper 
columnist, by the time working on the case of three men killed at the Zirve Christian publishing 
house on 18 April 2007 and the killing of Mr. Hrant Dink, who was a Turkish journalist of 
Armenian origin and an activist for democratic reform. According to the information received, in 
November 2007, an article published in a local newspaper in the province of Malatya reportedly 
included details that could only have been learnt through the interception of Mr. Orhan Kemal 
Cengiz&#8217;s telephone calls and e-mails concerning the aforementioned case. He later learned that a 
letter had been sent to the Malatya prosecutor accusing him of involvement in the murders. The 
letter also contained other false and defamatory information, the intention of which was 
reportedly to make him a target. In January 2008, Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz received a letter 
which contained both veiled and direct threats to his safety, which may have the same origin as 
the letter to the Malatya prosecutor Reports inform that Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz has requested 
that authorities provide a bodyguard to protect him, but that this request has not yet been 
granted. He has reportedly been threatened and intimidated on a number of occasions, 
intensifying since November 2007, when the trial of those accused of killing the three men at the 
Zirve publishing house in Malatya began. The mandate-holders further referred to the case of the 
killing of Mr. Hrant Dink, who was shot dead on the street in front of his office in Istanbul on 
19 January 2007. Mr. Dink had also reported death threats to the police on numerous occasions, 
who had allegedly been aware of a plan to assassinate him for some months prior to his death. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>296. On 25 May 2007, the Government responded to the joint urgent appeal of 5 April 2006 
stating that with regard to the decision taken by the 3rd Court of First Instance of Kartal against 
Eren Keskin a fine was imposed in the amount of 6,000 Turkish Lira for insulting the armed 
forces. According to the decision of the Court, it was established that Eren Keskin, during her 
public speech in Germany, stated that &#8220;Members of the Turkish armed forces sexually assault 
and harass women. Soldiers conduct virginity tests on married women in order to torture them.&#8221; 
The Court considered as to whether her statements could fall within the limits of criticism, which 
has been safeguarded in the fourth paragraph of article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. On the 
basis of the elements contained in her statement regarding the armed forces, the Court concluded 
that the motivation in the case was to publicly denigrate the institution of the armed forces as a 
whole and that her allegations were groundless. In this regard, the Court decided that her speech 
cannot be considered within the framework of the right to freedom of expression and 
dissemination of thought, which was safeguarded in the Turkish Constitution and the 
international treaties to which Turkey is a party. Therefore, the Court convicted Eren Keskin of 
the indicted charge and imposed a fine in the amount of 6,000 Turkish Lira. </p>

</p>
<p>297. On 27 February 2008, the Government responded to the joint urgent appeal 
of 19 February 2008 that, with regard to the complaint lodged by Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz 
regarding the interception of his emails and telephone calls, it was referred to the relevant 
authorities for investigation. Moreover, the request for security measures to be taken was 
also transferred to the relevant authorities. Furthermore, the Government informs that the Office 
of the Public Prosecutor of Malatya received an anonymous letter accusing Mr. Orhan Kemal 
Cengiz for involvement in the murder. 
</p>
<p>298. On 25 March 2008, the Government informed that Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz was provided 
with close protection. A law enforcement official was instructed to ensure his personal security. 
Moreover, the Government informed that the trail on the murder of Mr. Hrant Dink is ongoing 
before the 14th Penal Court of Istanbul. 18 persons have been charged and 8 have been arrested 
pending trial. During the first hearing held on 25 February 2008 the defense was heard. The next 
hearing is scheduled for 28 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>299. On 23 April 2008, the Government informed that an investigation has been initiated by the 
Chief Public Prosecutor of Ankara following the complaint filed by Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz, 
regarding the anonymous threats related to his work on the murder case of the 3 employees of 
Zirve Publishing House in Malatya. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations

<p>301. On 2 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the intrusion 
of armed police personnel and disregard for judicial independence and order at the High Court 
on 1 March 2007 in Kampala, which led to a decision by the judiciary to suspend all court 
activities nationwide since 2 March 2007. According to the information received, following the 
adjournment of the final decision by the High Court in respect of the bail application made by 
twelve alleged members of the People&#8217;s Redemption Army (PRA), who had been held since 
November 2005 on charges of treason and conspiracy, and the decision of the High Court to 
grant them bail in the meanwhile, armed men in police uniform surrounded the Registry, 
where they intimidated and assaulted civilians and vandalised court property, before they 
prevented those released on bail from leaving the Court and proceeded to re-arrest them. All 
twelve co-accused men in the trial were returned to Luzira Prison despite being granted bail; 
some were forcibly removed from the High Court building. Furthermore, three of the accused 
were held incommunicado for nearly a day after being taken into police custody and were only 
returned to Luzira prison late on 2 March 2007. It is further reported that some of the defendants, 
a journalist and one counsel, who subsequently required medical treatment, were mistreated 
during the incident. Previously, on 16 November 2005, a group of armed security operatives </p>

the ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above 
allegations.

<p>303. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, concerning Mr. Mohamed al-Mansoori, a lawyer, a human rights activist and 
President of the Independent Jurist&#8217;s Association, and Mr. Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken, a 
lawyer, a human rights activist and former President of the UAE&#8217;s Jurists Association. 
According to the allegations received, on 17 June 2006, an arrest warrant was issued against 
Mr. Mohamed al-Mansoori, based on an accusation of &#8220;insulting the Prosecutor&#8221;. It is alleged 
that the real motive of this order was to silence Mr. Mohamed al-Mansoori, after he gave several 
interviews to Arab satellite television in which he criticized the human rights situation in the 
country. Moreover, on 23 August 2006, Mr. Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken has reportedly been 
arrested by members of the State Security, Amn al-Dawla. When the communication was sent 
the reasons of his detention remained unknown. Previously, Mr. Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken 
had been arrested and held for one night on July 2006, after he gave an interview regarding the 
recent conflict in Lebanon, to an Arabic television channel. It is also alleged that both 
Mr. Mohamed al-Mansoori and Mr. Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken have been banned for a 
number of years from giving interviews or writing articles to the media. In addition, in 
September 2005, the authorities of the Emirate of Fujairah allegedly banned a conference on 
civil rights, women&#8217;s rights and democracy, organized by the Jurists&#8217; Association, without giving 
any reasons. Serious concerns have been expressed that Mr. al-Mansoori and Mr. al-Roken may 
be detained on account of their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, and that their 
detention may form part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation against defenders of 
human rights in the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>304. On 21 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 169 
 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on torture regarding Mr. Abdullah Sultan Sabihat Al Alili, aged 46, 
agricultural engineer and civil servant with the Ministry of Agriculture of Adjman Emirate, 
resident at Adjman. According to the information received, Mr. Abdullah Sultan Sabihat Al Alili 
was arrested without warrant by the State Security Forces (Amn Al dawla) on 15 February 2007 
at his residence. His home was searched and his personal documentation and library confiscated. 
Since then neither his family nor his lawyer have received any information about his 
whereabouts or the reason for his arrest. Mr. Al Alili had been in detention between 
8 August 2005 and 25 October 2005. No arrest warrant had been issued; when the 
communication was sent he was held in secret detention and has not been brought before a court. 
During that time he was interrogated about his political opinions and his criticism related to the 
state of democracy in the country. He was allegedly repeatedly beaten by the State Security 
Forces. In view of his incommunicado detention, concern was expressed for his physical and 
mental integrity. 
</p>
<p>305. On 1 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat, 
aged 46, agricultural engineer by profession and head of the agricultural administration 
department in the Emirate of &#8216;Ajman. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat was already the subject 
matter of a joint urgent appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 
19 August 2005. According to new information received, Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat was 
arrested on 8 February 2007 by State Security officers at the premises of the agricultural 
administration department in the Emirate of &#8216;Ajman. The officers took him to his home and 
confiscated a number of books. After the search he was handcuffed and blindfolded and 
transferred to an unknown place of detention in Abu Dhabi. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat 
was held incommunicado for months before he was charged with &#8220;obtaining secret information 
on State security&#8221;. He appeared before the Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates 
in Abu Dhabi for the first time on 25 June 2007. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat was granted 
access to a lawyer, however, the court sessions were closed and no family members were 
allowed to attend the hearings. His application for bail was denied. During the final court session 
on 10 September 2007 he alleged that he had been ill-treated in detention by members of the 
State Security forces. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat reported that he had been beaten with a 
hosepipe all over his body, deprived of sleep, forced to carry a chair above his head every day 
for two weeks, and threatened with sexual assault. The Federal Supreme Court did not 
investigate these allegations. Witnesses appearing for the prosecution during his trial were the 
very members of the State Security forces who had ill-treated him in detention and were the only 
evidence presented by the State. On 1 October 2007 Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat was 
sentenced to a three years&#8217; term of imprisonment. There is reportedly no right to appeal. 
Mr. &#8217;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat is currently being detained at al-Wathba Prison, located 60 km 
outside of Abu Dhabi, where he is allowed to receive family visits once a week. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah 
Sultan al-Subaihat was previously arrested on 2 August 2005 for unknown reasons, held 
incommunicado and eventually released without charge on 25 October 2005. In view of reports 
about his previous incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location and further considering 
the allegations of ill-treatment, concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of 
Mr. &#8216;Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat. </p>

<p>308. On 15 December 2005, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, concerning the 
new Constitution of Gibraltar that the Governments of Gibraltar and of the United Kingdom 
agreed to in London on 17th March 2006 and which has been approved by referendum on 
30 November 2006, with 60% of votes. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur enumerated a 
number of concerns regarding the way in which the new Constitution would fail to guarantee the 
independence of the judiciary in Gibraltar. According to the information received, the principle 
of the independence of the judiciary is not enshrined in the Constitution: such lack is 
incompatible with a democratic system founded on the separation of powers, and with the 
international obligations subscribed by your Government on the need to guarantee the 
independence of the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur urged the Government to make sure this 
fundamental principle is included in this new Constitution. Also, various provisions of the new 
Constitution weaken the independence of the judiciary. Concerning the appointment of judges, 
he noted with satisfaction that the Constitution provides for the creation of a Judicial Service 
Commission. However, he expressed his concern regarding the role of the executive in the 
judicial appointment process. In particular, an imbalance appears between judicial and executive 
appointees in article 57 (1) which provides that the Judicial Service Commission of Gibraltar 
shall consist of the President of the Court of Appeal, who shall be the chair, the Chief Justice, the 
Stipendiary Magistrate, two members appointed by the Governor, acting in accordance with the 
advice of the Chief Minister, and two members appointed by the Governor, acting in his 
direction. He noted with deep concern the fact that executive appointees have the majority, the 
lack of criteria for selection of the non-judicial appointments by the Governor, and the lack of 
provision on the length of service of the members of the Commission. In addition, Section 58 
provides that votes of the Judicial Service Commission can be taken in the absence of some of its 
members. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 171 
 
</p>
<p>309. Furthermore, Section 57 (2) (b) fails to give proper protection to junior members of the 
judiciary in terms of tenure of office. According to this provision, the Governor, acting in 
accordance with the advice of the Judicial Service Commission, may terminate the appointments 
of the Stipendiary Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and Registrar of the Supreme Court. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur underlined that security of tenure is fundamental to the 
independence of the judiciary and that this applies to all levels of the judiciary, including the 
Stipendiary Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and the Registrar. Moreover, the termination of any 
appointment and control over disciplinary matters should lie solely with the judiciary. He also 
expressed his concern by the lack of transparent, objectively justified, criteria, by which the 
power of removal may be exercised. 
</p>
<p>310. He also expressed his deep concern by Section 64 (7) which allows the appointment of a 
Chief Justice or Puisne Judge for a specified term only. &#8220;A person may be appointed to the office 
of Chief Justice or of Puisne Judge for such term as may be specified in the instrument of his 
appointment, and the office of a person so appointed shall become vacant on the day on which 
the specified term expires.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern that this article may 
undermine the security of tenure of these persons, which is guaranteed by Section 64 (1) of the 
Constitution that provides for security of tenure to the Chief Justice and Supreme Court Judges 
until the age of 67. The Special rapporteur was informed that this provision has been justified by 
the need to replace a judge who would for any reason be unable to perform the functions of their 
office, and he believed that such specific cases are already covered by article 63. Therefore, 
article 64 (7), which is formulated in general terms, appears to threaten the security of tenure of 
these judges. 
</p><p>311. Moreover, Section 57 (2) (c) gives to the Governor, albeit with the advice of the Judicial 
Service Commission, the power to exercise disciplinary control over the Stipendiary Magistrate, 
Justices of the Peace and the Registrar. Finally, Section 57 (3) permits the Governor, acting with 
the prior approval of the Secretary of State, to disregard the advice of the Judicial Service 
Commission on appointments, terminations and discipline to the Executive, if compliance with 
that advice would prejudice Her Majesty&#8217;s service. The Special Rapporteur expressed his deep 
concern over the ability that the Governor would possess under this article to control the 
appointments, terminations and disciplinary actions of judges and therefore exercise an undue 
influence on them. In addition, the Constitution does not limit the exercise of this control to very 
specific or exceptional circumstances. 
</p>
<p>312. Finally, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concern by the fact that the observations 
submitted by the Gibraltar Judiciary on the draft Constitution may not have been duly taken into 
consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>313. On 15 February 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter 
of 15 December 2006, informing the following: I disagree with the assertion that the new 
Constitution fails to guarantee the independence of the judiciary in Gibraltar. You will wish to be 
aware that it has always been envisaged that the judicial provisions of the Constitution would be 
supplemented by a Judicial Services Act. This Act will be enacted by the Gibraltar Parliament 
and provide detailed guidance on aspects of the Judicial Services Commission, and disciplinary 
matters. I therefore fear that the information that has been made available to you does not take </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 172 
 
</p>
<p>into account the additional provisions and safeguards that will be included in this Act. I note that 
you are satisfied with the creation of a Judicial Services Commission (JSC) but are concerned 
about the note of the executive in the judicial appointment process, and believe that the 
executive has a numerical advantage on the Judicial Services Commission. This is a 
misconception that ignores the careful construction of the Commission, which is in essence 
composed of three &#8220;constituencies&#8221;: (1) the 3 judicial members; (2) the 2 members nominated by 
the elected Chief Minister, who has a valid democratic interest in the good administration of 
justice; and (3) the 2 members independently selected by the Governor, who are not part of the 
local executive, and can thereby reflect the interest of the United Kingdom Government in the 
good administration of justice. None of these &#8220;constituencies&#8221;, however, has a majority and we 
consider it is unjustified to suppose that the appointed members would always form a blocking 
majority over the judicial-members. We therefore consider the Commission as a well-balanced 
representation of the relevant interests. Nor is there any established principle that preserving 
judicial independence requires the judiciary to be in a majority, or the executive in a minority, in 
any such Commission. You also raise concerns over the perceived lack of provision on the 
length of service of members of the Commission and on the voting procedures. These are 
matters that will be covered in the Judicial Services Art. We disagree with your assertion that 
section 57 (2) of the Constitution fails to give proper protection to junior members of the 
judiciary in terms of tenure. On the contrary, the tenure of office of junior members of the 
judiciary is protected by the constitutional requirement that appointments can only be terminated 
by the Governor acting on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. The Gibraltar 
Government is committed to including in the Judicial Services Act a provision that junior 
members of the judiciary car only be removed from office on the grounds that they are unable to 
discharge the functions of his office (whether arising from infirmity of body, or any other cause) 
or for misbehaviour. We, therefore regard these arrangements as a significant advance on the 
previous Constitution where the power to remove junior members rested with the Governor&#8217;s 
discretion. You mentioned your deep concern over Section 64 (7), which you claim threatens the 
security of tenure of Puisne judges. Section 64 (7) was deliberately included to allow flexibility 
of appointments in small jurisdictions such as Gibraltar, where such mechanisms are rot 
uncommon. It should be noted that a judge appointed for a specified term under section 64 (7), 
will enjoy throughout the term of his appointment, the security of tenure afforded by section 64 
(2) to (4), which limits the grounds of possible dismissal and prescribes the (arduous) procedures 
to be followed for dismissal. You also express concern regarding Section 57 (2) (c), which give 
the Governor power, on the advice of the JSC to exercise disciplinary control over junior 
members of the judiciary and Section 57 (3) where the Governor can, with the Secretary of 
State&#8217;s permission, disregard the advice of the JSC. We can see no difficulty whereby the JSC, a 
constitutionally independent body, on which members of the judiciary shall serve as the single 
largest constituency, should advise the Governor on disciplinary matters. When considering its 
disciplinary advice, the JSC shall give full regard to the judicial conduct and ethics code, which 
the Gibraltar Government has indicated the Judicial Services Act will call to be introduced. 
Section 57 (3) is required to reflect the continuing constitutional relationship between the 
United Kingdom and Gibraltar. The United Kingdom Government would only envisage this 
power (of veto) being used in extremely rare and - exceptional circumstances. This section is not 
intended to, and does not, give the Governor an enabling power. It is deliberately drafted as a 
veto power only, and this is clearly stated in the explanatory notes accompanying the 
Constitution. In the extremely rare event of this power being used, the JSC would be required to 
supply the Governor with further advice. Finally I have to dispute your concerns that the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>observations of the Gibraltar judiciary were not taken into consideration. The United Kingdom 
Government and Gibraltar delegation took very full and detailed account of the Judiciary&#8217;s 
submissions of March 2005 and February 2006. Indeed, many of the provisions suggested by the 
Judiciary were adopted in the Constitution. I should also point out that both the United Kingdom 
and Gibraltar Governments have gone to great lengths to explain our respective positions in 
correspondence with the Chief Justice and the Gibraltar Bar Council. Legal Advisers from &#8216;the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who helped draft the Constitution, met with the Chief 
Justice and a panel of legal experts appointed by him on 20 November 2006 to explain the 
United Kingdom Government&#8217;s view. I am pleased to note that after this meeting the panel 
members left suitably reassured over the intentions. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>314. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Kingdom for its timely 
cooperation and values its efforts in providing substantive and detailed information in response 
to the above allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>United States of America

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>315. On 25 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter of allegation together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
regarding the situation of six non-US citizens currently detained at the military detention facility 
at Guantanamo Bay, Mr. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, Mr. Mohammad al-Qahtani, Mr. Ramzi bin 
al-Shibh, Mr. Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali (a.k.a. Ammar al-Baluchi), Mr. Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, 
and Mr. Walid bin Attash (a.k.a. Khallad). The mandate holders were informed that, pursuant to 
the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), all six will shortly be brought before military 
commissions on charges of conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, 
attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in 
violation of the law of war, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism. The mandate 
holders affirmed that it is long overdue for Guantanamo Bay detainees allegedly responsible for 
or involved in the 9/11 attacks in the United States to be finally charged and prosecuted. 
However, they considered that the commissions established under the MCA lack the legal 
competence and procedural guarantees to conduct fair trials in accordance with international 
legal standards. This case highlights a number of concerns that have already been raised in the 
USA mission report of the Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) regarding the jurisdiction and composition of the military commissions, the 
use of evidence, the imposition of the death penalty for certain offences and shortcomings in 
securing a fair trial. According to the mandate holders, firstly, there is a jurisdictional issue 
related to the MCA and the intention to try these six detainees before military commissions 
rather than courts. Among the charges that are awaiting the approval of the convening authority 
for the military commissions are the charges of terrorism, conspiracy and providing material 
support for terrorism that go beyond offences under the laws of war. This combined with the 
notion of &#8220;unlawful enemy combatant&#8221; may result in some of these detainees who are actually 
civilians being tried by military commissions. Another concern regarding the offences of 
terrorism, conspiracy, and providing material support for terrorism is that, to the extent they were </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 174 
 
</p>
<p>not covered by the law applicable at the time of the commission of the actual acts and thus fall 
under the jurisdiction of US federal courts, the military commissions will be applying criminal 
law retroactively, in breach of article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR) and universally acknowledged general principles of law. Secondly, the mandate 
holders were concerned that, owing to their composition, the military commissions may lack 
independence and impartiality or the appearance thereof. The convening authority selects 
individual commission members for each trial and thus the appearance of an impartial selection 
is undermined. There is also the possibility of chains of command existing between members of 
the same commission which is a matter of concern. The ability of the convening authority to 
determine what charges will be referred to the military commissions and to have the authority to 
intervene during the negotiation of potential plea agreements is a serious concern as it gives a 
role to the executive to interfere before and during the proceedings. On the issue of the use of the 
evidence, the mandate holders were concerned about allegations that some, or even all, of the six 
detainees have been subjected to highly abusive interrogation techniques that may have 
amounted to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, equally prohibited under the 
non-derogable guarantees provided by article 7 of the ICCPR and under article 15 of the 
Convention against Torture. The domestic law definition of torture for the purpose of the 
proceedings before the military commission is restricted, not catching all forms of coercion 
that amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment equally prohibited under the 
non-derogable terms of the above named articles. In addition, on 5 February 2008 Central 
Intelligence Agency Director-General Michael Hayden advised Congress that Mr. Khalid Sheikh 
Mohammad had been subjected to &#8220;waterboarding&#8221;. There is reportedly other evidence 
contained in interrogation logs that may confirm that some, or perhaps all, of the six detainees 
were subjected to abusive interrogation techniques, including stress positions and sleep 
deprivation. An even more worrying point is that the wording of the MCA allows testimony 
obtained through abusive interrogation techniques that were used prior to the Detainee Act 
of 2005 if such evidence is found to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and its use &#8220;in the interests of justice&#8221;. This is 
contrary to the clear and well established principle of international law that excludes the use of 
evidence obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for the purpose of trying 
and punishing a person. The mandate holders also expressed their concern about the use of 
evidence based on classified information and by the admission of hearsay evidence in 
proceedings before military commissions, in the form of a written summary of the evidence, if 
the military judges consider it to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and &#8220;probative&#8221;. The admissibility of such 
evidence presents serious problems with regard to the right to fair trial since the accused is not 
secured the possibility of cross-examination of witnesses, as foreseen under article 14, 
paragraph 3 (e) of the ICCPR. If hearsay evidence was obtained through torture or coercion in 
respect of other persons and the interrogation techniques applied were themselves classified, the 
defendant would not know whether the evidence was obtained by such methods and therefore 
should be subject to a legal challenge. Finally they expressed their strong concern regarding the 
intention of the Government to request the death penalty regarding the six detainees on grounds 
of conspiracy and murder. They considered that the proceedings governed by the MCA seriously 
undermine the right to a fair trial provided under article 14 of the ICCPR. Furthermore, the right 
to appeal is limited to matters of law. Thus, in the context of fair trial concerns this means that 
the imposition of the death penalty, in the event of a conviction or convictions by the military 
commission in this case, is likely to be in violation of article 6 of the ICCPR. </p>

<p>317. On 15 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Komiljon Usmanov. According to 
the allegations received, Mr. Komiljon Usmanov disappeared at the beginning of May 2006. 
With the assistance of human rights organizations, his relatives found out that he was detained 
incommunicado by the Tashkent city department of Internal Affairs (GUVD) for thirty days. 
During this time, he was detained without his relatives being notified, and was under 
investigation without access to a legal counsel. On 6 November, Mr. Kamiljon Usmanov was 
sentenced to ten years in prison on charges including attempting to overthrow the constitutional 
system after a trial which was conducted with numerous violations of the Criminal Procedural 
Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and international human rights instruments. In particular, the 
public prosecutor (assistant to the Prosecutor of Shaikhontahaurski district of Tashkent) 
Abdulazys Kalandarov did not attend the first phases of the trial. Also, the chairman judge in 
charge of the case, Mr. Abduvokhid Sharipov, allegedly performs the dual function of public 
prosecutor. During the trial the accusations were not confirmed with any fact or evidence in 
accordance with the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the court did not allow 
defence witnesses to appear, nor did it allow human rights defenders, journalists and many of the 
accused relatives to observe the proceedings. At the first court session, Mr. Komiljon Usmanov 
rejected the accusations, stating that his confessions had been obtained as a result of torture and 
ill-treatment. Four witnesses stated that they had witnessed Mr. Usmanov being subjected to 
torture in the GUVD facilities, including being hung from the ceiling from his feet and with his 
ears attached to electric wires. However, the judge refused to order any investigation into these 
allegations of torture. Kamiljon Usmanov and his lawyer, Rukhiddin Komilov, intend to appeal 
the case. 
</p>
<p>318. On 18 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, regarding Mr. Saidjahon Zainabitdinov, Chairman of the Andijan human rights 
group Apellatsia (&#8220;Appeal&#8221;), an organization working on religious and political persecution. 
Saidjahon Zainabitdinov was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 176 
 
</p>
<p>Freedom of Expression and Opinion, and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention on 26 May 2005. According to the information received, it is alleged that, 
Saidjahon Zainabitdinov was arrested on 21 May 2005 by the Uzbek authorities after he had 
recounted his version of the events in Andijan on 13 May 2005 to some western media sources. 
It has been reported that on 4 January 2006 the trial of Saidjahon Zainabitdinov began in 
Chirchik, a town near Tashkent where he was reportedly charged with defamation and 
anti-government activities. It is believed that on 12 January Mr. Zainabitdinov was found guilty 
and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment in what appears to have been a closed trial as information 
about the proceedings did not become available until after the fact. It is further alleged that the 
trial was held at a secret location and that no official information concerning the proceedings 
was made available to relatives of Saidjahon Zainabitdinov. Concern was expressed that 
Saidjahon Zainabitdinov&#8217;s trial may be linked to his activities in the defense of human rights, in 
particular his descriptions of the recent events in Andijan and of the general human rights 
situation in Uzbekistan which have appeared in the press. 
</p>
<p>319. On 2 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Sanjar Umarov. Mr. Umarov 
was already the subject matter of a joint urgent appeal to the Government by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture dated 3 November 2005. While it was appreciated the Government&#8217;s detailed 
response of 29 November 2005, in which the ongoing investigations by the General Procurator in 
connection with the criminal proceedings instituted against Mr. Umarov and his brother, the 
situation of Mr. Umarov&#8217;s defense and the state of his mental health are explained, the mandate 
holders requested further information on new allegations received. Mr. Umarov&#8217;s case is also 
pending before the Human Rights Committee with a request for interim measures of protection. 
According to new allegations received, Mr. Umarov was arrested on 22 October 2005 and 
convicted in March 2006 of a number of offences including fraud, embezzlement and 
membership in a criminal organization. On appeal Mr. Umarov&#8217;s sentence was reduced from 
ten and a half years to seven years and eight months. He has been detained incommunicado since 
July 2006 when he was last allowed a visit by his son. On this occasion Mr. Umarov specifically 
requested to meet with his attorney, Ms. Olga Zimareva. Numerous attempts undertaken by 
Ms. Zimareva and lawyers Mr. Berdiev and Mr. Lisunov to gain access to their client since then 
were denied by the head of prison, Mr. Abdullaev, stating that it is the prison inmate who has to 
file a request for a meeting with counsel. These attorneys of Mr. Umarov&#8217;s choice are not the 
two identified as his defence counsel in your Government&#8217;s reply dated 29 November 2005, 
whose names are Mr. V.L. Krasilovsky and Ms. Burnasheva. Several attempts by members of his 
family to see him in prison since July 2006 were met with official denials for the reason that 
Mr. Umarov has been placed in solitary confinement for 15 days. Each time this period expired 
his family was notified that Mr. Umarov has been subjected to solitary confinement again for 
15 days. Questions about his state of health were met with the standard reply as being 
&#8220;satisfactory&#8221;. Beginning 22 October 2006 Mr. Umarov was placed under solitary confinement 
for a period of three months for inappropriate behaviour in prison. Although this period expired 
on 23 January 2007 his family members were refused a visit on this day. Prison officials 
informed his family that he has been subjected to solitary confinement for another 15 days </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 177 
 
</p>
<p>beginning 18 January 2007. Various letters addressed to the office of the General Procurator by 
Mr. Umarov&#8217;s family, inter alia, questioning the actions of the prison head with respect to 
denials of family visits and access to counsel have so far remained without reply. In view of his 
alleged continued incommunicado detention in solitary confinement grave concerns were 
expressed as regards Mr. Sanjar Umarov&#8217;s physical and mental integrity. 
</p><p>320. On 9 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Erkin Musaev, Uzbek national and a 
UNDP local staff member in Uzbekistan (UNDP Country Manager, Border Management 
Programme Central Asia). According to the information received, Mr. Musaev was arrested by 
the Uzbek National Security Service on 31 January 2006, when he was on his way to attend a 
United Nations Conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in his capacity as a United Nations staff 
member. His family was not informed about his whereabouts for 20 days. He was not allowed to 
see a lawyer of his choice. During detention he was subjected to various forms of pressure, 
including threats by the interrogators who tried to force him to sign a confession. He was also 
subjected to beating by fellow inmates at the instigation of the interrogators. Furthermore he was 
beaten on his chest three nights in a row, which resulted in pain in the inner organs. He was put 
on a bed with the hands tied up and hit him on his heels, which meant that he was unable to walk 
for several days. He was also subjected to a method called &#8220;Northern Aurora&#8221;, which means 
hitting somebody hard on his head for a prolonged period. The beatings and other ill-treatment 
resulted in a broken jaw. First aid was provided by other inmates. On 13 June 2006, following a 
reportedly secret and flawed trial, Mr. Erkin Musaev was found guilty of high treason (article 
157 of the Uzbek Criminal Code), disclosure of state secrets (article 162), abuse of office (article 
301) and negligence (article 302) and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the Uzbek 
military court in Tashkent. The verdict reads that the information that he provided was utilised 
by unfriendly forces in order to organize the disturbances in Andijan in May 2005. It took the 
presiding judge four hours to read the 72-page verdict. No family and no independent observers 
were allowed to be present at the trial. On 14 June 2006, a second trial against Mr. Erkin Musaev 
commenced. This time he was accused of embezzlement of UN funds. The presumed purpose of 
the second trial was that, in accordance with Uzbek law, a second sentence would make it 
impossible to ever get amnesty for the first sentence. Mr. Erkin Musaev was sentenced to 6 years 
of imprisonment. A related UNDP-statement, dated 4 July 2006, read: &#8220;&#8230; UNDP conducted its 
internal investigation on the matter and found no basis for the accusations &#8230;&#8221;. In view of the 
fact that he has recently been transferred to a different prison and that he has no access to his 
family and lawyers of his choice, serious concern was expressed for Mr. Musaev&#8217;s physical and 
mental integrity. 
</p>
<p>321. On 23 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders regarding Ms. Umida Niyazova, a member of Veritas, an unregistered 
non-governmental organization which works for the protection of human rights in Uzbekistan. 
Ms. Niyazova also works as a journalist for the Central Asia website Oasis, a project of the 
Moscow-based media watchdog Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations and as a translator 
for Human Rights Watch in Tashkent. Ms. Niyazova was included in an allegation letter sent by 
the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 25 January 2007, and an urgent appeal sent on behalf of the Secretary General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 1 February 2007. According to new information received, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 178 
 
</p>
<p>on 22 January 2007, Ms. Niyazova was arrested in Uzbekistan whilst crossing the Uzbek-Kyrgyz 
border. She was reportedly detained in Andijan, before being transported to Tashkent four days 
later. Ms. Niyazova was denied access to her lawyer during this period. According to reports, 
Ms. Niyazova remains in detention at Tashkent prison where she is awaiting trial on charges of 
&#8220;illegal border crossing&#8221; and &#8220;smuggling subversive literature&#8221;. If charged, Ms. Niyazova could 
face up to ten years in prison. On Friday 13 April 2007, prosecutors issued a further charge 
for alleged &#8220;distribution of materials and threatening national security by using foreign 
financial aid&#8221;. This latest charge carries up 15 years in prison along with the confiscation 
of property. Ms. Niyazova has reportedly being subjected to daily interrogations whilst in 
detention which can last up to 15 hours and sleeps three to four hours per night. Family who 
have visited Ms. Niyazova claim that she lost considerable weight and that loud music is 
constantly played when she is in her cell. Concern was expressed that the arrest and continued 
detention of Ms. Umida Niyazova forms part of an ongoing campaign against human rights 
defenders in Uzbekistan and that the aforementioned events may be an attempt to prevent her 
from carrying out her legitimate work in the defence of human rights. Concern was also 
expressed at reports that she is being detained in poor conditions and that her health is 
deteriorating as a result. 
</p>
<p>322. On 9 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders regarding Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva, human rights defender and pathologist from 
Andijan. According to information received, on 25 April 2007, Ms. Turayeva was sentenced to 
six years in prison by the Andijan Regional Court on charges of alleged slander and the 
production and distribution of literature deemed threatening to public order. Ms. Turayeva was 
denied access to a defense lawyer of her choice throughout her detention and trial. According to 
reports, Ms. Turayeva was arrested on 14 January 2007 by Uzbek customs officers, whilst 
crossing the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border at the Dustlik post in Andijan, for carrying press material 
published by the opposition Erk party in her bag. Ms. Turayeva was subsequently detained at 
Andijan Region customs department before being transferred to the local office of the National 
Security Service detention centre on 16 January 2007. When the communication was sent, 
Ms. Turayeva was detained at the National Security Service Centre in Andijan. Concern was 
expressed that the afore-mentioned events are related to Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s work in defence of 
human rights and that her arrest and detention may form part of a pattern of harassment of 
human rights defenders in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>323. On 24 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Akhadov Gafur Gulamovich; Aliyev Dzhamshid 
Amriyevich; Usupov Azam Rakhimbayevich; Ekubov Rofe Nazhmiyevich; Ibodullayev Azam 
Hikmatullayevich; Dadamirzayev Ibrokhim Akhmadzhanovich; Batyrov Ilkhom Rakhmanovich; 
Gaphurov Sobir Uktamovich and several witnesses interrogated in connection with their criminal 
case, all resident in the Urgutsk region of Samarkand Oblast. According to the allegations 
received, on 29 April 2006, the Samarkand Oblast Department of Internal Affairs arrested the 
eight above mentioned persons, initiating criminal charges against them. In order to obtain 
confessions to support their case, several employees of the Oblast Department of Internal 
Affairs severely beat the eight arrested persons and several witnesses, including close relatives of 
the arrested, including women and children, some of them only 14 years old. They also 
subjected them to electric shocks. More specifically, policemen beat the heels of Gafur Akhadod </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 179 
 
</p>
<p>with a baton, sent electric shocks though parts of his body and drove needles under his nails. 
Mr. Akhadov fainted several times during the treatment. A forensic medical examination 
recorded that the injuries and bruises on his body and under his eyes, noticeable even after 
6 months after the interrogation, resulted from &#8220;falling off a mulberry tree&#8221;. Police also beat 
Mr. Aliyev with a baton on his heels and all over his body and subjected him to electroshock. 
The forensic medical examination indicates that the injuries and bruises on his body were &#8220;the 
results of falling from the roof&#8221;. When he refused to sign a confession, the police officer 
threatened to throw him out of the third story window of the Department on Internal Affairs and 
register his death as suicide &#8220;during an effort to escape&#8221;. A. Usupov was equally subjected to 
beatings, resulting from which his feet and his body were covered with bruises. The forensic 
medical examination indicated that &#8220;the bruises on the body of the defendant resulted from 
falling from a hill&#8221;. Mr. Usupov also shows clear signs of trauma resulting from the treatment. 
The eight persons were charged under articles 159 (Encroachment on the constitutional status 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan), 244-1 (Production and distribution of materials against public 
security and public order), 242 (Organizing a criminal association), 165 (Extortion), 
189 (Violation of trading and servicing rules), 190 (Practicing business without a license), 
209 (Official forgery) of the Criminal Code because of alleged association with Hizb-ut-Tahrir. 
The eight young men were not allowed to consult with the attorneys their parents had hired and 
were given access to state appointed attorneys only on 1 May 2006. Among the 40 witnesses 
interrogated in connection with the above case, 28 were subjected to beatings and ill-treatment 
during their interrogations. Some of the women were stripped naked or forced to sit in their 
underwear in the presence of a large number of men. Several witnesses were forced to sign 
statements that they will refrain from filing official complaints and threatened with more 
violence should they file any. 
</p>
<p>324. On 24 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Jaksigeldi Nurlanovich Tashenov, aged 16, 
resident in Djavgashti village, Tashkent region, school student, and currently detained at 
UYA-64/IZ-1 in Tashkent. According to the allegations received, Jaksigeldi Tashenov was 
arrested by the police on 2 April 2007 and taken into custody in accordance with the order of the 
Prosecutor of Yukori-Chirchik district on 6 April 2007. At about 19.30 on 2 April, two men in 
civilian clothes and seven policemen beat him on different parts of his body with clubs, fists and 
plastic bottles. One of the uniformed men beat him with a rubber club on his heels and pushed 
him to the floor. As a result of this treatment, which went on until 3:00 the next morning, 
Jaksigeldi Tashenov confessed to having committed the homicide he was accused of. On the 
morning of 3 April 2007 Jaksigeldi Tashenov was told by the police post&#8217;s chief, whose 
first name was Salim that he should plead guilty when he will be presented to the Prosecutor. 
However, Jaksigeldi Tashenov withdrew his confession. Subsequently the police chief reminded 
him that &#8220;last night&#8217;s work would continue&#8221; and urged him again to confess his guilt. When 
Jaksigeldi Tashenov was interrogated for the first time by investigator R. Agzamov on 3 April, 
no defence lawyer was present, although the presence of a lawyer P. Niyazova is registered in 
the record. When he was interrogated for the second time on 4 April 2007, a defence lawyer, 
S. Pirmatova, was present. However, she remained passive and did not react to the fact that, as a 
result of the beatings, Jaksigeldi Tashenov was unable to walk and had bruises on visible parts of 
his body. This fact has been confirmed by medical personnel who were called for an 
examination on 4 April. When they asked how Jaksigeldi Tashenov had sustained the bruises, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 180 
 
</p>
<p>the police replied that he had fallen. Moreover, on 4 April 2007 Jaksigeldi Tashenov&#8217;s 
grandmother Z. Mashrapova was appointed his legal representative, yet in apparent violation of 
article 121 of Criminal Code, she was never allowed to be present during her grandson&#8217;s 
interrogations. She did not sign the interrogation records, although she had repeatedly gone to 
the police department. Moreover, the investigator ignored the fact that Jaksigeldi Tashenov&#8217;s 
mother tongue is Kazakh and that he is unable to read Uzbek. Petitions were filed with the 
Prosecutor of Tashkent region and the General Prosecutor of the Republic. Also, a complaint 
was filed with the Office of Internal Affairs of Tashkent region. However, by the moment when 
the communication was sent there have been no reactions. 
</p>
<p>325. On 9 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. Muminov Otabek, aged 34.  
A letter on this case has been sent to the Government of Kyrgyzstan as well. According to the 
information received: Mr. Muminov Otabek, an alleged Hisb ut Tahrir member, had fled 
from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan in 2001 and later to Kyrgyzstan. He was detained in Osh on 
28 November 2006 and, on 1 June 2007, extradited to Uzbekistan. By the moment when the 
communication was sent he was being held in the detention facility of the National Security 
Services (SNB) in Tashkent. He has been denied access to an independent lawyer. With a view 
to his alleged Hisb ut Tahrir membership and the allegation that he has no access to an 
independent lawyer, fear was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Muminov. 
</p>
<p>326. On 22 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
Mr. Zafar Atajanovich Batyrov. According to the information received, on 20 August 2007, 
Mr. Zafar Atajanovich Batyrov, former director of the state company &#8220;Utrenchtransgaz&#8221;, was 
convicted for crimes pursuant to articles 167 (theft), 205 (abuse of authority or official powers), 
209 (forgery of documents while in official function), 210 (bribe taking), 242 (organisation 
of criminal community) and article 28 in conjunction with article 179 (complicity in 
false entrepreneurship) of the Criminal Code to 13 years imprisonment and a fine of  
7.098.620.185 Sums. It has been reported that the criminal case of Mr. Batyrov has not been 
examined by the court in substance. In the course of the trial practically all evidence and 
witnesses brought forward by the defense lawyer of Mr. Batyrov were rejected by the court. 
Article 81 of the Criminal Procedure Code describes the evidence to be examined in order to 
establish whether the suspect actually committed the crimes which he is accused of. 
Furthermore, according to article 26 of the Criminal Procedural Code, which enshrines the 
principle of direct and verbal examination of evidence, &#8220;the court shall constitute a sentence on 
those evidences only which have been examined in judicial procedure&#8221;. An appeal was 
launched against the sentence, which was granted by the Tashkent City Criminal Court on 
23 October 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>327. On 18 January 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 15 November 2006 (A/HRC/4/25/Add.1), concerning the criminal proceedings against 
Komilzhon Usmanov. On 14 November 2006, Tashkent city criminal court found 
Kamilzhon [sic] Usmanov guilty of offences under article 159, part 3, paragraphs (a) and (b), 
and other articles of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan and sentenced him to 10 years&#8217; deprivation 
of freedom. According to the court, on 3 February 2001, K. Usmanov had been sentenced by 
Tashkent district court to seven years&#8217; deprivation of freedom for participating in the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 181 
 
</p>
<p>commission of crimes against the State as a member of the religious extremist organization 
&#8220;Hizb ut-Tahrir&#8221;. In 2003, he was released under an amnesty, but, instead of drawing the 
appropriate conclusions, he rejoined &#8220;Hizb ut-Tahrir&#8221;, which was operating illegally in the 
country, in 2004 and actively participated in its activities. Specifically, while remaining true to 
his oath to keep secret any information connected with the activities of &#8220;Hizb ut-Tahrir&#8221;, to carry 
out the organization&#8217;s orders and to submit to it unquestioningly, he distributed slanderous 
fantasies about the democratic reforms being introduced in Uzbekistan, as well as material 
containing threats to public security and public order. He also advocated the establishment of a 
single worldwide theocratic State, the caliphate. The criminal proceedings against K. Usmanov 
were conducted in accordance with the requirements of the country&#8217;s Code of Criminal 
Procedure. The court examined the testimony of all those participating in the trial, correctly 
evaluated the evidence and reached the justified conclusion that K. Usmanov was guilty. After 
categorizing his criminal actions in accordance with the law, the court imposed the appropriate 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>328. On 26 January 2007 the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 18 January 2006 
(A/HRC/4/25/Add.1), stating that Mr. Saidjahon Zaynabitdinov, member of the Human Rights 
Group in Andijan, arrested on 21 May 2005 and held incommunicado for a period of time, is 
allegedly being detained in the basement of the Andijan police station. He is able to meet 
with his lawyer, Mr. Matliub Akhmedov, but he cannot receive any food from his family. 
On 14 October 2004, the procurator of Andijan instituted criminal proceedings against 
Mr. Zainabiddinov on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 139 
(Defamation), paragraph 3 (d), of the Criminal Code. On 9 December 2004, the criminal 
proceedings were terminated on the basis of article 84 (Grounds for terminating criminal 
proceedings without establishing guilt), paragraph 5 (1), of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
On 19 April 2005, the Andijan procurator&#8217;s office instituted new criminal proceedings against 
Mr. Zainabiddinov under article 139 (Defamation), paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code. In spite 
of the institution of new criminal proceedings, Mr. Zainabiddinov did not halt his illegal 
activities. On 13 May 2005, it was established that Mr. Zainabiddinov had disseminated 
slanderous information to representatives of foreign media concerning the events that were 
taking place in Andijan. Mr. Zainabiddinov&#8217;s reports were intended to create panic among the 
population and foster a negative attitude towards the authorities and constitutional system of 
Uzbekistan. Mr. Zainabiddinov&#8217;s aims were confirmed by tape recordings and also by 
forensic, psychological, philosophical and religious and philological expert examinations. On 
21 May 2005, during a customs inspection at the Dustlik crossing point on Uzbekistan&#8217;s border 
with Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Zainabiddinov was found to be in possession of materials, the printing and 
dissemination of, which are prohibited and which pose a threat to the public order and the 
country&#8217;s security. The materials were confiscated in the presence of witnesses. Following this 
incident, on 22 May 2005, the Andijan procurator&#8217;s office overturned its decision to terminate 
the first criminal case. Both criminal cases were combined into one and the internal affairs 
authority of Andijan province was instructed to conduct an investigation. On 23 May 2005, 
Mr. Zainabiddinov was arrested as a suspect in accordance with article 221 (Grounds for 
detention) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; on the same day, in the presence of the lawyer 
Matliub Akhmedov, he was questioned as a suspect by the authorities conducting the pretrial 
investigation. Subsequent questioning and other procedural actions were always conducted in the 
presence of the lawyer. On 24 May 2005, Mr. Zainabiddinov was indicted under article 139, 
paragraph 3 (a) and (d) (Defamation with aggravating circumstances), and article 244-1 </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 182 
 
</p>
<p>(Preparation or dissemination of materials constituting a threat to public safety and public 
order), paragraph 3 (c), of the Criminal Code, and the procurator approved the preventive 
measure of remand in custody for Mr. Zainabiddinov. By the verdict of the Tashkent city court 
of 5 January 2005 [sic], Mr. Zainabiddinov was sentenced to seven years&#8217; deprivation of liberty 
under article 139, paragraph (a) and (d) (Defamation with aggravating circumstances), 
article 159, paragraph 3 (b) and (c) (Attacks against the constitutional order of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan committed by an organized group or in its interests), article 244-1, paragraph 3 (a) 
and (c) (Preparation or dissemination of materials constituting a threat to public safety and public 
order, committed by prior conspiracy or by a group of persons, with the use of financial or other 
material assistance received from religious organizations as well as from foreign States and 
nationals) and article 244-2 (Establishing, leading or participating in religious extremist, 
separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations), paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. 
The pretrial investigation and judicial proceedings were conducted in accordance with national 
legislation and international norms. From the moment of his arrest, Mr. Zainabiddinov made no 
complaints about detention conditions in the remand centre and did not make any application to 
the investigative authorities or the court concerning the use of impermissible methods against 
him. 
</p>
<p>329. On 21 February 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 2 February 2007. The Government informed that since 23 May 2006 until the present, the 
convict Sanjar Umarov has been held in prison Uya 64/47 in Kyzyl-tepa in Navoi province. 
In accordance with the law in force and the regulations of the Central Penal Correction 
Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan, the administration of the 
aforementioned institution has repeatedly taken disciplinary measures against Mr. Umarov by 
placing him in a punishment cell for violating the prison&#8217;s custodial system. However, 
Mr. Umarov was never once subjected to solitary confinement in the punishment cell (the 
regulations of the Central Penal Correction Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs do not 
provide for solitary confinement). He was always with other inmates who were also being 
subjected to disciplinary measures for violating the prison&#8217;s custodial system. An investigation 
conducted by the Navoi procurator&#8217;s office relating to the supervision of the observance of laws 
in places of deprivation of liberty found that the disciplinary measures taken against Mr. Umarov 
were justified. During the time that Mr. Umarov was serving his sentence, his lawyers requested 
to meet with Mr. Umarov on 26 June, 11 July and 20 July 2006, respectively. However, in 
accordance with Mr. Umarov&#8217;s own handwritten statement, all of the lawyers were denied a 
meeting with the convict. At the same time, it should be pointed out that, during his 
imprisonment in the aforementioned institution, Mr. Umarov was allowed two meetings: 
on 27 June 2006, he met briefly with his son, and, on 4 July 2006, he had a long meeting with 
his son and sister. In addition, on 7 July 2006 and 30 September 2006, Mr. Umarov received 
two parcels. On a number of occasions, when his son requested the institution to allow him to 
meet with the Mr. Umarov, the meetings did not take place because he had been subjected to the 
disciplinary measure of being placed in a punishment cell for violating the prison&#8217;s custodial 
system. It should be pointed out that, according to the medical report on Mr. Umarov (which was 
signed by members of the medical commission consisting of the chief physician, therapist, duty 
doctor, and psychiatrist), his health was satisfactory at the time of his transfer to the 
aforementioned institution, and he has not complained about his general state of health or prison 
conditions. </p>

</p>
<p>330. On 10 April 2007, the Government added information to its reply of 19 April 2006 to the 
urgent appeal sent on 6 February 2006 (A/HRC/4/25/Add.1). According to the new information 
provided by the Government, on 6 March 2006 Mutabar Tajibaeva was convicted by the criminal 
court of Tashkent province under articles 165, para. 3 (a), 167, para. 3 (a), 168, para. 2 (b), 184, 
para. 2 (b), 189, para. 3, 197, 209, para. 1, 28, 209, para. 2 (a), 216, 228, para. 2 (b), 228, para. 3, 
229 and 244-1, para. 3 (b), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan, and sentenced under articles 59 
and 61 of the Criminal Code to eight years deprivation of liberty and stripped of the right to 
occupy managerial and financially responsible posts and to engage in business activity for a 
period of three years. According to the court judgement, M. Tajibaeva used the pretext of 
defending the rights and interests of Akhmadullo Abdullaev and Khafizidin Koraboev during 
investigation and in court to extort from them first 100,000 sum (Uzbek currency), then 
US$ 900, by means of deceit and abuse of their trust, thereby causing particularly extensive 
losses. With the aim of unlawfully taking possession of half the fish bred by T. Mamadaminov, 
a lessee of the company Andizhonbalik, in lake N-7, M. Tajibaeva used threats and coercion to 
make him transfer his rights of ownership into her name, on signature of a contract to that 
effect. She also demanded that Mamadaminov paid her 5 million sum. On 6 October 2005 
M. Tajibaeva obtained 350,000 sum from Mamadaminov by extortion. The next day 
M. Tajibaeva was arrested in flagrante delicto by law-enforcement officers in the act of receiving 
250,000 sum from Mamadaminov. In 2002 M. Tajibaeva set up an illegal voluntary association 
called the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221;. She thereupon used funds received from abroad to organize 
unauthorized demonstrations in front of buildings housing local authorities and Government 
bodies in Tashkent and Fergana provinces for the purpose of putting pressure on them and their 
representatives. During these demonstrations she disseminated information that she knew to be 
false, aimed at provoking panic and destabilization. Furthermore, M. Tajibaeva did not declare 
the financial assistance received for organizing the activities of the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221; to the 
tax authorities and deliberately evaded payment of taxes and other charges to the value of 
2,042,900 sum. M. Tajibaeva set up a multiproduct trading and manufacturing company and 
used forged documents to obtain a loan of 8 million sum from the National Bank in Margilan, 
which she withdrew in cash and diverted for improper use. M. Tajibaeva unlawfully used 
6.8 hectares of land belonging to the Nomuna shirkat farm in the Akhunbabaev district of 
Fergana province. This plot of land had originally been allocated to the Tursunbai farm, and then 
to the Bokijon Ota farm. Having unlawfully taken possession of this plot of land, M. Tajibaeva 
left it untended, as a result of which it was waterlogged, heavily salinized and infested with 
weeds. In consequence the productivity of this farmland fell and the provisions on land use and 
regulations on soil protection were directly broached. The Nomuna shirkat farm suffered a total 
financial loss of 1,601,512 sum and the Bokijon Ota farm a loss of 8,579,304 sum. Land tax of 
191,130 sum was deliberately evaded. The criminal prosecution against M. Tajibaeva is not 
related to her human rights work. She has been convicted for perpetrating specific criminal acts. 
This criminal case is currently being prepared for review by the court of appeal. 
</p>
<p>331. On 14 August 2007, the Government added that some mass media and foreign 
non-governmental organizations disseminate false reports as if &#8220;Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva&#8217;s 
health has deteriorated&#8221;. According to the decision of the Court, Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva was 
pledged guilty in for committing such crimes as blackmail, robbery, embezzlement through 
appropriation and misapplication, fraud, evasion from tax payments, violation of trade rules and 
land tenure conditions, functional forgery, arbitrariness, distribution of materials containing 
threat to public safety and order. Since 7 July 2006 convicted Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva is serving </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 184 
 
</p>
<p>a sentence in the colony of general regime. She has a right for health protection, including 
medical care outlined in the Criminal-Executive Code of Uzbekistan. For the term of sentence 
she have had so far, Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva contacted medical unit of the colony, where she 
was provided with necessary treatment in the outpatient setting and two tunes underwent 
in-patient treatment. According to the medical examination conclusions made on 
11 August 2007, the health condition of Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva is satisfactory and she is able to 
work. During serving the punishment sentenced Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva in accordance with 
article 9 of the Criminal and Executive Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan used four times short 
and long-lasting meetings with her relatives. Thus, on 19 July 2006 she had a short meeting with 
her nephew Mr. Gani Umurzakov, on 10 August 2006 - long-lasting meeting (3 days) with her 
sister Ms. Mukharram Tajibayeva, 9 January 2007 - short meeting with her daughter 
Ms. Makhliyokhon Tajibayeva, 10 August 2007 - short meeting with her younger brother 
Mr. Rasul Tajibayev. In accordance with written request by Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva, lawyer 
Ms. Dilafruz Nurmanova visited her on 13 July 2006. Afterwards she never requested such 
visit. Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva regularly receives parcels and packets from relatives (6 times), 
last time - on 28 June 2007. She also receives and sends correspondents to and from relatives 
(34 times received and 46 times sent). Abovementioned facts show that misinformation 
disseminated by some mass media and NGOs as if &#8220;Ms. Mutabar Tajibayeva&#8217;s health condition 
has deteriorated, there is no access to her by relatives&#8221; is based on unchecked information, bears 
tendentious nature. It is obvious that such actions are aimed at artificial discharging of the 
situation on around that issue and represent intentional attempts to damage the image of 
Uzbekistan in the international arena. 
</p>
<p>332. On 4 May 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 23 April 2007 
indicating that on 1 May 2007 the Sergeli district court on criminal cases in Tashkent city 
concluded the consideration of the criminal case against Mrs. Umida Niyazova, who had been 
found guilty according to three articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan: 
article 223 (&#8220;Illegal crossing of the State border&#8221;), article 246 (&#8220;Smuggling&#8221;), article 2441 
(&#8220;Production and dissemination of materials containing threat to public security and public 
order&#8221;). The court hearings have been held in the open mode. The representatives of 
&#8220;Human Rights Watch&#8221; and other NGOs attended the trial. On cumulative of committed crimes 
Mrs. U. Niyazova was sentenced to 7 years of imprisonment serving the punishment in colony of 
general regime. During the investigation it also has been established that Mrs. U. Niyazova had 
been engaged in financing various non-registered non-governmental human rights organizations 
operating in Uzbekistan. Moreover, the financial assets transferred to the specified illegal 
organizations Mrs. U. Niyazova has received from several foreign diplomatic missions 
accredited in Uzbekistan. The given facts according to the international law should be considered 
as attempts to interfere into internal affairs of the sovereign state. 
</p>
<p>333. On 28 June, the Government added that according to the verdict of the court, 
on 21 December 2006, Ms. Umida Niyazova arrived by flight #782 &#8220;Bishkek-Tashkent&#8221; 
approximately at 10 o&#8217;clock and proceeded to the customs control of Tashkent 
International Airport. During the customs registration of the convicted Ms. Niyazova&#8217;s luggage, 
the custom officials of the Post #1 of &#8220;Tashkent-Aero&#8221; Custom Control Services have found and 
withdrawn one HP laptop and one flash-disk hidden from the custom control and not specified in 
the T-6 customs declaration form. The data available in HP laptop and flash-disk have been 
examined. Besides during 2004-2006 Ms. U. Niyazova have received 1,229.84 US dollars for the 
individual grant of the Commission on development of democracy under the US Embassy in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 185 
 
</p>
<p>Uzbekistan entitled &#8220;Decriminalization of slander and insult -pledge of freedom of speech&#8221;, as 
well as for assistance to so called &#8220;human rights defenders&#8221;, allegedly for fees to independent 
journalists and lawyers from the United Kingdom. During the above-mentioned period 
Ms. Niyazova has also received 5,328 US dollars from Russia, 2,000 US dollars from Turkey, 
170 US dollars from Kazakhstan and 2,911 US dollars from Kyrgyzstan for realization of her 
activities presented as grants and projects such as the project of the Initiative Group of Legal 
Experts of Uzbekistan &#8220;On monitoring of violations of human rights in the field of freedom of 
movement in Uzbekistan&#8221;, the project of non-governmental non-profit human rights organization 
OZNP MAZLUM &#8220;Monitoring of violations of human rights in the field of freedom of 
movement, immigration and exit in Uzbekistan&#8221;, the project &#8220;Hot Line&#8221; or &#8220;Urgent legal aid&#8221;, 
the project &#8220;Urgent legal aid to human rights defenders&#8221;, In total the sum of 10,409 US dollars 
has been received. The above-specified projects are aimed at financing and uniting the various 
so-called &#8220;human rights&#8221; organizations and associations illegally operating on the territory of 
Uzbekistan. The aims and objectives of the above-mentioned projects and grants presented as 
human rights protection schemes and financed by western non-governmental organizations, are 
directed on unconstitutional change of the existing political system, opposing to the sovereignty, 
integrity and security of Uzbekistan, and targeting the incitement of social, national, racial and 
religious hostility, encroaching on health and morale of people. Ms. U. Niyazova by continuing 
her criminal activity on 8 January 2007 headed from Tashkent to Andijan region with the 
purpose to depart abroad illegally and in violation of the existing due order, without 
documents confirming her identity, unlawfully crossed the border of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
bypassing the &#8220;Hanobad&#8221; frontier post and departed to Osh city of the Republic of Otan. On 
22 January 2007 Ms. U. Niyazova with the purpose to enter Uzbekistan illegally in infringement 
of the due order, without documents confirming her identity, has again unlawfully crossed the 
border of the Republic of Uzbekistan from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan bypassing the 
&#8220;Hanobad&#8221; frontier post in Andijan region and was detained by officers of &#8220;Hanobad&#8221; frontier 
post. Ms. U. Niyazova has partially admitted her guilt in committing the crimes and has testified 
that on 21 December 2006 on arrival to Tashkent from OSCE session which took place in 
Bishkek, during the customs registration of her luggage custom officials found the laptop. After 
the examination of the data available in the laptop and flash-disk by the expert of the Center of 
monitoring on mass communications of the Uzbek Agency on communication and 
Informatization, Ms. U. Niyazova was familiarized with expert&#8217;s conclusion which specified that 
the data available in the laptop and flash-disk could lead to the attempts to undermine the 
existing Constitutional system of the Republic of Uzbekistan and infringe its territorial integrity. 
The materials containing religious motives were also revealed and it was recommended to refrain 
from importing the specified data carriers to the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Then, 
customs officers made the report on infringement of the customs legislation, which she was 
familiarized with and signed. Ms. Niyazova&#8217;s guilt is confirmed by the evidences of the witness 
Mr. M. Makhkamov who testified that as a result of search of the luggage of Ms. Umida 
Kurbonovna Niyazova, a passenger and citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, a laptop and a 
flash-disk not mentioned in the customs declaration was found and withdrawn. According to 
expert&#8217;s preliminary conclusion dated 21 December 2006, it was established that the laptop and 
flash-disk contain materials and information that could lead to the attempts to undermine the 
existing Constitutional system of the Republic of Uzbekistan and infringe the territorial 
integrity of the Republic. Ms. Niyazova&#8217;s guilt is also confirmed by the evidences of 
witnesses: O. Addable, A. Kuptsova, D. Aydarov, D. Shukurova, S. Talibjonov, R. Muhamedov, 
A. Negrienko, E. Holikov and others. Besides, the guilt of Ms. Niyazova is also confirmed </p>

</p>
<p>334. On 3 July 2007, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter of 9 May 2007 
indicating that on 24 April 2007, the Andijan provincial criminal court found 
Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva guilty of committing offences covered by article 159, paragraph 3 (b) 
(Attacks against the constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan), article 244-1, 
paragraph 3 (b) (Preparation or dissemination of materials constituting a threat to public safety 
and public order) and article 244-2, paragraph 1 (Establishing, leading or participating in 
religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations), of the 
Criminal Code of Uzbekistan and sentenced her to six years&#8217; imprisonment for multiple 
offences. In April 2005, Ms. Turayeva, under the pretext of providing legal assistance to doctors 
and patients, established and headed the unofficial organization Animakor. Through this 
organization, she engaged in the dissemination, in the mass media, of slanderous information 
that had a negative impact on social stability. In such information, Ms. Turayeva exaggerated a 
number of shortcomings in the work of health-care institutions. In addition, she disseminated, 
on Internet pages, unfounded information about terrorist acts committed in Andijan on 
13 May 2005, thereby spreading panic among the population. In January 2007, Ms. Turayeva, 
for a large sum of money, travelled to Osh in Kyrgyzstan in order to obtain literature containing 
an open call for the overthrow of the existing constitutional order of Uzbekistan and for the 
violation of the Republic&#8217;s territorial integrity. This literature was to be disseminated in 
Uzbekistan. On her return to Uzbekistan, she was arrested at the Dustlik customs checkpoint. 
Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s guilt has been proved by her confessions and repentance for her acts at her trial, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 187 
 
</p>
<p>by the testimony of the witnesses G. Saypirov, Y. Isakov, A. Oripov, M. Tukhtasinov, 
I. Yuldashev and S. Saydakhmetov, by the findings of a comprehensive forensic psychological, 
philosophical, philological and religious examination and by other evidence. The pretrial 
investigation and trial were conducted in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure of 
Uzbekistan. The accusations were discussed and the evidence was correctly assessed. There is no 
indication in the case file that law enforcement agencies exerted any physical or psychological 
pressure on Ms. Turayeva during the investigation. The materials of the criminal case show that, 
from the moment that Ms. Turayeva was arrested as a suspect on 14 January 2007, all 
investigative measures with her participation were conducted in the presence of the lawyer 
O. Matyakubova. On 17 January 2007, Ms. Turayeva requested that Ms. Matyakubova be 
replaced by the lawyer D. Botiraliev; on 22 January 2007, she requested that Mr. Botiraliev be 
replaced by the lawyer A. Usmanov. All of her requests were met and all investigative measures 
were conducted in the presence of the lawyers D. Botiraliev and A. Usmanov. The preliminary 
investigation of Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s case was conducted with the participation of a lawyer, in whose 
presence the prisoner stated that she had testified of her own free will and that she had not been 
subjected to any pressure. During the trial, Ms. Turayeva also confirmed that no prohibited 
methods had been used against her during the pretrial investigation. Since the testimony given by 
Ms. Turayeva during the pretrial investigation coincided with the evidence assembled, the court 
found her testimony plausible. During the preliminary investigation and trial, Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s 
rights were observed in accordance with articles 49 (Defence counsel), 50 (Engagement of 
defence counsel) and 52 (Waiver of defence counsel) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 
Uzbekistan. In addition, on 7 May 2007, the Andijan provincial criminal court found 
Ms. Turayeva guilty of committing an offence under article 139, paragraph 3 (a) and 
(d) (Slander, combined with accusation of the commission of a serious or particularly serious 
offence for mercenary motives). In accordance with article 57 of the Criminal Code (Mitigation 
of sentence), the court sentenced Ms. Turayeva to a fine in the amount of 648,000 sum. In 
accordance with article 59 (Sentences in the case of the commission of multiple crimes and 
multiple convictions) and 61 (Rules for calculating sentences in the case of multiple 
convictions), and bearing in mind the conviction of 24 April 2007, the court, on the basis of all 
the offences committed by Ms. Turayeva, on 7 May 2007 handed down the combined sentence 
of six years&#8217; deprivation of liberty and a fine in the amount of 648,000 sum. On 8 May 2007, 
Ms. Turayeva filed appeals against both court decisions. The appeals were considered by the 
appellate division of the Andijan provincial criminal court. On 12 June 2007, the appellate court 
amended the court sentences of 24 April and 7 May 2007, applying article 72 (Suspended 
sentence) of the Criminal Code. Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s sentence was changed to six years&#8217; deprivation 
of liberty, suspended, with three years&#8217; probation, and a fine of 648,000 sum. Ms. Turayeva was 
released from custody in the courtroom. 
</p>
<p>335. On 6 August 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 9 September 2007 
indicating that as an ardent supporter of the religious extremist organization Hizb-ut-Tahrir 
since 1998, Mr. Otabek Muminov was engaged in the preparation and distribution of the 
organization&#8217;s religious extremist literature but fled his place of residence after his associates 
were arrested. In April 2002, the investigation department of the Uzbekistan National Security 
Service opened criminal proceedings against him under articles 159 (Attacks on the 
constitutional order) and 244-2 (Establishing, leading or participating in religious extremist, 
separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations) of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan 
and placed him on their list of wanted persons. It has been established that, from 2001, </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 188 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Muminov continued his extremist activities in the Kazakh province of South Kazakhstan; 
then, in 2004, he entered the Kyrgyz province of Osh on a fake Kyrgyz passport. Mr. Muminov 
occupied one of the top positions in the Hizb ut Tahrir hierarchy and was responsible for 
preparing and reproducing the religious extremist organization&#8217;s anti-constitutional literature. 
While carrying out these subversive activities, Mr. Muminov was taken into custody in 
November 2006 by the Kyrgyzstan law enforcement agencies and, in accordance with the Minsk 
Convention on Judicial Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Cases of 
22 January 1993, was extradited to Uzbekistan for investigation in the context of the criminal 
proceedings against him. Pursuant to article 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Uzbekistan, 
Mr. Muminov was provided with a lawyer. No requests for additional legal counsel or 
complaints have been received from either the accused or his representatives. 
</p>
<p>336. On 28 August 2007, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent on 24 July 2007. The 
Government informed that it has been established that a pretrial investigation in the criminal case 
concerning the aforementioned persons was conducted by the investigative units of the 
Samarkand province internal affairs department. On 1 May 2006, Gafur Akhadov, Jamshid Aliev 
and Azam Yusupov were detained under article 221 (Grounds for detention) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure of Uzbekistan and were remanded in custody as a preventive measure. 
According to the report of 1 May 2006 by service officers and duty officers at the holding 
facility of the Samarkand internal affairs department, on the day of their arrest, abrasions were 
noted on the arms and legs of Mr. Akhadov, Mr. Aliev and Mr. Yusupov, and they were 
requested to explain how they had sustained those injuries. Mr. Akhadov explained that he had 
sustained his injuries on 30 April 2006 when he had fallen from a mulberry tree. Mr. Aliev 
explained that he had sustained his injuries when, out of carelessness, he had slipped off the roof 
of a shop where, on 29 April 2006, he had been repairing a broken power line. Mr. Yusupov 
explained that he had sustained his injuries on 28 April 2006 when holidaying in the 
mountains. As a preventive measure, Rofe &#203;kubov, Azam Ibodullaev, Ibrokhim Dadamirzaev, 
Ilkhom Batirov and Sobir Gafurov were asked to sign a pledge of good conduct. The 
investigation into the case was conducted in accordance with the provisions of Uzbek legislation 
governing criminal procedure and with respect for the rights of the accused, including their right 
to a defence. In accordance with article 50 (Engagement of defence counsel) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the defence counsel is engaged by suspects, the accused, defendants, their 
legal representatives and other persons at the request or with the consent of the suspect, accused 
or defendant. At the request of the suspect, accused or defendant, the defence counsel&#8217;s 
participation in the case is ensured by the person conducting the initial inquiry, the investigator, 
the procurator or the court. During the investigation into the criminal case, the accused were 
represented by lawyers according to arrangements made with their relatives. The proceedings 
and investigations in which the accused participated were conducted in the presence of the 
aforementioned lawyers. In addition, on several occasions the lawyers met with the accused in 
private while they were being held in custody. 
</p>
<p>337. On 8 October 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent 
on 24 August 2007. The Government informed that on 2 April 2007 J.N.T. was taken 
into custody in connection with a murder and handed over to the internal affairs office of 
Yuqori-Chirchiq district of Tashkent province. From the moment that he was handed over, 
J.N.T. was ensured the services of a lawyer, in accordance with the rules on the procedure for 
upholding the right to defence, signed on 21 August 2003 by the Central Investigations Office of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Bar Association of the Republic of Uzbekistan. She </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 189 
 
</p>
<p>represented J.N.T.&#8217;s interests throughout the pretrial investigation. During the pretrial 
investigation, no reports or complaints were submitted by the defence of unlawful acts by 
employees of the internal affairs office of Yuqori-Chirchiq district of Tashkent province. On 
3 April 2007, J.N.T. was charged under article 97, part 2, paragraph (g), of the Criminal Code of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan and remand in custody was ordered as the measure of restraint 
against him. On 4 April 2007, during his questioning in the presence of his lawyer and his legal 
representative, J.N.T. confessed to the offence that he had committed and described his actions 
in detail. On 12 April 2007, J.N.T. complained of headaches and received medical attention from 
staff of the emergency medical service. In addition, arrangements were made for J.N.T. to be 
visited by his grandmother. On 29 July 2007, on the basis of the materials gathered during the 
pretrial investigation, J.N.T. was charged under article 169, part 1, and article 97, part 2, 
paragraphs (g) and (n), of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the investigation 
was closed that same day. Over the periods from 29 June and 10 July 2007, the defendant J.N.T., 
his lawyer and his legal representative were familiarized with the materials of the criminal case 
against him. On 13 July 2007, the indictment was transmitted to the Tashkent provincial court 
for its consideration. The court, having comprehensively studied and analysed the materials of 
the criminal case against J.N.T., found him guilty of the commission of an offence under 
articles 97, part 2, paragraph (o) and 169, part 1, and, on 14 September 2007, sentenced him to 
7 years and 11 months&#8217; deprivation of liberty, his sentence to be served in a young offenders&#8217; 
institution. In addition, J.N.T.&#8217;s guilt was proved during the investigation by fingerprint tests, 
biological and trace evidence analysis and forensic studies. The reports received by the 
Special Rapporteur alleging that the investigative authorities disregarded the fact that J.N.T. 
does not know Uzbek because he is an ethnic Kazakh are unfounded. A teacher of Uzbek 
language confirmed that J.N.T. spoke and understood Uzbek well. She also confirmed that, on 
3 April 2007, she had been present during J.N.T.&#8217;s questioning and that no unlawful actions had 
been taken against J.N.T. by officers of the internal affairs office of Yuqori-Chirchiq district of 
Tashkent province. During the investigation, no instances came to light of the use of unlawful 
interrogation methods or of torture by staff of the internal affairs office of Yuqori-Chirchiq 
district. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>338. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for its responses to the 
communications of 2 February, 23 April, 9 May, 24 July, 24 August, 9 September 2007 and 
the information provided. He also thanks the Government for the responses to the 
communications sent on 16 January and 15 November 2006, which were included in his report 
A/HRC/4/25/Add.1. He is however concerned at the absence of an official reply to his 
communications sent on 9 March and 22 November 2007 and urges the Government of 
Uzbekistan to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the 
ninth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to those 
communications.

<p>Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente 
en relaci&#243;n con la reforma de la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de Venezuela, 
aprobada el 3 de noviembre de 2007 por la Asamblea Nacional de la Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de 
Venezuela, y que ser&#225; sometida a refer&#233;ndum a principio de diciembre del 2007. Por un lado, 
deseamos destacar que, dentro de la reforma propuesta, hay importantes avances para los 
derechos humanos como, por ejemplo, la extensi&#243;n de la prohibici&#243;n, contenida en el art&#237;culo 21 
de la Constituci&#243;n a la discriminaci&#243;n por razones de salud y de orientaci&#243;n sexual, as&#237; como el 
reconocimiento al valor de la diversidad de culturas, contenido en el art&#237;culo 100 de la 
Constituci&#243;n. Por otro lado, hemos recibido informaci&#243;n sobre los cambios sugeridos y 
aprobados por la Asamblea Nacional en los art&#237;culos 337, 338 y 339 referidos al estado de 
excepci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la reforma aprobada por la Asamblea Nacional 
eliminar&#237;a la obligaci&#243;n de presentar el decreto que declare el estado de excepci&#243;n ante la Sala 
Constitucional del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia para que se pronuncie sobre su 
constitucionalidad. Tambi&#233;n, se habr&#237;an suprimido los l&#237;mites temporales que la Constituci&#243;n 
vigente establece para los estados de excepci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, la reforma eliminar&#237;a la exigencia 
expresa de que el decreto que declare el estado de excepci&#243;n cumpla con las garant&#237;as 
establecidas en el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos y en la Convenci&#243;n 
Americana sobre Derechos Humanos. Asimismo, durante un estado de excepci&#243;n, podr&#237;an 
suspenderse algunas garant&#237;as consagradas en la Constituci&#243;n vigente, en particular el acceso a la 
informaci&#243;n. Si bien el nuevo texto incluye en el listado de derechos humanos intangibles el 
derecho a la defensa, a la integridad personal, a ser juzgado o juzgada por sus jueces naturales y 
a no ser condenado o condenada a penas que excedan los treinta a&#241;os, as&#237; como la prohibici&#243;n a 
la desaparici&#243;n forzosa, no menciona en forma expresa, como as&#237; lo hace el texto vigente, el 
derecho a un debido proceso. Asimismo, dicha propuesta de reforma cambiar&#237;a las disposiciones 
vigentes sobre la remoci&#243;n de los magistrados del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (Art&#237;culo 265). 
Mientras la Constituci&#243;n en vigor prev&#233; que dichos magistrados pueden ser removidos por la 
Asamblea Nacional mediante una mayor&#237;a calificada de las dos terceras partes de sus integrantes, 
la reforma prev&#233; que su remoci&#243;n puede ser votada por solo la mayor&#237;a de los integrantes de la 
Asamblea Nacional. Esta disposici&#243;n fragiliza la posici&#243;n de los magistrado y vulnera su 
independencia respeto al poder legislativo. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, dicha propuesta 
de reforma cambiar&#237;a las disposiciones vigentes sobre libertad de asociaci&#243;n, prohibiendo a las 
&#8220;asociaciones con fines pol&#237;ticos y que participen en el proceso electoral&#8221; recibir fondos 
provenientes de fuentes internacionales, tanto p&#250;blicas como privadas. La definici&#243;n de 
&#8220;asociaciones con fines pol&#237;ticos&#8221; podr&#237;a dar lugar a incertidumbres legales que afectar&#237;an 
directamente a las asociaciones de defensa de los derechos humanos y otras organizaciones 
no-gubernamentales. De esta manera, se les impedir&#237;a recibir fondos internacionales de los que, 
en muchos casos, dependen. Deseamos expresar nuestra preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad de los 
periodistas y los participantes en las manifestaciones que se suceden entre partidarios y 
opositores a la mencionada reforma constitucional. En este sentido, nos gustar&#237;a se&#241;alar a la 
atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido sobre varios incidentes que han 
tenido lugar recientemente. As&#237;, el 25 de octubre de 2007, Paulina Moreno, de la cadena p&#250;blica 
&#193;vila televisi&#243;n, habr&#237;a resultado herida por un explosivo cuando cubr&#237;a un foro en el Instituto 
Pedag&#243;gico de Caracas, y un camar&#243;grafo del mismo medio habr&#237;a sido agredido por opositores 
a la reforma. El 7 de noviembre de 2007, varios estudiantes habr&#237;an resultado heridos de bala por 
varios desconocidos armados en el campus de la Universidad Central de Venezuela, en Caracas, 
durante una manifestaci&#243;n de oposici&#243;n a la reforma. </p>

</b></p>
<p>340. El 30 de Noviembre de 2007, el Relator Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Representante Especial del 
Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humanos, emitieron el siguiente 
comunicado de prensa. Se adjunta la versi&#243;n en ingl&#233;s puesto que el comunicado fue emitido 
solamente en dicha lengua: 
</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS INDEPENDENT EXPERTS CONCERNED ABOUT 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN VENEZUELA 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are concerned about some provisions of the constitutional reform that was approved 
by the National Assembly of Venezuela on 3 November 2007 and that will be subject to a 
referendum on 2 December 2007, in a context where the security of journalists and 
participants to public demonstrations against the reform is seriously undermined. 
</p>
<p>We believe that the new provisions concerning states of emergency hinder the full 
enjoyment of civil liberties by Venezuelan citizens. The elimination of the 
Supreme Court&#8217;s authority to oversee and approve state of emergency declarations and 
the abolition of time limits for such states are inconsistent with the commitments taken by 
Venezuela under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>We express our preoccupation that provisions of the constitutional reform will curtail a set 
of fundamental rights that should be enjoyed at all times, including during states of 
emergencies, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right of access to 
information, stepping stones of all democratic societies that are not expressly guaranteed 
under the modification of articles 337, 338 and 339 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>We are also concerned about the situation of human rights defenders as the proposed 
reform establishes that associations with a political aim can only access funding at the 
national level. We fear that this definition might be selectively applied to human rights 
organizations to prevent them from accessing international funding. We are also concerned 
by the general situation of human rights defenders and journalists, who have been subject 
to threats and attacks that not only affect their personal security, but generate a widespread 
atmosphere of intimidation that discourages them from engaging in their activities and 
from taking public stands for the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the constitutional reform might harm the independence of the judiciary, since 
it is proposed that the dismissal of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judges would be decided by a 
simple majority vote of the National Assembly, instead of the two third majority as 
currently stated in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>We call upon the Venezuelan government to firmly commit to the protection of the full set 
of human rights, safeguarding the institutional guarantees that ensure that democracy and 
the rule of law will be upheld at all times.&#8221; </p>

<p>344. On 9 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 193 
 
</p>
<p>the situation of more than 40 democracy activists, opposition party members and labour union 
leaders who have been arrested during the past 15 months for charges relating to the spread of 
&#8220;anti-government propaganda&#8221; and in particular regarding Mr. Nguyen Van Dai, human rights 
lawyer. According to the information received, on 6 March 2007, Mr. Van Dai was arrested on 
the charge of spreading &#8220;propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam&#8221;. After his arrest, 
numerous requests were made to grant Mr. Van Dai access to a lawyer. On 2 May 2007, 
seven working days before the trial, a defense lawyer was provided by the Hanoi People&#8217;s Court. 
The lawyer was neither provided with the investigative report of the Hanoi Public Security 
Office nor the indictment of the Hanoi People&#8217;s Procuracy. During the court trial of first instance 
of 11 May 2007, immediate family members of the accused were not allowed to attend the event. 
They were stopped at the entry door reportedly because they could not produce invitation letters. 
During the trial, the defendant and his lawyer were not allowed to make any reference to issues 
relating to political organizations and parties. On the other hand, the prosecutors were allowed to 
discuss these issues. On 11 May 2007, the Hanoi People&#8217;s Court sentenced Mr. Van Dai to 
five years of imprisonment. On 28 November, an appeals court reduced this sentence by one 
year. As a human rights lawyer Mr. Van Dai has written many legal complaints to the authorities 
concerning violations of freedom of religion and believe. Concern was expressed that 
Mr. Van Dai did not enjoy a fair and public trial with adequate possibilities to defend himself 
because of his activities as a human rights lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>345. On 7 March 2008, the Government sent a response to the communication sent 
on 9 January 2008. According to the response, Mr. Nguyen Van Dai&#8217;s lawyer certification was 
revocated on 12 March 2007 by the association of lawyers. He joined a number of organizations 
which were illegally established and unregistered as provided by laws. He collected, propagated 
and distributed documents and answered interviews to journalists of foreign radios with contents 
inciting hatred, violence and stimulating actions aimed to disturbing public order, which violates 
Vietnamese laws. On 6 March 2007, the Agency of Investigation provisionally arrested him. 
On 11 March 2007 the People&#8217;s Court of Hanoi publicly tried him at first instance. He was 
sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment and 4 years of administrative probation. At his appeal, on 
27 November 2007, the People&#8217;s Supreme Court sentenced him to 4 years of imprisonment 
and 4 years of administrative probation following the completion of his jail term. The process of 
investigation, arrest, provisional detention and trial of Mr. Nguyen Van Daiwere conducted by 
judicial agencies in agreement with Vietnamese laws and international practice, including a 
complete independence of judicial agencies. In addition, Mr. Nguyen Van Dai was defended by 
five counsels selected by his family. Representations of foreign Embassies and journalists were 
allowed to attend and report on the trial. On 23 October 2007, Nguyen Van Dai in a meeting 
with the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom acknowledged that he 
was humanely treated in accordance with Vietnamese laws. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>346. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply of 7 March 2007. He is 
however concerned about the fact that Mr. Nguyen Van Dai was not represented by a lawyer 
during an important part of his trial - since his arrestation on 6 March 2007 until 2 May 2007, 
seven working days before the first instance trial-. The fact that his lawyer&#8217;s licence was 
cancelled in March 2007, does not justify the absence of representation. The Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 194 
 
</p>
<p>is concerned that the imprisonment sentence has been imposed in the absence of one of the 
guarantees of the due process of law, the right to be represented by a lawyer. Therefore, he 
recommends his process to be reviewed.

<p>347. On 4 December 2006, he Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, regarding Mr. Ibrahim 
Sharaf al-Din who was sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court in Yemen on 
23 November 2006 after a trial whose proceedings reportedly fell short of international fair trial 
standards. The case is now subject to appeal. If his sentence is upheld he will be at risk of 
execution. According to the information received, Ibrahim Sharaf al-Din was among 
37 members of the Shi&#8217;a Zaidi community charged in connection with an alleged &#8220;plot to kill 
the President and senior army and political officers&#8221;. Ibrahim Sharaf al-Din was arrested in 
May 2005 and held incommunicado for several months at al- Mabahith al-&#8217;Ama (General 
Investigation unit) in Sana&#8217;a. It would appear that while detained incommunicado, all 
37 defendants were interrogated without a lawyer being present. During the trial that started in 
August 2005, lawyers were reported to have been prevented from obtaining a copy of the court 
file, including full interrogation records, to enable them to exercise an effective right to 
defence. Thirty-four of the defendants were sentenced to prison terms of up to eight years&#8217; while 
two others were acquitted. 
</p>
<p>348. On 25 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the situation of 
Mr. Maamar Mohamed Ahmed Salah Al Abdelli, academic, President of the Committee for 
Freedom of Conscience and the Release of Political Prisoners, and correspondent of the 
non-governmental organization Alkarama for Human Rights. According to the information 
received, on 26 May 2007, Mr. Al Abdelli was arrested on the campus of the University of Sanaa 
by unknown persons. When the communication was sent he was detained at the Al Amn 
Assiyassi intelligence facilities of Sanaa. He has been denied access to a lawyer and his family. 
In May 2007, Mr. Al Abdelli informed Alkarama for Human Rights of several cases of 
incommunicado detention of persons belonging to the Shiite religious minority and suspected 
of supporting the Al Houti movement. Concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Al Abdelli may be related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights. In view of 
his incommunicado detention further concern was expressed that he might be at risk of torture or 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>349. On 15 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mr. &#8216;Abbas al-&#8217;Assal, aged 42, and 
Mr. Nasser al-&#8217;Awlaqi, aged about 40. According to the allegations received, Mr. &#8216;Abbas 
al-&#8216;Assal and Mr. Nasser al-&#8217;Awlaqi were arrested on 2 August 2007 by security forces together 
with other retired soldiers, including Brigadier Nasser al-Nouba and Mr. Shallal Ali Shaya, who 
were released on 7 August. The arrests were carried out following a protest in form of a &#8220;sit-in&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 195 
 
</p>
<p>at Liberty Square in central Aden. The protesters intended to voice their concern that their 
pension payments had either not been made or been significantly delayed. Security forces 
dispersed the protesters using tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition. Several persons 
were injured and it is feared that one protester was killed. Mr. &#8216;Abbas al-&#8217;Assal and Mr. Nasser 
al-&#8217;Awlaqi continue to be held in incommunicado detention at Sheikh Osman police station in 
Aden without access to family members or lawyers. The reason for their arrests and continued 
detention and whether they have been charged with any offence is still unknown. In view of the 
incommunicado detention of Mr. &#8216;Abbas al-&#8217;Assal and Mr. Nasser al-&#8217;Awlaqi, concern was 
expressed that they might be at risk of ill-treatment. Further concern is expressed that their 
arrests and continued detention might solely be connected to their exercise of their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>350. On 9 February 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
of 4 December 2006, stating that Ibrahim Sharaf al-Din, who was sentenced to death by the 
Specialized Criminal Court in Yemen on 23 November 2006, had established a terrorist cell 
targeting peace, stability, national and public security. This cell was responsible for 13 bombings 
in the capital Sana&#8217;a, resulting in the killing and injuring of more than 25 persons. Furthermore, 
the named person has been caught guilty for trying together with the terrorist cell to bomb the 
US Embassy in Yemen with missiles and they were all transferred to the Specialized Criminal 
Court in Yemen for trial where he has been sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>351. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Yemen for its answer 
of 9 February 2007. He is however concerned at the absence of an official reply to his 
communications sent on 25 June and 15 August 2007 and urges the Government of Yemen to 
provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the ninth session of the 
Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to those communications.

</b></p>
<p>352. On 7 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders concerning the situation of Mr. Arnold Tsunga, a prominent lawyer, Director of 
the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights organisation, acting Secretary of the Law Society of 
Zimbabwe, Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association, and the trustee of the radio 
station Voice of People (VOP). Mr. Tsunga is also the laureate of the 2006 international 
Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders which is granted annually to someone who 
has demonstrated an exceptional record of combating human rights violations by courageous and 
innovative means. Mr. Tsunga, together with five other activists, was the subject of an urgent 
appeal by the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 31 January 2006. A response from the Government was received on 4 May 2006. 
According to new information received, on 25 January 2007, Mr. Tsunga was reportedly </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 196 
 
</p>
<p>detained for a brief period at the Harare International Airport when returning from the World 
Social Forum in Kenya. He was stopped in the arrivals terminal by four men in civilian clothing 
who asked to see his passport. When Mr. Tsunga enquired about their identification, they 
dragged him into an office where they demanded to see his baggage. Mr. Tsunga was reportedly 
released without charge. 
</p>
<p>353. Concern was expressed that the recent detention of Mr. Tsunga may be related to his 
legitimate and peaceful activities as a lawyer acting in defence of human rights, in particular his 
participation in the World Social Forum in Kenya, and may form part of a campaign of 
intimidation and harassment against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>354. On 28 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders regarding the situation of Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa, President of the Law Society of 
Zimbabwe and Board member of the non-government organization Zimbabwe Lawyers for 
Human Rights (ZLHR), Mr. Andrew Makoni, Board member of ZLHR, Mr. Harrison Nkomo, 
Mr. Alec Muchadehama, Mr. Otto Saki, Mr. Tafadzwa Mugabe, Mr. Rangu Nyamurundira, 
Mr. Dzimbabwe Chimbga, Ms. Irene Petras, and Mr. Arnold Tsunga, all members of ZLHR. All 
the aforementioned individuals are registered legal practitioners in Zimbabwe and represent 
other human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, trade unionists, 
constitutional rights activists, and students. Ms. Mtetwa was the subject of an allegation letter 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 18 June 2004; Mr. Nkomo was the 
subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 
20 March 2007; Mr. Mugabe was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
30 April 2004; Mr. Tsunga was the subject of a an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 7 February 2007 and of 
an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders on 31 January 2006. According to the information received, on 
11 March 2007, Mr. Nkomo was assaulted by a police officer with a baton stick at Machipisa 
police station while enquiring about the whereabouts of the members of the Save Zimbabwe 
Coalition who were arrested following an attempt to hold a peaceful prayer meeting in Harare. 
He was chased away from the station by police officers. On the same day, Ms. Petras 
Mr. Makoni, Mr. Muchadehama, and Mr. Mugabe were threatened with physical harm by armed 
police officers when attempting to enter the Harare Central police station and meet with the 
Officer in Charge of the Law and Order section. On 12 March, Ms. Mtetwa was threatened by 
armed police at Borrowdale police station when attempting to serve a court order and gain access 
to Mr. Tsvangirai, an arrested member of the political opposition. On 16 March, Mr. Saki 
received an anonymous phone call at the office of ZLHR threatening him with death if he did not 
stop representing members of the Save Zimbabwe Coalition. He was also warned that all the 
ZLHR lawyers would be &#8220;silenced&#8221;. On 16 March, the offices of Mr. Makoni and Mr. 
Muchadehama in Harare were visited by officers from the Central Intelligence Organisation 
(CIO) who attempted to intimidate the lawyers from carrying out their legal representation work. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
  page 197 
 
</p>
<p>Officers from the CIO have since reportedly visited the premises of ZLHR at least 7 times. 
On 17 March, Mr. Mugabe accompanied his clients Mrs. Sekai Holland and Ms. Grace Kwinjeh, 
who were reportedly injured by police, to the airport to seek medical treatment in South Africa, 
but they were prevented from leaving the country, re-arrested and escorted by armed police back 
to a private hospital. Mr. Mugabe tried to assert their rights to intelligence and immigration 
officials, but he was threatened with arrest and physical harm, and warned to desist from 
representing his clients and taking up similar cases. On the same day, Mr. Chimbga was stopped 
by intelligence and immigration officers at the airport when returning to Harare, and told to stop 
taking up similar cases. These officers reportedly told Mr. Chimbga that all the lawyers working 
for ZLHR would be &#8220;dealt with&#8221; shortly. On 18 March, Mr. Makoni was threatened with 
disappearance by Assistant Commissioner Mabunda at Harare Central police station while 
attempting to serve a High Court order on him. Assistant Commissioner Mabunda allegedly 
stated that lawyers had disappeared during Zimbabwe&#8217;s liberation struggle, and that since 
Mr. Makoni and his colleagues believed they were waging a new &#8220;liberation struggle&#8221;, they too 
would suffer the same fate. On 19 March 2007, Ms. Mtetwa and Mr. Nkomo were manhandled 
by police officers and threatened with arrest by Assistant Commissioner Mabunda at Harare 
Central police station whilst attempting to serve court orders and notices of set down for an 
urgent hearing. Concern was expressed that these acts of intimidation and harassment against the 
aforementioned lawyers working for ZLHR may be related to their legitimate and peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, in particular the right to provide legal assistance to 
detainees. This concern is heightened by the fact that there seems to be a limited number of 
lawyers both engaged in and willing to take up human rights cases. Further concern was 
expressed that the independence of the judiciary is also threatened by the fact that those 
representing members of certain political groups are targeted. 
</p>
<p>355. On 11 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning the harassments, assaults and arrests of human rights lawyers in 
Zimbabwe. According to the information received, on 25 April 2007 the wives of the lawyers 
Alec Muchadehama and Andrew Makoni received two anonymous calls, threatening the families 
of the two lawyers by saying that they were going to be dealt with ruthlessly and that their 
husbands would meet the same fate. On 4 May 2007, Alec Muchadehama and Andrew Makoni 
were arrested and detained during their course of business on charges of obstructing the 
course of justice in the case of Amos Musekiwa and others who are facing arson charges. The 
two lawyers are the main legal representatives for the 30 opposition Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) members who are accused by the Government of a series of petrol bomb attacks. 
Defence lawyer Muchadehama argued that several of his clients were already in detention when 
the alleged arson attacks took place. On 7 May 2007, the lawyers were finally released after 
spending three days in police custody. The lawyers were being held despite two court 
orders ordering their release. In addition, they were both denied access to their lawyers. On 
8 of May 2007, members of Law Society of Zimbabwe were subjected to brutal treatment by the 
state as they attempted to gather outside the High court of Zimbabwe in Harare for a peaceful 
solidarity protest against the arrest of the two lawyers and the non-execution of the court order. 
Around 60 lawyers had gathered, when they were ordered to disperse. As the lawyers began to 
disperse, police started assaulting lawyers with baton sticks. Seeking protection in the 
Attorney General&#8217;s office, they met officers waiting for them inside the building. They were 
forced into a police truck, driven away, severely beaten up a few kilometers away and finally </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 198 
 
</p>
<p>abandoned by the side of the road. It is also reported that contempt of court orders by the police 
has become frequent, and that lawyers exercising their duties in defending the people, and 
notably political dissidents, are experiencing increasing harassment and violence from the police. 
Grave concern was expressed for the lack of respect for the independence and authority of the 
judiciary and for the harassment and attacks on lawyers who execute their lawful mandate as 
provided for under the law, which is essential for the safeguard of fundamental rights and 
freedoms of citizens in the country. 
</p>
<p>356. On 12 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the following situation affecting members of 
the Women and Men of Zimbabwe Association (WOZA-MOZA). According to the information 
received, on 6 June 2007, around 200 members of the Women and Men of Zimbabwe 
Association (WOZA-MOZA) undertook a silent and peaceful march through the city of 
Bulawayo to launch a document entitled &#8220;Ten steps to a new Zimbabwe&#8221;. The Association was 
also expressing its concern that Zimbabwean civil society was excluded from the ongoing 
dialogue initiated by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and mediated by 
South African President Thabo Mbeki, creating the danger that pertinent issues on civil, political, 
economic and social rights and democracy would be given not enough attention. After having 
walked one block, one group of participants was reportedly violently dispersed by the riot police. 
Five WOZA members, namely Ms. Rosemary Sibiza, Ms. Angeline Karuru, Ms. Martha Ncube, 
Ms. Sangeliso Dhlamini and Ms. Pretty Moyo, were badly beaten with baton sticks, arrested and 
detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station. Upon hearing that five of their colleagues had been 
beaten, another group of women went to the police station. The police officers then assaulted the 
women, before arresting Ms. Jenni Williams, WOZA National Co-ordinator and Ms. Magodonga 
Mahlangu, another WOZA leader. Following the arrest of the WOZA women, attorney Kossam 
Ncube went to the police station to represent them. At the police station, Superintendent Nsingo 
reportedly accused him of being &#8220;unethical&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and stated that lawyers had no 
business at the police station as he sought to speak to his clients. He also ordered Mr. Ncube to 
leave and pushed him out of the station. On 7 June 2007, Mr. Ncube tried again to meet with his 
clients but was denied access by the police. 
</p>
<p>357. On 24 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding the situation of Mr. Kucaca Phulu, a lawyer and chairperson of the Zimbabwe 
Human Rights Association (also known as ZimRights). According to the information received, 
on 22 August 2007, Mr. Phulu reportedly received threats over the phone by a person 
introducing himself as &#8220;Moyo&#8221; from the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front. 
This person threatened Mr. Phulu with physical harm for representing one of his clients who is 
charged with armed robbery and wanted for arrest, and warned him that should his client not be 
found, Mr. Phulu would be killed in his place. Serious concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned death threats against Mr. Phulu may be related to his work in defense of human 
rights. Further concern was expressed that these threats may form part of an ongoing pattern of 
harassment against human rights defenders and lawyers in Zimbabwe. </p>

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>358. On 19 June 2007, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 12 June 2007. 
According to the Government, on the 6th of June 2007 a group of about 30 members of WOZA 
converged at the Bulawayo city centre with the intention to hold an illegal demonstration. 
At about 1130 hours the group started to march along George Silundika Street between 8th 
and 9th avenue. They were waving placards denouncing the President of South Africa, 
Thabo Bheki&#8217;s mediation in Zimbabwe. The police ordered the demonstrators to disperse and 
five members who defied the order were arrested. These were: Sizimisele Ndlovu aged 23 years, 
Samkeliso Dlamini aged 38 years, Angeline Karuru aged 25 years, Rosemary Siziba 
aged 43 years, Martha Ncube aged 47 years. These were taken to the police station. Meanwhile 
another group of WOZA members numbering about 25 and led by Jennipher Williams and 
Magodonga Mhlanga regrouped and marched towards Central Police station, where they staged a 
demonstration in solidarity with their arrested colleagues. This group was also ordered to 
disperse by the officer in Charge Central Police Station. As they were being dispersed, the group 
leaders, Magodonga and Williams were arrested and detained at Central Police Station. They did 
not hand themselves over as alleged in some circles. The detained were allowed access to their 
lawyers Cossam Ncube and Caca Phulu of Coglan and Welsh legal practitioners at the Police 
Station. Accordingly, the said lawyers are reported to have arrived at the Police station and 
sought to see their clients well before the arrest of their clients. At no stage were the accused 
denied access to their lawyers. The first group of five accused persons were charged for 
contravening section 46 As Read with subsection 2 of the criminal Law (Codification 
and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23. &#8220;Criminal nuisance&#8221;. They were taken to court on the 
8 June 2007, where they were remanded out of custody to 21 June 2007 on $100,000.00 bail 
each. Jennipher Williams and Magodonga Mhlanga were charged for contravening 
section 37 (1) (a) (1) of the criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23, 
&#8220;Participating in an unlawful demonstration&#8221; alternatively contravening section 46 As Read with 
subsection 2 of die criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 &#8220;Criminal 
nuisance&#8221;. They were also released on $100,000.00 bail. 
</p>
<p>359. On 4 September 2007, the Government added in a separate communication that 
Jennipher Williams and Magodonga Mhlanga appeared in court on the 22nd of June 2007. 
During the court proceedings their lawyer raised issues of constitutionality in respect of the 
preferred charges. The case has since been referred to the Supreme Court for a determination of 
the issues raised by the defence lawyer. 
</p>
<p>360. On 11 December 2007, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 24 August 2007. According to the response, the Zimbabwe Republic Police denies having 
received a complaint from Mr. Phulu. The Government states that the threats against 
Mr. Phulu cannot be substantiated because the Police did not received any complaint. In absence 
of such police report there is no way one can guarantee the accuracy and truthfulness of the death 
threats alleged. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>361. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Zimbabwe for its quick response to 
the joint urgent appeal of 12 June and 24 August and 2007 and the information provided. He 
is however concerned at the absence of an official reply to his communications sent </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 
page 200 
 
</p>
<p>on 7 February, 28 March and 11 May 2007. He urges the Government to provide substantive 
detailed information at the earliest possible date and preferably before the end of the 9th session 
of the Human Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned by the Government&#8217;s 
affirmation regarding the communication sent on 24 August 2007, that in absence of a complaint 
before the Police the threats against Mr. Phulu can not be substantiated. It is the obligation of the 
State, according to international human rights law, to investigate any act that could constitute 
human rights violations. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur calls the Government to investigate 
the threats received by Mr. Phulu.
