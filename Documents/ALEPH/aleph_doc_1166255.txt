Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting 
 
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  company  have  been  prepared  by 
management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  include  a 
summary prepared by management reconciling significant differences between Canadian and United 
States generally accepted accounting principles as they affect these financial statements. The financial 
statements  contain  estimates  based  on  management’s  judgement.  Management  maintains  an 
appropriate system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are authorized, 
assets safeguarded, and proper records maintained. 
 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has met with the company’s independent auditors to 
review the scope and results of the annual audit and to review the consolidated financial statements and 
related  financial  reporting  matters  prior  to  submitting  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the 
Board for approval. 
 
The company’s independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are appointed by the shareholders 
to conduct an audit of the annual financial statements, and their report follows.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
 
To the Shareholders of 
Spur Ventures Inc. 
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Spur Ventures Inc. as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the 
consolidated statements of operations and deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. 
 
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
company as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2005 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Comments by Auditors for U.S. Readers on Canada-U.S. Reporting Difference 
 
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion 
paragraph) when there is a change in accounting principles that has a material effect on the comparability of the company's 
financial statements, such as the change described in note 2 to the financial statements. Our report to the shareholders dated 
March 17, 2006 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do require a reference to such a change 
in accounting principles in the auditor's report when the change is properly accounted for and adequately disclosed in the 
financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
 
(expressed in Canadian dollars) 
 
1  Nature of operations
Spur Ventures Inc. (the company) is developing a fully integrated fertilizer business in the People’s Republic of 
China (China). The recoverability of the amounts shown as mineral properties is dependent upon the existence 
of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the company to obtain the necessary financing to complete 
the development of the properties, and future profitable production or proceeds from the sale of fertilizer 
products.
Management acknowledges that for the Yichang Phosphate Project to be successful it will require significant 
equity and/or debt financing. Management has successfully raised financing in the past for the early stages of 
this project; however, there is no assurance that the company will be successful in raising this financing in the 
future. Management considers that the company has sufficient funding to meet its obligations and maintain 
administrative and operational expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
In addition, the company has entered into agreements securing the title of the mineral properties, by forming a 
78.72% controlled Joint Venture Company, Yichang Maple Leaf Chemicals Ltd. (YMC), with Hubei Yichang 
Phosphorous Chemical Co. Ltd. (YPCC) in December 2003 to undertake the development of the phosphate 
mines and to build compound phosphate fertilizer production facilities. YMC has not yet commenced active 
operations. The titles to the two primary mining properties are legally in the possession of our Joint Venture 
partner, YPCC, and are in the process of being formally transferred to YMC. Although these arrangements are 
in accordance with industry standards for the stage of development of such properties, these procedures do not 
guarantee the company’s title. Property title may also be subject to unregistered prior agreements and 
regulatory requirements.
To accelerate the production of compound fertilizers, the company acquired Xinyuan Chemicals Ltd. in 2004 
and formed a 72.18% controlled Joint Venture Company called Yichang Spur Chemicals Ltd. (YSC), which 
owns a 100,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphate, Potassium), The other two minority 
partners are YPCC which owns 16.69% and Yichang Yuanfeng Chemical (Yuanfeng) which owns 11.13%.
2  Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation and preparation of financial statements
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) and differ in certain material respects from the requirements of United 
States GAAP, as disclosed in note 17).
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, its two sino-foreign Joint Venture 
companies, YSC and YMC, which are controlled by the company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Spur 
Chemicals (BVI) Inc. and International Phosphate Mining Corporation (International Phosphate). International 
Phosphate was incorporated to carry out mineral exploration and development programs in China. All 
significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain comparative figures have 
been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
 
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenditures during the reporting period. Items subject to significant management estimates include the 
amounts recorded for stock-based compensation and the assessment of recoverable values. Actual results could 
differ from those reported.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits maturing within ninety days of the original 
date of acquisition and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. To limit its exposure, the company 
deposits its funds with large financial institutions in either US dollars or Canadian dollars.
Marketable securities & Short Term Investments
Marketable securities are carried at the lower of cost and market value. Short term investments with an original 
maturity of greater than 90 days and less than 1 year are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting primarily of fertilizers and raw materials, is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable 
value. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the 
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost is calculated using the 
weighted average method comprising all costs of purchases, costs of conversion and other costs incurred, 
including overhead allocation, in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is 
computed using the straight-line method at the following rates calculated to depreciate the cost of the assets less 
their residual values over their estimated useful lives:
Building 
Machinery and equipment 
Motor vehicle 
Office equipment and furniture 
Computer equipment 
Leasehold improvement
Land use right
5.00%   
  8.33% - 10.00%   
20.00%   
 
20.00%   
 
33.33%   
 
 
50%
The land use right is for 50 years. It is amortized on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the YSC 
business license of 30 years.

(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Impairment of long-lived assets
Management of the company regularly reviews the net carrying value of each long-lived asset. Where 
information is available and conditions suggest impairment, estimated future net cash flows are calculated 
using estimated future prices, proven and probable reserves, selling prices for fertilizer products, and operating, 
capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis. Reductions in the carrying value of long-lived assets 
would be recorded to the extent the net book value of the related assets exceeds the estimated future cash flows.
Where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment, 
management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered.
Management’s estimates of mineral prices, recoverable proven and probable reserves, selling prices for 
fertilizer products, and operating, capital and reclamation costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
which may affect the recoverability of long-lived assets. Although management has made its best estimate of 
these factors, it is possible that changes could occur in the near term, which could adversely affect 
management’s estimate of the net cash flow to be generated from its assets.
Mineral properties
The company records its interest in mineral properties at cost. Exploration and development expenditures 
relating to properties with mineralization are deferred and will be amortized against future production following 
commencement of commercial production, or written off if the properties are sold, allowed to lapse, abandoned 
or if impairment is evident.
The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a detailed and time-consuming process. The titles of the mining 
properties have been issued to our Joint Venture Company partner, YPCC, for the exclusive use of YPCC’s 
equity contribution to the YMC Joint Venture. In Canada, our sino-foreign joint venture agreement with YPCC 
would be sufficient protection to proceed with mining but in China, for greater certainty, we are ensuring the 
formal transfer of the titles from YPCC to the YMC joint venture. This is a time-consuming process required 
only for foreign investors in China.
Asset retirement obligations
The accounting for asset retirement obligation encompasses the accounting for legal obligation associated with 
the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction or development 
and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The retirement of a long-lived asset is its other than 
temporary removal from service, including its sale, abandonment, recycling or disposal in some other manner.
According to current Chinese environmental regulations and contracts of the company, there is no obligation 
for the company to dismantle and remove plant and equipment or to remediate sites upon the cessation of 
operations. The company pays an annual environmental fee to the local government as the cost of operating a 
chemical site. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the annual revenues and is expensed as incurred. Future 
changes to Chinese environmental regulation may have a material impact on the assessment of asset retirement 
obligations.

(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Loss per common share
The basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding during the year. The diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution of common share 
equivalents, such as outstanding stock options and share purchase warrants, in the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding during the year, if dilutive. For this purpose, the “treasury stock method” is used 
whereby the assumed proceeds upon the exercise of stock options and warrants are used to purchase common 
shares at the average market price during the year.
Income taxes
The company follows the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, future 
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial statements. The future tax assets or liabilities are calculated 
using the tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to be settled. Future tax assets are 
recognized to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be realized.
Revenue recognition
The company recognizes revenues to external customers when the product is shipped and title passes along 
with the risks and rewards of ownership, provided collection is reasonably assured. Transportation costs are 
recovered from the customer through product pricing.
Foreign currency translations
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (CAD) and the functional currency of 
YSC and YMC is Chinese Yuan Renminbi (RMB). YSC is considered a self-sustaining operation and is 
translated into Canadian dollars using current rate method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are 
translated at period-end exchange rates and items included in the statements of operations and deficit and cash 
flows are translated at the rates in effect at the time of the transaction. The gain or loss on translation is charged 
to cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders' equity.
YMC is considered an integrated operation and is translated into Canadian dollars using the temporal method. 
Under this method, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and items included 
on the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at rates in effect at the time of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. The gain or loss on translation is charged to 
the statement of operations.
Financial instruments
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short periods to maturity. Bank loans are 
carried at current value, as discussed in notes 11 and 12.

Stock-based compensation
Effective January 1, 2004, the company adopted the new requirements of the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants (CICA) Standard 3870, which requires an expense to be recognized in the financial statements for 
all forms of employee stock-based compensation. Previously, the company did not record any compensation 
cost on the granting of stock options to employees and directors as the exercise price was equal to or greater 
than the market price at the date of the grants.
Accordingly, the opening deficit for 2004 was restated on a retroactive basis to show the effect of compensation 
expense associated with stock option grants to employees and directors from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 
2003, which amounted to $1,405,433, and an increase of $94,600 to share capital and $1,310,833 to stock

Land use rights refer to the ability of the company to operate a fertilizer and phosphoric acid facility on the 
YSC property for a period of 50 years. These land use rights are provided by the municipal government and are 
being amortized over the initial 30-year term of YSC’s business license as this is currently believed to 
approximate the estimated useful life.

In 1996, the company entered into an agreement with YPCC for the exclusive right to develop the Yichang 
phosphate deposit, which is located in Hubei province in China. The company can earn a 90% interest in the 
property by taking the property to production. The Chinese government will earn a 10% interest by contributing 
land and the mineral rights.
In 1999, the company completed the preliminary feasibility study report conducted jointly by the Northern 
China Chemical Mine Planning and Design Institute and China Wuhan Chemical Engineering Corp. Final 
project approval was also received from the Chinese government. In November 2000, a feasibility study and an 
environmental impact assessment study were completed. During 2001, the China Environment Protection 
Bureau approved the environmental study of the Yichang project. In April 2002, a feasibility study was updated 
by Jacobs Engineering Corporation.
In early 2002, the company commenced its application for a mining permit through YPCC. In 2003, the 
company and YPCC formed a Joint Venture Company, YMC, to undertake the development of the project. 
Since inception, all activities at YMC have been centered on the mining license transfer, with costs incurred in 
engineering studies, coordination of government relations and public relations activities. All YMC costs have 
been classified as mining exploration costs and capitalized to mineral properties.
During 2003, $760,490 of deferred mineral property expenditures was written off. The amount related to the 
Jacobs Engineering Corporation study on the development of a plant, as the construction of the facility will no 
longer be required due to the purchase of the existing fertilizer facility which was completed in 2004.

9  Other assets
Included in Other Assets, is an amount of $396,364 related to due diligence and legal opinions costs in 
connection with the proposed Tianren acquisition. In June 2005, the company signed a binding agreement to 
acquire the fertilizer related businesses of Hebei Tianren Chemical Corporation, a Chinese holding company 
and to merge the management teams and assets of both companies. Commercial and legal due diligence was 
completed late in the fourth quarter. The company continues at the negotiation stage with Hebei Tianren and is 
working with the Chinese authorities on the approval processes. If the acquisition is closed, these costs will be 
allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the negotiation indicates the transaction 
will most likely not be closed, the company will expense all the expenditures related to the proposed acquisition 
at that time.
10  Acquisition of YSC
On April 20, 2004, the company formed YSC, a 72.18% controlled Joint Venture Company. The remaining 
27.82% of YSC is held by YPCC and Yidu Yuanfeng Chemical Industrial Company Limited (Yuanfeng). YSC 
owns the 100,000 tpa fertilizer facility near the City of Yidu, Hubei Province. The company made a 
contribution of $3,351,934 (US$2.5 million) to YSC to acquire its interest. These funds were applied to finance 
the construction of a 60,000 tpa phosphoric acid plant, which was completed and commissioned in the first 
quarter of 2005.
The acquisition of the fertilizer facility and operations has been accounted for as an acquisition of a business 
using the purchase method and results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. The 
following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the fair values of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed:

Following the formation of YSC and the acquisition of the fertilizer operations, the company discovered that 
YSC was liable for a loan facility of RMB7,400,000 ($1,069,302) from the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), 
the funds of which were advanced directly to YPCC prior to the date of acquisition. The company understands 
that the proceeds of this loan were used in YPCC's business and YSC has received no benefits from this loan. 
YPCC has guaranteed repayment of this loan to the company and the bank and the company is advised that 
YPCC has been paying the related interest to the bank. Prior to December 31, 2004, YPCC repaid 
RMB500,000 of the loan balance, accordingly at December 31, 2005, RMB6,900,000 ($997,052) was 
outstanding on this facility. The company has recorded an amount receivable from YPCC of RMB6,900,000 
($997,052) at December 31, 2005, being the amount due from YPCC required for the repayment of the 
remaining outstanding loan balance.
YSC has also received a working capital loan from YPCC of RMB4,475,375 ($646,693) and YPCC has 
requested repayment of this loan. YSC has received a written authorization for YPCC to apply this amount to 
offset the amount receivable from YPCC should YPCC fail to repay the bank loan and YSC is required to make 
payment of the loan directly to the bank. Accordingly, the company has accounted for the amount receivable 
from YPCC and the amount payable to YPCC on a net basis.
The company believes the net exposure of RMB2,424,625 ($350,359) to be fully recoverable from YPCC, 
however, the ultimate collection of this amount remains uncertain and it is possible that the amount may not be 
fully recoverable.
The company is still in discussion with YPCC and the ABC regarding the full repayment of the bank loan, 
which came due in December 2004 (note 12).
The company also owes the third YSC Joint Venture partner Yuanfeng $119,358 due to additional land use 
right acquisition from Yuanfeng. The amount owed to Yuanfeng was $44,290 in 2004.

benefit of YPCC. This loan was not paid in full as of the end of 2005, because YSC, YPCC and the ABC were 
still in discussions on repaying the loan in full. ABC has verbally advised the company that no penalty will be 
charged on the loan.
The company has held discussions with ICBC bank on the two loans due in late October and early November. 
The company and the bank are in discussion on a renewal agreement or a schedule to repay the bank loans over 
a period of next 12 months.

In the year ended December 31, 2003, the company elected not to follow the fair value method of 
accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors. Accordingly, no compensation expense is 
recorded on the grant of share options to employees and directors where the exercise price is equal to the 
market price at the date of grant. In accordance with the new accounting policy as stated in note 2, the 
opening deficit was restated on a retroactive basis to show the effect of compensation expense associated 
with stock option grants to employees and directors from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003, which 
amounted to $1,405,433, and an increase of $94,600 to share capital and $1,310,833 to stock options.

The company’s controlled Joint Venture Company YSC, has a future income tax liability associated with its 
capital assets and land use right. It has a potential future income tax asset related to its tax losses, inventory and 
accounts receivable. The potential future income tax asset related to its tax losses more than offset its future 
income tax liability associated with its capital assets. Given the losses incurred by YSC and its history, 
management has determined that it would not be appropriate to recognize a net future income tax asset. As a 
Joint Venture Company with foreign parties, YSC has a tax exemption during its first two profitable years and 
a 50% tax exemption in the third year. What effect this will have on the future taxes payable is unknown at this 
time since it its dependant on what the profit will be in those reduced tax years.

Under U.S. GAAP, the sale of flow-through shares resulted in a deferred credit being recognized for the 
excess of the purchase price paid by investors over the fair value of common shares without the 
flow-through feature. The fair value of the shares was recorded as equity. When the tax deductibility of the 
qualifying expenditures is renounced, a temporary difference arises. A deferred tax liability was 
established in the amount of the tax benefit foregone, and tax expense was recorded for the difference 
between the deferred tax liability and the premium received upon issuance of the flow-through shares. 
This deferred tax liability reversed due to loss carry-forwards available.
c)  Accounting for stock-based compensation
Effective January 1, 2004 for Canadian GAAP, the company adopted CICA 3870, Stock-based 
Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments which requires an expense to be recognized in the 
financial statements for all forms of employee stock-based compensation. Adoption of CICA 3870 was 
applied retroactively, without restatement, as permitted by the standard. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the 
company adopted FAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-based Compensation Transition and Disclosure”. 
FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method 
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. For U.S. GAAP, effective January 1, 2004, the 
company applied the modified prospective method of adoption included in FAS 148 which recognizes 
stock-based employee compensation for 2004 as if the fair value based accounting method in this 
statement had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years 
beginning after December 14, 1994. Since all stock options granted from that date to January 1, 2004 
vested immediately, application of the modified prospective method for U.S. GAAP purposes in 2004 did 
not have any additional impact on the stock-based compensation charge for 2004 or on total shareholders’ 
equity under U.S. GAAP.

(expressed in Canadian dollars)
d)  Mineral property expenditures
Mineral property expenditures are accounted for in accordance with Canadian GAAP as disclosed in 
note 2. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the company expenses exploration or property maintenance expenditures 
relating to mineral properties as they are incurred. When proven and probable reserves are indicated by a 
bankable feasibility study for a property, subsequent development costs of the property are capitalized. 
The capitalized costs of such properties would then be measured periodically to ensure that the carrying 
value can be recovered on an undiscounted cash flow basis. If the carrying value cannot be recovered on 
this basis, the mineral properties would be written down to fair value using a discounted cash flow basis.
e)  Capitalization of interest
Under U.S. GAAP, capitalization of interest is calculated for certain qualifying assets that require a period 
of time to get them ready for their intended use. Under Canadian GAAP, capitalization of interest is 
permitted, but not required. The company’s interest expense related to construction in progress was 
$69,052 and $49,823 respectively in 2005 and 2004, which has been expensed for Canadian GAAP 
purposes.
f)  Comprehensive income
Under US GAAP, comprehensive income is recognized and measured in accordance with FASB 
Statement No. 130 “Reporting Comprehensive Income”. Comprehensive income includes all changes in 
equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive 
income includes two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive 
income includes amounts that are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net 
income as these transactions or events were attributable to changes from non-owner sources. These items 
include minimum pension liability adjustments, holding gains and losses on certain investments, gains and 
losses on certain derivative instruments and foreign currency gains and losses related to self-sustaining 
foreign operations (cumulative translation adjustment). A standard for comprehensive income and other 
comprehensive income is not yet effective under Canadian GAAP.
g)
Issue of escrow shares
U.S. GAAP requires that compensation expense be recorded for the excess of the quoted market price over 
the price granted to employees and directors under escrow share agreements that are based on more than 
mere passage of time and require performance. The compensation expense was recorded under US GAAP 
when the shares became eligible for release. Under Canadian GAAP, no compensation expense was 
recorded for these escrow share agreements.

h)  Supplemental cash flow information
Under U.S. GAAP, the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2005, 2004 and 2003 would not show 
exploration expenditures under investing activities. These balances of $564,637, $371,293 and $53,951, 
respectively, would instead be included in cash flow from operating activities. This would result in cash 
flow from operating activities for 2005, 2004 and 2003 of ($3,446,678), ($647,513) and ($634,962), 
respectively.
i)  Marketable securities
For U.S. GAAP purposes, unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are included in 
comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity, except where the decline in value is 
other than temporary in which case Canadian and U.S. GAAP are the same.
j)
Issue of units
Under U.S. GAAP, the proceeds on the sale of units comprising shares and warrants are allocated to each 
instrument on a pro rata basis using the total fair value to determine the pro rata allocation.
k)  Cash flow from operating activities
Under U.S. GAAP, cash flow from operating activities must be presented as the amount calculated after 
taking into effect the changes in non-cash working capital items. The disclosure of a subtotal referring to 
the amount of cash flow from operating activities before changes to working capital items is not permitted.
l)  Recent accounting pronouncements
Accounting standards that the company expects to adopt subsequent to December 31, 2005 on a 
prospective basis when applicable include the following:
•
Financial instruments-recognition and measurement, hedges, and comprehensive income
In January 2005, the CICA issued three new standards: “Financial instruments-recognition and 
measurement, hedges, and comprehensive income.” The main consequences of implementing 
standards are described below. The new standards will be effective for interim and annual financial 
statement commencing in 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted. Most significantly for the company, the 
new standards will require presentation of a separate statement of comprehensive income. Investment 
in marketable securities will be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Changes in 
the fair value of marketable securities will be recorded in income and changes in the fair value of 
investments reported in comprehensive income. The company is undertaking analysis of the impact of 
the new standards.

•  Deferred stripping costs
In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 04-06 – Accounting for Post-Production 
Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry. The EITF requires that stripping costs incurred during the 
production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the 
inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The company has not yet 
reached the production phase of the YMC properties and as such, has no inventory in which to 
include any stripping costs. Once the company goes into production, it will account for stripping costs 
as per EITF 04-06 for U.S. GAAP purposes. However, this may result in GAAP differences based on 
the proposed Canadian EIC D56 - Accounting for Deferred Stripping costs in the mining industry.
•  Accounting for changes and error corrections
During June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections. 
The new standard requires that entities which make a voluntary change in accounting principle apply 
that change retroactively to prior period financial statements, unless this would be impracticable. For 
changes in methods of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived assets, the change must 
be accounted for prospectively, as a change in estimate. SFAS No. 154 is effective for the company’s 
2006 financial statements.
18  Financial instruments and concentration of risk
Fair values
The company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts 
receivable, customer deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, other payable, bank loans, and amount 
due from YPCC. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values.
Credit risk
The company maintains a substantial portion of its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions 
in Canada and China. Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk 
are primarily receivables. Management believes that any risk of loss is reduced due to the financial strength of 
the company’s major customers.
Foreign currency risk
A substantial portion of the company’s business is carried out in Chinese Renminbi, and the company 
maintains Renminbi denominated bank accounts. The company also has short-term investments in US dollars. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and PRC Renminbi and US dollar could have a 
material effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company.
