</p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people carried out an official visit to Bolivia, at the invitation of the Government, 
from 25 November to 7 December 2007, in order to examine the situation with regard to the 
human rights of indigenous peoples in the country. This preliminary note provides initial 
information on the visit of the Special Rapporteur. A full report of the mission, including the 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations to the Government and other relevant actors, will be submitted 
subsequently to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur was established in 2001 and renewed by the 
Council in September 2007. A key aspect of his work is the periodic visits to countries at the 
invitation of the Governments concerned. The reports on these visits describe the general 
situation with regard to indigenous rights and contain a number of recommendations to 
Governments and other actors with a view to improving the situation. Mr. Stavenhagen&#8217;s visit to 
Bolivia is his eleventh visit as Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. During his mission, Mr. Stavenhagen visited the departments of La Paz, Potos&#237;, Oruro, 
Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Beni, where he held information meetings with 
indigenous and human rights organizations to gain an understanding of the specific situation of 
different communities. Among others, he met with representatives of the Aymara and Quechua 
nations and the Ayoreo, Chiquitano, Guaran&#237;, Guarayo, Moje&#241;o, Movima, Tacana, Trinitario, 
Uru, Yuki and Yuracare peoples. The Special Rapporteur also met with several ministers and 
other officials of the national Government, with prefectural and municipal authorities, members 
of the Constituent Assembly and the legislature, and the Ombudsman. He also met twice with 
President Evo Morales Ayma. 
</p>
<p>4. Bolivia is a multi-ethnic country. In 2005 an indigenous president was elected for the first 
time, and announced his intention of introducing sweeping changes in the country&#8217;s social and 
economic policy aimed at benefiting the indigenous peoples and remedying the historic 
injustices perpetrated against them. President Morales also appointed several indigenous 
ministers and vice-ministers to his Cabinet. One of the first decisions of his Government was to 
dismantle the Ministry of Indigenous Affairs and Native Peoples, which has been replaced by a 
cross-cutting approach led by the Ministry of the Presidency. 
</p>
<p>5. The Government has taken steps to incorporate in domestic law the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted by the General Assembly in September 
this year. The Political Constitution of the State recently approved for the most part by the 
Constituent Assembly contains numerous provisions on the collective rights of indigenous 
peoples, including the concept of indigenous autonomy. 
</p>
<p>6. One of the main issues that drew the attention of the Special Rapporteur during his visit is 
the serious persistence of racism and discrimination against indigenous people, and especially 
against indigenous women. This is still manifested in the behaviour of public officials at the 
national and subnational levels and in the attitudes of political parties and pressure groups, which 
sometimes incite violence against persons based on their indigenous status. Expressions of 
anti-indigenous racism frequently occur in some media, which often sacrifice the principles of 
objectivity and impartiality for the sake of political interests. It is a matter of concern that the 
current political conflict in Bolivia has given rise to a resurgence in manifestations of racism 
more suited to a colonial society than a modern democratic State. </p>

<p>7. Denial of the right to lands and territories, as recognized by the Declaration, is the main 
focus of concern for indigenous communities in Bolivia, and the principal source of violation of 
their rights. While some progress has been made in land reform and the granting of title under 
the Act on the National Agrarian Reform Institute and community renewal of agrarian reform, 
there are still many obstacles in the way of this process, which is a source of frustration for the 
communities. In the highlands, where smallholdings and extremely small plots (known as 
&#8220;<i>surcofundios</i>&#8221;) are prevalent, many indigenous communities are demanding a reconstitution of 
their ancestral territories. In the Eastern region (<i>Oriente</i>) and the Bolivian Amazon, land has 
been consolidated, in many cases illegally, into very large estates (&#8220;<i>latifundios</i>&#8221;), giving rise to 
numerous conflicts with the indigenous people who have been affected and, in some cases, 
displaced, and serious violations of their human rights have been documented. 
</p>
<p>8. A matter of special concern is the bondage in which Guaran&#237; communities are still living in 
three departments of Bolivia as a result of historical dispossession of their territories; the Special 
Rapporteur was able to observe this personally. Also of concern is the situation of high-risk 
vulnerable communities such as the Yuki people in the tropical lowlands of Cochabamba and the 
Ayoreo in the department of Santa Cruz. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur was able to examine several cases of environmental pollution 
caused by extractive industries, with highly detrimental effects on the health and habitat of 
adjoining communities. This is the case of mining activities in the departments of Oruro and 
Potos&#237;, as well as hydrocarbon extraction in other areas. 
</p>
<p>10. The mobilization of indigenous peoples in recent years has led to substantial progress in 
recognition of their rights and their role in the national political process. The many documented 
instances of assault and attacks on indigenous leaders and human rights defenders, with the 
support of economic actors and local authorities, are a matter of concern, and reflect the 
difficulties in the way of building a pluralistic democratic society in the country. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur will prepare a full report of his mission for subsequent 
presentation to the Human Rights Council. This report will also include his final 
recommendations on the legal, administrative and other measures that can contribute to 
improving the situation in regard to the rights of indigenous peoples in Bolivia.
