1.0  SUMMARY   (Item 3)
Introduction
InnovExplo  inc.  –  Consulting  Firm  (InnovExplo)  was  retained  by  Mark  Billings,  President  and 
CEO of Orex Exploration inc. (Orex), and by Jean Lafleur, P.Geo., Senior Technical advisor to 
Orex, to prepare and independent Technical Report on the Goldboro property, in Nova Scotia. 
The purpose of this report is to publish results of a new Mineral Resource Estimate completed 
along a 1.5-km strike length from the West Ramp Area to East Gold Brook on the Goldboro gold 
property.
This  Technical  Report  conforms  to  R-43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects. 
InnovExplo recently visited the property on April 23rd, 2009 and has reviewed access, drill sites, 
surface  infrastructures  and  some  core  intervals  from  the  2008  drilling  program.  The  authors: 
Donald  Gervais,  P.Geo.  (OGQ  #520);  Alain  Carrier,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo.  (OGQ  #281);  and  Karine 
Brousseau,  Eng.,  B.Sc.,  (OIQ  #121871)  are  Qualified  and  Independent  people  as  defined  by 
Regulation 43-101.
InnovExplo has conducted a review and appraisal of the information used in the preparation of 
the present report and is of the opinion that the conclusions and recommendations herein are 
valid and appropriate considering the status of the project. The authors have fully researched 
and documented the conclusions and recommendations submitted in this report.
Property description and location 
The  Goldboro  property  lies  on  the  eastern  shore  of  Nova  Scotia,  Canada,  along  the  Atlantic 
Ocean.  It is located 175 kilometres northeast of Halifax and approximately 1.6 kilometres north 
of the village of Goldboro on the eastern shore of Isaac’s Harbour, in Guysborough County. The 
central  point  of  the  property  is  approximately  defined  by  latitude  45° 10' 00” N  and  longitude 
61° 40' 00” W and is approximately 70 metres above sea level.
The Goldboro property consists of 37 contiguous claims covering a total area of 584 hectares 
held  under  Exploration  Licence  No.  05888.  The  surface  rights  belong  to  various  private 
landowners  and  the  Nova  Scotia  Department  of  Lands  and  Forests.  Orex  owns  100%  of  the 
mining  rights  since  1988  when  they  acquired  them  from  Onitap  Resources.  Ownership  of  the 
Goldboro property is not subject to any lien, mortgage, royalty or other right in favour of third 
parties. At the time of the report, the Goldboro Exploration Licence (No. 05888) is in pending 
status for an extension period until a technical assessment report is submitted (report submittal 
in  process;  pers.  comm.,  W.  Shaw,  2009).  Orex  has  enough  work  credits  to  maintain  the 
property for more than 260 years.
History
Exploration work in the area dates back to 1861 when gold was discovered in quartz veins in the 
Isaac’s Harbour anticline. The property host six (6) historic shafts (1 shaft at Dolliver Mountain, 2 
shafts  at  West  Goldbrook,  1  shaft  at  Boston-Richardson,  and  2  shafts  at  East  Goldbrook).  In 
1988, the Boston-Richardson shaft was rehabilitated and an access decline and two levels were 
developed. These underground accesses are currently flooded.
In 1892, Howard Richardson was the first to note gold occurrences in the slate belt (slate and 
quartz) that would later bear his name. In 1893, the Richardson Gold mine went into operation in 
1896  and  ended  in  1908.  In  the  1909-1910  period,  the  New  England  Mining  Company  has
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report

extracted  additional  ore.  The  total  gold  recovery  for  the  Boston-Richardson  mine  was  54,871 
ounces (1,707 kg) from 414,887 short tons of ore (376,303 t) between 1893 and 1910, making 
an average recovered grade of 4.53 g/t and head grade of 6.8 g/t, and average mill recoveries of 
67% (Roy, 1998).
From 1901 to 1905, stopping was done mainly from two levels at the Dolliver Mountain mine and 
205 ounces (6,376 g) of gold were recovered from 8,059 short tons of ore (7,310 t). In the 1907-
1908 and 1931-1934 periods, underground exploration programs were done the East Goldbrook 
exploration shaft. In the periods from 1909-1910 and 1929-1931, underground exploration and 
metallurgical tests were done from the West Goldbrook exploration shafts.
After almost 50 years of inactivity, exploration activities on the property have starts again in the 
eighties  with  drilling  programs,  geophysics  and  underground  exploration  program  at  Boston-
Richardson mine in 1988. Orex is involved in the property since 1988. No work was performed at 
Goldboro  from  1996  to  early  2004.  Since  2004,  exploration  works,  drilling  programs  and 
technical studies were completed by the issuer.
Geological setting and mineralization
The property is located within the Meguma Supergroup of the eastern Canada Appalachian Belt. 
The property is entirely underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Goldenville Group, which consist 
of altered greywacke, sandstone (arenite), and slate. The stratigraphic sedimentary succession 
of the Goldboro area is affected by the Upper Seal Harbour anticline. This anticline is an upright, 
ENE-trending tight fold with a 10° to 30° plunge to the east. In the apex of the anticline, the slate 
units are thicker than other sedimentary rock types.
The Goldboro mineralization has been previously referred to as a “saddle reef” lode-gold deposit 
type.  In  Nova  Scotia,  the  Boston-Richardson  mine  (Upper  Seal  Harbour  district)  is  a  classic 
example of a “saddle reef” deposit. The gold mineralization at Goldboro occurs in association 
with  and  within  a  quartz  vein  swarm  located  in  the  hinges  of  regional  anticlines, principally  in 
black shale-argillite wall rocks. As such, Goldboro is not a classic “saddle reef” lode gold deposit 
type. The fine-grained folded sedimentary units have a constant thickness in the limb but not in 
the hinge of the fold, suggesting flexural-slip as the folding mechanism. Many key features within 
the  gold  deposits  of  the  Upper  Seal  Harbour  district  show  that  the  folding  itself  should  be 
considered as the gold mineralizing process.
Gold mineralization at Goldboro occurs in quartz veins and disseminated sulphides in the wall 
rock.  The  mineralized  wall  rock  mostly,  but  not  exclusively,  consists  of  shale-argillite  (slate). 
Locally, the greywacke and arenite are cut by quartz veins and are mineralized. The veins are 
characterized by quartz, sulphide (auriferous arsenopyrite) and native gold (visible gold flakes 
have  historically  been  observed  in  several  slate  belts).  Wall  rocks  generally  contain  more 
sulphides than the veins, in the form of arsenopyrite selvedges.
Interpretation and conclusions
The Goldboro gold project of Orex is an advanced stage exploration project hosting a significant 
Mineral  Resource.  The  project  is  also  characterized  by  additional  exploration  potential. 
Exploration  drilling  completed  by  Orex  at  Goldboro  in  2008  has  continued  to  upgrade  the 
property and enhance the gold potential. InnovExplo recommends additional work to confirm and 
augment the economic potential of the project.
Results  of  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (cut-off  grade  of  1.50  g/t  Au)  are  as  follows: 
270,000  tonnes  grading  4.99  g/t  Au  (43,300  ounces)  within  the  Measured  category;
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report

www.innovexplo.com
2,441,000  tonnes  at  5.99  g/t  Au  (353,900  ounces)  within  the  Indicated  category;  and 
3,438,000  tonnes  grading  3.67  g/t  Au  (405,900  ounces)  within  the  Inferred  category.  The 
Measured and Indicated Resource represents a total of 2,711,000 tonnes grading 4.56 g/t Au
(397,200  ounces).  The  resource  estimate  published  in  this  technical  report  was  compiled  by 
Donald Gervais, P.Geo. (OGQ #520), and Alain Carrier, M.Sc., P.Geo. (OGQ #281).
Past  metallurgical  test  work  demonstrated  that  bulk  metallurgical  grade  determinations  of 
composite  drill  core  samples  are  more  accurate  than  determinations  made  by  conventional 
assaying of drill core samples. For the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, only resources defined 
from  bulk  metallurgical  grade  have  been  classified  as  Measured.  The  area  of  Measured 
Resources is confined to the ramp area where continuity has been confirmed by underground 
development.  A  significant  portion  of  the  Indicated  Resources  within  the  ramp  area  could  be 
converted to Measured Resources simply by completing additional drilling to produce composite 
samples for metallurgical grade determinations within the respective mineralized zones.
Most of the Indicated Resources are located in the proximal extensions of the ramp area (within 
a few hundred meters) where geological continuity of the mineralized zones area is generally 
well enough established to categorize all the resources as Indicated. One other criterion used to 
classify the resource as Indicated was the presence of at least 3 or 4 holes in the same area 
with  consistent  grade.  For  isolated  holes  with  or  without  grade,  resources  inside  the  search 
ellipse have been classified as Inferred no matter of the distance from the hole.
The  geological  continuity  and  the  grades  are  generally  well  defined  by  the  321  drill  holes, 
including 112 underground holes in closely spaced section ring drilled patterns, 175 metres of 
underground drifting along strike (70 metres below surface), and 17 bulk composite metallurgical 
test samples within the mineralized zone. On the other hand, all the resources in the western 
portion  of  the  deposit  (west  of  section  8600E)  have  been  classified  as  Inferred  because  the 
geological  continuity  of  the  mineralized  zones  in  this  area  is  generally  not  well  enough 
established to categorize resources as Indicated. An even more important reason, however, is 
the presence of a fault trending N75E on section 8600E, displacing the western portion over an 
unknown distance.
The  Goldboro  mineralization  was  modeled  under  current  CIM  resource  definitions  and  in 
accordance  with  accepted  industry  practices.  Regulation  43-101  reporting  standards  and 
formats  were  followed  in  this  document  in  order  to  report  the  mineral  resources  in  a  fully 
compliant manner.
The  Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  as  reported  have  demonstrable  mineralized  shape, 
continuity  and  grade,  which  has  been  well  established  over  a  1,500-metre  strike  length  from 
section 8100E to 9600E and to a vertical depth of 500 metres below surface.
Many  historical  holes  (97  completed  pre-2004)  were  improperly  sampled,  resulting  in  some 
blank areas where no samples appear. Sampling at the time was done using visual guides, with 
shale  and  quartz  veins  most  commonly  selected  for  assaying.  Because  the  recent  modeling 
includes other types of coarser material, like arenite or greywacke, it includes some previously 
unsampled areas. Assuming a grade of zero for any areas with missing samples will, of course, 
affect the estimated number of ounces of gold. The recent drilling programs (2004 to 2008) are 
therefore important in this regard as they adequately sample the mineralized zones (i.e., no gap 
in the mineralized envelop). As for the remaining unsampled areas, InnovExplo is of the opinion 
that they may carry some gold, although most likely at a lower grade.

Goldboro Geological Model
The  InnovExplo  geological  model  used  for  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  based  on:  (i) 
lithologies  (mainly  shale,  but  locally  including  coarser  grained  material  such  as  arenite  and 
greywacke);  (ii)  the  occurrence  of  veins  and  veinlets;  (iii)  gold  grades;  and  (iv)  some  findings 
arising from historical mining work (e.g., the fold shape of the Boston-Richardson stope). The 
Goldboro mineralized system was interpreted as a series of belts of various shapes, with some 
belts joined together due to proximity criteria and/or a minimum mining width consideration. The 
limbs of the various belts dip steeply towards the north and south, and generally do not exceed 
the  minimum  mining  width.  The  limbs  form  narrower  zones  appear  to  be  less  mineralized. 
Locally,  individual  zones  or  belts  significantly  increase  in  size  in  the  fold  hinges.  InnovExplo 
believes  that  hinges  were  the  site  of  locally  intense  fracturing  (dilatational  zones)  and  vein 
stockworks.  In  the  hinges,  the  belts  contain  various  rock  types,  and  as  a  consequence,  their 
grades and the presence of veining become more important features in the interpretations.
Two  different  approaches  to  geological  modeling  can  be  used  for  resource  estimation  at 
Goldboro:  the  mineralized  zones  can  be  interpreted  as  either:  (i)  narrower  and  higher  grade 
folded belts (about sixteen (16) belts); or (ii) they can be grouped into larger structural domains 
(about four (4) domains). For the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo opted for the first 
approach (e.g., individual belts rather than domains).
In  both  approaches,  the  higher  grade  material  is  in  similar  locations—fold  hinges  where 
maximum dilation seems to have occurred—although differences can occur in the distribution of 
lower grade material. Some tests have been completed using the two different approaches, and 
both models gave similar totals for contained ounces.
The  use  of  larger  domains  directly  increases  the  number  of  unsampled  intervals  within  the 
estimated zones. In the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo has assigned a value of 0 
g/t  Au  to  unsampled  intervals.  More  drilling  is  needed  to  confirm  whether  these  unsampled 
intervals contain any gold.
Goldboro Property Additional Potential
The current geological model is constrained between section 8050mE and section 9600mE over 
a strike length of 1,550 metres, and extends from surface to a maximum depth of 520 metres. 
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the resource blocks are located within the first 200 metres of the 
surface.  The  Dolliver  Mountain  area  (historical  shaft),  where  intense stockworking  occurs  in  a 
fold hinge, was not included in this Mineral Resource Estimate.
InnovExplo states that the probabilities of adding new resources to the existing mineral inventory 
are excellent, particularly towards the Dolliver Mountain area where no modern exploration has 
been  done.  InnovExplo  recommends  drilling  the  area  between  Goldboro  and  the  Dolliver 
Mountain  area,  which  opens  up  a  potential  segment  measuring  1,500  metres  in  strike  length. 
Limited drilling at depth in the main Goldboro area also shows some additional potential.
Recommendations
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the character of the Goldboro property is of sufficient merit to 
justify  the  recommended  program.  The  recommended  work  program  is  divided  into  two  (2) 
phases. Expenditures for the Phase I work program are estimated at $2,141,875. The accurate 
cost for the Phase II work program (permitting, 10,000-tonne bulk sample, metallurgical testing) 
would be established during a scoping study, which would need to be completed during Phase I. 
Order-of-magnitude  expenditures  for  the  Phase  II  work  program  will  be  in  the  range  of
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
8
www.innovexplo.com
$3,530,500 to $4,853,000. The design of the second phase of the program is conditional on the 
success of the first phase.
Phase I – Drilling Program, Updated Mineral Resource Estimate and Scoping Study
Phase 1a) Diamond drilling program – Segment from West Goldbrook to Dolliver Mountain
Significant Inferred Resources could potentially be added by drilling from section 8100E (that is, 
from the fault zone) to a distance of 1,500metresto the west. This area has not been covered by 
modern exploration and no historical drilling has been recorded. This area includes 1 kilometre 
along  the  strike  of  the  Goldboro  structure  from  West  Goldbrook  to  Dolliver  Mountain  and  an 
additional 500 metres west of Dolliver Mountain. A drilling program of 8,750 metres in ±35 drill 
holes  (Phase  2D  and  2E  of  Orex)  is  recommended  along  the  remaining  segment  from  West 
Goldbrook to Dolliver Mountain.
Phase 1b) Diamond drilling program – Testing the grade of unsampled intervals from historical 
drill holes
In  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  InnovExplo  considered  unsampled  intervals  from 
historical  drill  holes  to  have  grades  of  0  g/t  Au.  Drilling  is  needed  to  confirm  whether  these 
unsampled intervals contain any gold. A 2,500-metre infill drilling program is recommended to 
confirm gold grades where intervals of 0 g/t Au were assigned to 97 historical drill holes in the 
2009 Mineral Resource Estimate.
Phase 1c) Updated Mineral Resource Estimate
The 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate should be updated at this point using the results obtained 
from  the  drilling  programs  (Dolliver  Mountain–West  Goldbrook  segment  and  results  for 
unsampled  intervals).  InnovExplo  recommends  that  such  a  study  be  produced  in  accordance 
with  Regulation  43-101  criteria  and  the  definitions  and  standards  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.
Phase 1d) Scoping Study
InnovExplo recommends completing the scoping of possible mining scenarios and the economic 
viability of the identified Mineral Resources at Goldboro. The scoping study should also establish 
the costs associated with permitting, the removal of a 10,000-tonne bulk sample, and completion 
of metallurgical testing. For the bulk sample program, different scenarios should be considered 
for metallurgical testing: pilot mill on site which requires a local tailing pond or transportation to 
other facilities and custom milling.
At  this  stage,  the  scoping  study  should  include  all  resource  categories  (including  Inferred)  to 
establish: 1) the economic potential of the project; and 2) the accurate cost for a bulk sample 
program.
Phase II – Permitting, bulk sampling program and metallurgical testing
Phase 2a) Surface muck pile inventory and sampling
InnovExplo  recommends  completing  an  inventory  and  sampling  of  the  surface  muck  piles  at 
Goldboro in order to document their volume, tonnage and grade. Research has to be performed
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
9
www.innovexplo.com
in historic records in order to track their sources from the underground developments. If results 
of the inventory are satisfactory, these muck piles should also be considered for metallurgical 
testing.
Phase 2b) Permitting and engineering studies
At  this  stage  of  exploration,  InnovExplo  recommends  surveying  the  surface  infrastructure  and 
completing environmental baseline studies and engineering studies, all of which are required for 
permitting.
Phase 2c) Bulk sample program and metallurgical testing
Upon completion of the permitting process, a bulk sample should be extracted from one of the 
most representative areas of the Goldboro deposit. The bulk sample should be at least 10,000 
tonnes  for  pilot  mill  and  metallurgical  testing.  The  cost  of  the  bulk  sampling  program  and  a 
detailed  plan  should  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  scoping  study  of  Phase  1.  Bulk  sample 
material should be sent for metallurgical testing to obtain the necessary parameters for a pre-
feasibility study.
Other recommendations 
The  Goldboro  property  is  characterized  by  additional  exploration  potential  that  can  also  be 
tested by drilling. Based on the geological and grade continuities of gold mineralization in the 
ramp area, InnovExplo is of the opinion that there is excellent potential to convert a significant 
portion of the Indicated Resources to Measured Resources. Metallurgical grade determinations 
of composite samples from the respective mineralized zones will be required for conversion from 
the Indicated to Measured category.

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE (Item 4)
InnovExplo inc. (“InnovExplo”) was retained in March 2009 by Mark Billings, President and CEO 
of Orex Exploration Inc. (“Orex” or “the issuer”), and by Jean Lafleur, M.Sc., P.Geo., and Senior 
Technical  Advisor  to  Orex,  to  complete  a  Technical  Report  (“the  report”)  and  an  independent 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  in  compliance  with Regulation 43-101  and  Form  43-101F1  for  the 
Goldboro Property (“the property”) in Nova Scotia, Canada. The report is addressed to Orex, a 
junior Canadian mineral exploration company. Orex shares trade on the TSX Venture Exchange 
under the symbol "OX" and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol "O5D". Orex has 
a 100% interest in the property. InnovExplo is an independent mining and exploration consulting 
firm based in Val-d’Or (Quebec, Canada).
The  purpose  of  the  current  report  is  to  provide  an  independent  Technical  Report  and  a  new 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  for  gold  mineralization  on  the  Goldboro  property  along  a  1.5-
kilometre strike length from the West Ramp area to East Goldbrook.
The authors—Donald Gervais, P.Geo. (OGQ #520); Alain Carrier, M.Sc., P.Geo. (OGQ #281); 
and Karine Brousseau, Eng., B.Sc., (OIQ #121871)—are Qualified and Independent persons as 
defined  by  Regulation  43-101.  The  2009  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  completed  and  the 
report  written  after  reviewing  all  available  data  from  the  2008  drilling  program  and  previous 
surveys,  and  all  other  information  judged  relevant,  suitable  and  reliable.  Donald  Gervais  was 
responsible  for  the  Gems  3D  modelling,  for  establishing  key  criteria,  and  for  completing  the 
resource estimation (Item 17). Karine Brousseau wrote most of the rest of the report, and Alain 
Carrier supervised the overall mandate (report and estimate). Technical support was provided by 
Marcel Naud, and computer editing by Thérèse Vincent, both of InnovExplo. Venetia Bodycomb 
of Vee Geoservices provided the linguistic editing.
On Thursday April 23, 2009, Alain Carrier and Donald Gervais of InnovExplo visited the property 
with Orex representatives Mr. Billings and Mr. Lafleur. Other representatives of Orex were met at 
the  core  facilities  in  Goldboro,  Nova  Scotia.  These  included  William  Shaw  (geologist  and 
manager of W.G. Shaw & Associates of Antigonish, Nova Scotia), Jonathan Taylor (geologist) 
and  Walter  Smith  (field  assistant).  The  site  visit  provided  InnovExplo  with  an  opportunity  to 
review  property  access,  drill  sites,  surface  infrastructure,  and  core  intervals  from  four  (4)  drill 
holes of the 2008 drilling program (holes BR-08-17, BR-08-27. BR-08-33 and BR-08-37).
In  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia,  discussions  with  David  Hatchette  (previous  project  geologist  and 
currently  a  director  of  Orex)  focused  on  the  geological  setting  of  Goldboro’s  mineralization. 
During  the  mandate  and  resource  estimation  process,  other  issues  (geological  modeling, 
QA/QC,  geostatistical analysis)  were  also  discussed  with  Orex  consultants  (Mr.  Alex  Horvath, 
P.Eng., from A.S. Horvath Engineering Inc. of Ottawa, Ontario, acting as Orex project manager; 
and Mr. Jean Lafleur, P.Geo., acting as Orex’s Senior Technical Advisor).
InnovExplo has conducted a review and appraisal of the information used in the preparation of 
the present report and is of the opinion that the conclusions and recommendations herein are 
valid and appropriate considering the status of the project. The authors have fully researched 
and documented the conclusions and recommendations submitted in this report.

4.0  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION   (Item 6)
The  Goldboro  property  lies  on  the  eastern  shore  of  Nova  Scotia,  Canada,  along  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  (Fig.  4.1).    It  is  located  175  kilometres  northeast  of  Halifax  and  approximately  1.6 
kilometres  north  of  the  village  of  Goldboro  on  the  eastern  shore  of  Isaac’s  Harbour,  in 
Guysborough  County.  A  secondary  gravel  road  crosses  the  property  and  passes  near  the 
Boston-Richardson  shaft  and  the  newer  access  ramp.  Smaller  logging  roads  give  excellent 
access to all of the property.
The Goldboro property consists of 37 contiguous claims covering a total area of 584 hectares 
held under Exploration Licence No. 05888 (Fig. 4.2). These claims are:
Tract 64: claims H, J, K, P and Q. 
Tract 65: claims A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q. 
Tract 66: claims A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q.
The  surface  rights  belong  to  various  private  landowners  and  the  Nova  Scotia  Department  of 
Lands and Forests. Orex owns 100% of the mining rights since 1988 when they acquired them 
from Onitap Resources. Ownership of the Goldboro property is not subject to any lien, mortgage, 
royalty or other right in favour of third parties. At the time of the report, the Goldboro Exploration 
Licence (No. 05888) is in pending status for an extension period until a technical assessment 
report is submitted (report submittal in process; pers. comm., W. Shaw, 2009). Orex has enough 
work credits to maintain the property for more than 260 years.

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND
PHYSIOGRAPHY   (Item 7)
5.1  Accessibility
The property is located approximately 175 kilometres northeast of Halifax and is accessible 
by a 2.5-kilometre gravel road from the paved, all-weather Highway 316 that links the village 
of  Goldboro  to  the  town  of  Antigonish,  Nova  Scotia  (Fig.  5.1).  The  central  point  of  the 
property is approximately defined by latitude 45° 10' 00” N and longitude 61° 40' 00” W, and 
is approximately 70 metres above sea level.
5.2  Climate
The climate is typical of the eastern Canadian coast, with temperatures varying between –20
°C in the winter and +20 °C in the summer. Snowfall in the winter tends to be heavy.
5.3  Local Resources
The  villages  of  Goldboro  and  Isaac’s  Harbour  offer  minimal  essential  services.  All  other 
services are readily available in the town of Sherbrooke, located some 50 kilometres west of 
the property, or in the town of Antigonish, 80 kilometres north of the property. The nearest 
commercial airport is the Halifax International Airport.
5.4
Infrastructure
Central  to  the  property  is  the  Goldboro  mine  site.  Present  at  the  site  is  a  vertical  shaft 
(Boston-Richardson  shaft)  rehabilitated  to  a  depth  of  122  metres,  and  a  hoist  capable  of 
operating  to  depths  of  600  metres  below  surface  (Figs.  5.2  and  5.3).  A  service  building—
which  acted  as  a  warehouse,  geology  office,  shaft  house  (Fig.  5.3A)  and  hoist  room  (Fig. 
5.3B)—is still on the site.
A second underground access is provided by a more recent decline ramp that accesses the 
near-surface portion of the New Belt area, which is located immediately beneath the Boston-
Richardson belt on the 36m and 76m levels in an area approximately 350metres west of the 
Boston-Richardson shaft. This decline, which measures 5 x 4 metres, was developed during 
the 1988 exploration program by Orex and its partners. It was driven with a slope of 15% to a 
total inclined length of 416 metres from surface to the 76m level. It gives access to two 4x3-
metre crosscuts, one at the 38m level and another at the 76m level. The decline is currently 
flooded to the portal collar (Fig. 5.3C).
There are four old tailings sites associated with past mining activities. They are referred to as 
South, Southeast and East (material in the latter is divided between two separate locations 
along the Gold Brook River) (Fig. 5.2).
The property is crossed in a northwesterly fashion by a natural gas pipeline that was built in 
1999 to bring natural gas to markets in the Maritimes and Northeastern United States from 
six developed gas fields 160 kilometres off the east coast of Nova Scotia. The pipeline runs 
from  Sable  Island  through  the  town  of  Goldboro  and  into  the  state  of  New  Hampshire.
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
17
www.innovexplo.com
Although the location of the pipeline does not jeopardize future underground operations, it 
should be considered during any future open pit studies.
5.5  Physiography
The site of the Goldboro Project is characterized by gently rolling topography, with elevations 
ranging from 65 to 80 metres above sea level. The area is moderately to heavily forested.
The Isaacs Harbour North Lake and Isaacs Harbour River touch and cut the western portion 
of  the  property.  The  area  between  the  Dolliver  Mountain  and  West  Goldbrook  historical 
shafts  is  covered  by  a  marsh.  An  arm  of  Goldbrook  Lake  partly  covers  the  east-west 
mineralized  trend  between  the  Boston-Richardson  shaft  and  the  historical  East  Goldbrook 
shafts.

6.0  HISTORY   (Item 8)
The  following  sections  refer  to  reports  by  Rousseau  (1990)  and  Roy  (1998)  unless  otherwise 
indicated.
BOSTON-RICHARDSON
The  Goldboro  property  has  been  the  subject  of  extensive  past  exploration  work.  Exploration 
work in the area dates back to 1861 when gold was discovered in quartz veins in the Isaac’s 
Harbour anticline. In 1892, Howard Richardson was the first to note gold occurrences in the slate 
belt (slate and quartz) that would later bear his name. During the same year, the Richardson 
Gold Mining Company started developing the belt.
In  1893,  the  Richardson  Gold  mine  went  into  operation  with  an  average  ore  grade  of  0.38 
ounces of gold per short ton (13.03 g/t Au; 50-60% gold recovery). In 1896, the mine operated at 
full capacity. In 1897, three shafts provided access to the ore at a depth of 60 m. At the turn of 
the century, the main shaft was 160 metres deep and selective mining methods were used. At 
this time, two Wilfley concentrators were in operation. In 1901, two additional Wilfley tables were 
installed. A year later, the vertical shaft was sunk.
In 1903, the Boston-Richardson Mining Co. took over the property and resumed the sinking of 
the vertical shaft to the 122m level (1905). In 1906, a bromo-cyanide plant was built and gold 
recovery went up to 70%. The next year, the 213m level station was reached. Operations were 
suspended on August 15, 1908, due to financial difficulties.
The New England Mining Company took over the mine in 1909. During that year, 41,425 short 
tons  (37,572  t)  of  ore  were  crushed  and  yielded  5,024  ounces  (156  kg)  of  gold.  In  1910,  the 
company proceeded to a final clean-up, resulting in the recovery of an additional 1,502 ounces 
(46.7 kg) of gold. This brought the total gold recovery for the Boston-Richardson mine to 54,871 
ounces (1,707 kg) from 414,887 short tons of ore (376,303 t) between 1893 and 1910, making 
an average recovered grade of 4.53 g/t and head grade of 6.8 g/t, and average mill recoveries of 
67% (Roy, 1998).
DOLLIVER MOUNTAIN
The Dolliver Mountain mine, located 2 kilometres west of the Boston-Richardson mine, was most 
active from 1901 to 1905 when underground work was done. In 1902, the shaft was 58 metres 
deep and three (3) ore belts had been intersected, the most important of which measured 10 
metres wide (Partington belt). In 1903, the shaft was deepened to 81 metres and intersected a 
7-metre-wide ore belt (Forge belt).
In 1904, the shaft was extended to 149 metres. Stopping was done mainly on two levels, and 
205 ounces (6,376 g) of gold were recovered from 8,059 short tons of ore (7,310 t). In 1905, a 
152-metre hole was drilled from the bottom of the shaft. Several bodies of quartz and slate were 
intersected, but results were unsatisfactory. The mine has remained idle since then.
WEST GOLDBROOK
In the West Goldbrook exploration shaft, located west of the Boston-Richardson mine, five (5) 
ore belts were identified. A milling test was done on three (3) of these belts from 1909 to 1910. 
Results were unsatisfactory and the mine was abandoned.
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
22
www.innovexplo.com
From 1929 to 1931, Locarno Copper Mines Ltd sank a shaft west of the earlier shaft. In 1931, a 
metallurgical test recovered 1.61 ounces (50 g) of gold from 1.1 short tons (1 t) of ore.
In 1956, Canso Mining Corporation dewatered the shaft and did some cross-cutting. Work was 
stopped due to the company’s financial difficulties.
EAST GOLDBROOK
The East Goldbrook exploration shaft, located east of the Boston-Richardson shaft, began with 
the sinking of a shaft in 1907. In 1908, three (3) ore belts were explored by drifting eastward 
around the apex (46-m level). Some rich ore was found in one of these ore belts, but no other 
work was done.
From  1931  to  1934,  Renada  Mines  Ltd  dewatered  and  sampled  the  old  workings.  Assaying 
yielded results from 1.61 to 4.26 g/t Au.
RECENT HISTORY AT GOLDBORO – BEFORE OREX
After  almost  50  years  of  inactivity,  some  exploration  work  took  place  in  1981.  Patino  Mines 
(Quebec)  Ltd  completed  a  detailed  geophysical  program  on  a  large  tract  of  ground  covering 
most of the Upper Seal Harbour district. This work defined an anticline axis stretching from the 
Dolliver Mountain mine to the East Goldbrook shaft. It confirmed the geological continuity of the 
structures comprising the main target of the exploration work planned for the area.
In  1984,  Onitap  Resources  Inc.  acquired  37  claims,  including  the  Boston-Richardson,  East 
Goldbrook,  West  Goldbrook  and  Dolliver  Mountain  properties.  They  started  by  drilling  a  529-
metre long hole (BR84-01) to test the down-plunge extension of the Richardson belt. The hole 
plunged eastward and extended deeper than the earlier underground workings, and intersected 
the  Richardson  belt  at  360  metres  from  its  collar.  More  importantly,  however,  it  intersected 
several previously unknown belts deeper along the hole. Then, in 1985, Onitap drilled five (5) 
short holes, totalling 390 metres, near the West Gold Brook mine (BR85-01 to -04, and BR85-
01A). Several slate belts were intersected but only a few samples taken.
Early in 1987, Petromet Resources Ltd and Greenstrike Gold Corporation completed a five(5)-
hole drilling program for 1,925 metres (BR-1 to BR-5). Later, Onitap drilled 33 holes (BR-6 to 
BR-38) totalling 11,862 metres, and conducted helicopter-borne geophysical (EM-16, magnetic) 
and IP surveys. These drilling programs focused on the eastern portion of the property, the first 
one testing the lateral and depth extensions of the Richardson belt, and the second one starting 
the  definition  of  the  four  (4)  new  belts  discovered  under  the  Richardson  belt  (the  New,  Third, 
Fourth  and  Fifth  belts).  This  second  program  also  intersected  several  very  impressive  gold 
grades in belts above the Richardson belt in the East Goldbrook area. Furthermore, gold specks 
were seen in nearly every hole, and reserves (historical resource, not compliant with R-43-101)
were estimated to be 999,767 tonnes grading 6.6 g/t gold. This first estimate was based on the 
information acquired in the definition of the new belts in relation to the shape and scope of past 
mining  activities  in  the  Richardson  belt.  These  “resources”  and/or  “reserves”  are  historical  in 
nature and should not be relied upon because it is unlikely they conform to current Regulation 
43-101  criteria  or  to  CIM  Standards  and  Definitions,  and  they  have  not  been  verified  to 
determine their relevance or reliability. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes 
only and should not be disclosed out of context.

RECENT HISTORY – OREX AND PARTNERS
A total of $8.2 million was spent on the 1988 surface and underground exploration program. This 
included  shaft  rehabilitation  (Boston-Richardson)  and  other  related  technical  services.  The 
program was financed by Orex. The financing was obtained under an option agreement between 
Exploration Orex Inc., Onitap Resources Inc., and Narex Ore Search Consultants Inc.
SURFACE DRILLING PROGRAM
The  1988  surface  exploration  drilling  program  was  designed  to  cover  the  western  part  of  the 
Boston-Richardson mine area. The goal was to drill the new belts previously discovered beneath 
the  Boston-Richardson  belt.  They  are  collectively  known  as  the  New  Belt  area.  A  total  of  41 
holes were drilled along the projected anticlinal axis of the Upper Seal Harbour fold (BR-39 to 
BR-79).  The  1988  drilling  program  covered  a  total  of  10,504  metres,  including  ten  (10)  holes 
(total of 1,818 m) drilled in the former West Gold Brook mine area. At the end of the program, 
three (3) additional holes (total of 205 m) were drilled in the vicinity of the underground decline to 
check the near-surface continuity of the belts (BR-80 to BR-82). Later in 1989, Orex drilled an 
additional twenty-six (26) holes for 2,822 metres (BR-83 to BR-108) in the West Goldbrook area.
UNDERGROUND EXPLORATION PROGRAM
An  access  decline  and  two  levels  were  developed  during  the  1988  exploration  program.  The 
decline, measuring 5 x 4 metres, was driven for a total length of 416 metres from surface to the 
76-metre level, with a slope of 15%. It gives access to two 4x3-metre cross-cuts, one at the 38-
metre level and another at the 76m level. Underground exploration confirmed the interpretation 
of drilling data and consequently substantiated the potential of the gold bearing zones.
As the cross-cut and apex drifts were being done, a muck sampling procedure was developed. 
Mapping and chip sampling of each of the cross-cut walls were part of the procedure. Coarse 
gold mineralization was found in the quartz veins associated with graphitic black shale, and free 
gold was also detected in the shale unit.
An underground drilling program was done at the 38m level cross-cut. Four (4) holes were drilled 
for a total length of 234 metres.
The final report for this work included new reserve calculations performed by G. Parent, M.Sc., 
and R. Ethier, P.Eng., using all information available between sections 9100E and 8575E to a 
vertical depth of 300 metres (Parent and Ethier, 1989). A total of 8.5 million metric tons were 
estimated for all categories (historical resources, not compliant with R-43-101), with an average 
grade  of  1.6  g/t  gold  (uncut  value)  and  1.2  g/t  gold  (cut  value).  These  historical  “resources” 
and/or  “reserves”  should  not  be  relied  upon  because  it  is  unlikely  they  conform  to  current 
Regulation 43-101 criteria or to CIM Standards and Definitions, and they have not been verified 
to  determine  their  relevance  or  reliability.  They  are  included  in  this  section  for  illustrative 
purposes only and should not be disclosed out of context.
SHAFT REHABILITATION
It was decided to rehabilitate the Boston-Richardson vertical shaft to provide direct access to the 
ore in the eastern part of the new belts. Dewatering started in May 1988, and the shaft collar 
was  reinforced  to  withstand  the  new  28-metre  (90-foot)  head  frame.  The  shaft,  which  now 
consists of three standard 1.80 x 1.80 metre compartments, was completely rehabilitated down 
to the 122m level.

UNDERGROUND RAMP DRILLING PROGRAM 
From December 4, 1989, to the end of February 1990, a definition underground drilling program 
was executed from the 76m level on sections spaced 12.5 metres apart. A fan of ten (10) holes 
per section were drilled at dips of 0°, +20°, +40°, +60° and +75° to the north and south. One 
hundred and eight (108) holes were drilled for a total of 4,740 metres. Eleven (11) sections were 
drilled in this manner from 8637.5E to 8762.5E.
UNDERGROUND RAMP DEVELOPMENT
Drifting  was  done  during  the  same  program  (December  2008  to  February  2009)  to  allow  the 
belts to be drilled from the 76m level along a lateral length of 125 metres. The apex drift is 2.6 
metres high by 4.0 metres wide, with a 128-metre finger to the north.
At the end of the program, two (2) underground bulk samples weighing approximately seven (7) 
metric tonnes each were mined out.
1.  The first underground bulk sample consisted of a slash on the 38m level. It was taken 
from the west wall of the cross-cut on the south limb of the N1 belt. The slashed area 
measured  4.5  metres  (length)  by  1.5  metres  (height),  and  50  centimetres  to  1  metre 
deep.
2.  The second slash was located on the 76m level. It was taken directly south of the apex 
drift, on the west wall of the cross-cut, also on the south limb of the N1 belt. The slashed 
area measured 7 metres long by 2 metres high and 30 to 50 centimetres deep.
Another  mineral  resource  estimate  was  prepared  for  the  Goldboro  property  in  1990  by  G. 
Parent, P. Geo. (historical resources, not compliant with R-43-101). It was prepared using the 
polygonal method calculated from geological cross sections drawn in at ore grade intersections 
along drill holes and linked together whenever possible. Each polygon was numbered and a list 
containing  details  of  volume  and  grade  estimates  for  each  polygon  was  produced.  The 
estimation was made between 8150E and 9100E and yielded 755,000 t grading 1.2 g/t for the 
Ramp  area,  19,500,000  t  grading  0.8  g/t  for  the  Boston-Richardson  area,  and  8,600,000  t 
grading  0.5  g/t  for  the  West  Goldbrook  area.  These  historical  “resources”  and/or  “reserves” 
should  not  be  relied  upon  because  it  is  unlikely  they  conform  to  current  Regulation  43-101 
criteria or to CIM Standards and Definitions, and they have not been verified to determine their 
relevance or reliability. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and should 
not be disclosed out of context.
During  the  years  to  come,  the  major  hurdle  for  Orex  was  to  evaluate  the  gold  content  of  the 
mineralized  belts.  The  gold  distribution  is  subject  to  a  severe  “nugget  effect”  with  a  strong 
segregation  component.  In  the  case  of  Goldboro,  gold  appears  as  large  nuggets,  fine 
disseminations within or bordering arsenopyrite crystals, and as fine gold grains associated with 
carbonaceous  material.  This  particular  distribution  of  gold  grains  may  explain  the  fact  that 
regular assaying methods (atomic absorption, fire assay, metallic screen) yield lower gold values 
than a metallurgical balance from mill tests.
Due to this problem and to the controversy generated by it, an agreement was reached with a 
senior partner, Minnova Inc. to determine if the high assay results were accurate, and to find an 
assay method that would work consistently. To obtain samples, Minnova twinned four (4) holes 
that had been tested previously, and they drilled an angular hole to test low-grade material close 
to the ramp area, but south of the apex (BR-109 to -113).
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
25

For assaying, it was decided to use the CGL (continuous grind leach) method, which consists of 
leaching the gold while grinding the material in a closed circuit. If the results turned out to be 
inconclusive  or  negative,  one  (1)  hole  was  to  be  milled  in  a  pilot  plant  to  repeat  the  exact 
conditions of Orex’s initial tests.
The  CGL  assays  were  low,  approximately  the  same  as  the  previously  obtained  atomic 
absorption or fire assay results. However, Minnova decided not to repeat the procedure used by 
Orex, arguing that they needed accurate results on small intervals if they were to evaluate the 
area properly and that such results would be needed to guide any future mining. Consequently, 
Minnova dropped the option.
The property remained on care and maintenance until an agreement was reached with Novagold 
Resources Inc. They were operating a vat-leaching mill in New Brunswick at the time, and the 
method  seemed  promising  for  testing  and  eventually  processing  the  ore  from  the  Goldboro 
property.
Representative samples were taken from a 4,000-tonne surface stockpile and sent to Halifax for 
processing at the Technical Institute of Nova Scotia to determine the possibility of processing 
this type of ore by vat leaching. The results were extremely encouraging, with recoveries up to 
84%  after  four  hours  of  leaching  and  grades  varying  between  4  and  6  g/t.  However,  due  to 
financial difficulties, Novagold had to drop the option.
In the fall of 1993, Orex decided to resolve, once and for all, if high grades were present over 
large  intervals  in  the  central  portion  of  the  apex.  In  order  to  do  so,  Orex  drilled  six  (6)  more 
diamond drill holes. These holes were drilled to provide raw material from a well-known area for 
metallurgical and analytical testing. The collected material was then sent for testing at the Centre 
de recherches minérales (CRM) in Quebec City.
Four (4) holes were first drilled as closely as possible to previously drilled holes, using a drilling 
method that ensured maximum core recovery (BR-114 to -117). In the first attempt for the two 
vertical holes (BR-114, BR-116), some material was lost and it was decided to drill again (BR-
114B,  BR-116B)  to  get  a  better  sample  of  the  areas  where  the  core  was  lost.  All  holes  were 
described  (logged)  and  recorded  rock  formations  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  past. 
Sludge samples were also collected and assayed by the metallic screen method.
The  whole  core  was  then  sent,  in  1-metre  lengths,  to  Quebec  City  for  assaying.  The  assay 
method  used  was  similar,  up  to  a certain  point,  to  the  CGL  method, which  had been  done in 
1991  on  core  samples  from  the  same  areas.  After  crushing  to  100%  <10  mesh,  the  1-metre 
samples were split into four (4) equal lots using a carrousel. Then, one lot out of four was ground 
in a small ball mill for 24 hours in the presence of high cyanide concentrations. Finally, the liquid 
and solids were fire assayed and a metallurgical balance calculated to give the head grade.
The  grades  obtained  were  lower  than  expected,  but  similar  to  those  obtained  by  Minnova, 
leading to an immediate first conclusion that grade variations were not related to problems with 
core recovery. The occurrence of <90% gold dissolution in 78% of the samples led to questions 
about  the  assay  method.  New  tests  were  performed,  but  the  assay  program  was  finally 
suspended  because,  in  particular,  the  four  splits  of  one  of  the  1-metre  sections  containing  a 
relatively  large  gold  nugget  yielded  grades  from  1.26  to  1.74  g/t  with  gold  dissolution  at 
approximately  5%.  These  results  were  totally  incompatible  with  metallurgical  tests,  which  had 
produced  gold  dissolution  above  95%  and  suggested  that  such  results  were  easy  to  obtain 
under  normal  conditions.  Furthermore,  the  results  from  the  sludge  assays  were  much  higher 
than the core assays, and a new assay method had to be designed.
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report

Based on the extremely high cyanide concentration in the new assays and on the results of past 
tests showing that gold dissolution was not a problem, it was determined that the low dissolution 
obtained in some samples could only be explained by precipitation of the gold after it had been 
dissolved. It was thus decided to combine one of each of the split samples from a selected hole 
and  process  the  batch  in  a  pilot  plant  using  gravity  separation  followed  by  cyanidation  of  the 
tails. This method was chosen because it had always yielded higher grades even if it could not 
give an accurate picture of how the gold was distributed in the sequence.
At  this  point  (1995),  Placer  Dome  Inc.  contacted  Orex  and  asked  permission  to  sample  the 
4,000-tonne stockpile, which had already been sampled by Novagold. At the same time, they 
asked Orex to stop their current work until they received the results from their sampling. Placer 
Dome felt that their presence would lend credibility to the project and they had the expertise to 
solve  Orex’s  analytical  problems.  Placer  Dome  had  also  encountered  relatively  similar  assay 
problems elsewhere and felt they could solve them.
High  gold  grades  are  typically  found  within  “veins”  at  Goldboro.  The  veins  are  a  mixture  of 
quartz, argillite (slate) and arsenopyrite, often containing visible gold and some galena, and are 
confined to the slate beds. Three other general rock types can be found in the area of interest: 
bull  quartz  (nearly  100%  quartz),  slate  without  quartz  veinlets,  and  greywacke  (with  some 
arsenopyrite but without quartz or pervasive alteration). The generally accepted theory was that 
bull  quartz  may  occasionally  contain  some  gold,  whereas  the  other  two  units  (slate  and 
greywacke) are almost always barren of gold mineralization.
In  order  to  make  their  decision,  Placer  sampled  the  stockpile  in  a  very  particular  way.  They 
wanted to know the gold content of each of the four different rock types described above, so 
they took random samples over the whole pile and then separated them by rock type. Also, each 
piece of rock was visually inspected, and any piece with visible gold was eliminated. Samples of 
all four types of rock were then sent to the Placer laboratory in Vancouver, where a 2-kilogram 
representative portion was separated from each. These portions were treated by the carbon in 
leach (CIL) method. The results were:
greywacke: 1.00 g/t calculated head, 1.00 g/t assayed head; 
slate (graphitic shale): 2.64 g/t calculated head, 2.82 g/t assayed head; 
quartz veins (bull quartz): 16.18 g/t calculated head, 6.16 g/t assayed head;
Ɣ 
Ɣ 
Ɣ 
Ɣ  mineralized veins: 33.62 g/t calculated head, 36.37 g/t assayed head.
The grade of 1.00 g/t in greywacke suggested that some of this host rock contains gold. The 
other assays could only confirm that: (i) some of the mineralized veins are extremely high grade; 
(ii) there is some gold in the slate; and (iii) bull quartz may contain very coarse gold grains that 
generate  a  strong  nugget  effect  and  locally  good  grades.  Placer  immediately  asked  Orex  to 
suspend  all  their  activities  and  started  negotiations  that  ended  with  Placer  offering  to  invest 
C$30,000,000 to acquire a 65% interest in the Goldboro property.
Placer’s  first  step  was  to  try  and  obtain  an  environmental  release  from  the  Nova  Scotia 
Government. This release would have acted as a protective measure to insure that Placer could 
not be forced to clean up past environmental problems, such as tailings left over from mining 
operations at the beginning of the century. The plan was to then immediately proceed with a drill 
program consisting of seven (7) angular holes to verify the open pit potential of the area near the 
ramp portal.
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report

www.innovexplo.com
The government officials were met in May of 1995, and the release was expected in early June, 
with drilling scheduled for late June. A total of 1,262.93 metres was to be drilled in the seven (7) 
holes (BR95-119 to BR95-125). It was decided that all samples would be assayed by fire assay 
or metallic screen, and by another method combining gravity extraction and cyanide leaching of 
the gravity tails.
Unfortunately, the release was obtained only in the fall and drilling started in October 1995. The 
work  was  done  on  remnants  of  the  original  budget  and  the  responsibility  for  the  project  was 
transferred from the Val-d’Or office, who had evaluated the project, to the Vancouver office. For 
budget  reasons,  it  was  decided  not  to  do  the  special  assaying.  The  adopted  assay  methods 
were fire assay or metallic screen and evidently yielded results similar to those obtained before.
Placer  Dome  subsequently  dropped  their  option  due  to  a  shift  in  their  exploration  towards 
international ventures and higher priority projects around existing mine sites, and the Goldboro 
project was shelved in 1996.
No work was performed at Goldboro from 1996 to early 2004.
In February 2004, MRB & Associates was retained by Orex to prepare an independent technical 
report on the Goldboro property. The report was a joint effort between a team of independent 
consultants (InnovExplo Inc., A.S. Horvath Consulting, Tech2Mine Inc., and MRB & Associates), 
supervised by Jean Lafleur, M.Sc. (Senior Technical Advisor to Orex).
One  of  the  reasons  for  this  independent  study  was  to  review  the  geology  of  the  Goldboro 
property and Meguma district in Nova Scotia, and compare the characteristics of Meguma-style 
deposits to those of the Bendigo and Ballarat deposits in the Lachlan fold belt of Central Victoria, 
Australia. Another purpose was to review historical sampling and analytical grade determination 
procedures at Goldboro and provide an assessment of the data quality and suitability of these 
historical results as they pertain to:
1.  mineralization  characteristics  and 
determination, and QA/QC protocols;
recommendations
for
future  sampling,  grade
2.  data quality and integrity for use in resource/reserve estimation, and;
3.  comparison  of  the  sampling,  analytical  determination  and  reserve  estimation  methods
with those used at deposits in the Bendigo-Ballarat district.
The  conclusions  and  recommendations  stemming  from  the  study  set  the  stage  for  the  2005 
exploration  program  undertaken  by  Orex,  specifically  the  conclusions  regarding  grade 
determinations. Horvath made the following conclusions (among others):
1.  Historical conventional sampling, processing and analytical gold determination protocols
consistently under-estimated the grade due to the extreme nugget effect;
2.  The  only  reliable  method  of  obtaining  accurate  and  precise  grade  determinations  for 
Goldboro mineralized samples is by metallurgical testing/processing of adequately sized 
representative samples.
Orex began an exploration program in February 2005. Twenty-three (23) diamond drill holes of 
HQ diameter core were completed for a total of 2,355 metres (BR05-001 to BR05-023). Drilling 
was  concentrated  in  a  225-metre  wide  area,  centred  on  Section  8675E  of  the  Boston-
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
28
www.innovexplo.com
Richardson  belt.  The  individual  sample  weight  was  estimated  to  be  7.75  kg  per  metre  of 
recovered core.
The purpose of the drill program was to test a small area of known shallow mineralized zones by 
drilling  fences  of  holes  on  a  spacing  of  no  greater  than  25  metres  between  sections.  The 
proposed pattern of drilling and number of holes was designed to allow two (2) separate shallow 
areas  to  be  similarly  tested.  Four  (4)  holes  were  twinned  to  previous  holes  for  comparative 
analysis.  Recognized  mineralized  zones  were  assayed  using  conventional  fire  assay  with  an 
atomic  absorption  or  gravimetric  finish,  and  at  the  end  of  the  program,  sample  composites 
(made by combining reject samples from multiple drill holes previously analyzed by conventional 
fire assay) were made and sent to Lakefield Research for metallurgical testing.
A resource estimate in compliance with CIM Definitions and Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves was undertaken at the end of the program by P & E Mining Consultants 
Inc. using the metallurgical sample results (Armstrong, Puritch and Horvath, 2006).

A two-phase diamond drill program was recommended to:
-  upgrade the Indicated Resources within the ramp area to the Measured category; 
-  upgrade Inferred Resources (conceptual target) over a 1-kilometre total strike length to
the Indicated category; 
test for extensions to the mineralized zones over a 2.5-kilometre strike length;
- 
-  add Inferred Resources from the 2.5-kilometre strike length.

7.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING   (Item 9)
7.1  Regional Geological Setting
In eastern Canada, the Appalachian Belt is divided into five tectono-lithostratigraphic zones. 
From the northwest to the southeast, these zones are: (i) Humber; (ii) Dunnage; (iii) Gander; 
(iv) Avalon; and (v) Meguma (Fig. 7.1). In Nova Scotia, only the Meguma and Avalon zones 
are present. The Meguma Zone (also known as the Meguma Supergroup) is juxtaposed onto 
the  Avalon  terrane  to  the  north.  This  tectonic  boundary  is  marked  by  the  Cobequid-
Cedabucto fault.
to  a  Cambro-Ordovician  sedimentary  rock 
The  Meguma  Supergroup  corresponds 
succession  formed  along  the  ancient  continental  shore  of  the  Gondwana  paleo-continent. 
The thickness of the Meguma Supergroup ranges from 10 to 14 kilometres (Bates, 1987), 
and  includes  a  basal  sandy  flysch  (Goldenville  Formation)  with  an  overlying  shaley  flysch 
(Halifax  Formation)  (Smith  and  Kontak,  1996).  The  Goldenville  Formation  consists  of  a 
turbidite series, formed as part of the ancient continental rise, while the Halifax Formation 
represents a sedimentary rock succession that was deposited onto the ancient continental 
slope and offshore deep sea basin (Fig. 7.2).
The  Meguma  sedimentary  rock  succession  and  formation  is  related  to  the  closure  of  the 
Iapetus and Rheic oceans (Gondwana and Laurentia continent collision). The final collision 
between Gondwana and Laurentia formed the Pangea supercontinent. This youngest part of 
the Appalachian Chain is related to the Alleghanian Orogen.
Structural features related to the Alleghanian Orogen include kilometre-scale folds with E-W 
to NE-SW axial trace directions. These folds are upright to slightly inclined with an easterly 
plunge. Cleavages are also a predominant structural feature and include slaty cleavage, AC 
cleavage and pressure-solution cleavage. The AC cleavage is the most common cleavage, 
and has a 2-metre regular spacing. The bedding-cleavage intersection lineation shows local 
plunge variations and indicates a general non-cylindrical character (Horne, 2000).
The Cambro-Ordovician sedimentary rock succession was metamorphosed to greenschist-
amphibolite  facies  and  intruded  by  peraluminous  granite,  granodiorite  and  minor  mafic 
intrusions of Devonian to Carboniferous age (370 Ma) (Smith and Kontak, 1996). Locally, in 
the northwest area of the Meguma Supergroup, the Cambro-Ordovician sedimentary rocks 
are  overlain  by  Devonian  to  Carboniferous  age  (370  Ma)  volcanic  flows  and  sediments 
(Williams, 1995).
During  the  Triassic,  at  the  time  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean  opening,  a  part  of  the  Gondwana 
continent (now the African continent) remained with the Laurentia continent (now the North 
American  continent).  This  segment  is  referred  to  as  the  Meguma  Zone  or  the  Meguma 
Supergroup.
The Meguma Supergroup is cut by a series of late NW-trending faults. These late faults may 
have played a role in remobilizing and concentrating gold mineralization in veins or lenses at 
Goldboro (Roy, 1998).

7.2  Goldboro Property Geological Setting
The  property  is  entirely  underlain  by  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Goldenville  Group,  which 
consist of altered greywacke, sandstone (arenite), and slate. The greywacke and sandstone 
are  represented  as  undifferentiated  Goldenville  Group  in  Figure  7.4,  and  the  slate  is 
indicated in red. The stratigraphic sedimentary succession of the Goldboro area is affected 
by the Upper Seal Harbour anticline. This anticline is an upright, ENE-trending tight fold with 
a 10° to 30° plunge to the east. In the apex of the anticline, the slate units (red mineralized 
zones in Figs. 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5) are thicker than other sedimentary rock types.
The  axial  trace  and  apex  of  the  anticline  is  cut  at  a  very  low  angle  by  steep  NW-  and  E-
trending faults (Fig. 7.4). The New Belt Fault is one of the most significant faults that cut the 
Upper Seal Harbour anticline at Goldboro. The sedimentary sequences are not the same on 
either side of this fault, and the lithological units are described separately and referred to as 
the  South  and  North  limbs.  The  lithological  description  for  each  limb  is  presented  in  the 
following section.
South Limb Lithological Description
The following descriptions are taken from Roy (1998), unless otherwise indicated.
Along  the  South  Limb,  four  main  sedimentary  sequences  have  been  recognized:  1)  a 
hanging  wall  package  of  thin  unaltered  turbiditic  Bouma  sequences;  2)  the  Boston 
Richardson  slate  belt;  3)  the  Boston  Richardson  arenite  unit;  and  4)  the  New  Belt 
sequences.
The  hanging  wall  to  the  Boston  Richardson  slate  belt  is  characterized  by  thin  Bouma 
sequences,  typically  30  centimetres  thick,  but  ranging  from  10  centimetres  to  3  metres. 
These sedimentary units are typically grey to green in colour and internally massive to finely 
laminated.
The  Boston  Richardson  slate  belt  is  2  metres  thick  and  comprises  two  or  three  Bouma 
sequences. Due to carbon and biotite alteration, this unit is generally grey or locally black in 
colour. Several faults, 5 centimetres thick, are observed at the top and middle of this zone.
The  Boston  Richardson  arenite  unit  consists  of  a  40-metre-thick  sequence  of  silicified 
greywackes in which the degree of silicification increases toward the base of the unit. The 
sequence is typically light grey, locally with a light brownish hue, and locally with a mottled 
appearance  (due  to  biotite  and  silica  alteration).  At  Goldboro,  the  term  arenite  was  used 
when referring to the altered greywackes (silicified and sericitized) to distinguish them from 
unaltered greywacke. The Boston Richardson arenite unit is the best marker horizon along 
the South limb.
Nine to ten (9-10) new zones were identified by Placer Dome during a diamond drill program. 
Each  zone  (or  belt)  consists  of  1-  to  2-metre-thick  Bouma  sequences  with  unmineralized 
arenite. The arenite is light grey and well silicified. The slates are black, graphitic and have 
up to 30% retrograded andalusite porphyroblasts. Other new zones were identified at depths 
greater than 300 metres.

North Limb Lithological Description
Due  to  displacement  along  the  New  Belt  Fault,  the  sequences  documented  on  the  South 
limb  differ  from  the  North  limb.  The  hanging  wall  (or  North  limb)  of  the  New  Belt  Fault  is 
characterized by thin, unaltered and poorly mineralized Bouma sequences, typically in 30-
centimetre-thick intervals (ranging from 10 centimetres to 3 metres).
It should be noted that the 40-metre-thick Boston Richardson arenite unit is not documented 
along  the  North  limb;  this  makes  the  location  of  the  Boston  Richardson  mineralized  zone 
uncertain  due  to  the  absence  of  the  arenite  marker.  However,  a  2-metre-thick  slate  belt 
containing  8%  bedding-parallel  ribbon  quartz  veins  with  pyrrhotite,  chalcopyrite  and 
arsenopyrite was intersected in a diamond drill hole. Another diamond drill hole intersected a 
7-metre-thick slate that could be interpreted as the Boston Richardson belt, but the belt is 
unmineralized and does not contain the arenite horizon marker; thus, this correlation remains 
uncertain.
The New Belt zones identified on the North limb lie immediately below the New Belt Fault 
and are identical to the belts of the South limb.

regional metamorphism
Generally transposed into 
parallelism with S4 cleavage

Shear zones may locally be
confused with S2 slaty

Includes all post D4
brittle/ductile structures
The first deformation phase (D1) was not recognized on the Goldboro property. The second 
deformation  phase  (D2)  has  been  recognized  on  the  property  where  it  consists  of  well-
developed,  steeply  dipping  pressure  solution  cleavage  (preserved  in  greywackes  and 
arenites).  Pressure  solution  cleavages  are  mostly  developed  on  the  South  limb  of  the 
anticline  and  were  documented  in  the  New  Belt  and  Boston  Richardson  arenites.  Some 
bedding  transpositions  have  also  been  recognized  by  the  presence  of  small-scale  slate 
lenses  within  the  greywacke.  The  D3  deformation  phase  was  recognized  in  outcrop  in  the 
Dolliver Mountain area (2 km west of the Boston-Richardson mine) where it consists of flat-
lying  pressure  solution  cleavage  developed  in  the  greywacke  units,  and  by  the  growth  of 
andalusite  and  biotite  porphyroblasts  in  a  shaly  unit.  The  D4  deformation  phase  was  also 
recognized  at  Goldboro  in  diamond  drill  hole  (flattened  porphyroblasts  in  the  hinge  of  the 
Upper Seal Harbour anticline).
The  New  Belt  Fault  is  a  result  of  the  D4  deformation  phase.  This  fault  has  a  strike  of 
approximately N085° with a dip ranging between 85° to 89° to the south. The displacement 
direction  or movement  is  not  certain  due  to  the  poor  correlation  on each  side  of the  fault. 
However, a dip-slip fault with some strike-slip component is suspected. The D5 deformation 
phase  was  recognized  in  the  form  of  late  NW-trending  brittle  faults  as  well  as  crenulation 
cleavage and kink bands within the slaty units.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES   (Item 10)
Four  distinct  mineralized  areas  have  been  identified  at  Goldboro:  the  Main,  Richardson,  East 
Goldbrook and West Goldbrook deposits.
The Main mineralized body is stratabound with the New Belt package of rocks and sits directly 
underneath the Richardson deposit (Fig. 7.4).
The Richardson deposit is stratabound within the Richardson belt. Early production from 1893 to 
1910 came from this zone, which remains open at depth.
The  East  Goldbrook  package  has  a  few  significant  mineralized  zones  of  unknown  extent,  as 
indicated by some exploration holes and underground development on the South limb. Diamond 
drill hole BR-35A returned a value of 2.8 g/t Au over 110 metres. In the West Goldbrook area, 
gold occurs along the apex of a fold (west of section 8600E).
The Goldboro mineralization has been previously referred to as a “saddle reef” lode-gold deposit 
type.  In  Nova  Scotia,  the  Boston-Richardson  mine  (Upper  Seal  Harbour  district)  is  a  classic 
example  of  a  “saddle  reef”  deposit. For  some,  this  definition  has  been  generalized  to  all  lode 
gold  deposits  in  the  Meguma  Supergroup,  while  for  others,  the  use  of  the  term  “saddle  reef” 
should be restricted to deposits where “gold occurred limited to the hinge or the apex of a fold 
and where a thickening of the unit occurred”.
The gold mineralization at Goldboro occurs in association with and within a quartz vein swarm 
located in the hinges of regional anticlines, principally in black shale-argillite wall rocks. As such, 
Goldboro  is  not  a  classic  “saddle  reef”  lode  gold  deposit  type.  The  fine-grained  folded 
sedimentary  units  have  a  constant  thickness  in  the  limb  but  not  in  the  hinge  of  the  fold, 
suggesting flexural-slip as the folding mechanism. Many key features within the gold deposits of 
the  Upper  Seal  Harbour  district  show  that  the  folding  itself  should  be  considered  as  the  gold 
mineralizing process.
8.1  Goldboro Mineral Deposit Model
The Goldboro deposit model, according to the USGS classification of mineral deposits, falls 
into  the  broad  category  of  low-sulphide  Au-quartz  vein  deposits  (USGS,  2006;  deposit 
type 36a). The main characteristics of these types of deposits are presented in Table 8.1. On 
a more local scale, many comparisons have been made between the gold deposits of the 
Goldfields  area  of  Central  Victoria  (Australia)  and  the  Meguma  deposits  of  Nova  Scotia 
(Canada). The comparisons show that these deposits share numerous similarities but also 
display some differences (Ryan and Ramsay, 1996). Table 8.2 highlights these similarities 
and differences.

The comparisons between deposits in the Goldfields area of Australia and Meguma deposits 
in  Nova  Scotia  could  have  a  significant  impact  for  gold  exploration  at  Goldboro  and 
elsewhere in the Meguma Terrane. The Victoria examples demonstrate that narrow quartz-
vein gold deposits, similar to those in Meguma, can be mined profitably. Furthermore, it also 
demonstrates that disseminated, low-grade concentrations of gold (1-2 g/t Au) can be mined 
as economically viable deposits.
This  comparison  indicates  that  a  potential  for  larger  deposits  exists  in  Nova  Scotia  (the 
extension  of  the  Meguma  deposits  at  depth  is  virtually  untested).  The  Goldfields  area  in 
Australia  hosts  the  Bendigo  and  Ballarat  giant  sedimentary-hosted  lode-gold  deposits.  At 
Bendigo, 22 Moz of gold have been produced since 1851, and ~12 Moz of gold has been 
produced at Ballarat since 1850. Bendigo and Ballarat may turn out to be unique, but the 
features  of  the  Australian  mineral  deposit  model  that  are  missing  at  Goldboro  should 
nonetheless  be  tested  by  an  exploration  program.  A  review  of  the  recent  advances  in  the 
geological and structural modeling of gold distribution in Australia (Central Victoria area) is 
presented in the following section and summarized in Table 8.2.
Finally, exploration programs in Australia tell us that the grade of mineralized veins cannot 
be assessed without bulk sampling, and where applicable, declines must be an integral part 
of the exploration strategy (Ryan and Ramsay, 1996).

Scotia (Canada) and the Central Victoria area (Australia).

MAIN SIMILARITIES
Gold is primarily associated with
quartz veins.
Host rocks correspond to Cambro–
Ordovician turbiditic sedimentary 
rocks rich in quartz veins and where 
carbon-rich slate is present.
Veins grade from 7 to 12 g/t Au on
average.
Variety of quartz vein types, such as:
saddle reefs, fissure veins, 
stockworks, bedding-parallel veins 
and combinations thereof.
Deposit host rocks have been 
metamorphosed to greenschist 
facies
Similar vein thickness. 
  Silica and carbon alteration. 
  Metamorphic fluid source indicated 
by geochemistry and mineralization 
temperatures.
Presence of calc-silicates and 
coticules (hard silicate schist).
Presence of gold-antimony deposits.
MAIN DIFFERENCES
Quartz veins seem to be more 
abundant in the Central Victoria 
area.
Presence of thick Tertiary, gold-
bearing gravels in the Central 
Victoria area.
Turbidite sequences are thinner in
the Central Victoria area.
Turbidites are usually interbedded 
with siltstone and slate in Victoria, 
whereas in the Meguma Terrane 
there are very thick quartz arenite-
dominated sequences in the 
Goldenville Formation.
Scale of folding is much tighter in
Ballarat (Central Victoria area) with 
wavelengths of 200 to 700 m as 
opposed to 1 to 4 km in the Meguma 
Terrane.

Geological and Structural Control on Gold Distribution at Bendigo
The Bendigo Goldfield (Australia) is located at the crest of a regional anticline dome. The 
500  to  470  Ma  sedimentary  sequences  (sandstone  and  slate  units)  are  deformed  into  a 
regular series of N-S-trending chevron folds with variable plunging fold axes. Metamorphism 
is  mid-greenschist  facies.  Gold  mineralization  and  hydrothermal  alteration  are  thought  to 
have occurred around 440 Ma after the Late Devonian Harcourt Batholith intrusion.
Gold at Bendigo is exclusively associated with quartz veins and faults which are commonly 
found  near  the  anticline  hinges.  The  gold-bearing  reverse  faults  are  related  to  local 
compression and over-tightening of the chevron folds and are not directly associated with the 
major thrusts. The auriferous reverse faults created offset of less than 50 m. Gold displays a 
complex distribution, typically occurring as free and coarse grains (0.1 to 10 mm) within the 
quartz veins. Free gold grains are also associated with sulphides (arsenopyrite, pyrite and 
traces  of  base  metal  sulphides)  with  wall  rock  alteration  immediately  adjacent  to  quartz 
veins.
Some  veins  at  Bendigo  are  attributed  to  the  classic  “saddle  reef”  type,  but  the  auriferous 
veins also occur in a wide variety of structural settings. Figures 8.1 and 8.2 show the variety 
of  structural  settings  documented  at  Bendigo  and  Ballarat.  Reefs  commonly  exist  as 
composites  of  the  two  main  quartz  vein  types  and  have  been  classified  into  four  broad 
categories:
Saddle:  Saddle  reefs  formed  at  or  near  the  crest  of  small  tight  folds  and  follow  the  axial 
trace  along  considerable  strike  lengths.  These  represent  less  than  10%  of  historic  gold 
production.
Legs: Leg reefs are bedding-parallel veins; usually laminated quartz veins running down one 
or both limbs of an anticline. They are most often connected to saddle reefs but can also 
form discrete orebodies. 
Neck and faults: Neck reefs are located in the fold axis of an anticline and are generally 
positioned  immediately  above  a  saddle  reef.  Fault  reefs  are  strike-parallel  mineralization 
within  west  or  east-dipping  thrust  faults  that  displace  the  anticline  axis.  They  are  usually 
located where the fault crosscuts bedding above an anticline fold hinge. 
Spurs:  Spur  reefs  are  stockworks  or  spur  veins  that  occur  against  bedding,  parallel  to  or 
crosscutting  faults,  and  usually  develop  in  sandy  units.  The  majority  of  the  gold  produced 
came from spur reefs.

Geological and Structural Control on Gold Distribution at Ballarat
The Ballarat East and West gold deposits are related to a tightly folded Cambro-Ordovician 
sequence of sandstones, siltstones and slates.
At Ballarat East, 80% of the mined gold ore was derived from large ore shoots located along 
west-dipping faults combined with vertically oriented thick quartz veins.
Key features at Ballarat East:
large continuous west-dipping reverse faults
variable  stratigraphy  (providing  favourable  rock  mechanical  contrasts  and  creating
undulation along the west-dipping reverse faults)
eastern limb of the anticline (high angle between the steep or east-dipping stratigraphy
with the west-dipping faults)
Key features at Ballarat West:
large continuous west-dipping reverse faults 
large upright folding
variable stratigraphy including the presence of graphitic shale 
  graphitic shale is the host for the higher grade ore

(structural features) are also documented in the Goldenville Group (Nova Scotia).

9.0  MINERALIZATION   (Item 11)
Gold mineralization at Goldboro occurs in quartz veins and disseminated sulphides in the wall 
rock (Figs. 9.1 and 9.2). The mineralized wall rock mostly, but not exclusively, consists of shale-
argillite (slate). Locally, the greywacke and arenite are cut by quartz veins and are mineralized. 
The quartz veins have a thickness of 0.1 centimetre to 2.1 metres with an average thickness of 9 
centimetres and a median thickness of 2.5 centimetres. The veins are characterized by quartz, 
sulphide  (auriferous  arsenopyrite)  and  native  gold  (visible  gold  flakes  have  historically  been 
observed in several slate belts). Wall rocks generally contain more sulphides than the veins, in 
the form of arsenopyrite selvedges.
Higher grade trends or mineralized shoots have been documented (Meusy, 1988; Carrier and 
Beausoleil,  2004).  In  the  Boston-Richardson  belt,  two  main  mineralized  shoots  have  been 
identified  (Faribeault  in Malcolm,  1976).  These shoots  plunge  25°  to  the  east.  A  typical shoot 
can have an average length of 70 to 100 metres. The shoots are characterized by veins (60-70% 
in volume) in black shale with strong arsenopyrite mineralization and minor quartz veining. The 
hanging  wall  is  usually  shattered  and  injected  with  oblique,  crosscutting  gold-bearing  veins 
(Faribeault  in  Malcolm,  1976).  Flexure  zones  reportedly  associated  with  the  shoots  may  be 
explained by the volume gain caused by quartz precipitation of the host rock.
9.1  Sulphide Mineralogy
Gold is usually associated with sulphide-bearing quartz veins and sulphide-rich (altered) wall 
rocks.  Arsenopyrite  is  the  common  sulphide  species  but  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  chalcopyrite, 
galena and sphalerite are also associated with the gold mineralization.
Pyrite coats fracture planes and cleavages closest to vein contacts, but also occurs as fine-
grained, disseminated subhedral crystals. Wisps and blebs of pyrite are also noted. Pyrite is 
also often associated with late faults.
Pyrrhotite  most  commonly  occurs  as  disseminated  blebs,  sometimes  flattened  in  bands 
along foliation planes or as blebs at quartz vein contacts. It also occurs as fracture coatings 
or rarely as very fine stringers.
Chalcopyrite  is  noted  exclusively  in  quartz  veins  as  fine-grained  blebs,  commonly 
concentrated near fractures.
Galena is noted exclusively in the New Belt zones and commonly in association with visible 
gold, but was rarely observed.
Sphalerite is rarely observed as blebs within or along fractures within quartz veins.
9.2  Alteration
Pervasive  alteration  zones  are  characterized  by  carbonate,  sericite,  sulphides,  tourmaline 
and chlorite, post-dating the growth of porphyroblasts but synchronous to late relative to the 
development  of  the  regional  cleavage.  Banded  sericite  alteration  is  common  in  the 
greywacke  units  and  usually  concentrated  along  the  pressure  solution  cleavage  planes  or
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report

associated  with  siliceous  patches.  Silicification  and  strong  arsenopyrite  mineralization  are 
centred on the anticline hinge within very dark to black shale (Roy and Labelle, 1990). Within 
the mineralized zones, the biotite and carbon alteration increases from much darker grey to 
black  in  colour.  Whole-rock  geochemistry  shows  potassium  and  carbon  enrichment  in  the 
vicinity of the mineralized zones. Feldspar also occurs in some quartz veins, mostly seen in 
the vein near the contact with the wall rock.
9.3  Structural Setting, Vein Styles and Genetic Model
Gold mineralization at Goldboro occurs in quartz veins and wall rocks adjacent to the veins 
(Fig. 9.1). At the deposit scale, the veins form a swarm and are clearly located in the flexure 
zone  (hinge  and  adjacent  limbs)  of  a  regional  fold  known  as  the  Upper  Seal  Harbour 
anticline. The gold-bearing veins are found in a 140- to 160-metre-wide envelope centred on 
the axial surface. The veins occur mostly on the limbs and in a lesser but significant portion 
of the hinge of the fold. All of the veins are hosted in a turbiditic metasedimentary rock pile.
The flexure zone and the envelope of the gold-bearing vein swarm (70 to 80 metres on both 
sides of the hinge line in cross section) are themselves hosted within a wider deformation 
corridor  of  over  200  metres.  At  Goldboro,  deformation  by  compression  and  shearing 
associated with Acadian folding reaches its maximum within this corridor centred on the axial 
surface  of  the  Upper  Seal  Harbour  anticline.  This  assumption  is  based  on  conceptual 
deductions and on field observations. Firstly, the axial surface cleavage is better developed 
in  the  fold  flexure,  where  it  appears  as  penetrative  pressure-solution  schistosity  almost 
subparallel  to  bedding  planes  within  the  fold  limbs.  Secondly,  at  the  property  scale,  it  has 
been  documented  in  plan  view  and  cross  section  that  the  thickness  of  fine-grained 
sedimentary rock units (shale-argillite) undergo flattening in the limbs and thickening in the 
hinge. Thickness variations of sedimentary units in the envelope close to the axial surface 
created a greater tightening of the fold closure. These features indicate that the formation of 
the  Upper  Seal  Harbour  anticline,  at  least  in  the  Goldboro  area,  is  related  to  progressive 
heterogeneous shearing.
At  the  deposit  scale,  shear  stress  and  ductile  strain  are  mostly  restricted  to  the  less 
competent shale-argillite units (belts). These less competent units are more schistose and 
deformed, characterized by changes in thickness and shapes, in contrast to the sandstone 
beds. Proximity and abundance of less competent units (e.g., the N1 to N5 belts area) allow 
the concentration of tectonic forces and strain accumulation in those specific areas through a 
strain  partitioning  process.  These  features  are  enhanced  by  local  anisotropy  created  by 
interbedded  competent  arenite-sandstone  units  with  incompetent  shale-argillite  units.  To 
accommodate the deformation mechanism, strain concentration in a highly anisotropic area 
like the N1-N5 belts may be transferred by a 30 to 40-metre step to another non-competent 
unit,  like  the  Boston-Richardson  belt.  When  cohesive  accommodation  of  deformation 
reaches  its  strength  limit,  selective  individual  rock  units  are  fractured  as  a  result  of  the 
shearing process. This fracture process led to the creation of an efficient permeability for the 
circulation of gold-bearing fluids, and gold-bearing quartz veins occur within these permeable 
zones.

10.0  EXPLORATION   (Item 12)
Orex began an exploration program in February 2008 that consisted of a diamond drill program 
comprising  12,201.5  metres  in  forty-five  (45)  holes  (also  refer  to  Section  11  (Item  13)  of  this 
report). The average drill hole length was 250 metres. Drilling was concentrated between West 
Goldbrook and East Goldbrook on Crown Land surface rights. Drill hole collar sites were located 
by handheld GPS instruments prior to drilling. The 2008 drill hole collars were surveyed by C.J. 
MacLellan and Associates Ltd using DGPS (differential GPS) after completion.
Down-hole  surveying  of  all  drill  holes  was  completed  using  a  Reflex  EZ  Shot  instrument 
approximately every 50 metres along the hole.
The purpose of the drill program was to infill the previous drill programs and test the extensions 
of gold mineralization to the east and west of the Boston-Richardson zone.

Orex began a diamond drill program in February 2008 that ended in October 2008 and consisted 
of 12,201.5 metres in forty-five (45) holes (Figs. 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3). Drilling was concentrated 
in a 975-metre-wide area between West Goldbrook and East Goldbrook. The purpose of the drill 
program was to infill the previous drill programs and test the extension of gold mineralization to 
the east and west of the Boston-Richardson zone.
Drill core was logged, photographed and sampled at the Orex core facilities at Goldboro (Figure 
11.3). The drill core samples were sent to ALS Chemex in Timmins, Ontario, for preparation and 
analysis. A comprehensive QA/QC program was implemented for the drill program, the details of 
which are covered in Section 13.0 of this report.
Mr. Jean Lafleur, senior technical advisor to Orex, and Mr. Alex Horvath, P.Eng., Orex project 
manager  from  A.S.  Horvath  Engineering  Inc.  of  Ottawa  (Ontario),  were  the  Qualified  Persons 
supervising  the  drill  program.  The  on-site  supervisor  at  Goldboro,  Nova  Scotia,  was  William 
Shaw  (geologist  and  manager  for  W.G.  Shaw  &  Associates,  Antigonish,  Nova  Scotia).  Core 
logging was done by Jonathan Taylor, Jamie Braid, Bruce Mitchell and William Shaw.
Drilling was undertaken by Logan Drilling of Stewiacke, Nova Scotia, using NQ-diameter core. 
Whole core samples were collected from BR-08-01 to BR-08-16, and split core samples were 
collected from BR-08-17 to BR-08-44. Core was logged at the Orex building located on-site at 
the Goldboro property. A total of 12,345 samples taken from 44 holes were analyzed for gold by 
fire assay and metallic screen methods.
Drill hole sites were located by handheld GPS instruments prior to drilling. After completion of 
the  2008  program,  the  drill  hole  collars  were  surveyed  by  C.J.  MacLellan  and  Associates  Ltd 
using differential GPS surveying techniques (Fig. 11.2).
Downhole surveying of all drill holes was done using a Reflex EZ Shot instrument approximately 
every 50 metres along the hole.
The  casing  was  pulled  from  all  diamond  drill  holes,  and  all  holes  were  cemented  upon 
completion. A cement plug was installed about 50 centimetres below the bedrock surface, and a 
10  x  10  centimetre  post  inserted  and  labelled  with  the  DDH  number  (Fig.  11.2).  The  core  is 
stored in the Orex building located near the centre of the property (Fig. 11.3).
Drill hole collar locations are presented in Table 11.1, and a plan map showing the drill area is 
presented in Figure 11.1.

12.0  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH   (Item 14)
Historically,  the  severe  “nugget  effect”  produced  by  the  extreme  variability  in  gold  size  and 
distribution within the Goldboro mineralized belts forced companies to implement a number of 
sampling and grade determination programs. The nugget effect is so extreme that collecting and 
processing  samples  of  a  size  adequate  enough  to  overcome  the  nugget  effect  is  problematic 
using conventional analytical methods. The programs have resulted in a wide variety of sample 
types tested by several different processing protocols on the initial and sub-split sample sizes. 
Sample types have included:
(cid:120) surface and underground grab samples, 
(cid:120) surface and underground drill core samples, 
(cid:120) drill sludge samples, 
(cid:120) drill core composite samples,
(cid:120) underground chip samples, 
(cid:120) underground muck samples, and 
(cid:120) underground bulk samples.
The results from these tests clearly demonstrate that undersized initial samples and/or improper 
sub-split sizes for the crush and/or grind sizes could produce imprecise determinations of grade.
In  2005,  assay  samples  consisted  of  HQ-size  core  and  the  average  individual  sample  weight 
was estimated to be 7.75 kg per metre of recovered core. Recognized mineralized zones were 
assayed by conventional fire assay with atomic absorption or gravimetric finish and at the end of 
the program, sample composites (made by combining reject samples from multiple drill holes of 
the  initial  conventional  fire  assay  analysis)  were  prepared  and  sent  to  Lakefield  Research  for 
metallurgical testing.
In 2008, all samples were obtained from NQ-sized drill core, and the average individual sample 
weight for split intervals was estimated to be 2.4 kilograms per metre of recovered core. For the 
2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, all new sample results added to the Goldboro database were 
from NQ-sized drill core obtained during the 2008 campaign and from further assaying done in 
2009.  The  first  seventeen  (17)  drill  holes  (BR-08-01  to  BR-08-17)  of  the  2008  program  were 
sampled whole core. From BR-08-18 to BR-08-44, the core was cut/split, and half-core intervals 
were sent to the laboratory for assaying. The remaining half-core sampled intervals from these 
holes was kept for future reference.
The 2008 Orex drilling program was conducted under the supervision of J. Lafleur, P. Geo., and 
A.  Horvath,  P.  Eng.,  and  the  logging  and  sampling  were  performed  by  W.G.  Shaw,  P.Geo. 
Sections  of core  perceived  to  be  of  potential  economic  significance  were  sampled  (i.e.,  those 
containing sulphides or quartz veins, or displaying alteration). Although Orex agents claimed that 
geological  contacts  were  respected  during  sampling,  InnovExplo  representatives  noted  during 
the site visit and core review that some sample intervals locally overlapped different lithologies. 
At this time, the authors believe that it has no significant impact but it should be addressed in the 
future.
During the 2008 program, sample lengths were kept to a minimum of 0.5 metre and a maximum 
of 1 metre. Occasionally, sampling was carried out on a relatively isolated area of mineralization 
over  a  narrower  intersection  length,  and  the  sample  intervals  were  adjusted  accordingly  to  a 
minimum of 0.25 metre.
Sample collection was supervised by professional geologists and carried out by field assistants. 
There is no indication that anything in the sampling procedures, or in the sampling methods and 
approach, could have had a significant impact on the reliability of the reported assay results.

13.0  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY   (Item15)
In 2008, drill core was logged, photographed and sampled within the Orex building adjacent to 
Goldbrook  Lake  Road.  Whole-core  samples  were  collected  from  BR-08-01  to  BR-08-16  and 
split-core samples were collected from BR-08-17 to BR-08-44. The drill core samples were sent 
to ALS Chemex in Timmins, Ontario, for preparation and analysis. The fire assay method was 
used  with  atomic  absorption  (AA)  finish  on  a  50-gram  prepared  sample.  For  preparation,  the 
entire sample was crushed to 70% at <2 mm, then split to 250 grams using a riffle splitter and 
pulverized to 85% at 200 mesh. Samples from significant zones that graded above 2.5 g/t Au 
were  re-assayed  using  metallic  screen  methods  with  AA  and/or  gravimetric  finish,  whereas 
samples  from  significant  zones  yielding  0.5  to  2.5  g/t  Au  were  re-fire  assayed  from  coarse 
rejects.
A  field  duplicate  was  taken  every  25th  sample  on  the  second  half  of  the  core  for  the  same 
sample interval for the purposes of evaluating QA/QC precision. At every 50th sample, one of 
two certified reference standards was inserted in the sampling sequence. A field blank was also 
strategically inserted to follow a sample that was suspected of being high-grade or containing 
visible gold.
At the laboratory, each batch of 84 samples included analytical blanks, certified standards and 
pulp duplicates for internal quality control.
Historically, sample preparation protocols were, for the most part, fairly similar during the course 
of  exploration  at  the  Goldboro  project.  Prior  to  the  2005  program,  most  programs  employed 
conventional  sample  crushing,  splitting  and  grinding  specifications  prior  to  sample  size 
reduction.
Analytical methods used to determine the gold content of Goldboro samples were predominantly 
by  conventional  fire  assay  with  either  AA  and/or  gravimetric  finish.  The  most  significant 
difference  between  the  various  programs  has  been  the  size  of  the  sample  used  for  the  final 
analytical determination.
Except during the 2005 and 2008 sampling programs, quality control procedures for systematic 
measurement of precision, accuracy and monitoring for contamination of samples were limited 
or nonexistent.

14.0  DATA VERIFICATION   (Item 16)
InnovExplo’s data verification included a field visit, core review, minor modifications to the drill 
hole database, and some checks against original assay certificates provided by Orex.
On Thursday April 23, 2009, Alain Carrier and Donald Gervais, both of InnovExplo, visited the 
property  with  Mr.  Billings  and  Mr.  Lafleur,  representatives  of  Orex.  The 
InnovExplo 
representatives  met  William  Shaw  (geologist  and  manager),  Jonathan  Taylor  (geologist)  and 
Walter Smith (field assistant), all representatives of Orex, at the Goldboro core facilities in Nova 
Scotia. The site visit allowed InnovExplo to review the property access, drill sites and surface 
infrastructure, as well as the core intervals from drill holes BR-08-17, BR-08-27, BR-08-33 and 
BR-08-37. The core available for review was from the last twenty-nine (29) drill holes of the 2008 
program. The first seventeen (17) drill holes (BR-08-01 to BR-08-17) were whole-core sampled. 
From BR-08-18 onwards, the core was cut/split, half the core is available for review. The core 
from previous programs was not available for review.
During  the  site  visit,  InnovExplo  checked  preliminary  drill  logs  against  core  intervals  from  drill 
holes  BR-08-17,  BR-08-27,  BR-08-33  and  BR-08-37.  The  final  drill  logs  with  assay  results 
included  were  not  available  for  review  at  the  time  of  the  site  visit,  but  were  provided  later. 
InnovExplo noted some local differences between the drill logs and the observed core intervals. 
For example, a quartz vein described in the drill logs as extending for more than 1 metre along 
the  core  length  was  not  even  present  in  the  core  interval.  InnovExplo  also  discussed  the 
differences between rock types (shale versus arenite) described in the drill logs and what was 
observed in the core boxes. Moreover, although Orex agents claimed that geological contacts 
were respected during the sampling, InnovExplo representatives noted during the site visit and 
core review that some sample intervals locally overlapped different lithologies. For example, one 
sample interval started in the wall rock of a quartz vein and ended in the middle of the vein. This 
type  of  sampling  may  make  it  harder  to  distinguish  the  gold  grade  for  each  rock  type.  At  this 
time, the authors believe that it has no significant impact but it should be addressed in the future.
For  resource  estimation  purposes,  the  Gems  drill  hole  database  was  checked.  Minor 
modifications  to  the  database  were  made;  for  example,  some  questionable  surveys  were 
modified.
InnovExplo reviewed and checked some original assay certificates obtained for the 2008 drilling 
program. Assays from the certificates were verified against the drill hole database. InnovExplo 
did not uncover any discrepancies between original assay certificates provided by Orex and the 
Gems drill hole database.

15.0  ADJACENT PROPERTIES   (Item 17)
There are no adjacent active properties that are actively being explored or developed for gold 
mineralization.
16.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING   (Item 18)
In  2008,  there  was  no  mineral  processing  or  metallurgical  testing  conducted  on  the  Goldboro 
property.
In 2005, a small area of known shallow mineralization was tested by drilling fences of HQ-sized 
drill holes at a spacing of no greater than 25 metres between sections. Recognized mineralized 
zones were assayed using conventional fire assay with AA or gravimetric finish, and at the end 
of the program, sample composites (combined reject samples from multiple drill holes previously 
analyzed  by  conventional  fire  assay)  were  prepared  and  sent  to  Lakefield  Research  for 
metallurgical testing. Unlike fire assaying, the total extractive metallurgical tests were completed 
by processing the entire composite sample and recovering the total gold from the whole sample 
through a combination of gravity concentration and cyanide leaching of the gravity tails.
Roughly 55% of the composite samples originated from the NB123 South Limb Hinge and South 
Limb  Extension  zones.  The  metallurgical  test  results  from  the  NB123  South  Limb  zone, 
averaging 2.85 g/t gold, would likely be most representative of the anticipated mill head grade at 
Goldboro.
Other metallurgical test work was performed, predominantly by Lakefield Research and the CRM 
from 1988 through 1991. Additional work was completed in the mid-1990s, initiated by Placer 
Dome  Inc.  The  test  work  demonstrated  that  a  relatively  simple  mill  flow  sheet  of  gravity 
concentration  followed  by  flotation/cyanidation  would  yield  recoveries  well  over  90%  for 
Goldboro belt rock ores.
Metallurgical  tests  indicate  the  ores  are  not  refractory  and  that  relatively  coarse  grinding  to 
minus  28  mesh  will  liberate  15-30%  of  the  total  gold  to  a  gravity  concentrate.  Gravity 
concentration  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  a  necessary  process,  otherwise  coarse  gold 
particles  may  not  be  completely  recovered  downstream  by  flotation  and/or  cyanidation.  It  is 
significant to note this work indicated that 69% of coarse free gold was greater than 10 mesh in 
size. Further grinding of the ores to minus 150 to minus 200 mesh liberated virtually 100% of 
free gold.
In some cases, the mineralized belts are dark black, biotitic, sometimes carbonaceous, clay-rich 
sediments, silicified with variable amounts of quartz veining. The metallurgical test results from 
Lakefield  Research  (May  1988)  for  three  (3)  composite  samples  of  drill  core  indicated  no 
adverse effects caused by the graphitic/carbonaceous component robbing gold from pregnant 
solutions, and in any case, adverse effects could be prevented by introducing agents such as 
kerosene. Reagent consumption was also considered low.

17.0  MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES   (Item 19)
17.1  Historical and previous Mineral Resources Estimate
The 1990 drill-indicated ore reserves (historical resources, not compliant with Regulation 43-
101) were calculated in 1990 by Guy Parent, M.Sc., at the request of Orex (Parent, 1990). 
The  mineral  evaluation  study  was  done  using  polygons  calculated  from  geological  cross 
sections drawn in at ore grade intersections along drill holes and linked together whenever 
possible.  This  resource  estimate  was  completed  prior  to  National  Instrument  43-101 
disclosure regulations and is considered to be historical in nature, non-compliant with current 
regulations, and no longer relevant.
The  1990  estimation  was  audited  in  detail  by  MRB  &  Associates  in  August  of  2004 
(Bourgoin,  2004).  The  mineral 
inventory  was  carefully  reviewed  and  subsequently 
reclassified into the Measured and Indicated Resource category in order to comply with NI 
43-101. The correction factors used to estimate grade—which were often used by Orex in 
previous reports—were defined and applied for the purpose of the 2004 estimation.
In August 2006, a new resource estimation was compiled by Alex S. Horvath, P.Eng., and 
reviewed  by  P  &  E  Mining  Consultants  Inc.  This  estimate  was  made  using  metallurgical 
sample  results  obtained  from  HQ-sized  core  samples  (2005  drilling  program).  The  results 
were published in an R-43-101 technical report signed by Tracy Armstrong, Eugene Puritch 
and Alex Horvath (Armstrong et al., 2006). The resource estimate detailed in the 2006 report 
included a new estimate for a 225-metre strike length of the Goldboro deposit from section 
8575E to 8800E and down to a vertical depth of 200 metres below surface. The estimate 
was  reconciled  with  the  company’s  previously  reported  NI-43-101  resource  estimate  that 
was calculated over a 1.5-kilometre strike length in the Goldboro deposit to a vertical depth 
of 300 metres (the “NB123 zone”). This resource estimate was valid as of August 21, 2006.
17.2  Methodology 
The  resource  estimate  detailed  in  this  report  was  made  using  3D  modeling  and  the  block 
model interpolation method for a 1,550-metre strike length corridor of the Goldboro deposit 
from section 8050E to 9600E and down to a vertical depth of 650 metres below surface.
BOSTON RICHARDSON AREA
The Boston Richardson area has been interpreted from transverse sections spaced 12.5 or 
25 metres apart and plan views spaced every 10 metres in an area with a strike length of 
500 metres, a width of 200 metres, and a vertical depth of 450 m. Geological continuity is 
sufficient  in  this  area  to  classify  much  of  the  mineral  resource  into  the  Measured  and 
Indicated  categories.  About  two  thirds  of  the  2008  drilling  program  was  dedicated  to  this 
area.
WEST GOLDBROOK AREA
The West Goldbrook area has been interpreted from transverse sections spaced 25 to 50 
metres apart and plan views spaced every 10 metres along a 250-metre wide corridor with a 
strike length of 500 metres and a vertical depth of 300 metres. Even though the drill pattern 
is regular (25-m spacing), the structure controlling gold mineralization is not well understood 
and the drill density did not allow the resource to be assigned to the Indicated category. The

quartz-bearing  argillite  (shale)  beds  are  also  thinner  and  fewer  in  this  area.  Mineral 
resources from this sector have been tagged as an Inferred Resource.
EAST GOLDBROOK AREA
The East Goldbrook area has been interpreted from transverse sections spaced 50 metres 
apart and plan views spaced every 10 metres over a 300-metre wide corridor with a strike 
length of 550 metres and a vertical depth of 600 metres. Eight (8) of the belts are located 
stratigraphically above the Boston Richardson belt, and five (5) are below, for a total of 14 
including  Boston  Richardson.  Information  from  this  package  of  belts  was  upgraded  from 
surface to a depth of 200 metres using data from the 2008 drilling program, and resulted in 
the identification of Indicated Resources in the upper part.
17.2.1  Drill hole database 
A  diamond  drill  hole  database  was  created  using  Gemcom  software  for  the  Goldboro 
project  and  consisted  of  209  surface  and  112  underground  diamond  drill  holes  with 
conventional analytical gold assay results, as well as coded lithologies from the drill core 
logs.  The  321  drill  holes  cover  a  1.55-kilometre  strike  length  of  the  Goldboro  deposit, 
although  199  of  the  holes  are  contained  within  the  250-metre  strike  length  of  the  ramp 
area, from section 8550E to 8800E and from surface down to a depth of 200 metres. Only 
122 drill holes have been drilled outside this ramp area along the remaining 1.3-kilometre 
strike length of the deposit. Of the 182 holes in the ramp area, 112 were drilled from the 
70-metre level drift in ring patterns on 12.5-metre spaced sections.
Also included in the database are 36 bulk composite metallurgical test results from a total 
of  503  drill  core  samples  collected  during  a  23-hole  large-diameter  drilling  program 
completed in 2005. Twenty-one (21) of these metallurgical composites were systematically 
taken from within the best defined part of the “NB123” mineral zone in the ramp area of the 
Goldboro deposit. Conventional analytical gold assay results for the same samples were 
completed and also included in the database. All the header (i.e., co-ordinate), survey (i.e., 
down-hole)  and  lithological  data,  as  well  as  the  conventional  assay  grades  and 
metallurgical recovery grades, were validated within the Gemcom database. No erroneous 
entries  were  found.  In  addition  to  the  basic  tables  of  raw  data,  the  database  contains 
several  composite  tables  containing  assorted  drill  hole  and  wireframe  solid  intersection 
composite calculations required for statistical evaluation and resource block modeling. The 
database contains a total of 21,675 assays taken from 51,037 metres of drilled core. Holes 
that  were  not  sampled  and  have  no  assay  data  were  not  considered  in  the  grade 
interpolation but were used for the 3D modeling. These holes are: BR-117, BR-114B, BR-
114, BR-115, BR-116, BR-116B, BR84-01, BR88-05 and BR-87-38.
The  only  change  to  the  database  since  the  2006  NI-43-101  report  is  the  addition  of  45 
holes, 12,345 new assays, and 12,201.5 meters of drilled core, all of which are from the 
2008 drilling program.
17.2.2  Domain interpretation 
In  order  to  facilitate  resource  modeling  of  the  Goldboro  deposit,  it  was  necessary  to 
construct  several  domain  wireframe  solid  models 
the  grade 
interpolation. These included:

zones.
a.  A mineral zone/rock model that delimits the geologically defined extent of the mineral
b.  A structural domain model to enable separate grade interpolations within the South 
Limb and North Limb domains both above and below the Boston Richardson horizon.  
c.  A  metallurgical  composite  model  that  defines  the  limits  of  influence  for  the
metallurgical composite grade interpolations in the Measured Resource category.
Mineralized-zone model and structural domains
17.2.2.1
In  2009,  a  new  mineralized-zone  solid  model  was  constructed  for  the  Goldboro  area 
using a 1.5-kilometre strike length corridor measuring 300 metres wide and extending 
up to 600 metres below surface. The new mineralized-zone model was constructed to 
outline  zones  of  continuous  mineralization  that  were  generally,  but  not  necessarily, 
defined  by  the  limits  of  the  shale  host  units  that  are  folded  along  an  anticlinal  axis 
trending 100º Az with a –30º plunge. The south and north limbs of the anticline dip –65º 
and –70º, respectively. The mineralized-zone model combines the multiple and closely 
spaced  “slate”  belts  of  the  earlier  model  (developed  before  2005)  into  larger  single 
zones. The narrow interbeds of greywacke between the closely spaced shale units are 
adequately mineralized to support the wider zones of the mineralized-zone model.
Once  all  the  zones  were  identified,  a  structural  model  was  defined  to  divide  the 
mineralized-zone  model  into  south-  and  north-dipping  domains,  with  the  hinge  area 
included in the south-dipping domain. The plane was developed into two solids, each of 
which envelops all blocks in the south- and north-dipping domains, respectively. During 
grade  interpolation,  the  solids  were  used  so  that  blocks  could  be  selected  within  the 
specific domain using the search ellipse orientations specific to each.
A few weeks before the final report was completed, a reinterpretation of the last 500 
metres  in  the  western  portion  of  the  deposit  produced  a  new  model  with  a  similar 
volume to the initial model. Starting from the main fault section at 8600E and ending 
500 metres to the west on section 8100E, this reinterpretation changes the modeling of 
the North and South limbs, showing a displacement to the north by 50 metres along a 
fault. This new modeling has not been integrated into the present resource estimation. 
InnovExplo  considers  that  the  final  tonnage  and  grade  numbers  should  not  be 
significantly  affected  by  this  new  interpretation,  but  it  should  be  taken  into  account 
during future work.

The wireframe solids of the mineralized zone model were created by digitizing an interpretation 
onto 12.5- to 100-metre spaced sections across the 1.5-km strike length, and then using tie lines 
between sections to complete the wireframes for each solid.
Metallurgical composites solid model
17.2.2.2
In order to use the best available grade data (i.e., metallurgical grades) for the resource 
estimation,  a  clipping  polygon  was  digitized  onto  the  longitudinal  section  in  the  ramp 
area  to  delimit  the  extent  of  each  of  the  21  metallurgical  composites  and  their  285 
corresponding sample assays within the 1-2-3 South Limb zone. The clipping polygon 
was  designed  with  respect  to  the  search  ellipse  parameters,  taking  into  account  the 
lengths of the major (30 m) and semi-major (22 m) axes. The metallurgical composite 
solid was obtained by cutting the 1-2-3 South Limb solid against the clipping polygon. 
The  metallurgical-composite  solid  was  used  for  block  selection  when  estimating  the 
Measured  Resources  because  it  used  the  more  precise  metallurgically  recovered 
grades.  In  addition,  the  metallurgical-composite  model  was  used  to  make  a  direct 
comparison  of  grades  for  the  same  samples:  those  estimated  by  metallurgical  grade 
determinations versus conventional assay determinations.
Figure 17.3 displays the spatial relationship of the 1-2-3 South Limb zone (light red) and 
the metallurgical-composite model (dark red) within this zone. The ramp, historical mine 
workings, and the twenty-three (23) diamond drill holes from the 2005 metallurgical test 
program are also shown.

17.2.3  Assay data, verification and treatment 
For drilling prior to 2008, Armstrong et al. (2006; pp. 51-52) verified the assay data entries 
for 3,173 gold assay intervals. A few minor data entry errors were observed and corrected. 
The  verified  intervals  were  checked against  assay  laboratory  certificates  from:  ALS 
Chemex of Val-d’Or, Quebec; Lakefield Research of Lakefield, Ontario; Assayers (Ontario) 
Limited of Toronto, Ontario; and Les Laboratoires XRAL of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. The 
checked assays represented 71% of the data used for the 2006 Resource Estimate and 
approximately 44% of the entire database at the time.
Basic  univariate  statistics  were  completed  on  point  area  files  containing  raw  analytical 
assay  data  for  different  populations,  namely  assays  performed  by  double  metallurgical 
screen (DMS) and assays performed by fire assay or metallic screen.

Because different drill core sampling and analytical methods were used over the years, two (2) 
populations were defined and used for statistical analysis: one population of double metallurgical 
screen assays and the other population with conventional fire assays + metallic screen analyses 
(Table  17.2).  Most  of  the  data  falls  into  the  fire  assay  +  metallic  screen  population  (20,210), 
compared to the double metallurgical screen assays (1,465).
Sampling completed during the 1988 and 1989 drill programs (mainly DMS assays) used longer 
than conventional sample intervals (i.e., composites from 1.5 to 12.5+ metres, with the longest at 
105 metres) in an attempt to collect larger samples and overcome the gold “nugget” effect. As 
the  statistics  indicate,  the  method  used  in  1988-89  clearly  biased  the  average  width  of  the 
population.

populations.

17.2.4  Grade capping and compositing 
The  normal  histogram  of  gold  grades  for  the  conventional  assay  population  (Fig.  17.7) 
displays  a  cut-off  grade  at  125  g/t,  which  means  that  fourteen  (14)  assays  should  be 
capped. Because the highest value in the DMS population is 48.69 g/t Au, no capping was 
applied  to  this  population.  The  14  capped  assays  all  belong  to  the  conventional  assay 
population. Log-probability plots support these numbers.

Figure 17.8 – Log-normal probability plot for the conventional assay population
In order to minimize any bias introduced by the highly variable sample lengths, the capped 
gold  assays  were  composited  to  1.0-metre  equal  lengths  within  all  intervals  that  define 
each of the mineralized zones. All composites generated within the assayed interval were 
considered. Of the 15,038 composites used for block model interpolation, only 2.7% were 
less than 0.5 metre wide and 1.5% less were than 0.25 metre. No grades were assigned to 
missing sample intervals. Tests were also performed using 2.5-metre composites, but the 
resulting variation of resource numbers was insignificant.
An evaluation of sample assay precision (i.e., reproducibility of duplicate sample assays) 
was completed on data obtained prior to the 2008 drilling program (refer Armstrong et al., 
2006; pp.53-55 for details).
17.2.5  Variography 
Since  the  down-hole  oriented  samples  are  the  most  closely  spaced  samples  in  the 
database,  the  linear  variogram  provides  the  best  estimate  of  the  nugget  value  (i.e., 
variation in grade for the same sample point). In addition, because the holes are oriented 
to cut across the width of the mineralization, the linear variogram provides an indication of 
the  range  of  influence  across  the  width  of  mineralization  and  the  tertiary  axis  of  the 
search/interpolation ellipse. Down-hole linear variography was completed on the 1.0-metre 
equal-length composites of the capped gold assay data to establish the best estimate of 
the “nugget” value and the range of grade continuity across the width of the mineralized 
zones. The modeled linear variogram is shown below as Figure 17.9.

A  3D  directional-specific  variography  was  completed  using  the  1.0-metre  equal-length 
composites  of  the  capped  gold  assay  data  for  individual  North  Limb  and  South  Limb 
populations confined to the mineralized-zone solids. Investigation involved 10º incremental 
searches in the horizontal plane, followed by 5º to 10º incremental searches in the vertical 
planes  of  the  indicated  preferred  azimuths,  as  well  as  planes  normal  to  the  preferred 
azimuth. The best-fit variograms are shown below as Figures 17.10 to 17.13.

The  results  of  the  linear  and  3D  variographic  investigations  are  consistent  with  the 
univariate  statistics  and  correlate  with  geological  features  of  the  deposit.  The  linear 
variogram of the 1-metre composite population cut at 125 g/t Au shows a reduced nugget 
value  at  2.47.  The  cross-width  continuity  or  range  is  16.5  metres.  The  3D  directional-
specific  investigations  yielded  the  best-fit  models  along  orientations  that  roughly 
correspond  to  the  strike/plunge  of  the  mineralized  zones  defined  by  the  axis  of  the 
anticlinal fold (100º/–30º). The best-fit model for the South Limb is about 100º in strike, 
plunging –20º in the down-dip direction of –65, and 100º in strike, plunging –10º in the 
down-dip direction of –75 for the North Limb of the anticline.
The  3D  variography  produces  two  specific  ellipses  for  each  of  the  South  and  North 
domains  of  the  deposit;  however,  an  important  characteristic  of  the  data  is  also 
demonstrated  by  the  down-strike/down-plunge  modeled  variogram  shown  in  Figures 
17.10  and  17.13.  The  fitted  curves  of  these  variograms  are  nested,  comprised  of  two 
models, and indicate the influence of two sub-populations each with a nugget component 
and  range.  The  nested  model  is  consistent  with  the  high-grade  and  low-grade 
subpopulations indicated by the log-normal histogram in Figure 17.6. InnovExplo is of the 
opinion that these variograms define the limits of correlation for the low- and high-grade 
subpopulations of assay data in each of the South and North limb domains, respectively. 
The  following  table  summarizes  the  search  and  interpolation  ellipse  orientations  and 
ranges derived from the variography. The Indicated category has been fixed at one-third 
(1/3) of the Inferred influence.

For  the  Measured  category  (located  only  in  the  1-2-3  South  Limb  zone),  the  search  ellipse 
azimuth and dip are the same as for the South Limb discussed above. The anisotropy used was 
40 metres for the long axis, 40 metres for the Y axis, and 20 metres for the Z axis. No high-
grade range restriction was applied.
17.2.6  Metallurgical treatment 
In  1990,  metallurgical  tests  were  completed  on  two  (2)  separate,  large  bulk  composite 
samples  weighing  in  excess  of  five  (5)  tonnes  each.  Furthermore,  a  systematic  large-
diameter  drill  core  and  metallurgical  test  program  completed  in  2005  included  the 
processing of 36 individual bulk composite samples weighing 40 to 120 kilograms each for 
a total weight in excess of 2.7 tonnes. Seventeen (17) of the 36 composites (1.44 tonnes 
in  total)  were  taken  from  within  a  well-defined  portion  of  the  1-2-3  South  Limb  zone. 
Results  of  the  metallurgically  recovered  grades  were  compared  with  original  gold  assay 
results from the same 285 drill core samples comprising the 17 composites from within the 
same zone. A review of all metallurgical test results indicates that any resources estimated
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
75
www.innovexplo.com
using metallurgical gold grades would be in the order of 65% higher than those estimated 
using  conventional  assay  gold  grades;  however,  a  correction  factor  cannot  be  directly 
applied to the assay data to account for the difference. The “up-grade” factor is a global 
average and is not valid for individual samples and local variations to be expected within 
the model (refer to Armstrong et al., 2006; pp. 60-61).
For the 2008 drilling program, about 1,200 individual samples from the 12,345 fire assayed 
samples were re-assayed using the metallic screen method, but the latter are not included 
in the current resource estimation because they were unavailable at the time this report 
was prepared.
InnovExplo is of the opinion that metallurgically determined gold grade data is required to 
estimate Measured Resources for the Goldboro project. Presently, only a portion of the 1-
2-3  South  Limb  zone  between  0  and  100  metres  below  surface  elevation  is  defined 
adequately enough by metallurgical test grades to allow for a determination of Measured 
Resources.
17.2.7  Bulk density 
In  the  2006  Resource  Estimation,  a  bulk  density  of  2.7  was  derived  from  nine  (9) 
verification samples measured by ALS Chemex, and was assigned to all rock types (refer 
to Armstrong et al., 2006; p. 65).
Since no new density data was available for use in 2009, the same specific gravity (2.7) 
was  applied  to  all  rock  types  for  our  estimation.  Bulk  density  was  used  to  calculate 
tonnages  from  the  volumetric  estimates  of  the  resource-grade  block  model.  Each  block 
with an assigned rock code (section 17.2.9) was assigned a specific gravity of 2.7.
17.2.8  Block model geometry 
A  block  model  was  established  over  a  1.5-kilometre  segment  of  the  2.5-kilometre  strike 
length of the known Goldboro mineralization to a depth of 750 metres below surface. The 
limits of the block model are as follows:
From 8100E to 9600E (300 columns x 5 m each) 
From 6650N to 7300N (260 rows x 2.5 m each) 
From level 5050 to level 4300 (150 levels x 5 m each)
The block model has parallel orientation, with the X-axis oriented along an east azimuth. 
The individual block cells have dimensions of 5 metres long (X) by 2.5 metres wide (Y) by 
5 metres vertical (Z). The block dimensions reflect the dimension of the mineralized zones. 
In  order  to  avoid  overlaps  in  rock  code  identification,  two  block  models  were  generated 
with the exact same limits, shapes and dimensions. Table 17.6 shows each block model 
with its interpolated zones.

17.2.9  Mineralized zone block model 
All blocks that were greater than 0.001% within the selected mineralized-zone solids were 
assigned a rock code corresponding to the mineralized-zone solids. A percent block model 
was generated reflecting the proportion of each block inside every mineralized solid. The 
percent  block  model  was  used  in  the  resource  estimation  process.  A  total  of  749,466 
blocks of the mineralized zone block model were coded with mineralized zone rock codes. 
A total of 4,109 of these blocks occur within the metallurgical composite solid of the 1-2-3 
South Limb zone. All remaining blocks were assigned code “0” for waste rock.
17.2.10  Grade block model 
As  per  the  geostatistical  results  detailed  in  this  report,  a  grade  model  was  interpolated 
using  a  combination  of  the  metallurgical  recovery  grade  data  and  conventional  assay 
grade  data  to  produce  the  best  possible  grade  estimate  for  the  defined  resources  at 
Goldboro. A set of ten (10) interpolation profiles was established for grade estimation in 
the grade model. The interpolation profiles were customized to estimate grades separately 
within the North Limb and South Limb structural domains, as well as separately for blocks 
within  and  outside  the  metallurgical  composite  solid.  The  inverse  distance  square  and 
ordinary  kriging  methods,  both  considering  capping  and  no  capping  for  the  high-grade 
values,  were  performed  and  compared.  The  method  retained  for  the  final  resource 
estimation was ordinary kriging with capping of high-grade values.
Two point-area workspaces providing the X, Y, Z and gold data points were used for block 
interpolation in the grade model. For blocks within the metallurgical composite solid, the 
1.0-metre  composite  points  of  the  metallurgically  recovered  grades  were  specified  for 
interpolation.  For  all  other  blocks  inside  the  mineralized-zone  solids  but  outside  the 
metallurgical composite solids, the 1.0-metre composites of the gold assays cut to 125 g/t 
Au were specified. The composite points in each of the point-area files were assigned rock 
codes and block codes corresponding to the mineralized zone in which they occur. The
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
77
www.innovexplo.com
interpolation profiles specify a single target and sample rock code for each mineralized-
zone  solid,  thus  establishing  hard  boundaries  between  the  mineralized  zones  and 
preventing estimation of block grades from sample points with different integer block codes 
than  the  block  being  estimated.  The  search/interpolation  ellipse  orientations  and  ranges 
defined in the ten (10) interpolation profiles used for grade estimation correspond to those 
developed in Section 17.2.5, Table 17.14 of this report (Variography).
Other specifications to control grade estimation are as follows:
Measured category for the 1-2-3 South Limb zone
• inverse distance square interpolation method for data points; 
• minimum of one (1) and maximum of six (6) sample points in the search ellipse for
interpolation;
• maximum of six (6) sample points from any one hole; 
• no capping of high-grade values.
Indicated and Inferred categories for South Limb
• ordinary Kriging interpolation method for data points; 
• minimum of two (2) and maximum of twenty (20) sample points in the search ellipse 
for interpolation; 
• maximum of six (6) sample points from any one hole; 
• high-grade values capped; 
• nugget effect at 0; 
• sill at 22 for spherical model 1 and at 18.5 for spherical model 2 on a total of 40.5.
Indicated and Inferred categories for North Limb
• ordinary Kriging interpolation method of data points; 
• minimum of two (2) and maximum of twenty (20) sample points in search ellipse for 
interpolation; 
• maximum of six (6) sample points from any one hole; 
• high-grade values capped (as above); 
• nugget effect at 0; 
• sill at 1.65 for spherical model 1 and 3.03 for spherical model 2 on total of 4.55.
17.2.11  Resource category block model 
The  Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred  categories  were  identified  in  the  interpolation 
process based on search ellipse criteria and specific interpolation parameters. In order to 
generate  the  final  resource  grades  for  the  block  model,  the  Measured  category 
interpolation  profile  for  the  metallurgical  domain  was  executed  first.  Blocks  for  the 
Measured  category  were  selected  when  at  least  10%  of  the  block  was  inside  the 
metallurgical solid. In the second step, the Indicated interpolation profiles were executed 
for  the  South  and  North  domains,  but  excluded  already  identified  Measured  blocks. 
Subsequently,  isolated  blocks  or  a  series  of  blocks  that  showed  no  spatial  continuity  in 
terms of grade and/or density of information were reclassified as Inferred. The rest of the 
Inferred  category  was  identified  in  the  final  interpolation  step  by  considering  only  the 
uncategorized  blocks.  Only  blocks  having  an  assigned  rock  code  were  interpolated  for 
grade and resource categories.

17.2.12  Gold cut-off grade determination 
An  appropriate  gold  cut-off  grade  above  which  all  mineralization  is  deemed  potentially 
economic should be determined for the resources in the Goldboro model. The resources in 
this estimate are considered to be amenable to an open pit mining scenario at a cut-off 
grade determined as follows:
Determination of a cut-off grade for Goldboro resource estimation
Assumptions:
Resources above 0.5 g/t = 17,000,000 tonnes
Stripping ratio around 6:1
Based on CostMine, Infomine USA, Inc., and Mining Cost Services: 
-  5,000 t/day operation 
-  Operating cost: US$20.4/t 
-  Processing cost: US$14.7/t for a carbon-in-pulp mill at 5,000 t/day
Gold price: US$750/oz 
Exchange rate: C$1.1/US$
Process recovery: 95%

The cut-off grade would therefore equal:
= ($20.4 + $14.7)/ (((750*1.1)/31.1035)*.95) 
= 1.4 g/t
The selected cut-off grade for the Resource Estimation in this report has been fixed at 1.5 g/t 
Au.
17.3  Mineral Resource Classification, Category or Definition
In  order  to  comply  with  Regulation  43-101,  the  following  definitions  were  applied  for  the 
purpose of classification in the 2009 Goldboro study.
Resource
Resource:  means  a  deposit  or  concentration  of  a  natural,  solid,  inorganic  or  fossilized 
organic  substance,  other  than  natural  ground  water,  petroleum,  natural  gas,  bitumen  or 
related hydrocarbons, in such quantity and at such a grade or quality that extraction of the 
material at a profit is currently or potentially possible. Resources are categorized as follows 
on the basis of the degree of confidence in the estimate of quantity and grade of the deposit.
Inferred Resource
Inferred resource: means the estimated quantity and grade of a deposit, or a part thereof, 
that is determined on the basis of limited sampling, but for which there is sufficient geological 
information and a reasonable understanding of the continuity and distribution of metal values 
to outline a deposit of potential economic merit.
Indicated Resource
Indicated  Resource:  means  the  estimated  quantity  and  grade  of  that  part  of  a  deposit  for 
which the continuity of grade, together with the extent and shape, are so established that a 
reliable estimate of grade and tonnage can be made.
Measured Resource
Measured  resource:  means  the  estimated  quantity  and  grade  of  that  part  of  a  deposit  for 
which  the  size,  configuration  and  grade  have  been  well  established  by  observation  and 
sampling of outcrops, drill holes, trenches and mine workings.
Reserve
Reserve: means that part of a resource which can be legally mined at a profit under specified 
economic conditions that are generally accepted by the mining industry as reasonable under 
current economic conditions, demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study based 
on measured resources and indicated resources only. Reserves are categorized as follows 
on  the  basis  of  the  degree  of  confidence  in  the  estimate  of  the  quantity  and  grade  of  the 
deposit.
Proven Reserve
Proven reserve: means, for the part of a deposit which is being mined or developed or which 
is the subject of a mining plan, the estimated quantity and grade of that part of a measured 
resource  for  which  the  size,  grade  and  distribution  of  values,  together  with  technical  and 
economic factors, are so well established that there is the highest degree of confidence in 
the estimate.

Probable Reserve
Probable  reserve:  means  the  estimated  quantity  and  grade  of  that  part  of  a  measured  or 
indicated  resource  for  which  the  economic  viability  has  been  demonstrated  by  adequate 
information on engineering, operating and economic factors, with sufficient accuracy to be 
used as a basis for decisions on further development and significant capital expenditures.
17.4  Resource estimation
Considering the density of the processed data, the poorly-defined geological continuity in the 
western  portion  of  the  deposit,  the  search  ellipse  criteria,  and  specific  interpolation 
parameters,  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  current  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  can 
only be classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources. The estimate is compliant 
with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves. A minimum 
mining width of 1.5 metres (true width) and a cut-off grade at 1.5 g/t Au were considered for 
the resource estimation.
InnovExplo estimates that the Goldboro project has Measured and Indicated Resources of 
2,711,000  metric  tonnes  grading  4.56  g/t  Au  for  a  total  of  397,200  ounces.  Total  Inferred 
Resources  are  estimated  at  3,438,000  metric  tonnes  grading  3.67  g/t  Au  for  a  total  of 
405,900 ounces at a cut-off grade off 1.50 g/t Au

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS   (Item 21)
The  Goldboro  gold  project  of  Orex  Exploration  Inc.  is  an  advanced  stage  exploration  project 
hosting  a  significant  Mineral  Resource.  The  project  is  also  characterized  by  additional 
exploration potential. Exploration drilling completed by Orex at Goldboro in 2008 has continued 
to  upgrade  the  property  and  enhance  the  gold  potential.  InnovExplo  recommends  additional 
work to confirm and augment the economic potential of the project.
Results  of  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (cut-off  grade  of  1.50  g/t  Au)  are  as  follows: 
270,000  tonnes  grading  4.99  g/t  Au  (43,300  ounces)  within  the  Measured  category; 
2,441,000  tonnes  at  5.99  g/t  Au  (353,900  ounces)  within  the  Indicated  category;  and 
3,438,000  tonnes  grading  3.67  g/t  Au  (405,900  ounces)  within  the  Inferred  category.  The 
Measured and Indicated Resource represents a total of 2,711,000 tonnes grading 4.56 g/t Au
(397,200  ounces).  The  resource  estimate  published  in  this  technical  report  was  compiled  by 
Donald Gervais, P.Geo. (OGQ #520), and Alain Carrier, M.Sc., P.Geo. (OGQ #281).
Past  metallurgical  test  work  demonstrated  that  bulk  metallurgical  grade  determinations  of 
composite  drill  core  samples  are  more  accurate  than  determinations  made  by  conventional 
assaying of drill core samples. For the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, only resources defined 
from  bulk  metallurgical  grade  have  been  classified  as  Measured.  The  area  of  Measured 
Resources is confined to the ramp area where continuity has been confirmed by underground 
development.  A  significant  portion  of  the  Indicated  Resources  within  the  ramp  area  could  be 
converted to Measured Resources simply by completing additional drilling to produce composite 
samples for metallurgical grade determinations within the respective mineralized zones.
Most of the Indicated Resources are located in the proximal extensions of the ramp area (within 
a few hundred meters) where geological continuity of the mineralized zones area is generally 
well enough established to categorize all the resources as Indicated. One other criterion used to 
classify the resource as Indicated was the presence of at least 3 or 4 holes in the same area 
with  consistent  grade.  For  isolated  holes  with  or  without  grade,  resources  inside  the  search 
ellipse have been classified as Inferred no matter of the distance from the hole.
The  geological  continuity  and  the  grades  are  generally  well  defined  by  the  321  drill  holes, 
including 112 underground holes in closely spaced section ring drilled patterns, 175 metres of 
underground drifting along strike (70 metres below surface), and 17 bulk composite metallurgical 
test samples within the mineralized zone. On the other hand, all the resources in the western 
portion  of  the  deposit  (west  of  section  8600E)  have  been  classified  as  Inferred  because  the 
geological  continuity  of  the  mineralized  zones  in  this  area  is  generally  not  well  enough 
established to categorize resources as Indicated. An even more important reason, however, is 
the presence of a fault trending N75E on section 8600E, displacing the western portion over an 
unknown distance.
The  Goldboro  mineralization  was  modeled  under  current  CIM  resource  definitions  and  in 
accordance  with  accepted  industry  practices.  Regulation  43-101  reporting  standards  and 
formats  were  followed  in  this  document  in  order  to  report  the  mineral  resources  in  a  fully 
compliant manner.
The  Measured  and  Indicated  Resources  as  reported  have  demonstrable  mineralized  shape, 
continuity  and  grade,  which  has  been  well  established  over  a  1,500-metre  strike  length  from 
section 8100E to 9600E and to a vertical depth of 500 metres below surface.
Many  historical  holes  (97  completed  pre-2004)  were  improperly  sampled,  resulting  in  some
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
86
www.innovexplo.com
blank areas where no samples appear. Sampling at the time was done using visual guides, with 
shale  and  quartz  veins  most  commonly  selected  for  assaying.  Because  the  recent  modeling 
includes other types of coarser material, like arenite or greywacke, it includes some previously 
unsampled areas. Assuming a grade of zero for any areas with missing samples will, of course, 
affect the estimated number of ounces of gold. The recent drilling programs (2004 to 2008) are 
therefore important in this regard as they adequately sample the mineralized zones (i.e., no gap 
in the mineralized envelop). As for the remaining unsampled areas, InnovExplo is of the opinion 
that they may carry some gold, although most likely at a lower grade.
Goldboro Geological Model 
The  InnovExplo  geological  model  used  for  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  based  on:  (i) 
lithologies  (mainly  shale,  but  locally  including  coarser  grained  material  such  as  arenite  and 
greywacke);  (ii)  the  occurrence  of  veins  and  veinlets;  (iii)  gold  grades;  and  (iv)  some  findings 
arising from historical mining work (e.g., the fold shape of the Boston-Richardson stope). The 
Goldboro mineralized system was interpreted as a series of belts of various shapes, with some 
belts joined together due to proximity criteria and/or a minimum mining width consideration. The 
limbs of the various belts dip steeply towards the north and south, and generally do not exceed 
the  minimum  mining  width.  The  limbs  form  narrower  zones  appear  to  be  less  mineralized. 
Locally,  individual  zones  or  belts  significantly  increase  in  size  in  the  fold  hinges.  InnovExplo 
believes  that  hinges  were  the  site  of  locally  intense  fracturing  (dilatational  zones)  and  vein 
stockworks.  In  the  hinges,  the  belts  contain  various  rock  types,  and  as  a  consequence,  their 
grades and the presence of veining become more important features in the interpretations.
Two  different  approaches  to  geological  modeling  can  be  used  for  resource  estimation  at 
Goldboro:  the  mineralized  zones  can  be  interpreted  as  either:  (i)  narrower  and  higher  grade 
folded belts (about sixteen (16) belts); or (ii) they can be grouped into larger structural domains 
(about four (4) domains). For the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo opted for the first 
approach (e.g., individual belts rather than domains).
In  both  approaches,  the  higher  grade  material  is  in  similar  locations—fold  hinges  where 
maximum dilation seems to have occurred—although differences can occur in the distribution of 
lower grade material. Some tests have been completed using the two different approaches, and 
both models gave similar totals for contained ounces.
The  use  of  larger  domains  directly  increases  the  number  of  unsampled  intervals  within  the 
estimated zones. In the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo has assigned a value of 0 
g/t  Au  to  unsampled  intervals.  More  drilling  is  needed  to  confirm  whether  these  unsampled 
intervals contain any gold.
Goldboro Property Additional Potential 
The current geological model is constrained between section 8050mE and section 9600mE over 
a strike length of 1,550 metres, and extends from surface to a maximum depth of 520 metres. 
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the resource blocks are located within the first 200 metres of the 
surface.  The  Dolliver  Mountain  area  (historical  shaft),  where  intense stockworking  occurs  in  a 
fold hinge, was not included in this Mineral Resource Estimate.
InnovExplo states that the probabilities of adding new resources to the existing mineral inventory 
are excellent, particularly towards the Dolliver Mountain area where no modern exploration has 
been  done.  InnovExplo  recommends  drilling  the  area  between  Goldboro  and  the  Dolliver 
Mountain  area,  which  opens  up  a  potential  segment  measuring  1,500  metres  in  strike  length. 
Limited drilling at depth in the main Goldboro area also shows some additional potential.

20.0  RECOMMENDATIONS   (Item 22)
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the character of the Goldboro property is of sufficient merit to 
justify  the  recommended  program.  The  recommended  work  program  is  divided  into  two  (2) 
phases. Expenditures for the Phase I work program are estimated at $2,141,875. The accurate 
cost for the Phase II work program (permitting, 10,000-tonne bulk sample, metallurgical testing) 
would be established during a scoping study, which would need to be completed during Phase I. 
Order-of-magnitude  expenditures  for  the  Phase  II  work  program  will  be  in  the  range  of 
$3,530,500 to $4,853,000. The design of the second phase of the program is conditional on the 
success of the first phase.
Phase I – Drilling Program, Updated Mineral Resource Estimate and Scoping Study
Phase 1a) Diamond drilling program – Segment from West Goldbrook to Dolliver Mountain
Significant Inferred Resources could potentially be added by drilling from section 8100E (that is, 
from the fault zone) to a distance of 1,500 metres to the west. This area has not been covered 
by  modern  exploration  and  no  historical  drilling  has  been  recorded.  This  area  includes  1 
kilometre along the strike of the Goldboro structure from West Goldbrook to Dolliver Mountain 
and an additional 500 metres west of Dolliver Mountain. A drilling program of 8,750 metres in 
±35 drill holes (Phase 2D and 2E of Orex) is recommended along the remaining segment from 
West Goldbrook to Dolliver Mountain.
Phase 1b) Diamond drilling program – Testing the grade of unsampled intervals from historical 
drill holes
In  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  InnovExplo  considered  unsampled  intervals  from 
historical  drill  holes  to  have  grades  of  0  g/t  Au.  Drilling  is  needed  to  confirm  whether  these 
unsampled intervals contain any gold. A 2,500-metre infill drilling program is recommended to 
confirm gold grades where intervals of 0 g/t Au were assigned to 97 historical drill holes in the 
2009 Mineral Resource Estimate.
Phase 1c) Updated Mineral Resource Estimate
The 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate should be updated at this point using the results obtained 
from  the  drilling  programs  (Dolliver  Mountain–West  Goldbrook  segment  and  results  for 
unsampled  intervals).  InnovExplo  recommends  that  such  a  study  be  produced  in  accordance 
with  Regulation  43-101  criteria  and  the  definitions  and  standards  of  the  Canadian  Institute  of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.
Phase 1d) Scoping Study
InnovExplo recommends completing the scoping of possible mining scenarios and the economic 
viability of the identified Mineral Resources at Goldboro. The scoping study should also establish 
the costs associated with permitting, the removal of a 10,000-tonne bulk sample, and completion 
of metallurgical testing. For the bulk sample program, different scenarios should be considered 
for metallurgical testing: pilot mill on site which requires a local tailing pond or transportation to 
other facilities and custom milling.
Goldboro Property – 43-101 Technical Report
88
www.innovexplo.com
At  this  stage,  the  scoping  study  should  include  all  resource  categories  (including  Inferred)  to 
establish: 1) the economic potential of the project; and 2) the accurate cost for a bulk sample 
program.
Phase II – Permitting, bulk sampling program and metallurgical testing
Phase 2a) Surface muck pile inventory and sampling
InnovExplo  recommends  completing  an  inventory  and  sampling  of  the  surface  muck  piles  at 
Goldboro in order to document their volume, tonnage and grade. Research has to be performed 
in historic records in order to track their sources from the underground developments. If results 
of the inventory are satisfactory, these muck piles should also be considered for metallurgical 
testing.
Phase 2b) Permitting and engineering studies
At  this  stage  of  exploration,  InnovExplo  recommends  surveying  the  surface  infrastructure  and 
completing environmental baseline studies and engineering studies, all of which are required for 
permitting.
Phase 2c) Bulk sample program and metallurgical testing
Upon completion of the permitting process, a bulk sample should be extracted from one of the 
most representative areas of the Goldboro deposit. The bulk sample should be at least 10,000 
tonnes  for  pilot  mill  and  metallurgical  testing.  The  cost  of  the  bulk  sampling  program  and  a 
detailed  plan  should  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  scoping  study  of  Phase  1.  Bulk  sample 
material should be sent for metallurgical testing to obtain the necessary parameters for a pre-
feasibility study.

The  Goldboro  property  is  characterized  by  additional  exploration  potential  that  can  also  be 
tested by drilling. Based on the geological and grade continuities of gold mineralization in the 
ramp area, InnovExplo is of the opinion that there is excellent potential to convert a significant 
portion of the Indicated Resources to Measured Resources. Metallurgical grade determinations 
of composite samples from the respective mineralized zones will be required for conversion from 
the Indicated to Measured category.
