<p><b>2006/&#8230;  Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan 
due to the violation of their fundamental and human rights since the Israeli military occupation 
of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>&#8727;  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14900  (E)    141106 </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, including the latest, 
resolution 60/40 of 1 December 2005, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had failed so 
far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of Israel&#8217;s decision of 14 December 1981 to impose 
its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has resulted in the 
effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of non-acquisition of territory by force in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories (A/60/380) of 26 August 2005 and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli 
settlement in the occupied Arab territories and regretting Israel&#8217;s constant refusal to cooperate 
with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, international 
law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirming the applicability of the 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949, and the relevant provisions of the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the 
occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of the peace process which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern over the halt in 
the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the basis of 
the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) with a view 
to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
the most recent being resolution 2005/8 of 14 April 2005, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions 
of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, in particular resolution 497 (1981), in 
which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal 
effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 
demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, 
and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must 
be allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them and from all other practices mentioned in the report of the 
Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the 
Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to 
be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character and legal status of the 
occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have 
no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls once again upon</i> Member States not to recognize any of the legislative or 
administrative measures and actions referred to above; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of 
all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, international 
and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and 
to give it the widest possible publicity, and to report on this matter to the Human Rights Council 
at its fourth session, due to be held in March/April 2007; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of the human rights violations in the 
occupied Syrian Golan at its next session and at the following sessions.
