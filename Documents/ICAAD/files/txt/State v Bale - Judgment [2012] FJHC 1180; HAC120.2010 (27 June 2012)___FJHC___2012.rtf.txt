JUDGMENT

1.      
The Accused is charged with one count of Rape.

2.      
After trial three assessors have in their unanimous opinion found the accused not guilty.

3.      
I direct myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. The only element of the offence in issue was, whether the victim consented to sexual intercourse with the accused.

4.      
I have reviewed the evidence adduced in this trial and I find that the unanimous opinion of the assessors is not perverse.

5.      
I agree with the assessors and find the accused not guilty of the offence.

6.      
I acquit the accused accordingly.
