</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, carried out an official visit to Iraq from 26 September to 3 
October 2010.   
</p>
<p> The Representative is encouraged by efforts undertaken by the Government of Iraq 
and the international community so far to address the problem of internal displacement. 
The scale and complexity of the internal displacement situation in Iraq, however, require 
that these efforts be strengthened. The Representative recommended the development of a 
comprehensive strategy which addresses both the immediate humanitarian needs and 
human rights of displacement-affected communities, and durable solutions. An estimated 
1.5 million Iraqis remain in displacement in the country (since 2006), and 500,000 persons, 
a majority of whom are reported to be internally displaced, are living in very difficult 
conditions in informal settlements in Baghdad and other cities. 
</p>
<p> An action plan should also be developed and implemented in close collaboration 
between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and federal authorities in order to 
ensure assistance and longer-term solutions for the estimated 30,000 internally displaced 
families presently living in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The Representative further

<p>stressed the importance of resuming the registration of IDPs throughout Iraq and renewing 
a moratorium on evictions from informal settlements until viable long-term solutions and 
housing alternatives, in line with international standards, become possible. 
</p>
<p> The Representative underlined that finding durable solutions to internal 
displacement including return, local integration or settlement in a different location, and 
measures for the allocation of land for those who cannot return is an essential part of 
peacebuilding in Iraq. He cautioned federal and regional authorities to ensure that the 
human rights of internally displaced persons are not adversely affected by a number of 
political or economic factors. He stressed that activities such as the upcoming national 
census exercise should not be tainted by political considerations. He further called on the 
Government of Iraq and the international community to provide sufficient resources to 
address the human rights and social challenges created by the various waves of 
displacement in the country, and, in particular, to include displacement issues in all relevant 
development plans and programmes, including the next National Development Plan.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, 
and by invitation of the Government of Iraq, the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons (the Representative), Walter K&#228;lin, 
conducted an official mission to Iraq from 26 September to 3 October 2010. His main 
objective was to assess the current situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq 
and provide practical recommendations based on his findings during his visit. The 
Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are based on the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement (Guiding Principles, E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2), which have been 
recognized by States as an important international framework for the protection of IDPs1 
</p>
<p>and have been recognized by Iraq in its National Policy on Displacement as &#8220;part of 
international law&#8221;.2 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of his visit, the Representative travelled to Baghdad and Erbil in 
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. While in Baghdad he met with the Prime Minister, Nouri al-
Maliki, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hoshyar Zebari, Minister of Human Rights, Wijdan 
Michail Salem, representatives of the Ministry of Displacement and Migration and the 
Implementation and Follow-up Committee for National Reconciliation and the Governor of 
the Baghdad Provincial Council. In Erbil, he met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the 
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Azad Barwari, the Regional Government&#8217;s Head 
of the Department of Foreign Relations, Felah Mustafa Bakir, and the Minister of Interior, 
Karim Sinjari. While a planned visit to Diyala had to be cancelled for security reasons, the 
Representative had the opportunity to visit a number of informal settlements in the Baghdad 
area and villages hosting IDPs in the Erbil area. He also met with representatives of various 
internally displaced communities, members of civil society and the international 
community. He is grateful for the fruitful exchanges with all of his interlocutors, which 
provided him with an understanding of the displacement situation inside Iraq, and wishes to 
express his sincere appreciation to the internally displaced persons who shared their 
experiences with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and socio-economic context 
</b></p>
<p>3. The national parliamentary elections that took place in Iraq on 7 March 2010, seven 
years after the United States of America initiated military action against the former regime 
of Saddam Hussein, represent an important milestone in the country&#8217;s democratic 
transition. However, at the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, the country remained in a 
political impasse following contested election results and the subsequent deadlock over the 
formation of a new Government. At the same time, American forces in Iraq had just been 
downsized to 50,000 transitional troops, due to leave by the end of 2011. It was a period 
marked by political and military transition, as well as uncertainty, which was beginning to 
affect the running of the country, six months into the elections. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See General Assembly resolutions 60/1, 62/153 and 64/162; Human Rights Council resolutions 6/32 
</p>
<p>and 14/6. 
 2 Iraq, Ministry of Displacement and Migration, <i>National Policy on Displacement</i> (July 2008), sect. 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>4. Other significant domestic issues include the political deadlock with regard to 
Kirkuk in the North between the federal government and KRG over the division of power, 
management of oil resources and the implementation of Article 140 of the Iraqi 
Constitution in disputed territories.3 At the time of the visit, preparations for a national 
census, which is to precede a national referendum, were under way. 
</p>
<p>5. Iraq&#8217;s total population of an estimated 31 million persons is composed of a majority 
of ethnic Arabs, approximately 15&#8211;20 per cent Kurds, and another 5 per cent of other 
ethnicities.  About 97 per cent of Iraqis are Muslim, roughly divided between 60&#8211;65 per 
cent Shia, 27&#8211;32 per cent Sunni, and 3 per cent Christians or other religions.4 
</p>
<p>6. The country&#8217;s economy relies heavily on the oil sector, which provides over 90 per 
cent of the Government revenue. Despite improvements in the economy, gains at the 
macroeconomic level have not translated into improvements in the day-to-day lives of 
Iraqis whose low standard of living and lack of access to basic services have remained 
issues of concern.5 Challenges include lack of structural reforms, weak development of the 
private sector, corruption, and high under/unemployment and poverty rates, which stand at 
28 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.6 The inter-sectarian and ethnic violence in 2006&#8211;
2007 also deeply affected the Government&#8217;s ability to deliver essential services and repair 
the country&#8217;s damaged socio-economic infrastructure.7 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Iraq is a State party to a number of key international human rights instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It has 
not, however, reported on these treaties in several years.8 Iraq has also ratified the four 
Geneva Conventions of 1949, and has signed into law the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, although the process of 
accession has not been finalized.9 
</p>
<p>8. The 2005 Constitution of Iraq provides fundamental human rights guarantees 
including with regard to the rule of law, equality before the law, equal opportunity, privacy 
and judicial independence. National institutions to implement these rights, however, remain 
weak.10 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Article 140 envisages a process to address past injustices, allow displaced people to return or receive 
</p>
<p>compensation and conduct a census followed by a referendum to determine whether citizens in parts 
of Ninewa, Kirkuk and other governorates wish to formally join the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

</p>
<p>9. Despite improvements in the overall security situation since 2006, the situation in 
Iraq is still characterized by continued indiscriminate attacks against civilians, including 
religious and ethnic minorities, arbitrary arrests, alleged ill-treatment while in detention, 
and sexual and gender-based violence. Moreover, impunity is reported as being widespread, 
while access to justice is largely absent due to fear of reprisals, lack of capacity among rule 
of law institutions, corruption and lack of awareness of accountability mechanisms.11 
</p>
<p>10. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, while the security situation is considerably better 
than in the rest of the country, specific concerns have been raised with regard to, inter alia: 
serious violations of the rights of suspects and detainees by KRG authorities; sexual and 
gender-based violence; and the impact of anti-terrorism legislation on human rights, 
including specifically the practice of keeping persons in de facto unlimited administrative 
detention.12 
</p>
<p>11. In February 2010, Iraq was reviewed under the universal periodic review. In this 
context, the human rights concerns mentioned above, as well as the specific situation of 
IDPs were addressed. With regard to IDPs, the Government of Iraq has committed to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Strengthening policies and further seeking international cooperation to ensure 
the human rights of Internally Displaced Persons, including measures for their return or 
resettlement; 
</p>
<p> (b) Developing a national plan to provide assistance and compensation to 
internally displaced persons; 
</p>
<p> (c) Paying special attention to women from marginal groups who have been 
affected by armed conflict and displacement; 
</p>
<p> (d) Building mechanisms which would enable provision of adequate 
humanitarian assistance to the large number of internally displaced persons.13 
</p>
<p><b> C. History, scale and characteristics of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>12. The scale and history of forced displacement in Iraq has created a complex situation, 
which continues to affect the search for durable solutions and to challenge assistance 
efforts. An estimated 4.6 million Iraqis, representing 15 per cent of the population, have 
been forcibly displaced within Iraq or in other countries, with an estimated 1.21 million 
internally displaced before 2006 and 1.55 million since then.14 
</p>
<p>13. Iraq has suffered various waves of displacement, including internal displacement, in 
its recent past due to armed conflict, sectarian violence and forced population movements 
associated with the former regime. These waves of forced displacement are often analysed 
as having taken place in three periods, namely: forced population movements under the 
former Ba&#8217;ath Government; displacement caused by armed conflict from the March 2003 
invasion until the February 2006 Samarra bombing; and from February 2006 onwards &#8211;

<p>with the period from 2006 to 2008 marked by sectarian violence.15 These waves are also 
commonly differentiated as &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;new&#8221; displacement movements. 
</p>
<p>14. In this report, the Representative focuses primarily on the situation of persons 
internally displaced since 2006. Between February 2006 and December 2007, displacement 
resulted mainly from sectarian conflict triggered by the bombing of the Al-Askari shrine in 
Samarra in February 2006, during which period close to 1.6 million people were internally 
displaced.16 According to official Government statistics, an estimated 1.55 million persons 
(post-2006 IDPs)17 have remained internally displaced in the country since then, with close 
to 573,000 persons living in Baghdad alone. While the Government recognizes the situation 
of earlier displacements, it has only registered displacement as of 2006. 
</p>
<p>15. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, there are an estimated 30,000 internally displaced 
families, with the most recent displacements having taken place in June 2010 owing to 
shelling along the border with Iran. This region has a long history of displacement, both 
before and after 2003, with various ethnic groups fleeing to the region during the inter-
sectarian violence in 2006&#8211;2007, as well as displacements within the region itself. 
</p>
<p>16. Internal displacement rates in the country have declined markedly in the last two 
years, from 11,794 families displaced per month in 2006 to 98 families per month since 
October 2009.18 As of 2009, displacement has been confined to sporadic incidents, such as 
the sectarian violence leading to the displacement from Mosul of 4,300 Christians in early 
2010, cross-border tensions in the Kurdistan Region, eviction of IDPs in Kirkuk in August 
2010 and natural disasters including floods and droughts which occurred at the end of 
2009.19  Furthermore, the Representative was informed that minority populations, such as 
Christians, Yazidis, Shabaks and Turkmen, who have historical ties to the disputed areas of 
Kirkuk and Ninewa, have been the targets of much of the sectarian violence in 2009 and 
early 2010. The general rate of internal displacement increased during the months of March 
and April 2010 in the context of the parliamentary elections and the political impasse which 
followed.20 
</p>
<p><b> III. Responses to internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Response by Iraqi authorities 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Government of Iraq has taken a number of important measures to address the 
needs of IDPs, including commitments made during the universal periodic review in 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Between 1974 and 1991, large numbers of Kurds were displaced in the Northern Kurdish region by 
</p>
<p>the Arabization campaign conducted by the Saddam Hussein regime. Some 343,000 persons, 
particularly Marsh Arabs, were displaced after the 1991 Shia uprising in South Iraq. An estimated 
190,000 persons were displaced between 2003 and the end of 2005, largely as the result of military 
operations by the Multinational Force Iraq (MNF-I) and Iraqi units against armed insurgents, although 
many of these displacements were temporary in nature. <i>Iraq &#8211; Little new displacement</i>, p. 9.

</p>
<p>February 2010. During the course of his visit to the country, the Representative was also 
encouraged to receive additional commitments from Government representatives in this 
regard, including in relation to the IDP registration process and the development of a 
national strategy to address internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>18. Within the Government, the Ministry of Displacement and Migration has a mandate 
to address IDP and refugee issues, and to coordinate related activities of a number of other 
line ministries such as the Ministry of Interior, Health, Education, Municipalities and Public 
Works, and Trade. The Ministry of Displacement and Migration played a crucial part in the 
development of a national policy on displacement and has extended its presence by 
establishing branches in most governorates, strengthened registration procedures and 
facilitated returns through its returnee centres. However, overall, its capacities remain 
limited. 
</p>
<p>19. The National Policy on Displacement launched in 2008, represents a significant step 
by the Government of Iraq, as do a number of other measures to facilitate return, 
reintegration and the restitution of property and increase budgetary allocations for IDPs. 
Approximately US$ 170 million was allocated for IDP programmes in the 2010 budget.21  
Concrete measures addressing property issues include a number of ministerial orders and 
decrees22 aimed at tackling key obstacles to returns, such as secondary occupancy and 
property restitution, and the establishment of two returnee centres (&#8220;Return Assistance 
Centres&#8221;) in Baghdad and one in Diyala, which assist returning registered IDPs and 
refugees who were displaced between 2006 and 2008.23 To date, 3,800 properties which 
had been subject to secondary occupancy have been restored to their original owners.24 
</p>
<p>20. A particularly noteworthy development is the Diyala Return and Integration 
initiative, which is a joint effort by the Government of Iraq,25 the Diyala governorate and 
the international community and the first integrated approach to ensuring sustainable 
returns and reintegration. The initiative, which targets 27,500 families, inter alia funds 
reconstruction and provision of basic services and has prioritized approximately 400 
villages with high returnee populations, including those with mixed ethnic and religious 
groups. The Implementation and Follow-up Committee for National Reconciliation, with 
which the Representative met during his visit, emphasized the importance of the 
reconciliation component of the Diyala initiative and its integrated approach, which 
combines security, housing, basic services and livelihoods. A total of 3,000 housing units 
were built in 2009 and another 8,000 are planned; 20,000 temporary jobs in Diyala were 
provided for IDPs.26 It is hoped that the Diyala model will be expanded to other areas, 
including three key return areas in Baghdad (Mada&#8217;en, Doura and Sabalbour) and to other 
governorates. 
</p>
<p>21. The Representative was also encouraged by a number of new measures with respect 
to internal displacement, announced during the course of his visit by Government 
representatives. These include: the development of strategies to address both the immediate 
</p>
<p>  
 21 As of September 2010, this budget had yet to be approved. <i>Iraq &#8211; Little new displacement</i>, p. 14. 
 22 Prime Minister&#8217;s Order No. 101 facilitates the return of IDPs and refugees in Baghdad through 
</p>

registered returnee families with a grant of 1 million dinars (US$840). &#8220;UNHCR Iraq: Fact Sheet,

<p>needs of internally displaced persons and the search for durable solutions (by national 
authorities as well as KRG); the organization of a workshop with governorates aimed at 
addressing IDP-specific issues, including land allocations, reconciliation and local 
integration; and the reopening of registration for IDPs who had been unable to register 
previously. Other measures envisaged include efforts to secure further allocations of land 
for IDPs, the construction of housing complexes and the inclusion of IDP-specific questions 
in the context of the national census exercise.27 
</p>
<p>22. The Representative commends the Government for these measures envisaged. At the 
same time, he stresses the need to follow up on these initiatives by adopting plans to 
implement the National Policy on Displacement, appropriate legislation and adequate 
resource allocations for relevant programmes. He is concerned that, to date, the 
Government has not devoted sufficient attention and resources to finding durable solutions 
for all IDPs, and has neglected to address the situation of those among the displaced who 
have had to resort to living in informal settlements, for lack of alternative accommodation. 
He notes that the Iraqi Parliamentary Committee on Displacement and Migration has 
repeatedly appealed for more funds to address IDP issues and underlined the need to rectify 
the slow or lack of disbursements to IDPs and returnees, as well as to take measures which 
offer more adequate durable solutions to the displaced.28 He is also concerned about the 
limited capacity of many of the Governmental actors, responsible directly or indirectly for 
internal displacement issues. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Response by the international community 
</b></p>
<p>23. A total of US$194 million were requested by the United Nations Country Team 
(UNCT) under the Iraq 2010 Humanitarian Plan. In addition to this sum, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees made a separate appeal amounting to US$264 million, 
which includes $144.5 million specifically for IDPs. Other assistance includes funds from 
the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, bilateral assistance and other 
humanitarian and reconstruction support projects. Owing to lower than expected levels of 
funding in 2009, the UNCT reset its priorities for 2010, which include maintaining a rapid 
response capacity, providing area-based responses in 26 districts in Iraq and cross-sectoral 
themes such as displacement. International donor funding for humanitarian assistance in 
Iraq, of which the Government of the United States of America continues to be the single 
largest contributor since 2003, is expected to continue declining substantially owing to the 
general improvement in the humanitarian situation, a reorientation towards recovery and 
development activities, and an increased emphasis on bilateral rather than multilateral 
processes. 29 
</p>
<p>24. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  and the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) have played leading roles in addressing 
displacement issues in Iraq. UNHCR, whose responsibility was extended to assisting IDPs 
in 2006, conducts Iraq-wide activities with partners to identify and respond to the 
immediate humanitarian and protection needs of the most vulnerable of the displaced. 
UNHCR coordinates the United Nations transitional efforts for the Diyala initiative 
together with the Government of Iraq and has established 14 &#8220;Protection and Assistance 
</p>
<p>  
 27 Meeting with Ministry of Displacement and Migration on 26 September 2010. The Ministry noted 
</p>
<p>that the Government had issued the decision to open statistical registration of IDPs in the context of 
the census, and that IDP-specific questions included questions pertaining to their former place of 
residence, reasons for leaving and their current place of residence.

<p>Centres&#8221;,30 which include mobile teams providing services throughout the country, and 
seven &#8220;Return, Integration and Community Centres&#8221; in Baghdad and Diyala. Both types of 
centres successfully increase outreach to affected communities by providing, inter alia, 
legal services, protection monitoring, needs assessments and social assistance services. In 
2009, UNHCR launched its Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Empowerment 
Scheme, which aims to strengthen the capacity of a network of over 100 selected national 
NGOs and enable UNHCR to deliver targeted urgent assistance. As part of its 2010 
priorities, UNHCR has focused on shelter, the provision of essential items to vulnerable 
IDPs, advocacy on protection from arbitrary evictions and microprojects targeting returnee 
and IDP-hosting communities.31 
</p>
<p>25. IOM, which is present throughout the country, also undertakes a wide array of 
activities on internal displacement including: monitoring displacements and returns; quick-
impact projects; household surveys on needs and intentions with regard to durable 
solutions; and capacity-building and assistance to the Government.  
</p>
<p>26. Of note are also the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) &#8220;sector 
outcome teams&#8221; (formerly &#8220;clusters&#8221;), which aim to link protection, reconstruction, 
development and humanitarian interventions, and which currently include the protection  
and shelter outcome teams. The Human Rights Office of UNAMI is part of the United 
Nations Country Team and works closely with key stakeholders to mainstream the human 
rights of IDPs in relevant United Nations and Government programmes and help develop a 
work plan for the implementation of the commitments made in the context of the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>27. Both national and international NGOs in Iraq play a key role in providing assistance 
to IDPs. While international NGOs have in recent years come under increasing pressure to 
establish a presence in different parts of the country rather than operating remotely from the 
north or from neighbouring countries, they have continued to be subject to targeted attacks 
since 2003, which have resulted in the killing of almost 100 aid workers (mostly nationals) 
to date.32 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Protection of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection against forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>28. Although systematic and large-scale displacement has stopped, a number of factors 
and events within Iraq can still cause sporadic and sudden internal displacements. While the 
National Policy on Displacement provides for the right to be protected from arbitrary 
displacement,33 no mechanisms exist to enable the effective implementation of this right. 
The Representative welcomes the efforts of the Government of Iraq and its reassurances 
that it will continue to prioritize national reconciliation, including from the perspective of 
preventing further displacement and ensuring the safety and security of IDPs who may wish 
to locally integrate in their host communities or resettle elsewhere in the country. With

land.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>regard to the latter, the Representative was pleased to learn of new initiatives which will 
emphasize consultation and sensitization of host communities, and authorities at the 
governorate level, as well as tribal leaders.34 At the same time, he appeals to the 
Government of Iraq and all relevant actors to strengthen efforts to resolve disputes 
peacefully and adopt legal and practical measures, including legislation and advocacy 
campaigns, which address and work to prevent ethnic and religious hatred. The 
Representative believes that without such further measures the risk of further displacement 
cannot be adequately addressed. 
</p>
<p>29. Of particular concern are the sectarian and ethnic tensions which persist in the 
country, as witnessed by the incidents in Mosul in February 2010 and more recently in the 
attacks against Christians in Bagdad on 31 October 2010,35 and which may lead to further 
displacement if they are not urgently addressed as a matter of national priority. In Northern 
Iraq, tensions between Kurds and Arabs are also fuelled by disputes relating to internal 
boundaries, especially in Kirkuk, and related developments such as the upcoming national 
census exercise. The Representative was informed of cases of harassment, intimidation, 
threats of forced evictions and arbitrary arrests of registered Arab IDPs originally from 
southern and western Iraq, which occurred both prior to and during the time of his visit. 
</p>
<p>30. While security has improved in the last two years, forced displacement related to 
security incidents &#8211; such as generalized criminal violence and terrorism by extremist groups 
&#8211; continues to be a problem. Crimes by militias, criminal gangs and security and military 
forces in certain parts of the country, such as in Baghdad, have included kidnappings, 
assassinations, extrajudicial executions, forced recruitment, destruction of property, 
intimidation, extortion and sexual and gender-based violence.36 The Representative stresses 
that an escalation of generalized violence in certain areas may result in renewed forced 
displacement and that IDPs can be especially vulnerable to such criminal practices. He 
encourages the Government to address impunity for human rights violations, strengthen 
rule of law and governance institutions, provide adequate resources for national security 
measures in line with human rights and develop effective mechanisms to address abuses 
emanating from its law enforcement institutions and security forces. 
</p>
<p>31. Persons trying to return to their homes also risk having to leave again or remaining 
displaced owing to a number of other factors. These include a lack of security, limited 
absorption capacity of local communities or the absence of other necessary conditions 
(food, water, electricity) for IDP returnees or refugees returning to the country. Measures to 
prepare communities of return for the reintegration of returnees &#8211; such as support to 
enhance their community services and infrastructure, measures related to reconciliation and 
the provision of adequate assistance to returnees (including as regards property restitution 
and shelter) are essential in this regard. 
</p>
<p>32. Attacks in border regions of the country continue to be a further source of 
displacement. Several thousand Iraqis living close to the northern border with neighbouring 
countries have been displaced following repeated military interventions between May and 
July 2010, when authorities in KRG reported that 5,600 persons had been displaced mainly

<p>by air strikes and shelling.37 The Representative urges the Government of Iraq, KRG and 
relevant neighbouring countries to strengthen dialogue on this issue, which should highlight 
the impact of such attacks on the civilian population of Iraq. 
</p>
<p>33. Natural disasters and water scarcity, as witnessed by the recent droughts in parts of 
the country, may also continue to cause displacement among affected communities. Several 
years of drought in parts of Iraq triggered the displacement of 4,250 families, including in 
Kirkuk, Nineveh and Salah El-din Missan and Basra.38 While the focus to date has been on 
internal displacement due to conflict, the Representative urges the Government of Iraq to 
include non-conflict IDPs in a future national strategy on displacement as well as in future 
legislative, emergency preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. 
</p>
<p>34. In addition to the above, the Representative is concerned by the continued risks of 
secondary displacements in Iraq, which can be triggered by a number of causes. In northern 
Iraq, where many IDPs fled in the aftermath of the sectarian violence in 2006 and to which 
other Iraqis migrated in search of jobs and better security conditions, displacement may be 
triggered, for example, in the event of the possible politicization of the national census 
exercise and internal border disputes in contested areas. The Representative strongly 
encourages the Government of Iraq, KRG and local governorates to specifically refrain 
from adopting policies or political positions which are likely to lead to forced secondary 
displacements. 
</p>
<p>35. During his visit, the Representative called for a moratorium on evictions of an 
estimated at 500,000 persons, a majority of whom are believed to be IDPs, currently living 
in informal settlements in Baghdad and other cities on public land or in buildings that they 
do not own. Such a moratorium should remain in place until the envisaged new strategy on 
internal displacement provides a clear plan and viable alternatives for these persons, in line 
with international standards. This course of action would avoid secondary displacements 
and further hardship for this vulnerable section of the population. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection during displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Physical security and humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p>36. IDPs and host communities face many of the same challenges with regard to the 
security situation and deficits in the areas of rule of law and governance. While the level of 
insecurity has diminished overall, low-intensity violence and targeted attacks persist. 
Coordinated explosions and attacks against minorities, and more specifically Christians, 
continued to take place as recently as in the months of October and November 2010.39 
</p>
<p>37. Serious concerns were raised during the universal periodic review of Iraq regarding 
the security of persons in Iraq generally, widespread impunity and corruption, and 
inadequate capacity among rule of law institutions.40 The protection needs of IDPs are, 
however, often more acute due to specific vulnerabilities caused by displacement. As a 
result of displacement, IDPs may have lost identity documents essential to affording them

<p>certain rights, as well as their housing, and are more vulnerable to rape, domestic violence, 
disappearances and detentions.41 In a survey of IDPs in 2009, 11 per cent of IDPs (post-
2006) reported being targeted due to their religious or political affiliation, 6 per cent simply 
because they were IDPs, and 30 per cent reported missing family members, including 
children, as a result of abductions or detention.42 
</p>
<p>38. The Representative highlights the special vulnerability to security risks of IDPs 
living in informal settlements and contested areas of the country, the need to pay increased 
attention to gender-based violence against IDPs and the risks associated with the rise of 
tensions between IDPs and host communities owing to overburdened social services, 
property disputes, housing and scarcity of resources. Where IDPs do not share the ethnic or 
sectarian affiliation of the majority, there have also been reports of discrimination, 
harassment and persecution.43 Feelings of insecurity among IDPs are also based on their 
own vulnerabilities and ability to access basic services and rights, such as shelter, food, 
freedom of movement and employment. Vulnerable IDP groups such as youth, female-
headed households, the elderly, persons with disabilities and persons without official 
documentation, proper housing or employment can feel especially at risk. 
</p>
<p>39. Other specific problems are also reported in the north of Iraq, including in the 
Kurdistan Region and the Governorate of Ninewa. Security issues include: detentions of 
Arabs, some of whom may be IDPs, coming into the Kurdistan Region; reports of 
trafficking; and IDPs from minority groups in the Ninewa Plains who may be subject to 
intimidation and manipulation pending a resolution of the question of whether or not this 
area should belong to the Kurdistan Region.44 
</p>
<p>40. The Representative acknowledges that humanitarian access has improved 
significantly in the last few years. However, security risks to humanitarian workers &#8211; both 
owing to targeted attacks and generalized violence &#8211; continue to be present, affecting the 
provision of adequate levels of humanitarian assistance and protection. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to shelter, food, basic services and livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>41. Housing is a high priority among all Iraqis, including IDPs, for whom the lack of 
adequate shelter represents a key protection issue. The majority of IDPs, over 75 per cent, 
live in rented accommodation or with host families, while over 20 per cent live in irregular 
settlements, former military camps, tents and public buildings.45 At the time of the 
Representative&#8217;s visit, an estimated half a million persons, the majority of whom are 
believed to be IDPs, were living in informal settlements on property which they did not 
own. More than 200,000 persons live in such settlements in Baghdad alone.46 
</p>
<p>42. During his visit to two such informal settlements in Baghdad, the Representative 
was struck by the very difficult and precarious living conditions of the IDPs he met there, 
including overcrowding, inadequate shelters, limited or no access to water and other 
essential services, such as sanitation and garbage collection. This creates serious health 
hazards, particularly among children and the elderly. In one location, IDPs reported that 
local authorities denied them access to education and health services. The Representative 
stresses the need to take immediate measures to address the dire living conditions and 
humanitarian needs in these settlements in accordance with principle 18 of the Guiding

<p>Principles, and to strengthen efforts to find alternative housing and long-term solutions, 
including the allocation of land plots. Following the Council of Ministers Order No. 440 of 
2008, which addressed the evictions of squatters, a decision was taken in May 2009 to 
suspend evictions from State land for a period of one year. While commending that gesture, 
the Representative calls for a full moratorium on evictions from such settlements until 
alternative solutions and housing are found. 
</p>
<p>43. Many IDPs living in rented accommodation at prohibitive prices often also live in 
overcrowded conditions in substandard housing with no or little access to basic services 
(sanitation, electricity, etc.) and are at risk of evictions as their finances dwindle over time 
and rent prices increase. Refugees returning from abroad may experience secondary 
displacement or homelessness due to the lack of affordable shelter. Over time, those living 
with host families or friends also come under increased pressure, as hosts struggle to make 
ends meet themselves. This places IDPs at special risk of homelessness, in a broader 
context of the country&#8217;s serious housing deficit. An estimated 52.8 per cent of the Iraqi 
urban population in 2005 were living in slums, a figure unlikely to have decreased given 
the further internal displacement that has taken place, creating fears of a social crisis.47 
</p>
<p>44. According to a needs assessment by IOM, access to work, food and shelter, in that 
order, have remained the priority needs of IDPs since 2006. In terms of basic service needs, 
this is followed by access to water, health, education and hygiene. In particular, access to 
food has increased as a priority in recent years as a result of droughts and rising food prices. 
Most IDPs, like many other Iraqis, have come to depend on the Public Distribution System 
(PDS), which has provided monthly food rations since its establishment in 1991.48 
However, IDPs have experienced significant difficulties in accessing the system, with a 
third of IDPs reporting in late 2009 that they did not have a PDS card valid in their 
governorate of residence, while only 15 per cent reported receiving their full monthly 
entitlement.49 
</p>
<p>45. In addition, the Representative received reports that IDPs moving from one 
governorate to another are often unable to transfer their PDS food ration card registration to 
their new areas of displacement. IDPs thus often need legal assistance in order to obtain 
PDS cards and are considered amongst the most vulnerable to food insecurity, given their 
reliance on food assistance and difficulties in accessing work.50 In the Kurdistan Region 
more specifically, the Representative noted similar difficulties among the IDP population 
with regard to the transfer of food ration coupons and high rental rates in cities.51 
</p>
<p>46. Chronic shortages of electricity and drinking water and inadequate sanitation 
facilities affect IDP populations and host communities alike owing to a lack of 
infrastructure, years of neglect and underinvestment. In 2009, only 44 per cent of IDPs (and 
23 per cent of IDP returnees) stated having sufficient access to water, and access to 
sanitation facilities was reported as insufficient by 25 per cent of IDPs, (and 26 per cent of 
IDP returnees).52 
</p>
<p>47. Like other services, health care in Iraq has deteriorated significantly over the past 
decades, seeing the exodus of many qualified professionals and shortages of medication, 
equipment and facilities. In this context, 23 per cent of IDPs report not having access to

<p>health care, while those who do have access point to a lack of staff and equipment, which 
results in poor treatment.53 Health-care concerns vary considerably depending on location, 
i.e., between rural and urban areas and from one governorate to another.54 IDPs living in 
rural or poor neighbourhoods or in informal settlements face particular difficulties in 
accessing health care due to a lack of means and insufficient or badly equipped health-care 
centres. 
</p>
<p>48. During the Representative&#8217;s visit, several IDPs in informal settlements to whom he 
spoke stressed the difficulty in accessing health care and paying the associated fees. 
Women IDPs stressed the lack of medical services for women, including gynaecological 
services, post/partum care and medical assistance during childbirth, and reported the deaths 
of some women who had given birth at home. In the Kurdistan Region, difficulties in 
accessing medical services particularly affect the category of non-professional IDPs, who 
have more difficulty securing employment and are thus less able to afford medical fees.55 
</p>
<p>49. As regards the right to education, a 2009 UNHCR survey found that, among the 
IDPs surveyed, an estimated 42 per cent of boys and 47 per cent of girls under 14 years of 
age did not attend school.56 Some IDPs, especially those without residency papers and IDPs 
with whom the Representative met in informal settlements, also report difficulty in 
enrolling their children in the local schools, owing to a lack of documents and spaces in 
already overcrowded schools. This appeared to vary significantly between neighbourhoods 
and schools, however. In the Kurdistan Region, IDPs were especially concerned by the lack 
of access to Arabic schools in certain towns, the lack of quick-learning curriculums for 
Kurdish children, and cited that, in Erbil, out of 4,000 IDP children, only 1,000 had access 
to schools.57 The Representative notes with concern reports of large numbers of IDP 
children who have dropped out of school, including because of poverty, the cost of 
uniforms, transportation and school supplies, or because children leave school to work in 
order to supplement the family income.58 The incidence of child labour appears to increase 
among displaced families the longer displacement lasts. 
</p>
<p>50. Access to work and livelihoods is the number one priority of 76 per cent of IDPs, 
according to an IOM survey. IDPs are particularly affected by unemployment because of 
their displacement, which meant the loss of the jobs, savings, property and perhaps 
documentation. IDP female-headed households are especially affected by unemployment 
and child and female participation in the informal economy. Concern about access to work 
also varies by region, affecting 50 per cent of IDPs in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk and 60 per 
cent in Baghdad, while in other governorates such as Kerbala it affects 95 per cent of 
IDPs.59 Moreover, in the Kurdistan Region, while the general unemployment rate is 
considerably lower overall, IDPs note difficulties in accessing employment owing to the 
language barrier, as most do not speak Kurdish. Some 80 per cent of IDPs in the Kurdistan 
Region are concerned about employment, although IDPs in professional categories fair 
much better.60 The authorities and NGOs in the Kurdistan Region were concerned that an 
increasing number of internally displaced women may be engaging in prostitution or 
become victims of trafficking because of a lack of livelihood opportunities. High levels of

<p>child labour are another consequence of the dire economic situation in which many IDPs 
live. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Registration, documentation, freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>51. In Iraq, documentation is essential to the exercise of certain key rights, including 
being able to register as an IDP or returnee and to access basic services and financial 
assistance. IDPs have faced a number of difficulties with regard to IDP registration, many 
of which were confirmed by the IDPs with whom the Representative met, including the 
lack of necessary documentation, inconsistent implementation of Government registration 
procedures and backlogs, and lack of awareness of certain requirements or of the resources 
to travel to registration points. Inconsistent implementation of registration procedures has 
also been reported, including because of restrictions on IDP entry and registration arising 
from security, economic or even demographic concerns in a number of governorates.61 
However, some IDPs have also been reluctant to register with authorities because of 
security concerns, bureaucratic delays or lack of documentation. During 2009, Government 
authorities stopped registration procedures, reopening them temporarily only for census 
purposes between April and June 2010. While there are no available figures on the number 
of unregistered IDPs in the country, they are presumed to be high.62 
</p>
<p>52. In the context of Iraq, non-registration of IDPs (and returnees) remains a significant 
humanitarian concern, as it limits or precludes access to a number of rights including, 
access to basic services and Government assistance, the inability to transfer or gain 
recognition of certain documents and the inability to rent or purchase land, vote or obtain 
land titles. Therefore, the Representative was especially pleased to be informed during his 
visit of the Governments&#8217; expressed willingness and intention to reopen registration 
procedures for all IDPs.63 
</p>
<p>53. IDPs also report difficulties in obtaining or renewing other key documents, 
including the civil status identification document, a key identity card necessary to access 
health care, education and many other services, and to obtaining other important documents 
such as a passport, PDS cards. As a result, IDPs often need specialized assistance to obtain 
or replace vital documents,64 to which they are entitled in accordance with principle 20 of 
the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>54. Despite improved security conditions, freedom of movement (Guiding Principle 14) 
for IDPs in Iraq continues to be affected by a number of security measures, especially in 
and around Baghdad, including frequent checkpoints, permission requirements and security 
fences or walls. According to information received by the Representative, freedom of 
movement is also impacted by checks at governorate borders,65 some reportedly resulting in 
arrests, and in the Kurdistan Region particularly of Arabs, due to the lack of proper papers 
or due to mistaken identity. Moreover, while most governorates have allowed IDPs to enter, 
obstacles to registration have limited their access to services and capacity to rent or 
purchase property. This problem was further accentuated once registration was halted in 
February 2009. Concern was also expressed during the universal periodic review about 
reports that displaced persons found it increasingly difficult to move within Iraq and to 
neighbouring countries given the more restrictive entry policies and visas imposed at State 
borders and governorate boundaries.

<p><b> C. Protection in the context of durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>55. Approximately 435,000 IDPs have returned to their place of origin since 2008. Of 
these, approximately 60 per cent returned to Baghdad and 28 per cent to Diyala. Rates of 
return slowed down significantly in 2010, however, to approximately 83,000 (by October) 
from nearly 168,000 the previous year.66 Most returnees returned to neighbourhoods 
controlled by members of their community. Yet, in late 2009, 38 per cent of returnees 
reported not always feeling safe, while 34 per cent had found their homes either damaged 
or destroyed. Often, property was occupied by local residents, militia or other IDPs. As 
demonstrated by the low numbers of returns in 2010, IDPs continued to be concerned by 
the continued insecurity, political stalemate, and particular ethnic or religious composition 
of areas of return, as well as by the potential lack of services, livelihoods and housing. Over 
the years, others have come to favour local integration in their host communities, given the 
emotional scars from violence they may have experienced in their place of origin or 
because they have formed social networks or found employment. 
</p>
<p>56. Despite a Government displacement programme that has focused largely on returns, 
some of the current displacement appears likely to remain protracted or lead to alternative 
durable solutions. According to intention surveys, the percentage of IDPs wishing to locally 
integrate has increased in the last years, reaching an estimated 37 per cent of IDPs by mid-
2010, while 42 per cent expressed the wish to return and 17 per cent to resettle elsewhere.67 
Intentions vary considerably depending on the governorate, however, with local integration 
being more attractive to IDPs in central and southern governorates at 75 per cent, as 
compared to less than 15 per cent in Ninewa for example. Factors in this preference are 
often related to the security situation and access to basic services. Returnee populations are 
mostly located in Baghdad, but also Diyala, Anbar and Kirkuk.68 
</p>
<p>57. While there has been some success with regard to returns, Government measures to 
promote returns have had mixed outcomes. Such measures have included: a number of 
Government orders aimed at facilitating returns through restitution of private property,69 the 
establishment of &#8220;Return Assistance Centres&#8221; in Baghdad, a financial assistance package of 
US$ 850 and a rental compensation package (for a period of six months) to registered IDPs 
who have been residing as secondary occupants. The Representative commended 
Government efforts to address a broad range of property restitution needs and the measures 
taken to facilitate procedures to establish property ownership &#8211; which have enabled the 
restitution of some 3,800 properties to date. He notes that the experience gained to date can 
now contribute to the ongoing efforts of the Government of Iraq to improve fairness and 
efficiency in property restitution. Nevertheless, Government support has largely been 
considered insufficient and difficult to access. With regard to return grants, according to 
one survey, only 40 per cent of returnees had applied for the grant or registered by the end 
of 2009 and, of those who had applied, only 30 per cent had actually received a grant.70 
</p>
<p>58. The Diyala initiative (discussed above) &#8211; which has targeted approximately 27,000 
families &#8211; has represented a positive model for returns and reintegration and has been 
selected for expansion to a number of other return areas. This initiative has also revealed a 
number of possible gaps, however, from which lesson can be learned, including on the need

</p>
<p>59. During his visit, the Representative was pleased to learn that the Government was in 
the process of developing a strategy on durable solutions to displacement in Iraq. He 
emphasizes the importance of ensuring that such a strategy is comprehensive in its scope71 
</p>
<p>and includes the full range of durable solutions, including return, local integration or 
settlement in a different location and, in accordance with guiding principle 28, the 
possibility to opt for one of these solutions on the basis of a voluntary and informed choice. 
Such a strategy should ensure that all IDPs should have equal access to durable solutions, 
irrespective of when they were displaced. The Representative further highlights that &#8211; 
consistent with their constitutional rights &#8211; all Iraqi citizens have the right to choose their 
place of residence and that local integration in particular may be the only feasible solution 
for those who fear return or do not wish to go back to their former place of residence for 
other reasons. 
</p>
<p>60. The Representative was encouraged to learn of Government plans to hold 
discussions with governorates regarding displacement issues, including  on the potential for 
the local integration of persons who do not wish to return to their place of origin. The 
Representative considers this process of consultation with displacement-affected 
communities to be an essential element in securing a long-lasting solution and urges the 
Government to ensure that IDPs themselves are also engaged in this dialogue and in the 
development of a national strategy on durable solutions that takes into consideration their 
needs and intentions. These represent essential steps in limiting subsequent secondary 
displacement and ensuring a successful durable-solutions strategy. 
</p>
<p>61. The Representative considers that finding durable solutions for displaced persons 
and displacement-affected communities alike in Iraq is a humanitarian, human rights and 
development challenge. In this context, he highlights the importance of specifically 
including displacement issues in all relevant development plans and programmes. In 
particular, he welcomes the inclusion of such issues in the United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework 2011&#8211;2014 for Iraq and calls on the Government of Iraq and other 
relevant stakeholders to sufficiently address displacement issues in the forthcoming 
National Development Plan. He also calls on the Government and the international 
community to provide sufficient resources to address the great human rights, social and 
development challenges created by displacement. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Iraq has suffered many waves of internal displacement throughout its recent 
past as a result of conflict, sectarian violence, and forced population movements 
associated with policies of the former regime &#8211; with an estimated 1.55 million persons 
remaining in displacement since 2006. This situation is compounded by a marked 
deterioration of basic infrastructures and services across the country, lack of 
livelihoods and economic opportunities, continuing insecurity and sectarian divisions, 
as well as serious deficits in relation to governance, rule of law and the capacity of 
government structures. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>On the basis of his visit, the Representative concludes that the Government of 
Iraq has made significant efforts towards addressing the situation of IDPs in the 
</b></p>
<p>  
 71 The Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons (A/HRC/13/21/Add.4) may 
</p>
<p>provide useful guidance for elaborating such a strategy. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>country. Achievements to date have included the National Policy on Displacement of 
July 2008, special measures introduced to facilitate return, reintegration and 
restitution of property, and cooperation with the international community to address 
the humanitarian and human rights situation of displaced persons in Iraq. The 
Representative also commends the Government for the commitments made in relation 
to displaced persons during the universal periodic review in February 2010. The 
Representative believes that his visit and resulting recommendations are an 
opportunity to build upon and carry forward that process and the recommendations 
to which the Government of Iraq agreed. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Representative stresses that despite efforts to date, the complexity and 
scale of the internal displacement situation in Iraq requires stronger efforts by the 
Government and the international community to protect the human rights of 
internally displaced persons, address their immediate needs and find durable 
solutions to end their displacement. This can only be done on the basis of an inclusive 
and comprehensive strategy that takes into account all communities affected by 
displacement, including host communities and communities in areas of return. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the Representative acknowledges that KRG 
has received and provided safety to IDPs from all over Iraq regardless of their origin, 
particularly in the aftermath of the sectarian violence in the country 2006. Stronger 
coordination and cooperation mechanisms between the Central Government and 
KRG are necessary however, to address the situation of IDPs in this region, including 
vulnerable groups, as well as a number of administrative and financial assistance 
issues, such as difficulties in transferring PDS cards and receiving pensions, which are 
adversely affecting the rights and standard of living of IDPs. As well, while improved 
social, security, and economic conditions prevail in this region, continued cross border 
attacks continue to cause periodic displacement of its border populations. The 
Representative believes that stronger cooperation between the Government of Iraq 
and KRG, as well as concerted diplomatic efforts and border dialogues with relevant 
neighbouring countries, must be undertaken in order to prevent and raise awareness 
of the impact of cross&#8211;border attacks on civilian populations. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>In view of the above, the Representative would like to make the following 
recommendations</b>. 
</p>
<p>67. <b>The Representative recommends that the Government of Iraq: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop a two-pronged approach to the situation of internal 
displacement in Iraq which addresses both continuing humanitarian needs and longer 
term durable solution strategies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Develop, in accordance with international standards, in particular the 
Guiding Principles, a national action plan to address the immediate humanitarian 
needs and human rights of all displacement-affected communities, which includes 
equitable access to basic services, registration as IDPs and provision of personal 
documentation for those who may have lost it, need it renewed or transferred. Such a 
plan should envisage a mechanism with sufficient capacity and resources to provide 
adequate and the timely delivery of assistance and compensation to IDPs, as well as 
mechanisms to identify and target particular assistance to persons with special needs, 
such as women from minority groups that have been affected by conflict and 
displacement, widows and female headed households, the elderly, youth and children. 
This requires, inter alia, that federal and governorate authorities coordinate and 
improve the flexibility of systems related to the allocation, transfer and management 
of funds necessary to assist IDPs; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Reopen registration to all IDPs in the country, as per the Government&#8217;s 
stated intentions, in order to better assist IDPs with their displacement-specific needs, 
as well as to facilitate the identification and implementation of durable solutions. 
Information gained from more reliable IDP registration figures and surveys on the 
intention of IDPs should also be used to inform both a future national strategy on 
durable solutions, as well as governorate level action plans and strategies. The 
Government should also ensure that the reopening of registration of IDPs provides 
them with all related rights and benefits and is not exclusively conducted for statistical 
purposes in the context of the national census exercise; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Urgently address the dire living conditions and situation of an estimated 
500,000 Iraqis, a majority of whom are believed to be IDPs, currently living in 
informal settlements in Baghdad and other cities. Pending longer-term solutions, 
immediate measure should be taken to improve the conditions in these irregular 
settlements such as by providing essential services including water, sanitation facilities 
and garbage collection, as well as by bringing some improvements to shelters which 
are currently inadequate. Efforts should also be made to improve their access to 
health and education. Simultaneously, concrete steps should be taken to identify 
alternative housing and long-term solutions, including the allocation of land plots; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Declare a moratorium on evictions from these informal settlements, until 
the envisaged new strategy on internal displacement provides a clear plan and viable 
alternatives for these persons which are in line with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Develop a durable solutions strategy to internal displacement in Iraq in 
accordance with such international standards as the Guiding Principles which is 
comprehensive in its scope and includes the full range of durable solutions, including 
return, local integration or settlement in a different location. Such a strategy should 
also ensure that all IDPs, including those displaced by natural disasters and 
irrespective of when they were displaced, should have equal access to durable 
solutions. Local integration, in particular, may be the only feasible solution for those 
who fear return or do not wish to go back to their former place of residence for other 
reasons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure consultation with and the participation of displacement affected 
communities and IDPs themselves in the process of developing a durable solution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Pursue initiatives such as are being currently planned, which promote 
and assess the potential for local integration of IDPs in the different governorates 
across the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Strengthen property restitution and compensation measures, including 
by facilitating procedures to establish ownership, increasing the capacity and 
efficiency of related mechanisms, and identifying and applying the lessons learnt from 
the country&#8217;s experience in property restitution to date. This should be accompanied 
by a number of others measures, such as community reconciliation and investment in 
basic community services; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Strengthen and clarify the institutional capacity and roles of the 
Ministry of Displacement and Migration, the Directorate of Migration and 
Displacement and provincial authorities on questions of displacement. This includes 
increasing the capacity of the Ministry of Displacement and Migration to both engage 
in day-to-day operational activities related to displacement, as well as to coordinate 
with relevant ministries, national and international agencies. Provincial authorities 
should play a key role in liaising with national, municipal and village authorities, and 
engage in intra-Government coordination, especially in the planning and 
implementation of displacement-related activities and policies; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Adopt a binding legal framework for the protection of IDPs in line with 
international standards and the National Policy on Displacement, which provides a 
comprehensive set of rights for all IDPs and enables a more consist and coherent 
designation of roles and responsibilities among federal and governorate institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Develop a national peace-building and reconciliation strategy which 
seeks to prevent further forced displacement and implement sustainable long-term 
solutions to displacement in the country. This could include the increased capacity of 
the Iraqi Implementation and Follow-up Committee for National Reconciliation to 
address tensions and reconciliation issues in the context of displacement, including 
with regard to tensions between IDPs and host communities, and in the identification 
and implementation of durable solutions, including local integration and returns. 
Activities such as the Diyala initiative, which address national and reconciliation 
issues in the context of integration and return programmes should be actively 
promoted and adequately resourced. The Government of Iraq should also develop a 
multi-year media and outreach campaign that raises awareness of the harm of 
sectarian divisions and violence within the country, promotes messages of national 
peacebuilding and, in that context, raises awareness of the rights and situation of 
IDPs.  In that spirit, the Government of Iraq, in coordination with all local authorities, 
should identify and specifically avoid policies and programmes which risk cementing 
or increasing ethnic or religious divisions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Systematically include displacement-related issues, including 
humanitarian and durable solutions aspects, in national development frameworks and 
activities, in particular in the forthcoming National Development Plan, and provide 
sufficient budgetary allocations for these activities. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> With regard to the situation of IDPs in Kirkuk, the Government should 
investigate allegations of recent harassment and detention of IDPs and take measures 
to both reaffirm and ensure that the upcoming census exercise remains non-political 
and inclusive and does not adversely affect the human rights of IDPs. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>With regard to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the Government should 
strengthen, together with KRG, diplomatic efforts and border dialogues to address 
the cross border attacks and raise awareness of the harm to civilian populations in 
border areas. Simultaneously, systems should be put in place to improve reception 
capacities for border populations suffering from these periodic attacks and 
displacement. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Representative recommends that the Kurdistan Regional Government 
(KRG) authorities, in coordination with the Federal Government, develop, in 
accordance with international standards (in particular the Guiding Principles), an 
action plan to address the immediate social needs of  and durable solutions for the 
30,000 IDP families in the region within the broader national displacement strategy. 
Such a regional action plan should include housing interventions such as rental 
subsidies, housing and land allocations, livelihood and employment projects (including 
language training for non-Kurdish speakers), improved access to educational 
facilities, including through language training and measures to address dropouts due 
to poverty, and improved access to health care. More targeted assistance programmes 
would also be necessary to address the specific problems of particularly vulnerable 
IDPs (including due to chronic poverty) and groups at risk of abuse or exploitation, 
including female-headed households, separated children, and children who have taken 
on the role of breadwinners. KRG, in coordination with the Federal Government, 
should reopen registration to all IDPs in the region. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>71.<b> The Representative recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support and provide technical assistance to the Government of Iraq in 
the development of a national strategy on durable solutions and a national action plan 
on humanitarian assistance to IDPs. Similar assistance should also be provided to 
KRG and other governorates for the development of regional strategies and action 
plans, in line with national policies and strategies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue to support the Government of Iraq through capacity-building 
and technical assistance, particularly in relation to the development of national IDP 
legislative frameworks, joint initiatives on such integrated and holistic durable 
solutions projects as the Diyala initiative and the implementation of humanitarian 
assistance activities to IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Continue and strengthen monitoring, information analysis and advocacy 
activities in relation to the human rights situation of IDPs, including IDP returnees; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) In line with the two-pronged approach, strengthen support and financial 
commitment to UNHCR and other humanitarian actors, in order to address the 
urgent humanitarian needs in the informal IDP settlements, directing resources 
towards the construction of low cost houses for homeless IDPs and other vulnerable 
groups, in line with the Prime Minister&#8217;s proposal for allocation of land to homeless 
and destitute IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) In close cooperation with the Government of Iraq address and direct 
resources to the urgent humanitarian needs of some 500,000 homeless Iraqis, many of 
whom are IDPs;    
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Work closely with the Government of Iraq and concerned United 
Nations agencies, to develop a work plan for the implementation of the commitments 
made in the context of the universal periodic review; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure the inclusion of IDP-related issues in the development 
programmes of the United Nations and the international donor community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Actively engage in diplomatic initiatives to encourage long-term capacity 
building with regard to institutional, human rights, rule of law, and governance issues 
in Iraq, including in order to prevent further forced displacement due to sectarian 
violence, impunity, and violations of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Actively encourage a more diversified group of international donors to 
support and engage with the Government of Iraq on both quick impact and longer-
term projects aimed at improving human rights, as well as the humanitarian and 
longer-term situation of IDPs.
