</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the responsibility to promote and protect cultural 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> that respect for the cultural diversity and cultural rights of all

The right to food 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council on the right to food, in particular Assembly resolution 65/220 of 21 December 
2010 and Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010 and 16/27 of 25 March 2011, as well 
as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights on the issue, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council, at which 
the Council analysed the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
realization of the right to food for all, and Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 
18 September 2008 and 12/10 of 1 October 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the right of everyone to adequate food, including the fundamental 
right of every person to be free from hunger, is recognized, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 
2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 
2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing 
Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained 
in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that </p>


<p><b>22</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty 
eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly 
interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared 
responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food and 
nutrition insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress 
made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of 
several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic 
factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global 
climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant 
technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed 
countries, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in 
particular in the said countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have 
serious consequences for the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, 
which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and 
alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, 
especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including 
women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in 
particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the importance of reversing the substantial decline in assistance devoted to 
agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in 
productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional 
farmers, in particular women farmers, and the most vulnerable groups, as well as national 
and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all 
relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the evolution of the world food crisis, which has 
been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis and seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, especially for one sixth of the world 
population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer from hunger, 
malnutrition and food insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Considers it intolerable</i> that, according to an estimation by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the 
age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are 
undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an 
additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of 
the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could 
produce enough food to feed twelve billion people; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality 
and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of smallholder farmers in developing countries, 
including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food and nutrition 
security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their 
development; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of 
women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to 
food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and 
water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and 
technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Stresses</i> the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including, in particular, 
rural women and vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food and nutrition insecurity to 
integrate into and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights 
perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; </p>


<p><b>24</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages </i>States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take 
steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as 
possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government; 
</p>
<p> (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population; 
</p>
<p> (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Underlines</i> the significance of national government policies and strategies on 
food production and poverty alleviation; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop 
rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food and nutrition security, with a special 
focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, 
paragraph 2, thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the 
measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses</i> that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and 
consider ways to integrate, where applicable and according to national contexts, the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food13 in policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Recognizes</i> that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural 
areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, 
and that these people are especially vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, given the 
increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, 
seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that 
sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food 
and nutrition security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, 
fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and the 
provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in countries experiencing serious drought 
and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Requests</i> all States and private actors, and international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective 
realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Encourages </i>all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food and nutrition security; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
 23. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Calls for</i> the early conclusion and a successful, development-oriented 
outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a 
contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to 
food; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
</p>

</p>
<p>13

<p><b>26</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Stresses</i> that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Recognizes</i> that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding for realizing the 
aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from 
hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Reaffirms</i> that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Urges</i> States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance, as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food and nutrition security, while recognizing that 
each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national 
programmes and strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Reaffirms</i> the commitment made in the ministerial declaration of the 2009 
high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council to eliminating hunger and to 
securing food for all, today and tomorrow, and reiterates that relevant United Nations 
organizations should be assured the resources needed to expand and enhance their food 
assistance, and support safety net programmes designed to address hunger and malnutrition, 
when appropriate, through the use of local and regional purchase; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Calls upon</i> Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises 
currently occurring across Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel, and 
expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to 
cut operations across different regions, including southern Africa; </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>27 
</b></p>
<p> 35. <i>Encourages</i> developing countries to establish regional arrangements, where 
they do not exist, with the support of the international community and development 
partners to ensure adequate food production and thereby contribute to ensuring food and 
nutrition security, in particular in developing countries that have scarce fertile land; 
</p>
<p> 36. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations of a regional approach towards ensuring food and nutrition security, and 
expresses its appreciation for the current collaboration with all Rome-based institutions 
working comprehensively towards the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 37. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Working 
Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the 
realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water 
resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 38. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries; 
</p>
<p> 39. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to 
adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and the increased price volatility of 
agricultural commodities on international markets, particularly on people in developing 
countries and on net food-importing countries; 
</p>
<p> 40. <i>Stresses </i>the need to address the root causes of excessive food price volatility, 
including its structural causes, at all levels, and the need to manage the risks linked to high 
and excessively volatile prices in agriculture commodities and their consequences for 
global food and nutrition security; 
</p>
<p> 41. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and 
net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Human 
Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> 42. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur1 and the 
recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p> 43. <i>Calls upon</i> all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organizations: 
</p>
<p> (a) To combat the different forms of malnutrition as a means to realize the right 
to adequate food, including, if appropriate, by adopting a national strategy in this regard; 
</p>

Rights of persons with disabilities: participation in political and 
public life 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be 
guaranteed the full enjoyment of their rights and freedoms without discrimination, 
 <i>Reaffirming also</i> all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the rights 
of persons with disabilities, the most recent of which was resolution 16/15 of 24 March 
2011, and welcoming the efforts of all stakeholders to implement those resolutions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> the right to participate in political and public life, as set out in 
article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that everyone has the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>right to take part in the Government of his or her country directly, or through freely chosen 
representatives, and the right of equal access to public service, as well as, inter alia, article 
25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, most recently and with 
regard to persons with disabilities, in article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the above-mentioned article 29 of the Convention reaffirms the right 
of persons with disabilities to participate in political and public life, and that parties to the 
Convention are required to guarantee political rights to persons with disabilities and adopt 
all appropriate measures to ensure that they enjoy these rights on an equal basis with others, 
 <i>Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons 
with disabilities in all regions continue to be denied their right to participate in political and 
public life on an equal basis with others, and noting that the exclusion or restriction of 
political rights of persons with disabilities on the basis of disability constitutes 
discrimination contrary to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that full and effective participation and inclusion in society is a general 
principle of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and thus that 
participation in political and public life on an equal basis with others is closely interrelated 
with and interdependent on other Convention provisions, including those that require States 
parties to ensure non-discrimination and accessibility and to recognize legal capacity and 
the right to participate in the community on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of 
discrimination, including in their participation in political and public life, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that, to date, one hundred and fifty three States have 
signed and one hundred and nine States and one regional integration organization have 
ratified or acceded to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that 
ninety States have signed and sixty six States have ratified or acceded to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention, and calls upon those States and regional integration 
organizations that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention and the Optional 
Protocol to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> States that have ratified the Convention and have submitted one 
or more reservations to it to initiate a process to review regularly the effect and continued 
relevance of such reservations, and to consider the possibility of withdrawing them; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the thematic study on participation in political and public life by 
persons with disabilities prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights,20 and calls upon all stakeholders to consider the findings and 
recommendations of the study; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can 
effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others, 
including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected, and 
to participate in the conduct of public affairs; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States parties to adopt and implement appropriate measures 
to ensure that persons with disabilities can participate effectively and fully in political and

regional, national and international levels; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Further calls upon</i> States parties to ensure that measures to assist persons 
with disabilities in their participation in political and public life are consistent with the 
Convention, including the general principle of inclusion in society; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> States parties to review any existing exclusion or restriction of 
political rights for persons with disabilities, including those persons with psychosocial, 
mental or intellectual disabilities, and to take all appropriate measures, including 
legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that 
constitute discrimination against persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties, in adopting and implementing measures to ensure 
that persons with disabilities have the opportunity to participate effectively and fully in 
political and public life, including the conduct of public affairs on an equal basis with 
others, to consult closely with and actively involve persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls upon</i> States and invites other relevant stakeholders, including 
national monitoring mechanisms, to collect appropriate information, including statistical 
and research data, to enable the formulation and implementation of policies relating to 
participation in political and public life of persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant actors in the design of products, environments, 
programmes and services relating to participation in political and public life to pay due 
attention to universal design, which requires the consideration of the needs of all members 
of society in order to avoid the need for any subsequent adaptation or specialized design; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also encourages</i> all relevant actors in undertaking measures of international 
cooperation, between and among States and, as appropriate, in partnership with relevant 
international and regional organizations and civil society, to consider appropriate and 
effective measures in support of national efforts to enhance enjoyment of political rights by

the Palestinian civilian population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip, taking into 
account Israeli concerns, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing systematic violation of the human 
rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including that arising from 
the excessive use of force and military operations causing death and injury to Palestinian 
civilians, including children, women and non-violent, peaceful demonstrators; the use of 
collective punishment; the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and 
expansion of settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949; the destruction of property and infrastructure; 
and all other actions by it designed to change the legal status, geographical nature and 
demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned in particular</i> about the critical humanitarian and security 
situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from the prolonged closures and severe 
economic and movement restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade and the military 
operations between December 2008 and January 2009, which caused extensive loss of life 
and injury, particularly among Palestinian civilians, including children and women, 
widespread destruction and damage to Palestinian homes, properties, vital infrastructure 
and public institutions, including hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities and the 
internal displacement of civilians, as well as about the firing of rockets into Israel,

</p>
<p> <i>Also expressing deep concern</i> at the Israeli policy of closures and the imposition of 
severe restrictions, checkpoints, several of which have been transformed into structures 
akin to permanent border crossings, and a permit regime, all of which obstruct the freedom 
of movement of persons and goods, including medical and humanitarian goods, throughout 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and impair the Territory&#8217;s 
contiguity, and at the consequent violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and 
the negative impact on their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed at rehabilitating 
and developing the Palestinian economy, which remains that of a humanitarian crisis in the 
Gaza Strip, while taking note of recent developments with regard to the situation of access 
there,

children and women and elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, continue 
to be detained and held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under harsh conditions, 
including, inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, lack of proper medical 
care, denial of family visits and denial of due process, that impair their well-being, and 
expressing deep concern also about the ill-treatment and harassment of any Palestinian 
prisoners and all reports of torture,

activities, the construction of the wall and any other measures aimed at altering the

detrimental impact on the human rights of the Palestinian people and the prospects for a 
peaceful settlement; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns</i> all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation, 
incitement and destruction, especially the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying 
forces against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, which have caused 
extensive loss of life and vast numbers of injuries, including among children, massive 
damage and destruction to homes, properties, vital infrastructure and public institutions, 
including hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities, and agricultural lands, mosques

<p> <i>Affirming</i> that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,

in and around East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the

the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including

</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully

Middle East peace process of 8 December 2009, in which the Council reiterated that 
settlements, the separation barrier where built on occupied land, demolition of homes and 
evictions are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to 
make a two-State solution impossible, and particularly its urgent call upon the Government 
of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities, in East Jerusalem and the rest of the 
West Bank, and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts erected since March

settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new 
housing units for Israeli settlers in the West Bank and around occupied East Jerusalem, as 
they undermine the peace process, constitute a threat to the two-State solution and the 
creation of a contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State, and are in violation 
of international law, and calls upon the Government of Israel to reverse immediately its 
decisions, which would further undermine and jeopardize the ongoing efforts by the 
international community to reach a final settlement compliant with international legitimacy, 
including relevant United Nations resolutions;

<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p> (a) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 
49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign 
and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (b) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 
and 2012 amounting to several thousands, including a large number of permanent buildings 
and structures, which undermine the efforts of the international community to advance the

</p>
<p> (c) The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (d) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
occupied Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent, in which case it would be tantamount 
to de facto annexation; </p>


<p><b>52</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p> (e) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West

</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power:

Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 2009, 
in which the States members of the Movement decided to oppose unilateralism and 
unilaterally-imposed measures by certain States, which can lead to the erosion and violation 
of the Charter and international law, the use and threat of use of force and pressure and 
coercive measures as a means to achieving their national policy objectives, and to support,

to compensation for damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation of

<p> <i>Recalling also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14

all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and 
social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby 
creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and

addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from 
exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates</i> its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United

concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be

<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 65/32 of 6 December 2010, in which the 
Assembly decided to convene a high-level meeting on the rule of law at the national and 
international levels during the high-level segment of its sixty-seventh session, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that, while democracies share common features, there is no single 
model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region, and 
reaffirming also the necessity of due respect for sovereignty and the right to self-
determination, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Stresses</i> that democracy includes respect for all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, freedom 
of expression and opinion, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, the right to be 
recognized everywhere as a person before the law and the right to take part in the conduct 
of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, to vote in a pluralistic 
system of political parties and organizations and to be elected at genuine, periodic, free and 
fair elections by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot guaranteeing the free 
expression of the will of the people, as well as respect for the rule of law, the separation of 
powers, the independence of the judiciary, transparency and accountability in public 
administration and decision-making and free, independent and pluralistic media; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of every citizen to vote and be elected at genuine periodic 
elections without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or 
belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
and stresses that persons entitled to vote must be free to vote for any candidate of party for 
election and free to support or to oppose government, without undue influence or coercion 
of any kind that may distort or inhibit the free expression of the elector&#8217;s will, and that the 
results of genuine, periodic, free and fair elections representing the choice of the people for 
their representatives should be respected by the international community, as well as by all 
parties and stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> therefore that everyone must be able to express their grievances or 
aspirations in a peaceful manner, including through public protests, without fear of being 
injured, beaten, arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured, killed or subjected to enforced 
disappearance; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that democracy is vital for the promotion and protection of all 
human rights;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recalls</i> that the interdependence between a functioning democracy, strong 
and accountable institutions, transparent and inclusive decision-making and effective rule 
of law is essential for a legitimate and effective Government that is respectful of human 
rights;

<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> the crucial role played by the political opposition and civil 
society in the proper functioning of a democracy; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure a safe and enabling environment for the media,

rights defenders to the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
create a safe and enabling environment for their work; 
</p>

countries, upon their request, that are emerging from conflict or undergoing 
democratization, as they may face special challenges in addressing legacies of human rights 
violations during their transition and in moving towards democratic governance and the 
rule of law; </p>


<p><b>100</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> the encouraging developments in countries on all continents where 
free elections have taken place for the first time, positive constitutional changes have been 
enacted and democratic institutions have been strengthened, thus building confidence in 
representational governance and contributing to greater national and regional peace and 
stability; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> that democratization can be a fragile process and that the respect of 
human rights and the rule of law are essential for the stability of democratic societies, 
including in the context of using information and communication technologies such as the 
Internet, mobile networks and social media tools; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also recalls</i> that States are guarantors of democracy, human rights, good 
governance and the rule of law, and bear responsibility for their full implementation; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms</i> that democracy and racism are incompatible and that any form of 
impunity condoned by public authorities for crimes motivated by racist, xenophobic or 
other discriminatory attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and 
tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts, and condemns political platforms and 
organizations based on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related 
discrimination, as well as legislation and practices based on racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolution 17/23 of 17 June 2011, 
 <i>Reiterating the commitment</i> to ensure the effective enjoyment of all civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights for everyone, including the right to development, and 
the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural 
wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law, 
and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization 
and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty 
eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Alarmed</i> at cases of corruption that involve vast quantities of assets, which may 
constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, the deprivation of which 
threatens the political stability and sustainable development of those States and has a 
negative impact on the application by States of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by the phenomenon of corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, 
which may endanger the stability and security of societies, undermine the values of </p>

</p>
<p>democracy and morality and jeopardize social, economic and political development, 
especially when an inadequate national and international response leads to impunity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and welcoming the 
growing number of States parties to it, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional 
organizations, in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and 
combating corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin and in returning such 
assets, and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions 
at all levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law 
enforcement measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
in particular chapters II and III thereof, 
</p>
<p> <i>Appreciating</i> the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental 
working groups, to overview the review process of the implementation of the Convention, 
to advise on the provision of technical assistance to building institutional and human 
capacity in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international 
cooperation, including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of 
funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of 
their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human 
rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have 
a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation as part of their obligation of international 
cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption and in the field of human rights, and in line with the commitment made 
at the 2005 World Summit to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the difficulties, in particular the practical difficulties, that both 
requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into 
account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable 
development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing 
a link between the proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in 
the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that 
everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until 
proven guilty according to law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption, while recognizing that States continue to face challenges in 
recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the 
complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with 
the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow 
of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases 
involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and 
their family members and close associates, and recognizing also that legal difficulties are 
often exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with deep concern</i> that, as indicated in the comprehensive study prepared by 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the negative impact of the 
non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>119 
</b></p>
<p>human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights,67 only around 2 per cent of 
the estimated funds of illicit origin annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to 
their countries of origin, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting </i>the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition regarding the return of assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in 
particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to 
enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national 
priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable 
development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, and stressing that any 
resource that the State is deprived of because of corruption has potentially the same 
negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or domestically retained, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the comprehensive study prepared by the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the negative impact of the non-
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human 
rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights;67 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet acceded to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Asserts</i> the urgent need to repatriate illicit funds to the countries of origin 
without conditionalities, consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption 
and in line with the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit to make the fight against 
corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and urges all States 
to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover those funds; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of compliance with international human rights 
law in relation to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin through, inter alia, promoting 
human rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of 
the Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption to consider ways of adopting a human rights-based approach in the 
implementation of the Convention, including when dealing with the repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin, and appreciates the continued efforts of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
Working Group on Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling 
their obligations under the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective 
manner the international transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international 
cooperation in asset recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources 
and willingness of the requesting State&#8217;s institutions and authorities, there is a victim 
society that is suffering the consequences of the transfer of those funds; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision made at the fourth session of the Conference of the 
States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to convene open-ended 
intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and assist States 
with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with appreciation the 
Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime, and encourages coordination among existing initiatives;

Nations system, in support of national, subregional and regional efforts to prevent and 
combat corruption practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin, consistent with the 
principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and, in this regard, 
encourages close cooperation at the national and international levels between anti-
corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requested to repatriate funds of illicit origin to fully 
uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to acknowledge that, in fulfilling their obligations in 
this regard under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, they also have a 
responsibility towards societies affected by corruption to make every effort to achieve the 
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the 
negative impact of non-repatriation, including on the enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, 
lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage and enhancing 
cooperation in this regard between anti-corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and 
financial intelligence units, in particular taking into account the risks of dissipation of those 
funds, and, where appropriate, by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of 
conviction in the country of origin; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls upon</i> all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin 
to fully uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels 
and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to apply the principles of accountability, 
transparency and participation in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of 
repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to 
improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or 
mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating 
conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration 
of justice; 
 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> that it is the obligation of the State to investigate and prosecute 
corruption, calls upon all States to strengthen criminal proceedings directed at freezing or 
restraining funds of illicit origin, and encourages requesting States to ensure that adequate 
national investigative procedures have been initiated and substantiated for the purpose of 
presenting mutual legal assistance requests and, in this context, encourages requested States 
to provide, when appropriate, information on legal frameworks and procedures to the 
requesting State; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Underlines</i> that there is also a corporate responsibility to comply with and 
respect all applicable laws and human rights, and a need for greater access to effective 
remedies by victims in order to realize effective prevention of, and remedy for, business-
related human rights harm, as set out in the guiding principles on business and human 
rights;68 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Stresses</i> the need for transparency in financial institutions and effective due 
diligence measures to be applied by financial intermediaries, calls upon States to seek 
appropriate means in accordance with their international obligations to ensure the 
cooperation and responsiveness of financial institutions to foreign requests to freeze and 
recover funds of illicit origin and the provision of efficient mutual legal assistance regime 
to States requesting repatriation of those funds, and encourages the promotion of human 
and institutional capacity-building in that regard;

Situation of human rights in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>At the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, held from 27 February to  
23 March 2012, during consideration of agenda item 10, entitled &#8220;Technical assistance and 
capacity-building&#8221;, the President of the Council made the following statement: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the latest legal and political 
developments in Haiti, which have been marked by: 
</p>
<p> (a) The recent peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected 
president to another who is from an opposition party, and stresses the importance of 
ensuring that forthcoming local and parliamentary elections are carried out under 
proper conditions; 
</p>
<p> (b) The appointment and investiture of 11 of the 12 judges of the Court of 
Cassation, including the chief justice, and progress towards placing sufficient 
material and human resources at the disposal of the justice system to permit the 
implementation of the judicial reform adopted in 2007, and underscores the need to 
improve the operation of the Haitian prison system. 
</p>
<p> 2. The Council also welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; plans to build 
housing for victims of the earthquake of 12 January 2010. It further welcomes the 
establishment of a special fund for children&#8217;s schooling in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 3. The Council applauds the reaffirmation of the Haitian authorities&#8217; 
commitment and determination to improve the living conditions of Haitian women 
and men by, inter alia, devoting greater attention to respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p> 4. The Council also applauds the priorities set by the President of the 
Republic, which include the rule of law, education, the environment and 
employment, and urges donors to honour their commitments without delay. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>135 
</b></p>
<p> 5. The Council emphasizes that the strengthening of national human 
rights institutions, such as the Office of Citizen Protection, as well as respect for 
human rights and due process of law, the fight against crime and its causes, and the 
effort to combat impunity are essential in order to ensure the rule of law and security 
in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 6. The Council invites the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt the 
necessary political and legal measures, including measures to combat the trafficking 
of children, in order to guarantee the rights of members of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p> 7. The Council also invites the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt 
the necessary political and legal measures to increase women&#8217;s participation in 
political affairs and to continue to combat gender-based violence and discrimination. 
</p>
<p> 8. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti 
and the difficulties encountered by its leaders following the earthquake of 12 
January 2010. It recognizes that the full enjoyment of civil and political, economic, 
social and cultural human rights is a factor in peace, stability and development in 
Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 9. The Council encourages the international community as a whole and, 
in particular, international donors, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean 
States, the group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti and United Nations 
specialized agencies to step up their cooperation with the Haitian authorities with a 
view to the full realization in Haiti of civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p> 10. The Council welcomes the request of the Haitian authorities for a one-
year extension of the mission of the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in Haiti, whose mandate concerns technical assistance and capacity-building, 
and decides to approve this request. 
</p>
<p> 11. The Council encourages the independent expert to work with 
international institutions, donors and the international community to raise their 
awareness of the need to provide their expertise and sufficient resources to support 
the Haitian authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the country in the wake of the earthquake 
of 12 January 2010. 
</p>
<p> 12. The Council also encourages the independent expert to continue to 
work with Haitian non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations in 
Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 13. The Council invites the independent expert to assist the Government 
of Haiti to act upon the recommendations made in the course of the universal 
periodic review. He will also provide his experience, expertise and contribution to 
the cause of human rights, including civil and political rights and with particular 
emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights, in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 14. The Council also invites the independent expert to submit his report at

<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>342. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and President&#8217;s statements PRST/8/1 and PRST/9/2 on modalities and practices for the 
universal periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the twelfth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, held from 3 to 14 October 2011, as well as of Libya, the review outcome of which 
could not be adopted at an earlier session. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>343. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement 8/1, the section below 
contains a summary of the views expressed on universal periodic review outcomes by the 
State under review, Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council, as well as 
general comments made by other relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome 
by the Council in plenary session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Tajikistan 
</b>344. The review of Tajikistan was held on 3 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Tajikistan in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/3). 
</p><p>345. At its 37th meeting, on 14 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Tajikistan (see section C below). 
346. The outcome of the review of Tajikistan comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/3), the views of Tajikistan concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/3/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>347. The delegation stated that Tajikistan had made its final position on the 
recommendations made in the framework of the universal periodic review after careful 
analysis and discussions with representatives of Government agencies and of civil society. 
</p>
<p>348. The delegation reported on a change in Tajikistan&#8217;s position on the recommendation 
that it decriminalize defamation and insults, formulated in paragraph 90.38 of the report of 
the Working Group. Tajikistan had decided to accept the recommendation although it 
initially declined to support it in the addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
Tajikistan&#8217;s commitment in this regard had been reflected in the statement made by the 
President of Tajikistan in March 2012. Having the above-mentioned in mind, the relevant </p>


<p><b>184</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>paragraph in the addendum to the report of the Working Group should read that Tajikistan 
had accepted recommendation 90.38. 
</p>
<p>349. The Government paid special attention to the enhancement of the role of women in 
society and to equality between men and women. The delegation pointed out some 
measures that the Government had taken recently in this regard. The process of drafting a 
law on domestic violence had started with the aim of combating domestic violence and 
providing victims with assistance. Tajikistan had accepted the recommendation that it ratify 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. The Government planned to implement recommendations regarding the 
treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders. 
</p>
<p>350. As a continuation of its measures to reform the criminal code, Tajikistan had 
accepted the recommendations that it ratify the second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Tajikistan had also accepted the 
recommendations on ensuring the independence of the Council of Justice, holding regular 
medical examinations of persons deprived of their liberty, and ensuring independent and 
impartial investigations into all allegations of violation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>351. Tajikistan had also accepted the recommendation on ensuring the right to challenge 
the lawfulness of administrative detention and the access of detainees to a lawyer, doctor 
and their family members from the time that they are taken into custody, and on amending 
the Criminal Procedural Code to ensure that the identity of officers involved in detaining a 
person is duly recorded. 
</p>
<p>352. Tajikistan had accepted the recommendation on bringing the Criminal Code into line 
with international standards on freedom of assembly and religion, and considered that the 
recommendation had already been implemented. The delegation explained that, under the 
Criminal Code, participants in public assemblies were subject to criminal action only if 
they had personally taken part in violent acts or disorder. 
</p>
<p>353. The delegation stated that national legislation provided the necessary guarantees for 
the establishment of independent media, and it referred to several measures taken to ensure 
the freedom of the media. Tajikistan had accepted the recommendation on freedom of 
expression and the media, and on transparent procedures for obtaining a broadcasting 
licence. It had also accepted a recommendation on prohibiting, preventing and sanctioning 
child labour. The delegation explained that legislation prohibited child labour and that the 
Government continued its efforts to prevent and prosecute it. 
</p>
<p>354. With regard to the recommendation on national and international monitoring in 
penitentiary institutions, the delegation explained that detention conditions were in line 
with minimum standards and norms in this area and that complaint mechanisms were 
available for persons in detention. Furthermore, Tajikistan offered the possibility for 
national and international monitors to visit detention centres in accordance with the 
arrangements and regulations laid down by national law. 
</p>
<p>355. After careful consideration, Tajikistan had not accepted several recommendations 
owing to the financial and economic situation in the country. Tajikistan had not accepted 
the recommendations on ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
and conventions on statelessness owing to the lack of financial and administrative resources 
necessary for the implementation of obligations under those treaties. In response to the 
recommendations regarding the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, the Government had made special efforts to strengthen national human 
rights institutions, reform the judicial system and improve the Criminal Code. However, 
Tajikistan was not in a position to establish the national preventative mechanism as 
required by the Optional Protocol owing to its economic situation; therefore, it could not 
support the recommendation. The ratification of the International Convention for the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance required a comprehensive 
comparative analysis of legislation in view of the requirements of the Convention; 
Tajikistan had therefore decided not to accept the recommendation on the ratification of the 
Convention at the present stage. 
</p>
<p>356. While Tajikistan had not accepted the recommendation on issuing a standing 
invitation to special procedures mandate holders, the Government continued to send 
invitations to some of them. The Government welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that of the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. 
</p>
<p>357. The Act on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations had been adopted in 
accordance with the requirements of international legal instruments, compared with the 
previous law, the Act made it easier to register religious associations, to combat illegal 
proselytizing and to realize the right to religious education and freedom of belief. 
Furthermore, Tajikistan respected the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion. There was no restriction to religious education of a child, although some 
limitations, in conformity with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, were permitted in 
the participation of children in religious organizations. Having this in mind, Tajikistan had 
not accepted the recommendations regarding legislation ensuring the freedom of children to 
participate in religious organizations. 
</p>
<p>358. As the implementation of several recommendations required additional resources, 
Tajikistan would plan the State budget by allocating the funding necessary for the 
implementation of its international human rights obligations. With regard to the 
recommendations that Tajikistan could not yet support, measures would be taken to bring 
legislation into conformity with international norms. A working group had been established 
to develop a national plan of action for the implementation of the recommendations made 
in the framework of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>359. Algeria welcomed the constructive participation of Tajikistan in the universal 
periodic review. While noting the progress made in the area of human rights, Algeria 
referred to several problems identified in the national report, in particular the widespread 
poverty. Algeria encouraged Tajikistan to continue its efforts to combat drug trafficking. It 
noted positively the fact that Tajikistan had supported three recommendations made by 
Algeria relating to the establishment of a national human rights institute, the completion of 
the implementation of the programme on combating human trafficking, and intensifying 
programmes to combat HIV/AIDS. Algeria also hoped that its recommendation that 
Tajikistan ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities would be 
possible after the improvement of financial and economic situation in the country. 
Tajikistan should receive assistance from the international community to improve standards 
of living, to raise public awareness on human rights and to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>360. Morocco commended Tajikistan for having accepted the majority of the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review. In particular, it welcomed the 
fact that the recommendations made by Morocco concerning human rights education and 
training for State officials and the improvement of prison conditions had been accepted and 
that its recommendation regarding the rights of the child had already been implemented. 
Morocco also reiterated its appreciation for Tajikistan&#8217;s long-term commitment to the 
protection of the rights of refugees, which was demonstrated by its ratification of the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto. Tajikistan&#8217;s 
commitment and undertakings in this area was a good practice to be considered by other </p>


<p><b>186</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>countries hosting refugees. Morocco also noted positively Tajikistan&#8217;s cooperation with 
treaty bodies and the mechanism of the Human Rights Council and the efforts of the 
Government to protect the most vulnerable groups of the population. 
</p>
<p>361. Cuba recognized Tajikistan&#8217;s efforts aimed at promoting universal access to health 
services and public education. It also welcomed the progress made in the areas of food 
security and combating human trafficking. It noted positively Tajikistan&#8217;s accession to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and two Optional Protocols thereto, and ILO 
Convention No. 182 on prohibiting the worst forms of child labour. It pointed out the 
national plan of action to reform the juvenile justice system, the measures taken to protect 
children from ill-treatment and the establishment of rehabilitation centres for women and 
children. Cuba also noted Tajikistan&#8217;s accession to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women without reservations. Cuba praised Tajikistan 
for having reduced poverty in recent years. It called on Tajikistan to continue its measures 
for the protection and promotion of human rights, and wished it success in the 
implementation of its socioeconomic development programmes. 
</p>
<p>362. UNICEF welcomed Tajikistan&#8217;s endorsement of a number of recommendations 
relating to the prohibition of corporal punishment of children in all settings, the elimination 
of child labour and the introduction of a separate juvenile justice system. It called on 
Tajikistan to focus on the rights of the most disadvantaged children, including children with 
disabilities and girls. UNICEF also welcomed Tajikistan&#8217;s adoption of the strategy on 
inclusive education for children with disabilities, and expressed its readiness to provide 
technical support to refine the strategy further and to implement it as a matter of priority. It 
also called on Tajikistan to ensure the right of children to live in a family environment by 
preventing family separation and developing family support and substitute services. Lastly, 
UNICEF urged Tajikistan to submit its overdue periodic reports for the two optional 
protocols to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>363. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme appreciated Tajikistan&#8217;s 
efforts to harmonize domestic legislation with international legal standards, and supported 
the measures taken in the area of gender equality. It noted with satisfaction the adoption of 
the moratorium on the death penalty and advised Tajikistan to take necessary steps to 
abolish it, in particular by ratifying the second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It remained concerned at the increasing restrictions 
on the freedom of conscience and belief, civil society organizations and independent media. 
It urged Tajikistan to take specific steps to meet its obligation to ensure a favourable 
environment for the freedom of expression. It deplored the allegations of torture and poor 
detention conditions, and encouraged Tajikistan to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and to request technical assistance for the renovation and 
construction of prisons. In conclusion, the organization encouraged Tajikistan to combat 
poverty and to ratify core human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>364. Save the Children called on Tajikistan to respect the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility of 14 years, without exception. Save the Children noted the adoption of the 
national plan of action on juvenile justice reform and of relevant legislative amendments, 
and it called for their full compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
international human rights standards. Save the Children deeply regretted the fact that the 
institutionalization of children with disabilities was still a common practice. It encouraged 
the Government to respect the principle of the best interests of the child with disabilities, 
and to ensure that community-based and family-based care services were prioritized. Save 
the Children called for the prompt ratification and implementation of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Save the Children echoed the concern expressed by the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>187 
</b></p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child that the number of children in State institutions had 
increased owing to the cases of institutionalization of children, with the consent of their 
parents, for economic reasons. It called on Tajikistan to establish comprehensive social 
protection and child protection systems to ensure an adequate standard of living to families, 
with the aim of avoiding family separation and children being left behind. 
</p>
<p>365. Action Canada for Population and Development, jointly with Federatie van 
Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homosekusualiteit (COC Nederland), 
commended Tajikistan for paying attention to the issue of gender recognition for 
transgender persons. They expressed the hope that Tajikistan would simplify the procedure 
of changing documents and not require surgeries for gender recognition. However, they 
highlighted the fact that gay and bisexual men continue to be detained and prosecuted 
despite the decriminalization of same-sex conduct, and that lesbian women continued to be 
forced into arranged marriages and controlled by families through beating and 
psychological pressure. They urged Tajikistan to take all necessary legislative measures to 
impose appropriate criminal penalties for violence, threats of violence, incitement to 
violence and related harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in all 
spheres of life. They also urged Tajikistan to ensure that violence based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity, including by law enforcement personnel, was vigorously 
investigated, that those responsible were prosecuted and duly punished, and that victims 
were provided with appropriate remedies and redress, including compensation. 
</p>
<p>366. Amnesty International welcomed Tajikistan&#8217;s support for several important 
recommendations on torture and ill-treatment, and urged the authorities to implement them 
without delay. Tajikistan had taken its first step by introducing draft amendments to the 
Criminal Code to bring the definition of torture into line with article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture. Tajikistan should now prioritize the implementation of recommendations to 
eradicate torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and to ensure prompt and credible 
investigations into all allegations of torture, including deaths in custody. Amnesty 
International referred to its research, showing that torture was widespread in Tajikistan, 
particularly in pretrial detention facilities. People suspected of supporting banned Islamic 
groups were at particular risk. A climate of impunity for such abuses by police and security 
forces prevailed; it therefore regretted Tajikistan&#8217;s rejection of the recommendation that it 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. It was concerned that 
Tajikistan regarded as already implemented a recommendation on the use of statements 
obtained under torture as evidence in legal proceedings. While the Code of Criminal 
Procedure required such evidence to be declared inadmissible, Amnesty International was 
concerned that judges frequently ignored allegations of torture. It called on Tajikistan to 
adopt legislation preventing statements made by detainees without a lawyer present from 
having probative value in court, except as evidence against those accused of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>367. Tajikistan would continue to take measures to improve its legislation and to bring it 
into line with international human rights standards. In this respect, the Government 
welcomed the cooperation and support of all interested parties. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Republic of Tanzania 
</b></p>
<p>368. The review of the United Republic of Tanzania was held on 3 October 2011 in 
conformity with all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, 
and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the United Republic of Tanzania in 
accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TZA/1); </p>


<p><b>188</b> GE.13-14768

<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TZA/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TZA/3). 
</p><p>369. At its 37th meeting, on 14 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the United Republic of Tanzania (see section C 
below). 
370. The outcome of the review of the United Republic of Tanzania comprises the report 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/4), the views of the 
United Republic of Tanzania concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/4/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>371. The United Republic of Tanzania thanked all the Member States and observers of 
the Human Rights Council for their contribution to a meaningful dialogue on its 
performance with regard to international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>372. During the course of the universal periodic review of the United Republic of 
Tanzania, 54 delegations had taken the floor, formulating questions and recommendations. 
It had received a total of 153 recommendations, immediately supported 96 
recommendations, while 4 had been noted. Some 53 recommendations had been deferred 
for further consideration. The Government gave full attention to all recommendations. 
</p>
<p>373. With regard to the recommendations accepted, the United Republic of Tanzania 
stated that they corresponded mostly to areas already identified in the course of the 
preparation of the national report as areas requiring further attention. There had been some 
significant changes since the presentation of the national report before the Working Group 
in October 2011. 
</p>
<p>374. Some delegations had recommended the creation of a special commission to 
supervise constitutional reforms. In response, the Constitutional Review Act No. 8 of 2011 
had provided for the establishment of a constitutional review commission, which would, 
inter alia, be responsible for coordinating and collecting public opinions on the new 
Constitution. The Act also provided for a procedure for constituting the Constituent 
Assembly, the holding of the referendum and other related matters. Pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act, the President had extended invitations to political parties, religious 
institutions, civil society and other interested groups to each submit three names of people 
to be considered for membership of the constitutional review commission, which was 
expected to commence its work before end of June 2012. 
</p>
<p>375. Regarding the recommendation on finalizing the national plan of action on human 
rights, a national technical committee comprising members of the Government, the 
Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance and civil society, was in place, with 
the support of UNDP under the One United Nations framework. The draft national human 
rights plan of action was expected to be finalized by June 2012. 
</p>
<p>376. The United Republic of Tanzania had rejected four recommendations on 
homosexuality, as well as on the abolition of the price of brides and polygamy. Same-sex 
unions were not culturally and legally accepted, as they violated and infringed cultural, 
religious and moral norms of Tanzanian society. The recommendation on the abolition of </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>189 
</b></p>
<p>the price of brides and polygamy was another area rejected on the basis of the enjoyment of 
cultural and religious rights. 
</p>
<p>377. Since the universal periodic review held in October 2011, the United Republic of 
Tanzania has considered the substance of each and every one of the deferred 
recommendations with the active participation of the relevant stakeholders from both within 
and outside the Government. The views and comments arising from a stakeholder&#8217;s 
workshop organized in December 2011 were considered and incorporated into the 
addendum on views on conclusions and or recommendations, voluntary commitments and 
replies submitted to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p>378. The United Republic of Tanzania had accepted a total of 107 recommendations. It 
agreed in part with the recommendations on considering the ratification of other core 
international human rights instruments. While the United Republic of Tanzania may not be 
a party to some treaties, it noted that, in practice, its policies were in most cases, already 
fully or largely in compliance with their provisions. The United Republic of Tanzania 
would continue to study the implications of acceding to other major human rights treaties. It 
had informed the Human Rights Council of its intention to consider accession to the 
International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, among other instruments. Some treaties were at the stage of 
cabinet approval. 
</p>
<p>379. With regard to issuing or extending an open invitation for special procedures, the 
United Republic of Tanzania noted that it had regularly received mandate holders and 
would continue to work with such mechanisms of the Human Rights Council. Requests for 
visits would be considered positively on a case-by-case basis. The Government was also 
working with other mechanisms; for example, a country review mission team of the African 
Peer Review Mechanism was currently in the country to review good governance issues. 
Likewise, in September 2011, the United Republic of Tanzania had pledged to join the 
Open Government Partnership initiative that aims to make Government business more open 
to its citizens, combat corruption and build greater trust. 
</p>
<p>380. With regard to the abolition of the death penalty and formalizing the de facto 
moratorium as a step towards its complete abolition, the United Republic of Tanzania 
categorically stated that this recommendation did not enjoy its support, as already 
mentioned in its national report and the statement delivered in October 2011. The 
Government would, in collaboration with other stakeholders, continue to inform the public 
on the general international trends with regard to the death penalty. On the establishment of 
a de jure moratorium on the death penalty, internal consultations and public opinion should 
be given the highest consideration. Most of these contentious issues would be deliberated 
upon in the forthcoming constitutional review process. 
</p>
<p>381. A number of measures had been taken by the Government in collaboration with civil 
society to address the issue of gender-based violence. The Constitution prohibited 
discrimination on the basis of, among other things, sex and gender. The Penal Code and the 
Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act criminalized various forms of gender and sexual-
based violence, including rape, sexual assault and harassment, sex work and trafficking. 
While the recommendation made in this regard enjoyed the State&#8217;s support in part, the 
United Republic of Tanzania did not accept any importation of the concept of marital rape 
embedded therein. Because of diverse opinions and issues, the question of introducing 
marital rape for married couples required a wider and culturally sensitive debate. 
</p>
<p>382. The United Republic of Tanzania stated that corporal punishment for persons 
convicted of certain offences was provided for by law under the Corporal Punishment Act 
and its regulations, as well as by the Prisons Act. This punishment was not applicable to </p>


<p><b>190</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>females and males over 55 years of age and, as a result of strict procedures and controls, it 
had not been administered for more than a decade. 
</p>
<p>383. The United Republic of Tanzania made a distinction between caning and corporal 
punishment; caning was administered to pupils and students for acts of gross indiscipline. 
The Education Act prescribed a strict framework for its administration. The caning of 
miscreant students in schools was viewed as a legitimate form of punishment, a constant 
reminder for pupils to adhere to education guidelines and regulations. 
</p>
<p>384. Regarding the recommendation on setting the minimum age of marriage for boys 
and girls at 18, the State pointed out that the Law of Marriage Act had been the subject of a 
protracted debate on gender equality, specifically the rights of women and girls; on the one 
hand, culture, traditions and religion and, on the other, the rights of some sections of the 
society, especially women and girls, were considered. A Government white paper had been 
prepared in order to obtain a balanced position on this matter. 
</p>
<p>385. The Government was also determined to review its laws governing freedom of the 
press. The bill on cabinet papers for both the media and newspapers concerning mainland 
Tanzania were in their final stage. With regard to Tanzania Zanzibar, the process for 
enacting the right to information bill was still at an early stage. The Human Rights Council 
would be updated on this process in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>386. The United Republic of Tanzania informed the Human Rights Council that the 
recommendation on respect for the right to assembly in the constitutional review process 
enjoyed its support, and the Constitutional Review Act No. 8 of 2011 contained provisions 
for the right to assembly and participation in the process. 
</p>
<p>387. During consideration of its national report at the session of Working Group in 
October 2011, the United Republic of Tanzania had clarified its position on indigenous 
peoples, indicating that it was a term that was not applicable to Tanzania, as all Tanzanians 
of African descent were indigenous to the United Republic of Tanzania. The Government, 
however, recognized the vulnerability of some marginalized communities, and it had been 
responsive to their needs and would continue to be so. 
</p>
<p>388. Bearing in mind the resource and time implications for the submission of a midterm 
report on the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations, the United 
Republic of Tanzania would continue to report regularly to the Human Rights Council and 
the treaty bodies, as and when necessary, just before its next periodic review in 2016. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>389. Cuba noted that the United Republic of Tanzania had achieved the Millennium 
Development Goal relating to universal primary education five years before the deadline of 
</p><p>2015. Economic empowerment funds have been created to benefit those marginalized by 
the conventional banking system, and plans aimed at disadvantaged persons had been 
implemented to normalize real estate and companies. Plans to raise awareness about water 
and sanitation, food, environmental health, sexual and reproductive health, and the 
promotion of public health, were also being implemented at the community level. Positive 
steps had been taken in the areas of the rights of women and persons with disabilities. Cuba 
recommended that the report of the Working Group on the United Republic of Tanzania 
should be adopted. 
</p>
<p>390. Algeria highlighted the commitment of the United Republic of Tanzania to the 
universal periodic review in its support for the majority of the recommendations made. It 
appreciated the acceptance of Algeria&#8217;s recommendations on the intensification of its 
programme to combat poverty, the ratification of the International Convention on the </p>

completion of its draft national plan of action for the promotion and protection of human 
rights and the plan of action on violence against women. The United Republic of Tanzania 
would undergo the peer review process by the African Union in July 2012. It wished the 
State success in its efforts, and recommended the adoption of the report of the Working 
Group. 
</p>
<p>391. Morocco welcomed the establishment of a national human rights institution in the 
United Republic of Tanzania, as well as the initiatives to improve the realization of 
refugees&#8217; rights, such as the regularization and naturalization of many refugees. Morocco 
had also noted the efforts made by the State to strengthen the rights of women, including 
their participation in public life, and the measures taken in favour of young people and 
persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>392. South Africa noted the voluntary commitments made by the Government of the 
United Republic of Tanzania that included, inter alia, the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals. South Africa commended the State&#8217;s commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights, as demonstrated by the large number of recommendations 
that had enjoyed the support of the Government. It congratulated the United Republic of 
Tanzania on having met the Millennium Development Goal on universal primary education 
before the deadline. South Africa called on the international community to provide the 
country with the necessary technical assistance and capacity-building requirements. 
</p>
<p>393. Botswana recognized the acceptance of the recommendation to prepare and 
implement a national plan of action on human rights as proof of the State&#8217;s commitment to 
the promotion and protection of human rights in a more systematic and predictable manner. 
Botswana understood and fully appreciated the challenges that accompanied the acceptance 
of universal periodic review recommendations, and expressed the hope that the United 
Republic of Tanzania would benefit from the support of the international community in 
meeting its domestic and international obligations. 
</p>
<p>394. UNICEF welcomed the endorsement by the United Republic of Tanzania of 
recommendations to tackle violence against children, female genital mutilation and the 
killing of children with albinism. UNICEF called on the State to (a) prohibit violence 
against children in all settings, including corporal punishment; (b) improve conditions of 
detention, ensure separation of detained children from adults, and establish alternatives to 
pre- and post-detention; and (c) ensure equal access to quality education, including for 
children with disabilities, to tackle the phenomenon of school dropout and change 
discriminatory laws and practices, including those excluding pregnant girls from school. It 
urged the United Republic of Tanzania to fully implement the Law of the Child Act 
(Mainland), to bring into force the Children Act (Zanzibar), and to implement promptly the 
under-five birth registration strategy. 
</p>
<p>395. Angola saluted the progress made by the United Republic of Tanzania in the 
establishment of a Government of national unity in Zanzibar. It praised its nationality 
policy for African refugees and the fact that it was the first African country to elaborate and 
circulate a report on violence against children. It also praised its national policy in favour of 
disabled persons and the reform with regard to the freedom of the press. It stressed the 
efforts made to achieve the national objective to eliminate malaria by 2015 following the 
successful achievement of the Millennium Development Goal relating to universal primary 
education, five years ahead of the deadline. Angola welcomed the consultative process in 
the elaboration of the national report and the reform aimed at strengthening the normative 
institutional framework for human rights. It recommended that the report of the Working 
Group on the review of the United Republic of Tanzania be adopted. </p>


<p><b>192</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>396. Uganda noted that the United Republic of Tanzania had supported the vast majority 
of the recommendations made, and it applauded the Government&#8217;s commitment to the 
protection of all human rights, especially those concerned with the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights. The East African community had been engaged in regional efforts 
to implement recommendations, and looked forward to working with the country in the 
implementation of the outcomes agreed upon. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>397. The Tanzania Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance referred to its 
follow-up and monitoring activities with regard to the implementation of the universal 
periodic review recommendations accepted by the United Republic of Tanzania. The 
administration of justice and conditions in detention facilities still did not meet international 
and national standards. The United Republic of Tanzania still lagged behind in the rights of 
women, children and persons with disabilities, as well as in the fulfilment of economic, 
social and cultural rights. The killings of persons with albinism had abated; however, the 
killing of older women and mob violence, domestic violence and child abuse still 
continued. The settlement of land disputes and property rights required the Government&#8217;s 
special attention. The Commission appealed to the State to continue its efforts to reform the 
system accordingly. 
</p>
<p>398. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, the Tanzania Legal and Human 
Rights Centre, the Zanzibar Legal Services Centre and the East and Horn of Africa Human 
Rights Defenders Network highlighted two key areas of concern. The United Republic of 
Tanzania had not yet taken sufficient steps to address gender-based violence, as there were 
no legal provisions for the protection of victims. Moreover, existing laws did not provide 
for penalties on spouse battering or other forms of violence. The second area of concern 
was the use of excessive force and extrajudicial killings by the police and other law 
enforcement officials. The State had accepted the recommendation on establishing an 
independent body for investigating complaints about the actions of law enforcement 
officials, but questions had been raised about the timescale for the establishment of such a 
mechanism and its transparency to the public. 
</p>
<p>399. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the efforts 
made by the United Republic of Tanzania regarding the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goal on universal primary education, the adoption of the national plan for the 
prevention and elimination of violence against women, and the election of two persons with 
albinism to Parliament. It expressed its concern, however, at the increased violence and 
killing of persons with albinism in many regions. It invited the State to take adequate 
measures, such as awareness-raising campaigns, to improve the protection of persons with 
albinism and to take legislative measures to criminalize all forms of violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>400. Save the Children welcomed the efforts of the United Republic of Tanzania to 
protect children&#8217;s rights and the acceptance of the universal periodic review 
recommendations regarding child mortality, child hunger and malnutrition, quality of 
education and the implementation of the 2009 Child Rights Act. Save the Children believed 
that enforcement of the minimum age at marriage and protection from violence in the 
family were crucial for improved protection of women and children. It called on the 
Government to include these measures in the comprehensive national strategy to end 
violence against women and children. It also called on the Government to take steps to 
prohibit all forms of corporal punishment in all settings, and towards the eradication of the 
worst forms of child labour as part of a comprehensive framework for the elimination of all 
forms of child abuse and exploitation. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>193 
</b></p>
<p>401. Franciscans International was pleased that the United Republic of Tanzania had 
accepted the recommendations relating to the justice system; however, it was concerned 
that human trafficking might be overlooked owing to the small number of 
recommendations made thereon. It urged the State to acknowledge the legal existence of 
indigenous peoples on its territory, and to safeguard their rights through appropriate 
national legislation, including the recognition of their own customary land tenure system. 
Franciscans International called on the Government to significantly increase its annual 
education budget to build schools and to train more teachers. It expressed concern at reports 
of the corporal punishment of children, both in school and at home. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>402. The United Republic of Tanzania pointed out that recommendations would be 
translated into Kiswahili and disseminated to the public and within national institutions. It 
would continue to value both technical and financial support from development partners 
and the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p><b>  Libya 
</b></p>
<p>403. The review of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was held on 9 November 2010 in 
conformity with all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, 
and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBY/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBY/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBY/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBY/3). 
</p><p>404. At its 37th meeting, on 14 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Libya (see section C below). 
405. The outcome of the review of Libya comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/15), the views of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/16/15/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>406. The delegation expressed its satisfaction and delight at representing Libya in the 
adoption of the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. The 
delegation considered the report to be the product of exceptional circumstances. At the time 
of the review of the ninth session of the Working Group in November 2010, Libya was still 
under the yolk of injustice imposed by a repressive regime for more than four decades. 
</p><p>407. The delegation emphasized the important role of the universal periodic review for 
the Human Rights Council, which distinguished its work from that of the Commission. The 
universal periodic review mechanism did not differentiate and treated all States equally and 
provided an opportunity for civil society and other stakeholders to comment on the human 
rights situation in a country. </p>


<p><b>194</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>408. The delegation acknowledged the positive response of the Human Rights Council to 
the request to postpone the adoption of the report. 
</p>
<p>409. The delegation reaffirmed Libya&#8217;s intention to study the recommendations and to 
provide its response, although they had been addressed to others. A committee composed of 
all competent ministries was to be formed for this purpose. In keeping with transparency, 
civil society and the national council for fundamental freedoms and human rights were 
involved. The President, deputy and some other members of the Council were present at the 
current session, which demonstrated the will to move forward in defending human rights 
and to show the world that Libya had placed human rights among its top priorities. 
</p>
<p>410. The delegation emphasized that the committee had accepted almost all the 
recommendations. They had already been accomplished by the victory of the February 
revolution. Most of the recommendations were part of the objectives of the revolution. The 
revolution itself was a response to the report and the recommendations of the Working 
Group presented in November 2010. This was further proof of the exceptional nature of the 
revolution. Almost all recommendations had been accepted, except those in conflict with 
the Islamic religion and the customs, culture, specificities and principles of the Libyan 
people. 
</p>
<p>411. The delegation stressed that accession to the international human rights treaties to 
which Libya had not yet acceded was considered one of the State&#8217;s main concerns. While 
waiting for the election of the National Congress, a committee comprising relevant 
governmental bodies, civil society, the national council for fundamental freedoms and 
human rights and all other stakeholders would be formed to review those conventions and 
to make appropriate recommendations on accession for consideration by future legislative 
bodies. For example, concerning the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
a recommendation to accede to it would be submitted following the election of the 
legislative bodies. This would take into consideration the growing number of people who 
had lost limbs during the revolution and were among those with special needs. 
</p>
<p>412. With regard to women&#8217;s rights, Libya focused on empowering and engaging women 
in top positions. The presence of many women in the Transitional National Council and the 
transitional Government was indicative of this focus, as was the representation of women in 
the National Congress. Furthermore, many were present at the Council session, and female 
diplomats had been assigned to join the Mission in Geneva. 
</p><p>413. The delegation reiterated that the Government did not ignore the role of Libyan 
youth, which had sparked the revolution in peaceful crowds demanding the rights that the 
Human Rights Council itself called for. Youth had sacrificed their lives so that the Libyan 
people could live in freedom and enjoy human rights. The new Libyan State has 
empowered youth to be at the top of the political, economic and social pyramid. The 
presence of the head of delegation was evidence of the Government&#8217;s keenness to give 
effect to the role of youth. 
</p>
<p>414. The delegation recalled that the revolution was one for human rights. Protesters were 
not hungry for bread, and were not naked or barefoot, but were demanding rights and 
human dignity. The new Libyan State therefore encouraged and promoted freedoms in a 
country deprived of the most basic human rights. In the past, talking about human rights 
was considered a crime punishable by law. Association with a party was a crime in Libya &#8211; 
described as treason, and punishable by law. The establishment of unions and free 
associations was also prohibited. Today the door was open for all those rights and 
freedoms. Today, Libya enjoyed free and independent media censored only by their 
professional standards and conscience. There were no special or State security courts, 
which had killed thousands in the past. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>195 
</b></p>
<p>415. The delegation emphasized that Libya, through its membership of the Human Rights 
Council, would cooperate with the international community and the United Nations to 
promote human rights and respect for human dignity. Reference was made to the 
cooperation between Libya and the United Nations support mission, led by Ian Martin, 
which had human rights among its priorities. The mission included experts from OHCHR. 
Consideration was also being given about calling on their assistance in relation to the 
recommendations made by the international commission of inquiry on Libya. 
</p>
<p>416. Libya had issued a law on transitional justice, amnesty and national reconciliation, 
believing that national reconciliation would not be complete without justice. It renewed its 
call on neighbouring countries to cooperate in the extradition of alleged perpetrators, taking 
into account the arrest warrants issued by Interpol. 
</p>
<p>417. The above-mentioned cooperation would have a significant impact on the success of 
national reconciliation and social peace. The delegation called on the international 
community to release frozen assets to be used in the transition process and the reform of 
State institutions. 
</p>
<p>418. The delegation clarified its position on the pending recommendations that had been 
examined by Libya and enjoyed its support. Other recommendations did not enjoy the 
support of Libya as they were in conflict with the Islamic religion. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>419. Algeria noted that the new authorities in Libya had taken important steps in a short 
time and under difficult conditions, which demonstrated their commitment to human rights 
and cooperation with the international community. Algeria welcomed Libya&#8217;s return to the 
Human Rights Council and its positive interaction with the universal periodic review 
mechanism, Libya had accepted most recommendations made by the Working Group, 
including recommendations that had been previously rejected. It also appreciated the fact 
that Libya had accepted the recommendations made by Algeria. It expressed its 
understanding for Libya&#8217;s position on some recommendations relating to issues that were 
not of a universal nature. It wished Libya further success, progress and prosperity on its 
path, while preserving its sovereignty and national unity. 
</p>
<p>420. Morocco welcomed Libya&#8217;s positive interaction with the international human rights 
mechanisms, with due regard for the religious and cultural specificities of the Libyan 
people. It appreciated in particular Libya&#8217;s cooperation with the universal periodic review 
mechanism and its acceptance of recommendations that had been rejected by the former 
regime. This also demonstrated Libya&#8217;s political will in the area of human rights, which 
needed to be fully acknowledged by the Human Rights Council. Morocco commended the 
efforts made by the transitional Government to promote human rights at the legislative and 
institutional levels, such as the adoption of a law on transitional justice and the creation of a 
national human rights institution. In the light of these positive indications, Morocco urged 
the Council to continue to support Libya in this transitional period, on the path of freedom, 
justice and democracy. 
</p><p>421. Malaysia noted that, despite considerable constraints, Libya had accepted a number 
of recommendations, including on economic, social and cultural rights. It encouraged the 
Government to take the measures necessary to implement them effectively. Malaysia was 
encouraged by Libya&#8217;s preparedness to continue to engage constructively with relevant 
international human rights mechanisms, which would contribute to spreading the human 
rights culture and further improving the human rights situation in the country. Malaysia 
hoped that the Government would continue its commitment to democratic ideals and </p>


<p><b>196</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>implement fully the recommendations and outcome of the review for the benefit of its 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>422. The United States of America, while remaining concerned about ongoing human 
rights challenges, looked forward to continued cooperation with Libya during this sensitive 
transition time. It appreciated Libya&#8217;s support for the recommendations made, especially 
for investigating and holding to account security forces allegedly responsible for enforced 
disappearance, torture and ill-treatment. Action on those issues would demonstrate a 
positive break with the past. It reiterated that all persons detained without legal basis should 
be released immediately. It welcomed the attention given to combating discrimination and 
enhancing the political rights of all Libyans, especially women, and hoped that Libya would 
make additional efforts to fight gender-based discrimination. It was encouraged by the 
support for recommendations on guaranteeing non-discriminatory treatment of migrant 
workers and preventing human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>423. Kuwait highlighted the unique situation in which Libya found itself today, after the 
regime change between the universal periodic review in 2010 and the adoption today of the 
report. Kuwait noted that the people of Libya had been deprived of human rights education 
for the past 42 years. It welcomed the efforts made by the national transitional Government 
to promote and protect human rights and to achieve tangible results in this difficult period. 
Kuwait also appreciated the acceptance by Libya of recommendations that had been 
rejected by the former regime. 
</p><p>424. Italy welcomed the firm commitment of the transitional Government of Libya to 
establish the rule of law and uphold all human rights and fundamental freedoms according 
to the highest international standards, in cooperation with OHCHR. Italy appreciated the 
willingness of the Libyan authorities to accept universal periodic review recommendations 
rejected by the previous regime. Italy considered it vital that accountability for human 
rights violations be ensured and that protection of all components of Libyan society be 
guaranteed, in a spirit of reconciliation. Italy invited Libya to avail itself of the assistance of 
the High Commissioner and OHCHR to accelerate the process of change. Italy was ready to 
make its contribution. 
</p>
<p>425. Uruguay appreciated the efforts made by Libya to comply with the 
recommendations made in 2010, and highlighted its acceptance of recommendations that 
the former regime had rejected, including those relating to the accession to international 
human rights instruments to which Libya was not yet a party. Uruguay encouraged Libya to 
accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Rome Statute and 
the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, to withdraw reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, and to accept the individual complaints mechanisms 
created under different treaties. Uruguay was concerned that the new authorities had not yet 
committed to the abolition of the death penalty. It urged Libya to adhere to the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Uruguay also 
urged Libya to lift all restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly, and 
to extend an open invitation to the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>426. Egypt thanked Libya for its readiness to accept recommendations, including those 
refused by the previous regime, especially where they complied with Libya&#8217;s priorities. 
Egypt appreciated the measures being taken to implement accepted recommendations, and 
the assistance from the international community, particularly in establishing a national 
human rights institution with a mandate ensuring its independence and effectiveness. Egypt 
also thanked Libya for having accorded special attention to the rights of women, 
particularly those who were forcibly displaced, and for its constitutional declaration on 
equality between men and women. Egypt stood ready to assist Libya. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>197

<p>427. Monaco welcomed Libya&#8217;s return to the Human Rights Council. It encouraged 
Libya, in a period of transition after more than 40 years of dictatorship, to aim to achieve 
conformity with international human rights treaties. For this purpose, Libya should 
cooperate with the special procedures and the commission of inquiry on Libya in order to 
establish the truth of past events, and to promote and protect human rights. By complying 
with its international obligations, Libya would reinforce the positive trend that it had 
already initiated. Monaco appreciated the efforts already made towards achieving 
democracy. 
</p>
<p>428. Jordan thanked Libya for its response to the universal periodic review 
recommendations, which reflected the latest developments in Libya in the field of human 
rights. Jordan particularly noted Libya&#8217;s considerable efforts to develop the institutional 
and the legislative framework for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It thanked Libya 
for its cooperation and acceptance of the majority of recommendations, including those not 
accepted by the previous regime. Jordan invited Libya to further the advancement of the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>429. Tunisia welcomed Libya&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations, including ones 
that had been rejected by the previous regime. It also noted that the establishment of a 
national council for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the involvement of civil 
society in the universal periodic review follow-up process demonstrated Libya&#8217;s 
commitment to moving forward on the path of human rights, democracy and the rule of 
law. The constitutional declaration adopted on 3 August 2011 emphasized the necessity to 
adhere to international and regional human rights instruments. Tunisia also noted that Libya 
intended to extend an open invitation to the special procedures. Tunisia appealed to the 
international community to support Libya in its efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>430. OCAPROCE International commended the efforts made by the new authorities. It 
however deplored the fact that women, who had been at the forefront of action to overthrow 
the dictatorship, had not gained their place in the new Government and remained subjected 
to polygamy. While acknowledging the efforts made in education and health care, as well 
as in the area of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, it recommended that Libya should redouble 
its efforts to strengthen the autonomy of women, including with regard to their social, 
economic and cultural rights, and to respect their related obligations set out in the treaties to 
which Libya had acceded, as well as the recommendations made by the Human Rights 
Council and other United Nations entities. 
</p>
<p>431. United Nations Watch reiterated its concern about the 2010 report of the Working 
Group on Libya, recalling that a number of States had praised the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
for its efforts and achievements in the human rights area. United Nations Watch recalled 
that it had pleaded for Libya not to be elected on the Human Rights Council, and that no 
single country had spoken in opposition. It believed that the review in 2010 had not lived 
up to the standards that people expected and therefore ought to be repeated. 
</p>
<p>432. The Indian Council of South America noted the complex situation facing Libya, and 
that the process of rebuilding and reforming political structures would take time, patience 
and effort. It spoke of the necessity of balanced reconciliation and the rebuilding of political 
alliances and social structures, their right to development and the formation of a 
Government representative of the people, and not the desires of those who would like to 
exploit Libya&#8217;s situation. Only Libyans could sort this out. It spoke of the support the 
Human Rights Council, other peoples and civil society could offer in this difficult situation. 
It recommended that all tribal groups should be given due consideration in a Government 
structure that would allow for their participation in developing a Government that reflected 
the will of the people, including by providing a form of representation of tribal peoples. </p>

<p>433. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme suggested that the Libyan 
authorities accept all universal periodic review recommendations in order to put an end to 
four decades of autocratic governance and move towards a genuine process of democratic 
change, which was essential for national reconciliation and the consolidation of peace and 
security. Libya had to confront the security challenge. The organization remained alarmed 
at the situation of African migrant workers, who continued to endure ill-treatment, 
persecution and virulent racism. Measures had to be taken to put an end to such practices. It 
urged the authorities to cooperate with the International Criminal Court to try the supporters 
of the former Government who were in detention, as well as the rebel members of the 
National Transitional Council who had allegedly committed crimes and serious and 
massive human rights violations. The international community had to continue to assist 
Libya in completing its transition, which remained fragile. 
</p>
<p>434. The World Organization against Torture and Human Rights Solidarity, in a joint 
statement, welcomed Libya&#8217;s commitment to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and other international instruments. They welcomed the 
positive developments in the freedom of assembly and the press, and the abolition of 
special tribunals and extrajudicial courts. They regretted the State&#8217;s failure to address 
systematic acts of torture and that the Government had not yet investigated the massacre at 
the Abu Saleem prison. They expressed their deep concern at continued and rising tensions, 
resulting in displacement, including in Tawegha. They were gravely concerned at the 
continued perpetration of extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions, some of 
which amounted to war crimes. It was vital that acts that were previously sanctioned by the 
State be addressed by the new regime, and that it take all measures to implement the 
recommendations of the commission of inquiry and continue its commitments in addressing 
all violations, including those committed by non-State actors. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>435. The delegation of Libya extended its appreciation to all delegations who had made 
statements on the adoption of the report. With regard to those who had not been able, due to 
time limitations, to make their presentations, Libya would study all comments with interest, 
and assured the Human Rights Council that it would continue to cooperate with the 
universal periodic review mechanism.

<p><b>  Swaziland 
</b></p>
<p>436. The review of Swaziland was held on 4 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Swaziland in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SWZ/3). 
</p><p>437. At its 38th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Swaziland (see section C below). 
438. The outcome of the review of Swaziland comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/6), the views of Swaziland concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>199 
</b></p>
<p>sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>439. Swaziland provided an update of activities and progress made since its review by the 
Working Group, as well as its responses to recommendations on which it had not taken a 
position, and additional information to questions raised. 
</p>
<p>440. Swaziland stated that, in February 2012, a training workshop had been conducted on 
the treaty body reporting mechanism, specifically on the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. During the training, officers had obtained information and developed skills in 
relation to the role and function of the treaty monitoring bodies, on how to prepare effective 
reports, as well as understanding the reporting process and how to enhance opportunities 
for civil society and the Commission on Human Rights and Public Administration to 
engage with those bodies. Swaziland extended its sincere gratitude to OHCHR, which had 
sent a team of experts to the country to train officers. 
</p>
<p>441. The recommendations made by Member States during its review had been examined 
by the National Steering Committee on the Universal Periodic Review. Responses had been 
drafted and approved after consultation with all relevant stakeholders. The Government of 
Swaziland had made the National Steering Committee a permanent body that would be 
responsible for preparing State reports for the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>442. Swaziland underlined the fact that some 90 per cent of all recommendations made 
during its review had received a favourable response from the Government, and that its 
statement would focus mostly on those that it had promised to consider but that had not 
received its support. 
</p>
<p>443. With regard to the accession to the second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, capital 
punishment was not mandatory and the death penalty had last been carried out in 1983. In 
effect, though a retentionist State in law, Swaziland was abolitionist in practice. Swaziland 
was not yet ready to accede to the Optional Protocol, at least for the time being. In this 
regard, it considered the current practice of not implementing capital punishment to be 
adequate. 
</p>
<p>444. On the recommendation on torture and extrajudicial killings, Swaziland highlighted 
the fact that all deaths were investigated by law enforcement officers. Where there was 
sufficient evidence, criminal proceedings were instituted. It confirmed that torture was 
unlawful, hence the acceptance of the recommendation on acceding to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>445. With regard to the recommendations on considering allowing the registration and 
operation of political parties, including greater political freedoms through free, fair, 
transparent democratic elections; on removing all legislative and practical restrictions 
impeding the free exercise of civil and political rights, in particular those related to freedom 
of association and expression, with a view to allow the creation of political parties and 
respect for trade unions; on enacting legislative measures to facilitate the existence of 
political parties; and on taking steps to further democratization efforts, including enacting 
laws that facilitate the registration of political parties, Swaziland recalled the intervention 
made by its delegation during the review, in which it clarified that political parties were not 
banned. Section 25, read together with section 32 of the Constitution, protected the right to 
freedom of association, including the rights of trade unions. By virtue of section 79 of the </p>


<p><b>200</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>Constitution, however, election to public office was by individual merit, and therefore 
political parties could not field candidates in national elections. The Constitution was a 
product of wide consultations and hence reflected the views of the majority of Swazis. For 
these reasons, Swaziland was not yet ready to accept the recommendations relating to 
political parties to contest elections. 
</p>
<p>446. With regard to the recommendations on issuing a standing invitation to special 
procedures and working groups of the United Nations human rights system, issuing a 
standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and enhancing 
its cooperation with all human rights bodies, considering positively the request for a visit by 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, and eventually extending a standing invitation to all special procedures of 
the Council, Swaziland was of the view that its human rights institutions and mechanisms 
were still in their infancy and were not yet ready for review. Swaziland preferred the 
strengthening of local institutions and structures. 
</p>
<p>447. Regarding the recommendations on the implementation of measures to prevent 
violence against the LGBT community, through training and advocacy campaigns, on 
bringing legislation into line with international human rights obligations by repealing 
provisions that might be used to criminalize same-sex activity between consenting adults, 
and on taking all necessary measures to ensure enjoyment of the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or 
gender identity, Swaziland did not accept the decriminalization of same-sex activity. It 
confirmed, however, that it did not prosecute consensual same-sex relations between 
consenting adults. Furthermore, the Government was taking steps to progressively realize 
the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation or gender identity. 
</p>
<p>448. Lastly, Swaziland reported on the Government&#8217;s consultations with relevant 
stakeholders in order to map out a way forward in the implementation of all 
recommendations that enjoyed the State&#8217;s support. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>449. Cuba recognized the efforts of the Government in the area of human rights. In recent 
years, Swaziland had faced several economic challenges, leading to higher poverty levels. 
Cuba welcomed the fact that the Government had the eradication of poverty as its main 
priority. It also highlighted the improvements made in the areas of health and education. 
Cuba commended the fact that Swaziland had accepted most of the recommendations, 
including those made by Cuba. 
</p>
<p>450. Algeria commended Swaziland for accepting a large number of recommendations, 
including the three submitted by the delegation of Algeria relating to training programmes 
for the personnel responsible for law enforcement and the implementation of the right to 
education for all. Algeria encouraged Swaziland to continue, with the assistance of the 
international community, to implement its plans and programmes aiming at enhancing 
human rights, particularly in the fields of the right to food, access to education, health and 
drinking water, as well as in the protection of vulnerable populations. 
</p>
<p>451. Morocco commended Swaziland for its national report, which was one of the most 
balanced universal periodic review reports, given that the section on constraints 
demonstrated the real challenges that the country faced. With regard to the 
recommendations, Morocco congratulated Swaziland on having accepted 90 per cent of 
them. Morocco also welcomed the fact that the recommendations accepted by Swaziland 
included two recommendations made by Morocco, inviting it to assess, in terms of the fight </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>201 
</b></p>
<p>against HIV/AIDS and malaria, its assistance needs, and to request such assistance, in 
particular from WHO, and to consider establishing an integrated human development 
programme. 
</p>
<p>452. South Africa commended Swaziland for accepting more than 90 per cent of the 
recommendations made during its review. It noted the progress made in education, 
especially in the provision of free primary education. It welcomed the work undertaken to 
combat the effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which had had a negative impact on the 
socioeconomic development of the country. The Government had identified clearly the 
challenges that impeded the effective promotion and protection of human rights in the 
country; South Africa therefore called on the international community to support these 
efforts. 
</p>
<p>453. Chad congratulated the delegation and thanked it for its clear statement. It was 
particularly touched that Swaziland had accepted the recommendation it had made during 
the session of the Working Group in October 2011, namely, that Swaziland request the 
international community to provide technical and financial assistance to meet its human 
rights needs. 
</p>
<p>454. Botswana commended Swaziland for its bold measures in the area of human rights, 
such as the establishment of an independent national commission on human rights. It 
commended the Government for having accepted most of the recommendations received, 
including on strengthening existing institutions to protect democracy. Botswana lauded the 
commitment made by the Government to broad consultations with stakeholders for the 
follow-up to these voluntary obligations. It acknowledged the explanation made by the 
delegation regarding the recommendations Swaziland had not accepted and the fact that this 
did not lessen the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>455. Angola welcomed the establishment of an independent human rights commission to 
investigate complaints of human rights violations and complaints concerning human rights 
brought against private and public bodies. Angola noted Swaziland&#8217;s achievements in 
education, health, food security and the promotion of women&#8217;s rights. Angola welcomed 
the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure access to free primary education and the right of access 
to free health services, food security, the national child policy and the national policy for 
gender equality; all this reflected the considerable progress made in increasing the number 
of women employed in the public sector despite the many economic problems that the 
country faced because of its small size and economic vulnerability to external shocks. 
Angola also welcomed the measures taken by Swaziland to deal with the problems noted in 
its national report, including the plans and programmes of action emphasizing such 
constitutional rights as the rights to life and to education, and the efforts to protect 
vulnerable groups and combat poverty and HIV/AIDS. Angola appealed to the international 
community to provide Swaziland with sustained support. 
</p>
<p>456. Kenya welcomed the concrete initiatives the Government had taken to promote 
human rights in many areas. It acknowledged the commitment to food security, poverty 
reduction and accessibility to health and education, among others. It noted that the eventual 
fulfilment of these commitments would not only be an achievement in the promotion of 
human rights but also the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>457. The International Commission of Jurists referred to Swaziland&#8217;s judicial crisis, 
which had exposed a serious risk to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. It 
recalled that, in June 2011, the Chief Justice had issued a practice directive banning 
litigants from suing the King, thereby restricting access to justice for the Swazi people. 
Furthermore, in August 2011, a High Court judge well known for applying international </p>


<p><b>202</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>human rights law and rule of law principles was suspended and, thereafter, dismissed. 
These events went against Swaziland&#8217;s undertakings under the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>458. Amnesty International referred to the accepted recommendations on ratifying the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, and added that torture and the ill-
treatment of detainees were persistent, with perpetrators not being held accountable. It also 
cited the accepted recommendations on measures to guarantee the independence of the 
judiciary, stating that such measures were urgently needed. Amnesty International also 
referred to the accepted recommendations requesting Swaziland to bring its legislation into 
line with its international obligations with regard to the freedoms of expression, association 
and peaceful assembly. This intent had been undermined by Swaziland&#8217;s rejection of the 
recommendations on removing restrictions to the exercise of civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>459. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme acknowledged the new 
Constitution promulgated in 2005 and the measures taken in favour of a human rights legal 
framework. It noted, however, the scarcity of democratic space and the proscription of a 
multiparty system. It welcomed the establishment of free primary education and 
encouraged the Government to enlarge this entitlement. It also recognized the 
Government&#8217;s efforts in the area of health. It noted the need to enhance the independence of 
the activities of civil society organizations. It called for the adoption of measures to 
eliminate violence against women and albinos. Lastly, it requested a debate to ensure the 
complete abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>460. In the view of the World Student Christian Federation, there was no political will in 
Swaziland to implement human rights. It mentioned, as examples, the absence of legislation 
to regulate the operation of political parties, the proscription of certain political entities 
under the Suppression of Terrorism Act and the prevention and disruption of political 
activities. It also referred to restrictions on freedom of expression through legislation and 
State intimidation. With regard to women&#8217;s rights, discrimination and violations continued 
to be widespread in law and in practice, with impunity. It urged Swaziland to domesticate 
international human rights instruments to which it was a party, and to submit all 
outstanding State party reports. 
</p>
<p>461. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC 
Nederland and Action Canada for Population and Development, in a joint statement, 
referred to the sustained sexual and reproductive rights violations of the people of 
Swaziland by its Government. Swaziland had failed to address gender-based violence 
effectively. Violence against women was extremely common. Swaziland had no form of 
legal protection on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. It requested the 
Government to specify the measures it would take to address the issue of the human rights 
of women and LGBTI persons in Swaziland, in keeping with its international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>462. Swaziland expressed its appreciation to the many delegations that had encouraged it 
on the noble cause of continuously improving its human rights situation. The universal 
periodic review mechanism was a journey rather than a destination, and therefore some 
issues would be covered by future reviews after broad consultations with all relevant 
stakeholders. Swaziland remained committed to the fulfilment of its human rights 
obligations and would spare no effort to pursue compliance in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Trinidad and Tobago 
</b></p>
<p>463. The review of Trinidad and Tobago was held on 5 October 2011 in conformity with 
all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>203 
</b></p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Trinidad and Tobago, in accordance with 
the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/3). 
At its 38th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review of Trinidad and Tobago (see section C below). 
</p><p>464. The outcome of the review of Trinidad and Tobago comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/7), the views of Trinidad 
and Tobago concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/7/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>465. Trinidad and Tobago stated that the universal periodic review process had been a 
beneficial one and expressed its appreciation to the troika (Peru, the Philippines and the 
United States of America), delegations that made recommendations, representatives of civil 
society, who made valuable contributions, OHCHR and the Commonwealth secretariat.  
</p>
<p>466. Trinidad and Tobago expressed its commitment to the protection of human rights of 
its people, a cornerstone of its plans for development. At the twelfth session of the Working 
Group, it had received 118 recommendations; 15 had been accepted outright, while 33 were 
at various stages of implementation. Some 18 recommendations did not comply with its 
views or policies. 
</p>
<p>467. Of the remaining 52 recommendations, Trinidad and Tobago provided a detailed 
written response to each issue, indicating the Government&#8217;s position. These 
recommendations were thematic in nature and centred on specific human rights issues that 
most developing States were currently addressing. 
</p>
<p>468. The first and most prominent theme identified was the signing, ratification or 
implementation of international human rights treaties that did not currently enjoy the 
support of Trinidad and Tobago. This was a serious issue that continued to engage the 
Government&#8217;s attention. Its position on the retention of capital punishment had been clearly 
stated and, as such, it would be inherently counterproductive to sign or ratify any 
instruments in conflict with this position. This in no way implied that the Government took 
such issues as torture or other cruel or degrading treatment lightly. 
</p>
<p>469. Trinidad and Tobago pointed out that, during its universal periodic review, its view 
on capital punishment had been expressed. While recognizing the international movement 
towards abolition, Trinidad and Tobago had to take into consideration the outcome of 
widespread public consultations and debate and moreover, have the full support of 
Parliament in any reform on death penalty laws. It was continuously engaging the public on 
this issue, with the intention of reviewing its laws on capital punishment. Its approach 
would be to preserve the death penalty in the most humane way possible and to ensure that 
all safeguards were in place, be it in a domestic or an international context. Such a process 
would also involve the amendment of existing national legislation. However, any definitive 
outcome on the issue of capital punishment would be guided by public consultations and 
the consensus of Parliament. </p>


<p><b>204</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>470. In Trinidad and Tobago, corporal punishment was currently maintained as part of 
the Penal Code, but was strictly forbidden in schools by a national code of conduct. While 
it was a long accepted practice used to discipline children, like many other aspects of 
Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s societal development this too was subject to change. In an effort to 
foster new thinking, it pointed out that the current administration had created the Ministry 
of Gender, Youth and Child Development, headed by a female senator who was a former 
social rights activist. 
</p>
<p>471. Trinidad and Tobago identified education as a key factor in the necessary paradigm 
shift in relation to corporal punishment. As highlighted in its universal periodic review 
report, the current administration had committed a great deal of resources to improving the 
accessibility of educational opportunities to the population, clearly demonstrated in the 
number of early childhood education centres being built, the school food initiative, the 
transportation facilities offered to students and the provision of school uniforms, as well as 
a book rental programme and its laptop initiative. 
</p>
<p>472. There had also been a legislative move to increase the mandatory age of school 
attendance from 12 to 16 years of age in the children&#8217;s bill currently being debated in 
Parliament. It observed that, on 9 March 2012, the Minister for Gender, Youth and Child 
Development had moved the second reading of the bill, which adjourned at 11.35 p.m. This 
underscored the Government&#8217;s commitment to the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>473. Trinidad and Tobago recognized that the thinking behind capital punishment and 
corporal punishment could not change overnight with the passing of a new law. It asked 
international partners to recognize that dialogue on these issues was ongoing and was the 
most powerful mechanism to change attitudes in the country. 
</p>
<p>474. Trinidad and Tobago had also received recommendations relating to the 
strengthening of national organizations to monitor the use of force by protective services, 
and these it had agreed to examine. As stated in its national report, the Police Complaints 
Authority was an independent body, operating free of political interference and headed by a 
former High Court judge. It was the main agency mandated to investigate and prosecute 
any instances of excessive use of force or corruption in relation to protective services. 
</p>
<p>475. Trinidad and Tobago had implemented other national security initiatives designed to 
address the issues concerning infractions of the law by protective services. The &#8220;Policing 
for the People&#8221; programme had been introduced to offer training with a view to improving 
modern-day policing. In November 2011, Trinidad and Tobago had also hosted the Third 
Regional Meeting of Ministers responsible for Public Security in the Americas. One of the 
key outcomes of the meeting had been technical capacity-building in the area of human 
rights and policing. 
</p>
<p>476. Trinidad and Tobago expressed its high regard for the work of the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council and for invitations to mandate holders in order to 
benefit from their technical expertise. This matter had engaged the active consideration of 
the current administration. 
</p>
<p>477. Trinidad and Tobago had also undertaken to examine very crucial issues concerning 
the discrimination of persons based on sexual orientation and/or HIV/AIDS status. 
Discrimination itself was not taken lightly in Trinidad and Tobago, and sexual orientation 
was a current and developing issue in the country. The attitudes of the people needed to 
change in order to address these issues adequately. 
</p>
<p>478. Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s domestic legislation dealing with discrimination was being 
amended to include a person&#8217;s HIV/AIDS status as one of the recognized categories under 
which a person was protected from discrimination. This legislative recognition was not only 
necessary but also a first in the region. This &#8220;maverick&#8221; attitude towards the protection of </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>205 
</b></p>
<p>human rights of all would propel national debate and eventual change in Trinidad and 
Tobago with regard to such issues as sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>479. Trinidad and Tobago was extremely proud of the progress made in relation to the 
protection and promotion of human rights for all, with emphasis on vulnerable groups. It 
recognized that, like many other developing States, there were many challenges ahead, and 
it was ready and willing to face them with the necessary enthusiasm. The universal periodic 
review process had served as a vital tool in the development of the jurisprudence of human 
rights protection; it was grateful for the kind support and encouragement received from the 
international community. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>480. Cuba welcomed the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago and thanked it for the 
information provided. It noted that, during the review, Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s efforts in the 
field of human rights had been evident, as well as its challenges and progress in health and 
education. It highlighted the fact that Trinidad and Tobago had achieved universal primary 
and secondary education, the second Millennium Development Goal, and target 3 of the 
third Millennium Development Goal, on eliminating sex disparities in education. On health, 
it welcomed the efforts to finance medication, as well as free oncological and antiretroviral 
treatment. Cuba also noted the progress made in female empowerment. It thanked Trinidad 
and Tobago for having accepted many recommendations, including those made by Cuba. 
</p>
<p>481. Algeria commended Trinidad and Tobago for the clarifications provided on recent 
developments and the clarity of replies provided. Trinidad and Tobago had received 118 
recommendations, a large number for a developing country with limited resources. Algeria 
expressed appreciation for the fact that two of the recommendations it had made had 
received the support of Trinidad and Tobago and were currently being implemented. 
Regarding its third recommendation, on the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with international standards, it welcomed the fact the ombudsman 
was considering the implementation of the Paris Principles. Algeria encouraged Trinidad 
and Tobago to continue its efforts to strengthen social and development efforts. 
</p>
<p>482. Morocco thanked Trinidad and Tobago for the openness with which it had engaged 
in the universal periodic review process, as seen in the frank and constructive dialogue that 
had been held with the Working Group. It noted with satisfaction that an important number 
of the recommendations had been accepted by the State. Morocco was grateful to Trinidad 
and Tobago for its acceptance of many recommendations, including those made by 
Morocco. It reiterated its support for Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s efforts in favour of 
development. 
</p>
<p>483. The United States of America congratulated Trinidad and Tobago on the adoption of 
its report, as well as on its outstanding presentation and the detailed quality of its 
addendum. It seemed clear from the addendum that recommendations 1 to 23 did not enjoy 
the support of Trinidad and Tobago. It asked whether any of the recommendations 
addressed in the addendum enjoyed the support of Trinidad and Tobago, or whether these 
should, for the record, be noted. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>484. Amnesty International welcomed Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s support for the 
recommendations on combating violence against women and girls. It encouraged the 
Government to finalize the draft policy on gender and development, and to enact the human 
trafficking bill of 2011. It regretted the fact that Trinidad and Tobago had rejected 
recommendations regarding the death penalty, and urged it to establish a moratorium on </p>


<p><b>206</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>executions, to commute all death sentences to prison sentences and to abolish the death 
penalty. While welcoming the support for recommendations on the promotion and 
protection of the rights of LGBT persons, it noted the existence of legislation criminalizing 
consensual same-sex relationships, and urged Trinidad and Tobago to repeal it. 
</p>
<p>485. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme took note of Trinidad and 
Tobago&#8217;s commitment to promote human rights, and stated that the country should pursue 
its social economic programmes in order to attain the Millennium Development Goals. It 
expressed its concern that the death penalty still existed in the country, and urged Trinidad 
and Tobago to, in particular, abolish its mandatory application in certain cases. It 
encouraged the Government to increase the number of women in decision-making 
positions. Noting that progress could be achieved in the elimination of violence against 
women, the organization recommended the establishment of a programme for the 
rehabilitation of victims. 
</p>
<p>486. Action Canada for Population and Development and Federatie van Nederlandse 
Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualit &#8211; COC Nederland congratulated the 
Government on having distinguished itself among its Caribbean peers in embracing issues 
of sexual rights and sexual orientation during its universal periodic review. They noted the 
recent initiatives, such as the steps taken to address the marriage of minors and the 
Government&#8217;s explicit recognition that human rights of all citizens included the LGBT 
community. They appealed to Trinidad and Tobago to: commence forthwith its nationwide 
human rights awareness-raising campaign, announced in October 2011, and to move swiftly 
to establish a functioning human rights institution. They also asked the Government to 
amend the Equal Opportunity Act of 2000 to include protection against discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>487. Trinidad and Tobago stated that all pending 52 recommendations had been noted. 
</p>
<p>488. Trinidad and Tobago reiterated its appreciation for the active and constructive 
exchange with its fellow States Members of the United Nations and non-governmental 
organizations throughout the universal periodic review process, including the interventions 
by Cuba, Algeria, Morocco and the United States of America, as well as its continuing 
dialogue with non-governmental organizations during the consideration of its report. 
</p>
<p>489. In particular, Trinidad and Tobago thanked Action Canada for Population and 
Development and COC Nederland for their joint statement on behalf of the Coalition 
Advocating for Inclusion of Sexual Orientation and the Family Planning Association of 
Trinidad and Tobago. It assured them that their request regarding the Equal Opportunity 
Act of 2000 would be conveyed to the Government, which prided itself on dialogue and 
transparency in the amendment of all legislation. 
</p>
<p>490. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago had been elected in 2010 to implement 
change, but stated that change could only be implemented through consultation with the 
people. It remained committed to its continued engagement with all stakeholders to ensure 
the promotion and protection of human rights of each citizen of Trinidad and Tobago.

<p><b>  Thailand 
</b></p>
<p>491. The review of Thailand was held on 5 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>207 
</b></p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Thailand in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/1/Corr.1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/3). 
</p><p>492. At its 38th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Thailand (see section C below). 
493. The outcome of the review of Thailand comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/8), the views of Thailand concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/8/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>494. The delegation of Thailand stated that, during its review, 172 recommendations were 
received, 100 of which were immediately accepted and none rejected. 
</p><p>495. Thailand had subsequently organized consultations to consider the pending 
recommendations. While sharing the concerns expressed on some issues, it believed that 
time should be allowed to work on those issues within the national context. 
</p>
<p>496. Thailand was able to accept wholly or in part 34 of the 72 recommendations made, 
bringing the total to 134 recommendations, with implementation of each accepted 
recommendation being of the utmost importance. 
</p>
<p>497. In February, the Cabinet of Thailand had endorsed a decision to amend the mandate 
of the national universal periodic review committee to include monitoring and follow-up on 
review recommendations. All relevant agencies had been tasked with the preparation of 
plans of action to implement the recommendations and voluntary pledges. 
</p>
<p>498. Thailand placed great importance on the participation of all stakeholders in the 
universal periodic review process, and various sectors had shown interest in it. Senior 
Government officials had met with parliamentary committees to discuss the 
recommendations. The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand had organized 
briefings for its subcommittees and the general public. Although difficult questions had 
been raised, the interaction with all stakeholders had helped to generate awareness about 
human rights at the national level. 
</p>
<p>499. Thailand believed that the implementation of the recommendations required the 
widest participation of all stakeholders. A nationwide consultation process had been 
embarked upon in March 2012. Further consultations would be carried out in all regions of 
Thailand. 
</p>
<p>500. Thailand had begun to implement some of the recommendations and voluntary 
pledges. In January 2012, Thailand signed the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and was reviewing its legislation. It had begun 
to consider the possibility of becoming a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
and was determined to complete this process as soon as possible. </p>


<p><b>208</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>501. The decision had been made to withdraw Thailand&#8217;s reservation to article 16 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its 
interpretative declarations on articles 6 and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Thailand was also considering withdrawing its interpretative declaration on 
article 18 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>502. As part of its pledges on a standing invitation to special procedures, Thailand was 
initially inviting three mandate holders to visit the country: the Special Rapporteur on the 
human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>503. Regarding recommendations on vulnerable groups, the Senate had approved a draft 
nationality bill, which would provide a channel for additional groups with status problems 
to obtain Thai nationality. 
</p>
<p>504. In February 2012, the Government of Thailand had issued an announcement 
describing the work that foreign victims of human trafficking could take up in Thailand 
pending their return. It hoped that this would empower the victims, enhance their 
independence and better prepare them for eventual return. 
</p>
<p>505. Various countries had recommended that Thailand should pursue efforts in national 
reconciliation. Thailand was moving in that direction. The Cabinet had approved a 
compensation package for those affected by past political violence. Investigations and legal 
proceedings were ongoing to bring perpetrators to account and to provide justice for all. 
</p><p>506. A compensation package for those affected by violence in the southern border 
provinces had been approved and was awaiting the Cabinet&#8217;s approval. Thailand 
recognized that providing such remedies must be coupled with efforts to address the root 
causes of the problem. 
</p>
<p>507. Thailand admitted that challenges still existed in various areas, and that they needed 
to be tackled effectively. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>508. Cuba noted positively that Thailand had accepted Cuba&#8217;s recommendations on 
implementing socioeconomic development plans, reducing poverty and prioritizing access 
to health care and education. Cuba acknowledged Thailand&#8217;s progress in reducing poverty 
and the realization of the first Millennium Development Goal. It also noted the progress 
made in increasing literacy and ensuring free medical coverage, as well as the priority 
attention paid to the treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS. Cuba expressed its confidence 
that Thailand would continue its progress in ensuring the socioeconomic rights of all. 
</p>
<p>509. Viet Nam commended Thailand for its efforts to implement the recommendations 
accepted and for examining and accepting additional recommendations after the review. It 
particularly appreciated Thailand&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendations, namely, to continue 
reconciliation among different sectors of society on the basis of principles of democracy, 
rule of law and tolerance; and to enhance the implementation of laws, policies and 
mechanisms related to human rights. Viet Nam encouraged Thailand to continue to do so in 
close cooperation with relevant United Nations mechanisms and all Member States. 
</p>
<p>510. China appreciated Thailand&#8217;s accession to the main international human rights 
treaties and its second national human rights plan of action for the period 2009&#8211;2013. China 
welcomed its efforts to promote economic and social development, and the attention given 
to health care and education, as well as the measures taken to protect the rights of children, 
women, the elderly and migrant workers, and to combat human trafficking. China noted 
that some challenges remained in the human rights area, but was confident that the joint </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>209 
</b></p>
<p>efforts by the Government and the people of Thailand would lead to further progress in 
social and economic development, as well as in the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>511. Algeria acknowledged Thailand&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review. It also noted with satisfaction 
that Thailand had accepted two of its recommendations relating to the protection of women 
and addressing violence against them, and to ensure adequate living standards for all. 
Algeria would have wished to see its recommendation on the ratification of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families accepted by Thailand. Noting Thailand&#8217;s adherence to 
democratic values, Algeria encouraged it to move forward on the path of national 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>512. Indonesia noted Thailand&#8217;s consistent and genuine commitment to human rights at 
the national, international and regional levels, which was reflected in its acceptance of 
many recommendations and of their implementation. It commended Thailand for its efforts 
to address equality and social justice, which would enable it to ensure continuous stability 
in the country. Indonesia, as a country of origin of migrants, appreciated the acceptance of 
its recommendations relating to the strengthening of law enforcement to protect migrant 
workers, to guarantee minimum wage and work safety, and to ensure equal access to health. 
Indonesia welcomed the efforts of Thailand to raise the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility and the separation of juveniles from adults in detention. 
</p><p>513. Myanmar recognized Thailand&#8217;s constructive approach to the universal periodic 
review process, noting that most of the recommendations made, including one by 
Myanmar, had been accepted. Myanmar was confident that Thailand would continue to 
strengthen its legal and administrative measures for the protection and promotion of all 
human rights, including the rights of migrant workers and their families. 
</p>
<p>514. Malaysia noted with appreciation Thailand&#8217;s constructive engagement in the 
universal periodic review process. It noted that Thailand had already started to implement a 
number of the recommendations accepted, but needed time to make further improvements 
in promoting and protecting human rights on the ground. 
</p>
<p>515. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic was pleased to note that Thailand had 
accepted many recommendations made during the session of the Working Group, and was 
taking steps for their implementation. It also noted the considerable progress and efforts 
made by the Government in improving mechanisms for the protection and promotion of 
human rights, providing social security for all groups, and moving forward in the 
reconciliation process on the basis of democratic principles, justice and the rule of law. It 
noted with appreciation that, as a party to most international human rights instruments, 
Thailand had made efforts to withdraw its reservations. It appreciated Thailand&#8217;s active 
cooperation with the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>516. Brunei Darussalam noted with appreciation Thailand&#8217;s cooperation with the human 
rights mechanisms of the United Nations and its constructive approach to the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review. It welcomed Thailand&#8217;s 
continuous efforts to protect the rights of its people, particularly those of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>517. Cambodia noted the commitment demonstrated by Thailand by accepting most 
recommendations. It took note with appreciation of the efforts and achievements made in 
the area of human rights, particularly over the past seven months, since the new 
Government took office, noticeably in the field of economic and social development. 
Cambodia also appreciated the advancement of the democratic process and the attainment 
of sustained political stability, as well as the progress seen in providing universal health 
care and free and equal educational opportunities for all, in addition to the attention given </p>


<p><b>210</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>to the rights of the elderly and disabled. Cambodia welcomed Thailand&#8217;s decision to extend 
cooperation to the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>518. Singapore welcomed the constructive approach demonstrated by Thailand 
throughout the universal periodic review process and its acceptance of a large number of 
recommendations, including two made by Singapore. It expressed its readiness to continue 
to cooperate with Thailand in strengthening the promotion of human rights in the region, 
including through the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>519. The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
acceptance of many recommendations and hoped to see the Government implement them 
with renewed commitment and vigour. It emphasized that the Government should 
strengthen the rule of law as a necessary framework for human rights protection, especially 
in the southern border provinces, where a large number of people were affected by violent 
incidents. Special protection should be provided to vulnerable groups. Regarding the 38 
recommendations not accepted by Thailand, the Commission proposed that there be a more 
positive response from the Government on recommendations relating to the death penalty, 
freedom of expression, the rights of refugees and asylum seekers and the ratification of the 
Rome Statute. It noted that abolishing the death penalty was a controversial but desirable 
step, and that the Government should at least limit its use to the most serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>520. The Association for the Prevention of Torture urged Thailand to ensure that the 
amendments to its laws were fully in line with the Convention against Torture, not only in 
criminalizing torture but also in taking measures to prevent and investigate torture and other 
ill-treatment, and to provide redress to victims. It welcomed Thailand&#8217;s commitment to 
studying the possibility of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, and hoped that Thailand would engage in a process of open and public consultation 
on its ratification and implementation. The Association commended Thailand for issuing a 
standing invitation and on its stated intentions to send an invitation to the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and to become a party to the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>521. Human Rights Watch regretted the fact that Thailand had rejected all 
recommendations calling for the review of the <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i> law to safeguard freedom of 
expression. It appreciated the fact that Thailand had accepted recommendations to 
investigate killings by security forces, recalling that at least 90 people had died during the 
violent confrontations from March to May 2010. According to Human Rights Watch, some 
actions by the Government appeared one sided, for instance ignoring the violence 
committed by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). Regarding the 
conflict in the southern border provinces, it noted that the Government had accepted 
recommendations to address impunity. Progress needed to be made with regard to enforced 
disappearances and torture. It referred to the failure to conduct an inquiry on the 2003 &#8220;war 
on drugs&#8221;, and was concerned about targets set to rehabilitate 400,000 drug users in 2012. 
Procedures concerning refugees and asylum seekers and the protection of migrants needed 
to be improved. 
</p>
<p>522. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development regretted the fact that, despite 
the Government&#8217;s pledges to reform the mandate of the truth and reconciliation commission 
of Thailand, truth-seeking had been entirely overlooked and the process of prosecuting 
alleged perpetrators significantly delayed. The Forum expressed its concern that cases of 
<i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i> continued to proliferate, with undue restrictions on the right to bail. While 
welcoming the issued standing invitation, the Forum pointed to the urgent need for a visit 
of the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression to assist the 
Government. It expressed concern about the prolonged use of special security laws in the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>211 
</b></p>
<p>southern border provinces, which contributed to the culture of impunity. It called for the 
presentation of a precise plan of action to lift such laws and to repeal section 17 of the 
Emergency Decree. 
</p>
<p>523. The Asian Legal Resource Centre welcomed the Government&#8217;s recent signing of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
but noted that this could be seen only as a first step towards addressing disappearances and 
witness protection. It noted the growing threats to political freedom. A number of long 
prison sentences had been abusively imposed for <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i> under article 112 of the 
Criminal Code and under the 2007 Computer Crime Act. Academics and human rights 
defenders calling for the revision of article 112 had been threatened in recent months. The 
Centre called on the Government to end such threats and the abusive use of <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i>, 
and to allow a country visit by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression. It also 
noted with concern that the universal periodic review process had not addressed the 
increasingly grave rights violations connected to development projects, as well as the 
grabbing of land and natural resources. It also expressed concern at reported threats and 
attacks, including abusive legal attacks and extrajudicial killings, against human rights 
defenders working on environmental issues. 
</p>
<p>524. In a joint statement, Istituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice delle Salesiane di Don 
Bosco, the International Volunteerism Organization for Women, Education and 
Development, Mouvement international d&#8217;apostolat des milieux sociaux ind&#233;pendants, the 
International Organization for the Right to Education and Freedom of Education, 
Association Points-Coeur and the Company of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de 
Paul expressed their concern about the direct and indirect discrimination against children 
belonging to ethnic minorities and children with disabilities. They were also concerned 
about the difficulty of ensuring birth registration of the most vulnerable children in the 
north and north-east. Children with disabilities in remote villages encountered serious 
barriers to the full enjoyment of their rights. They noted a number of problems in access to 
education, such as the persistence of tuition fees, inadequately qualified teachers in rural 
and indigenous schools, and that the bilingual education system was not fully effective. 
</p>
<p>525. Action Canada for Population and Development welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
acknowledgement of the human rights of sex workers to health-care information and 
services. It hoped that the Government would develop concrete plans and strategies to 
address the stigma and discrimination of sex workers, as well as of effective and rights-
based strategies to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care. While 
acknowledging the Government&#8217;s efforts to provide universal health care to vulnerable 
groups, it remained concerned that migrants with irregular status had no access to health-
care information and services. It urged the Government to consult and collaborate with 
local rights-based non-governmental organizations working with people experiencing 
stigma, discrimination and marginalization. 
</p>
<p>526. The International Commission of Jurists welcomed the commitments made by 
Thailand to address the issue of impunity. While victims might seek compensation from the 
Government for any wrongful act committed by its agents, this was just one element in 
combating impunity. Thailand must make a clear and public commitment to ensure that 
perpetrators of human rights violations were brought to trial and duly punished. The 
Commission urged Thailand to respond positively to recommendations relating to repealing 
section 17 of the Emergency Decree and abolishing provisions of the martial law that grant 
immunity from criminal and civil prosecution to State officials, and to ratify the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
promptly. 
</p>
<p>527. The International Federation for Human Rights regretted the fact that Thailand had 
not accepted key recommendations related to core human rights concerns, which </p>


<p><b>212</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>undermined its compliance with international human rights law, including the restriction of 
freedom of expression through the use of the <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i> law and the Computer Crimes 
Act, as well as the draconian special security laws. It regretted Thailand&#8217;s rejection of 
recommendations on the abolition of the death penalty, despite the reference of the second 
national human rights plan of action to parliamentary debate of capital crimes and the 
replacement of the death penalty with life imprisonment. Thailand should devote adequate 
resources to the planned study on the possibility of abolition, which should benefit from 
broad consultations. It urged Thailand to set target dates for the conclusion of its 
consideration of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, and the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the Protocol thereto. 
</p>
<p>528. Amnesty International expressed its disappointment that Thailand had rejected the 
recommendations to abolish the death penalty and had resumed executions in 2009 after a 
hiatus of six years. It was concerned that all death row prisoners continued to be shackled, 
despite a court decision in 2009 declaring the practice illegal, and that over half of all death 
sentences were passed for drug-related offences, in contravention of international law. 
Amnesty International stated that Muslim insurgents had committed acts constituting war 
crimes, while security forces had used torture and other ill-treatment in their counter-
insurgency efforts. No official or member of the security forces had been prosecuted for 
human rights violations since the conflict resumed in 2004. It urged Thailand to suspend 
application of the <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;</i> law and the Computer-related Crime Act until they were 
brought into compliance with international standards, and to release prisoners of conscience 
detained under these laws. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>529. The delegation of Thailand indicated that it would not be able to respond to all the 
concerns raised, but wished to clarify some key concerns.  
</p>
<p>530. With regard to past political violence, Thailand intended to make every effort to 
further national reconciliation by providing justice for all the victims and ensuring an 
inclusive process of political dialogue. 
</p>
<p>531. Thailand attached the highest priority to the rights of all vulnerable groups and 
intended to do more. 
</p>
<p>532. Concerning the security laws, Thailand reiterated its policy of progressively ending 
their use as the situation improved. Regarding section 17 of the Emergency Decree, this 
provision did not grant immunity to State officials. It did not preclude the right of persons 
to seek compensation for wrongdoing. While Thailand was not in a position to accept 
recommendations to repeal this provision or to review its security laws, it accepted 
recommendations to increase its efforts to put an end to impunity. This reflected its 
determination to address this challenge, including through awareness-raising on the rule of 
law and human rights principles for law enforcement officers, while ensuring justice for all 
affected persons. 
</p>
<p>533. Although Thailand was not a party to the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and the Protocol thereto, it had always lived up to its humanitarian obligations. 
Thailand&#8217;s unique location required that it consider the security implications of these 
instruments. Nevertheless, a mechanism was in place to review Thailand&#8217;s position, and 
further consideration of this matter would be made. 
</p>
<p>534. Given the large number of migrants, Thailand had to handle the matter of migration 
carefully. It had made progress on the protection of migrant workers, but more needed to be 
done. Thailand would study the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, though its final position would </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>213 
</b></p>
<p>depend on the study&#8217;s results. Thailand had accepted several recommendations on migrant 
workers. 
</p>
<p>535. On capital punishment, views and concerns were noted. Discussions on this issue 
were needed at the national level, given that views still varied among sectors of society. 
Thailand was giving careful consideration to this matter. 
</p>
<p>536. On the issue of freedom of expression, Thailand had heard the concerns and views 
raised. Those who understood the nature of Thai society and the key pillars of the Thai 
nation would realize that this was an issue that only the Thai people could settle, and such a 
process was ongoing. 
</p>
<p>537. Today was the beginning of the national implementation phase. Thailand intended to 
make use of the universal periodic review to further advance human rights and nation-
building. It hoped to work with relevant stakeholders in implementing the accepted 
recommendations and voluntary pledges. 
</p>
<p>538. Thailand hoped to present a midterm report to maintain the momentum of the 
universal periodic review process. It thanked all delegations, the National Human Rights 
Commission of Thailand and civil society organizations for their comments, and the troika 
and the secretariat for their hard work and support. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>539. The review of Ireland was held on 6 October 2012 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents:  
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Ireland in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/IRL/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/IRL/2 and A/HRC/WG.6/12/IRL/2/Corr.1); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/IRL/3). 
</p><p>540. At its 39th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Ireland (see section C below). 
541. The outcome of the review of Ireland comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/9), the views of Ireland concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/9/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>542. The Ambassador of Ireland highlighted the fact that the universal periodic review 
was an important process in raising awareness of and standards in relation to human rights 
for all States at the global level. He expressed his gratitude to Irish civil society and the 
non-governmental organizations that had engaged thoroughly to raise awareness of the 
review mechanism in general. One of the great strengths of the universal periodic review 
was its emphasis on consultation, which was central to the process. 
</p>
<p>543. The national human rights institution of Ireland, the Human Rights Commission, 
had played a significant part in informing the public about the importance and value of the </p>


<p><b>214</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review process by holding its own information sessions around the 
country and offering advice and guidance to people who wished to make submissions. 
Together with representatives from non-governmental organizations, they had supported 
the consultation process by providing independent speakers with the opportunity to take 
part in public meetings. 
</p>
<p>544. The protection and promotion of human rights required continuous review and 
updating. In Ireland, the Constitution provided a strong foundation for the protection of 
human rights, both those specified in the Constitution and derived from its underlying 
principles. There was also a strong legislative framework to further protect individuals from 
discrimination, inequality and unjust treatment. 
</p><p>545. The Government had announced its decision in September 2011 to improve 
Ireland&#8217;s human rights infrastructure by merging the Human Rights Commission and the 
Equality Authority into a new Human Rights and Equality Commission, in order to 
promote human rights and equality issues in a more effective, efficient and cohesive way. A 
working group comprising an interdepartmental chairperson, members of both existing 
bodies, and officials from the Department of Justice and Equality had held a consultation 
process to seek the views of civil society and members of the public on what the new body 
should do, what features and functions it should have, how it should be structured and what 
working methods it should employ. 
</p>
<p>546. The working group had almost completed its report, which would be presented to 
the Government shortly. The new Human Rights and Equality Commission would build on 
the achievements of the current bodies to forge an even stronger culture of human rights 
awareness and protection in Ireland. 
</p>
<p>547. Of the 127 recommendations made by Member States, Ireland had immediately 
accepted 62, was unable to support 15, and pledged to further examine 50. The 
Interdepartmental Working Group on the universal periodic review, comprising 
representatives from all relevant Government departments, had responded to 50 outstanding 
recommendations in the addendum. 
</p>
<p>548. Of the 50 pending recommendations, Ireland had fully accepted 29, partially 
accepted 17, and was unable to support only 4. The addendum contained concise 
explanations on the responses to each recommendation. Of a total of 127 recommendations, 
Ireland had fully accepted 91, and 17 had been accepted in part. 
</p>
<p>549. The most important phase of the entire process was the implementation of 
commitments. Some of the recommendations had already been implemented, while other 
areas of implementation were under way. 
</p>
<p>550. During the interactive dialogue, for example, many States had raised the question of 
prison accommodation, in particular, overcrowding and in-cell sanitation. On 6 March 
2012, Minister Shatter had visited Mountjoy Prison in Dublin to inspect the recently 
refurbished C Division, which was due to reopen. Although the project was extremely 
complex, the refurbished accommodation would provide radically improved physical 
conditions for prisoners, including a dedicated committal/assessment area with 28 cells for 
new prisoners, as recommended by the Inspector of Prisons in his report of 2009, and a new 
dedicated drug-free area. The refurbishment project had also seen the introduction of in-cell 
sanitation in all cells in C Division; a similar refurbishment project would commence in B 
Division within the next few weeks, which, when completed, would involve the installation 
of in-cell sanitation in all cells in B Wing. A total of 317 cells in Mountjoy prison would 
therefore have in-cell sanitation, almost 60 per cent of the total prison, by the end of 2012. 
The developments in Mountjoy and the implementation of the proposals for Cork prison, 
which had been recently announced by the Minister, were the realization of the 
Government&#8217;s commitment, as indicated at the review of Ireland in October. </p>

</b></p>
<p>551. With regard to Ireland&#8217;s position on abortion and the response to the judgement of 
the European Court of Human Rights on <i>ABC v. Ireland</i>, the Government had set up an 
expert group to examine the judgement, to elucidate its implications for the provision of 
health-care services to pregnant women in Ireland, and to recommend a series of options on 
how to implement the judgement, taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and 
ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area and the need 
for speedy action. The expert group was established on 13 January 2012 and was composed 
of 14 experts in the fields of obstetrics, psychiatry, general practice, law, professional 
regulation and public policy. It was chaired by a judge of the Irish High Court and would 
present the Government with its written report by the end of July 2012. 
</p>
<p>552. The Government had also announced its decision to sign the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the coming weeks at 
United Nations Headquarters in New York. The current programme for the Government 
clearly stated the policy and goal of forging a new Ireland based on fairness and equality. 
The complaints mechanism that would be established by the Optional Protocol was in 
keeping with the spirit of the many independent complaints, monitoring and inspection 
bodies currently in place in Ireland. Signing the Optional Protocol would be an opportunity 
to continue to affirm Ireland&#8217;s determination to achieve full respect for human rights in 
practice. 
</p>
<p>553. The proposed wording for a referendum on children&#8217;s rights was currently being 
finalized, with a view to holding the referendum later in 2012. 
</p>
<p>554. Ireland had chosen to prepare and submit a voluntary interim report on its progress 
in implementing its commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>555. Algeria welcomed the acceptance by Ireland of a number of recommendations, 
including some on the rights of persons with disabilities, the need to take effective 
measures to improve prison conditions, and to continue the implementation of policies 
concerning domestic violence. Algeria expressed its hope that Ireland would reconsider its 
position on the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Algeria wished Ireland well in the 
implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>556. Uruguay valued the acceptance by Ireland of a number of recommendations to ratify 
international human rights instruments. It considered, that Ireland should however, keep 
under consideration the recommendation to accede to the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Uruguay 
encouraged Ireland to strengthen legislation and policies aiming at assigning a tutor to non-
accompanied asylum-seeking children. Uruguay referred also to one of their 
recommendations, which had been partially accepted, and encouraged Ireland to make 
progress in ensuring the legal prohibition of all forms of corporal punishment against 
children. 
</p>
<p>557. The Republic of Moldova welcomed Ireland&#8217;s constructive engagement with the 
universal periodic review process, applauded Ireland for its cooperation with civil society 
and acknowledged Ireland&#8217;s acceptance of a significant number of recommendations. It 
expressed its appreciation to Ireland for having accepted the three recommendations that 
the Republic of Moldova had made during the review. It noted that Ireland had 
strengthened its policies and laws on domestic violence, as well as the measures to 
eliminate inequality between men and women. The Republic of Moldova welcomed </p>


<p><b>216</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s intention to establish a disability forum and expressed the hope that this initiative 
would result in greater empowerment for people with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>558. The Islamic Republic of Iran hoped that the recommendations would be 
implemented by Ireland. It remained concerned over incidences of human rights violations 
in the country, especially with regard to racism, xenophobia, discrimination against 
Muslims and persons belonging to minorities; lack of legislation proscribing racial profiling 
by the police and other law enforcement personnel; and the low living standards in many 
prisons, including overcrowding and inadequate sanitation and health care. The Islamic 
Republic of Iran had made a number of recommendations to Ireland. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>559. The Irish Human Rights Commission welcomed the wide range of issues raised and 
the recommendations made during Ireland&#8217;s review. It stated that the report of the working 
group could serve as a template for advancing human rights issues, and hoped that Ireland&#8217;s 
progress in implementing the recommendations would underscore its application for 
membership to the Human Rights Council. It stressed the need for Ireland to guarantee 
sufficient resources to the Human Rights and Equality Commission. Ireland needed to make 
serious, sustained and quantifiable efforts in a number of core areas identified by the 
working group in its report. 
</p>
<p>560. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC 
Nederland, speaking also on behalf of ILGA-Europe and GLEN, welcomed progress in 
addressing the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. It welcomed 
Ireland&#8217;s commitment to progressing same-sex marriage through the Constitutional 
Convention, and urged Ireland to address the legal recognition and support of children in 
same-sex-headed families. With regard to challenges, it was essential that Ireland remain 
committed to promoting full equality of young LGBT people. COC Nederland remained 
concerned by legal provisions allowing for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation 
in certain institutions, and called for legislative reform. 
</p>
<p>561. Action Canada for Population and Development, speaking on behalf of the Irish 
Family Planning Association and Sexual Rights Initiative, expressed concern with regard to 
Ireland&#8217;s rejection of all the recommendations on women&#8217;s reproductive rights. These 
recommendations were consistent with the criticism made by treaty bodies. The rejection of 
these recommendations was unacceptable and amounted to a considered disregard by 
Ireland of its human rights obligations, and fell short of the principles of universality, 
indivisibility and interdependence. The European Women&#8217;s Lobby79 expressed concern at 
the rejection of recommendations 108.4 to 108.9 on the regulation of abortion. It made 
reference to another accepted recommendation (107.4), and called on the Government to 
institute a statutory inquiry and compensation scheme for the Magdalene laundries abuse. 
The European Women&#8217;s Lobby expressed concern at Ireland&#8217;s response to recommendation 
107.23 calling for the implementation and an independent assessment of the national 
women&#8217;s strategy, and noted that an independent review would enhance the strategy. It 
urged Ireland to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating 
Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.

 The statement was supported by AkidWA, Banulacht, C&#225;irde, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Irish 
</p>
<p>Family Planning Association, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Justice for Magdalenes, the Migrant 
Rights Centre of Ireland, the National Collective of Community-Based Women&#8217;s Networks, the 
National Traveller Women&#8217;s Forum, the National Women&#8217;s Council of Ireland, OPEN, the Pavee 
Point Travellers Centre and Women&#8217;s Aid. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>217 
</b></p>
<p>562. The International Movement against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism, on 
behalf of Pavee Point, stated that Ireland continued to ignore the opinions and 
recommendations of a range of eminent international and regional human rights bodies that 
had taken the position that the Traveller community met all the legal criteria to be 
recognized as an ethnic minority. A report released in 2010 had revealed that Traveller 
mortality was higher than that of the general population. It urged Ireland to engage with 
Traveller organizations to formulate a response to the issues raised in the said report. 
</p>
<p>563. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues welcomed Ireland&#8217;s 
acceptance of 91 recommendations. It remained concerned about the declaration of partial 
acceptance of 17 recommendations, where it was not clear in what precise manner each 
recommendation has been accepted. It urged Ireland to ratify all core United Nations 
human rights instruments, especially those with monitoring mechanisms, such as the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, and called on Ireland to set out a clear timetable in this regard. 
It remained concerned about the rejection of recommendations regarding the 
implementation of the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights on access to 
abortion, putting an end to ongoing religious discrimination in access to schools and 
recognizing Travellers as an official ethnic minority group. 
</p>
<p>564. Amnesty International urged Ireland to ratify, without further delay, the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
which had been signed almost five years earlier. Ireland must recognize in law the rights to 
health and housing. It urged consideration of these rights at the upcoming review of 
Ireland&#8217;s Constitution. It also urged Ireland to sign and ratify the Council of Europe 
Convention on Violence against Women and Domestic Violence without delay. It 
encouraged Ireland to set time frames, to establish a monitoring mechanism for the 
implementation of accepted recommendations, and to undertake to provide a midterm 
report. 
</p>
<p>565. Age Action Ireland, a member of the HelpAge International network, together with 
the coalition partners (Disability Federation Ireland, the MakeRoom Campaign Alliance, 
Mental Health Reform and the Women&#8217;s Human Rights Alliance) welcomed the spirit in 
which the universal periodic review process of Ireland had been conducted. It commended 
Ireland for committing to sign the Optional Protocol to the International Convention on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also welcomed the partial acceptance of the 
recommendation to incorporate into the law the rights to health and housing, and to bring 
legislation into line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It hoped 
that civil society and the Government could work together, including in the preparation of 
the interim report. 
</p>
<p>566. The society for the Protection of Unborn Children stated that it was the will of the 
Irish people that the right to life of unborn babies be protected from the very beginning. 
During the universal periodic review, many States had called for Ireland to introduce 
abortion. It expressed appreciation for the Irish delegation&#8217;s rejection of these calls. Ireland 
had an excellent record in protecting the lives of both mothers and babies. Life-saving 
medical interventions for pregnant women had always been available. While some children 
may not survive those interventions, their deaths were an undesired consequence of the 
treatment of the mother&#8217;s condition rather than the intended result of the doctor&#8217;s actions. 
Such interventions should not be confused with abortion procedures. 
</p>
<p>567. The European Disability Forum, on behalf of the Equality and Rights Alliance 
(Ireland), welcomed Ireland&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations on the ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, as well as Costa Rica&#8217;s 
recommendation that measures be taken to allow people with disabilities access to 
education, employment, housing, transport and cultural life, and to facilitate their access to </p>


<p><b>218</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>public places and services. It called on Ireland to ensure that the proposed new unified 
Human Rights and Equality Commission was independent, adequately resourced and 
prioritized the ratification of the Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
This new body must have a focus on the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>568. The Ambassador of Ireland thanked all intervening delegations and civil society 
representatives. He stressed that discrimination against Muslims and minorities was 
combated in a most comprehensive manner. The role of the National Disability Authority 
was to monitor compliance with domestic disability legislation. The Ambassador also noted 
the necessity for further consultation regarding the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic 
group. Lastly, he highlighted the continuation of dialogue with civil society for the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations, the new modalities for the 
second cycle and the onus on States for the implementation of their commitments. 
</p>
<p><b>  Togo 
</b></p>
<p>569. The review of Togo was held on 6 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Togo in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TGO/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TGO/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TOG/3). 
</p><p>570. At its 39th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Togo (see section C below). 
571. The outcome of the review of Togo comprised the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/10), the views of Togo concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/10/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>572. The delegation of Togo recalled that during its review, 133 recommendations had 
been made, of which 112 had been accepted (23 of which had already been implemented or 
were being implemented), 11 had been rejected and 10 had been under study until the 
nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p>573. The delegation stated that, as part of the implementation of the above-mentioned 
recommendations, four essential points were raised: (a) responses to deferred 
recommendations; (b) progress achieved since Togo&#8217;s review; (c) measures taken by the 
Government following the enquiry report of the National Commission on Human Rights on 
allegations of torture; and (d) the national plan of action on the implementation of universal 
periodic review recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>219 
</b></p>
<p>574. The responses to deferred recommendations could be categorized into two groups: 
(a) ratification of international instruments on human rights and; (b) standing invitations to 
the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>575. With respect to the first group, the delegation indicated that instructions had been 
given to the Ministry in charge of the promotion of women to commence the procedure of 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. The delegation was also pleased to inform the Council that 
the National Assembly had adopted the law authorizing the ratification of the Convention 
against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Lastly, the delegation stated that the Government had 
been studying with interest the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>576. Concerning the second group of recommendations, the Government had been 
willing to accept invitations that would be formally addressed by special procedures, and 
would cooperate fully with the mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>577. Among the achievements made by Togo since the review in October 2011, the 
Government had launched, in February 2012, the national agricultural investment 
programme, which was aimed at improving life conditions of people in rural areas, 
particularly women and children. WHO had certified that Togo was one of the countries 
that had eradicated the Guinea worm. 
</p>
<p>578. The delegation also informed the Council that the bill on the revision of the Criminal 
Code had taken into account international instruments ratified by Togo, particularly the 
definition and repression of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The bill had been finalized and would be considered by the Council of 
Ministers. Some 500 prison guards (of which a third were female) would be trained and 
operational in six months&#8217; time. 
</p>
<p>579. The delegation stated that, in February 2012, the National Human Rights 
Commission had presented a report on allegations of torture by the National Intelligence 
Agency. The Government had taken measures to implement the recommendations made by 
the Commission, including (a) the reorganization of the National Intelligence Agency; (b) a 
prohibition on keeping on its premises persons arrested for custody or for preventive 
detention; (c) the inclusion in the preliminary bill on the Criminal Code of the definition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; (d) the revision of 
the Organic Law to allow the Commission to carry out investigations and to prevent, if 
applicable, any action by public officials that could be considered an act of torture; (e) the 
budgetary and infrastructure strengthening of the Commission; (f) the Minister for Justice 
had been instructed to propose a draft reform on prison administration; and (g) 
strengthening the organization, equipment and training of the judicial police. 
</p><p>580. Other recommendations accepted included that (a) instructions be given to the 
military command to immediately start disciplinary procedures against officials called into 
investigation; (b) an urgent examination be made by a specialized team of persons that had 
been subjected to inhuman and/or degrading treatment in the National Intelligence Agency, 
with the aim of providing them with appropriate reparation; (c) health treatment be 
provided to people in custody; (d) assurance be given to the President of the Commission 
and his family that measures had been taken to ensure their safety; (e) an interministerial 
commission be established to follow up on the implementation of the Commission 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>581. The delegation reiterated the determination of the Government to fulfil its human 
rights obligations. Togo had adopted a participatory approach in the preparation of its 
national report, and would follow the same approach in the implementation of the universal </p>


<p><b>220</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>periodic review recommendations. Indeed, the Ministry for Human Rights had organized, 
with the support of OHCHR, sectoral workshops that had led to the development of a five-
year plan of action for implementing universal periodic review recommendations. In March 
2012, various stakeholders had approved the plan, which would be adopted by the Council 
of Ministers. 
</p>
<p>582. The plan of action was designed to meet the challenges that Togo faced in the field 
of human rights. Ten main fields were considered: (a) the ratification of international 
instruments on human rights; (b) the harmonization of national legislation with 
international instruments; (c) strengthening the independence of the judiciary; (d) access to 
justice and the fight against impunity; (e) capacity-building of institutions, State and non-
State actors; (f) the promotion and protection of the rights of specific groups (women, 
children, persons with disabilities and the elderly); (g) the fight against poverty and the 
promotion of good governance; (h) promoting the right to health, nutrition and education; 
(i) the integration of human rights into school curricula; and (j) cooperation with human 
rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>583. Togo counted on international cooperation, as it was convinced that, with the 
support of the United Nations system and other partners, it would succeed in implementing 
the recommendations that it had accepted. Togo was convinced that the promotion and 
protection of human rights not only contributed to development but was also a key factor of 
stability and social peace. It therefore requested the support of the international community 
in the implementation of the national plan of action on universal periodic review 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>584. Cuba noted that, in spite of challenges common to other developing countries, Togo 
had made important efforts to promote and protect all human rights of its people. 
Significantly, the right to a healthy environment enjoyed constitutional status. Regarding 
one of the most pressing priorities, the right to food, Togo had taken various initiatives to 
increase agricultural production. Cuba noted with satisfaction the health development plan 
and the implementation of strategies to defeat malaria and HIV/AIDS, and to reduce infant 
mortality. Cuba recommended that the report of the Working Group on the universal 
periodic review of Togo should be adopted. 
</p>
<p>585. Algeria expressed its confidence that Togo would continue to progress on the path to 
democracy and economic and social development. It appreciated the fact that Togo had 
accepted the two recommendations that it had made to promote the rights of women. It 
wished Togo success in implementing its accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>586. Morocco paid tribute to all efforts made by Togo to build stability in the process of 
national reconciliation after having courageously overcome the social unrest and turmoil 
that had ravaged the country for years. Morocco congratulated Togo on having accepted 
almost all recommendations made during the review, especially the two recommendations 
drafted by Morocco, which was also satisfied by Togo&#8217;s response on the commission on 
truth and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>587. Chad praised Togo for having accepted a large number of recommendations, 
including those submitted by its delegation, for which it thanked Togo. It reiterated its 
recommendation that Togo should seek financial and technical assistance from the 
international community to support its efforts to implement its universal periodic review 
commitments. 
</p>
<p>588. The Republic of Moldova noted with satisfaction that Togo had demonstrated its 
engagement in human rights by supporting a considerable number of recommendations at </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>221 
</b></p>
<p>the end of its universal periodic review. In particular, the Republic of Moldova appreciated 
Togo&#8217;s support for its recommendations, and congratulated it on the ratification of the 
UNESCO Convention on Discrimination in Education. It recommended that the report of 
the Working Group on Togo be adopted. 
</p>
<p>589. The Democratic Republic of the Congo stressed Togo&#8217;s efforts to protect social and 
economic rights and, in particular, the adoption of a national housing programme for the 
period 2009&#8211;2013. Noting the many human rights challenges that the country faced, it 
thanked Togo for having accepted its recommendation, and encouraged it to step up its 
efforts to eliminate discrimination against women. It also encouraged Togo to strengthen its 
action to help people living with HIV/AIDS and the measures under way to guarantee food 
security to its people. 
</p>
<p>590. Senegal appreciated Togo&#8217;s open dialogue in the context of its universal periodic 
review and the fact that it had supported many of the recommendations made, including 
those on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. The implementation of these recommendations, 
together with the efforts already made in the economic domain, would allow Togo to 
reinforce the promotion and protection of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>591. Benin lauded Togo&#8217;s acceptance of more than 112 recommendations. It noted that it 
had ratified most international human rights instruments and had demonstrated its 
determination to observe universally accepted values. As examples, Benin listed the 
abolition of the death penalty, the effort to promote peace and harmony through the 
commission for truth, justice and reconciliation, and its steps to promote the rights of 
women and children and to improve the living conditions of its people. Benin invited the 
international community to support the reforms under way in Togo. 
</p>
<p>592. Burkina Faso believed that Togo&#8217;s spirit of cooperation in dealing with the Human 
Rights Council was a sign of its willingness to promote and guarantee the human rights for 
all its citizens. Burkina Faso welcomed Togo&#8217;s efforts in this regard and was ready to 
cooperate with it bilaterally and at the regional and subregional levels. Burkina Faso called 
on the international community to give Togo all necessary technical and financial 
assistance, and recommended the adoption of the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p>593. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire hailed Togo&#8217;s vanguard role in the promotion and protection of human 
rights referring to the establishment of its human rights commission (with &#8220;A&#8221; status) and 
the work of its truth and reconciliation commission. It recognized Togo&#8217;s political courage 
in accepting 112 recommendations, and invited the international community to support this 
effort. It thanked Togo for its solidarity with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire throughout the crisis of the past 
decade, including by accepting Ivorian refugees and hosting the first peace negotiations. 
</p>
<p>594. Tunisia thanked Togo for having accepted almost all recommendations made during 
the review, and noted with appreciation the reforms made in the fields of health, food, 
security and social protection, and the achievements made in the fight against poverty, the 
rights of the child and fundamental freedoms. Tunisia believed that the international 
community should support Togo in its efforts and determination to engage in its reforms 
towards democracy and development. Tunisia recommended the adoption of the report of 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>595. Djibouti noted with satisfaction the numerous efforts made by the Government of 
Togo to strengthen democracy and social dialogue, and welcomed its support for the 
majority of recommendations made during its universal periodic review. Djibouti 
recommended the adoption of the report of the Working Group. </p>


<p><b>222</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>596. The National Human Rights Commission welcomed the universal periodic review 
process, which had allowed for an assessment of the human rights situation and provided 
recommendations to strengthen the ongoing process towards democracy. The Commission 
had actively encouraged the Government to promote a culture of human rights. It had 
participated in the universal periodic review follow-up mechanism established by the 
Government, and had supported the implementation of the recommendations as well as of 
those it had made in its latest report concerning allegations of torture. The Commission 
cited as priorities the fight against impunity and corruption, the protection of civil liberties 
and the imperative of development, stressing that human rights were indivisible and 
universal. It reiterated its invitation to the international community to continue to support 
the difficult and sometimes dangerous efforts made by Commission members to turn Togo 
into a place of peace and justice. 
</p><p>597. The Association for the Prevention of Torture welcomed Togo&#8217;s support for the 
recommendations on the prevention and prohibition of torture in the framework of its 
universal periodic review and for the Government&#8217;s announcement of 13 measures 
concerning the implementation of the recommendations by the National Human Rights 
Commission relating to allegations of torture perpetrated during an attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in 
April 2009. It encouraged Togo to implement those recommendations and to complete, as 
soon as possible, the reform of the Criminal Code in order to ensure that torture would be 
defined in conformity with article 1 of the Convention against Torture and that perpetrators 
would be punished appropriately. The Association also welcomed Togo&#8217;s engagement in 
the creation of a national mechanism for the prevention of torture, and hoped that the new 
mechanism would be independent and effective. The realization of this engagement would 
represent a best practice that other countries could take as an example. 
</p>
<p>598. A statement delivered by the Istituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice, also on 
behalf of the International Volunteerism Organization for Women, Education and 
Development, Mouvement international d&#8217;apostolat des milieux sociaux ind&#233;pendants and 
the International Organization for the Right to Education and Freedom of Education, 
welcomed Togo&#8217;s constructive engagement with the universal periodic review, its adoption 
of a plan of action based on its recommendations, and its decision made in 2008 relating to 
free primary education. It questioned the reliability of official statistics. It welcomed the 
acceptance of recommendations to strengthen the education system and to eliminate 
discrimination against the disabled. It noted the lack of planning policy, poor educational 
infrastructures, the lack of teachers, the overcrowding and poor management of schools and 
the related proliferation of private schools. It recommended the registration of all children 
at birth, a global education reform based on reliable data and integrating on equal footing 
disabled children, and steps to implement article 376 of the Code of the Child, and to 
punish violence against children. 
</p>
<p>599. F&#233;d&#233;ration internationale des ligues des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed Togo&#8217;s 
engagement in the universal periodic review, especially its willingness to eradicate torture 
and to improve the judicial and prison systems. It called for prompt implementation of the 
recommendations and the ratification of the Rome Statute and of the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also welcomed the 
revision of the Criminal Code and the reinforcement of the remits and the capacities of the 
National Human Rights Commission. The organization also urged Togo to ratify the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, and to extend a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human

engagement with the universal periodic review and its cooperation with civil society actors. </p>

<p>It noted that, after years marked by a wide range of human rights violations, it was time to 
renew dialogue with the international community to promote and protect human rights. It 
welcomed the decriminalization of press freedom, the abolition of the death penalty, the 
Code of the Child, the law on rape, and the truth, justice and reconciliation commission, 
although it noted the lack of credibility of certain members. It regretted that none of the 
recommendations of the fact-finding mission conducted in 2005 had been implemented, 
and deplored the fact that the President of the National Human Rights Commission had 
been forced to seek refuge abroad following the publication of the Commission&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>601. The Democracy Coalition Project, with the support of R&#233;seau ouest africain des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits humains, stated that the President of the National Human Rights 
Commission had left the country with his family because their safety was at stake after the 
publication of a report on allegations of torture. It urged the Government to ensure 
protection to the other members of the Commission. The Project was concerned at the lack 
of independence of the judicial system in spite of the reform made in 2009. The situation of 
prisons and detention conditions, as well as the Civil Code and the Family Code, were not 
yet compliant with international standards. It urged the Government to address the above-
mentioned issues and to work with civil society for the implementation of universal 
periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>602. The International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture 
welcomed Togo&#8217;s intention to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on Enforced 
Disappearances, and called for a precise calendar in this regard. It noted the frequent 
practice of torture and ill-treatment, recalled that torture was inappropriately punished, 
underlined the lack of training of the judiciary police, the lack of provisions in the Penal 
Procedure Code relating to the presence of defence lawyers and the right to be examined by 
a doctor in police custody, and deplored the frequent cases of prolonged detention without 
charge of trial. It hoped to be allowed to comment on the draft review of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>603. The delegation expressed its thanks for the support for Togo&#8217;s efforts to promote and 
protect human rights. The delegation reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the 
recommendations included in the plan of action, and recalled the need for the support of the 
international community to ensure it. 
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>604. The review of the Syrian Arab Republic was held on 7 October 2011 in conformity 
with all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Syrian Arab Republic in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/3). 
</p><p>605. At its 39th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Syrian Arab Republic (see section C below). 
606. The outcome of the review of the Syrian Arab Republic comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/11), together with the views 
of the Syrian Arab Republic concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its </p>


<p><b>224</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>607. The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic believed in the importance of the 
universal periodic review mechanism and would work with other States to strengthen 
human rights mechanisms, free from politicization and double standards. It wished to take 
advantage of the recommendations made to advance human rights, especially during the 
current period when the Government was working to build a new State based on human 
rights, despite the great difficulties. The commitment of the Syrian Arab Republic to human 
rights was based on the fundamental principle that these rights are universal and indivisible. 
The responsibility to protect the people and their human rights lay with the State and could 
not be achieved through foreign interference. 
</p>
<p>608. The delegation pointed out that the Syrian Arab Republic had rejected the 
recommendations that were aimed at condemning it rather than protecting human rights, 
and which constituted interference in its internal affairs. The Syrian Arab Republic would 
not allow the hidden intentions of foreign States to disrupt national efforts to promote and 
protect human rights. The delegation thus thanked all States that had contributed positively 
to the review and provided objective and constructive recommendations. 
</p><p>609. The delegation noted that, immediately following the review, the national committee 
that had prepared the universal periodic review report had examined ways and means to 
implement accepted recommendations and worked to determine a position on 
recommendations that had been postponed for further consideration. Over the past five 
months, the Syrian Arab Republic had suffered from terrorist acts by armed groups, 
unprecedented in its history. Innocent civilians had been harmed, property destroyed and 
people displaced in violation of all laws and human rights. On 12 March, the city of Homs 
had suffered a massacre that had all the hallmarks of Al-Qaida, and innocent women and 
children had been killed. The Syrian Arab Republic regarded those who were responsible 
for providing media, financial and weapons support as complicit in the bloodshed. 
</p>
<p>610. Nevertheless, the reforms initiated by the State continued, based on the legitimate 
demands of the people. The Government continued to believe in coexistence, despite the 
attempts at ethnic cleansing and displacement. On 26 February, Syrians had voted in a 
referendum for a new Constitution that sought to protect and promote human rights. The 
new Constitution brought radical changes in order to meet the demands of the Syrian 
people. The leadership of the State by the Ba&#8217;ath party was repealed from the Constitution, 
and the President&#8217;s mandate would be limited and could only be extended once. Other 
amendments opened the way to political pluralism and the democratic transfer of power. 
They upheld political, economic and social human rights and promoted the rule of law, 
while protecting cultural diversity. The new Constitution had been approved by 89 per cent 
of voters. 
</p>
<p>611. Despite the continued violence, support for armed groups and unjust economic 
sanctions, the Syrian Arab Republic had reiterated its commitment to human rights and 
announced the acceptance of 24 more recommendations, in addition to those already 
accepted in October 2011. It had accepted recommendations to establish a national human 
rights institution and placed particular importance on recommendations concerning national 
dialogue, which was the only solution to the current crisis. It had opened the door to 
dialogue with all parties, although the armed opposition supported by foreign powers had 
rejected this offer. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>225 
</b></p>
<p>612. To accelerate reform, article 13 of the new Constitution aimed at increasing the 
national income and development of production, raising living standards and creating 
employment. Economic sanctions imposed outside the scope of international law had, 
however, violated the economic and social rights of the people, and their impact made more 
severe by the destruction of infrastructure through terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p>613. The delegation made comments with regard to the recommendations accepted by the 
Syrian Arab Republic and considered to be in the process of implementation: 
</p>
<p> (a) With regard to recommendations 1 to 3, on the harmonization of national 
legislation with the provisions of international instruments, particularly the Convention 
against Torture, the Ministry of the Interior had issued circulars prohibiting all forms of 
torture and arrests without evidence, requiring families to be informed on the whereabouts 
of detained family members and providing for the accountability of those responsible for 
concealing information; 
</p>
<p> (b) With regard to recommendation 11 on the rules of engagement for the 
security services and human rights training for the police, the Ministry of the Interior had 
put in place a training plan on crowd control for riot police in line with the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles for the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. The Syrian Arab Republic had established a 
national commission of inquiry that was now considering nearly 5,000 cases, and it had 
provided detailed information to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on cases in which penalties had been imposed on members of the security forces for 
violations of human rights or that had been referred to justice; 
 (c) With regard to recommendation 12, on the reform of the judicial system, 
article 154 of the new Constitution provided for legislative reform to be implemented 
within a period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (d) With regard to recommendation 13, on respect for freedom of expression, the 
Syrian Arab Republic had enshrined this right in the new Constitution, and a new media 
law had been adopted two months earlier; 
</p>
<p> (e) With regard to recommendation 14, on the review of the Personal Status 
Law, to ensure that women and men enjoy equal rights, the Syrian Arab Republic was 
working with national non-governmental organizations to resolve gaps in the existing law. 
</p>
<p>614. With regard to pending recommendations, the Syrian Arab Republic had accepted 
recommendation 2, on acceding to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; 
recommendations 4 to 6, on the incorporation into national law of provisions contained in 
human rights treaties, including the definition of torture as contained in the Convention 
against Torture; recommendation 7, on the withdrawal of reservations to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child; recommendation 10, on compliance with the Convention against 
Torture; recommendations 11 to 23, on cooperation with the international commission of 
inquiry and OHCHR, allowing them entry to the country; and recommendations 24 and 25, 
on cooperation with special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>615. With regard to the recommendations that the Syrian Arab Republic regarded as 
already implemented, the delegation pointed out that, in the case of recommendations 22 
and 23, on freedom of expression and association, in addition to measures already taken, 
the Syrian Arab Republic was already elaborating a law on the work of non-governmental 
organizations, which would permit the establishment of different types of organizations. 
</p>
<p>616. The delegation also presented additional information on a number of rejected 
recommendations, particularly those that it considered not to be compatible with the spirit 
of the universal periodic review mechanism. At the same time, in an effort to further 
promote and protect human rights, the delegation announced that the Syrian Arab Republic </p>


<p><b>226</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>was in a position to accept recommendations allowing the access of international media, 
noting that it had already allowed more than 147 foreign media outlets to enter the country 
since the universal periodic review meeting in October 2011. 
</p>
<p>617. The delegation deplored the fact that terrorist acts had impeded the State&#8217;s ability to 
implement some recommendations, but noted that the Government would not renounce its 
responsibility to protect the Syrian people. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>618. Cuba highlighted the approval of a new Constitution with the support of 89 per cent 
of voters, which demonstrated the support of the people for the reform measures. One 
positive step was the creation of a commission to study the socioeconomic reality of the 
country, which reflected the priority given by the authorities to the well-being of its 
population. Cuba reiterated its opposition to foreign intervention. It also reiterated its 
confidence in the ability of the people and the Government to resolve their domestic 
problems without external interference, and called for full respect of the right of self-
determination of this Arab nation. 
</p>
<p>619. Nicaragua noted the political will of the Syrian authorities to achieve national 
reconciliation. The Human Rights Council should cooperate and show solidarity with all 
States, without imposing measures that could not lead to an adequate solution. Selectivity 
should not become the spirit of the Council. Nicaragua appreciated the fact that the Syrian 
Arab Republic had made efforts to re-establish a democratic order. National dialogue had to 
take place without interference from abroad. Nicaragua also highlighted the political will 
demonstrated by the Government in receiving Kofi Annan, who could make a constructive 
contribution to the national dialogue. 
</p>
<p>620. Uruguay called on the Syrian Arab Republic to end the repression of its own people, 
arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions and torture. It urged the State to allow a visit by 
the commission of inquiry created by the Human Rights Council. Uruguay called on the 
Syrian Arab Republic to release all prisoners of conscience and those arrested arbitrarily, 
and to end intimidation, persecution and arbitrary arrest. Recommendations on ending 
violent repression, initiating an open and inclusive national dialogue and launching a 
transparent investigation remained valid and necessary. Uruguay reiterated its 
recommendation that the Syrian Arab Republic should cease the de facto reinstatement of 
the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>621. Algeria noted that, in the current situation, the Human Rights Council was not only 
concerned with the review of the Syrian Arab Republic under the universal periodic review, 
but also with the resolutions and decisions taken at its special sessions and urgent debates 
on the country. Algeria asked what procedure should best be adopted to appropriately deal 
with this situation and to reconcile the two different tracks, while addressing the situation 
with the priority that it deserved. 
</p>
<p>622. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea commended the Syrian Arab Republic 
for its adoption of a new Constitution, which stipulated the principle of political plurality. It 
was concerned that the human rights efforts of the Syrian Arab Republic were being 
hampered by unilateral sanctions, which had had a negative impact on the Government&#8217;s 
efforts to provide basic services to the people. The support that armed groups had received 
from certain countries only served to encourage their violations of the right to life. It was 
important to fully respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Member 
States. Any development process could only be an outcome of Syrian-led policies, without 
any foreign intervention. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>227 
</b></p>
<p>623. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the determination of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
promote human rights and democracy by responding to the demands of the people and by 
adopting a new Constitution, which had taken into consideration many new commitments 
in the area of human rights. The Syrian Arab Republic had accepted a number of 
recommendations, which should be fully implemented. The Islamic Republic of Iran was, 
however, concerned that sanctions imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic by certain 
countries would hamper the Government&#8217;s efforts to provide basic services to its 
population. 
</p>
<p>624. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that the Syrian Arab Republic had 
adopted a new Constitution, which provided for political pluralism. It was concerned that 
the country&#8217;s efforts to promote human rights had been hampered by harsh unilateral 
sanctions. It expressed concern at the support that armed groups had received from some 
countries, which only served to encourage the violation of the right to life. The Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela reiterated its faith in the ability of the Syrian people and the 
Government to resolve their domestic situation without any foreign intervention, in 
accordance with the principles of sovereignty and self-determination. 
</p>
<p>625. Ecuador called on the Government and the armed groups to respect human rights, to 
refrain from violence and the escalation of the armed conflict, and to engage in a peaceful 
and constructive dialogue to find a political solution. It hoped that the Syrian Arab Republic 
would consider the outcome of the review positively and implement the recommendations 
accepted. Ecuador believed that individual investigative procedures were not the most 
appropriate way to promote and protect human rights, and that the universal periodic 
review was a more adequate means. 
</p>
<p>626. The Russian Federation noted that the agreement of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
undergo its universal periodic review demonstrated that, despite the difficult period, it was 
open to a mutually respectful dialogue on human rights issues. It noted with satisfaction 
that the Syrian Arab Republic had accepted a large number of recommendations, and called 
on the country to make every effort to implement them. 
</p>
<p>627. China paid great attention to the developments in the Syrian Arab Republic and 
stood for a peaceful solution to the crisis. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and 
other parties should immediately and unconditionally stop all acts of violence, in particular 
against innocent civilians. The Government and the various factions should open an 
inclusive political dialogue immediately. Relevant parties in the international community 
should respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
the right of the people to choose independently their political system and path of 
development. China supported the leading role of the United Nations in coordinating 
humanitarian assistance. It appealed to the Human Rights Council to conduct its work in an 
impartial, objective and non-selective manner, and to play a constructive role in the pursuit 
of an early political solution. 
</p>
<p>628. The United States of America was appalled by the worsening human rights situation. 
Since the review, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic had engaged in even more 
flagrant violations of international human rights. Government forces had cracked down 
brutally on Syrians who demanded merely that their human rights be respected. This had 
resulted in the killing of more than 7,500 civilians. The people continued to endure mass 
arrests, arbitrary detentions, torture, targeted killings and indiscriminate bombardment by 
heavy artillery. A Government that ruled through terror and intimidation should step aside. 
The United States called on the Government to immediately facilitate access to 
humanitarian aid, end violence against peaceful protestors and political activists, release all 
prisoners of conscience, permit unrestricted access to human rights observers, including the 
commission of inquiry and media, and allow a Syrian-led transition towards the formation 
of a representative Government. </p>


<p><b>228</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>629. The World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its support for the Syrian people 
and workers in their legitimate demands to achieve political, economic and social reform. 
The recent approval of a new Constitution by 89 per cent of voters was a sign of the 
popular support for this path. It was up to the Syrian people to determine their own future, 
without foreign interference. The Syrian Arab Republic had become the object of a political 
and media campaign aimed at undermining its national unity. No country had the right to 
organize, fund and arm terrorist groups in another country. Furthermore, the Israeli 
occupation of the Syrian Golan and the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions 
violated human rights and needed to be stopped. 
</p>
<p>630. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies noted that the Syrian people, for one 
year, had been struggling for freedom, justice and dignity and, during the same period, had 
been killed, tortured and imprisoned on a massive scale. The Syrian Arab Republic had 
refused to end violations of international human rights law, including violent reprisals 
against peaceful protesters and activists, and to engage in a credible reform process. The 
number of documented deaths probably exceeded 10,000, with entire cities under military 
siege. The Security Council had failed to fulfil its obligations. The Cairo Institute called on 
the Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution demanding international accountability and 
referring the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court. It 
also called on the Council to postpone the adoption of the universal periodic review 
outcome on the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>631. The International Commission of Jurists had noted the widespread violations of 
human rights amounting to crimes under international law, including torture, summary 
executions, arbitrary detention and indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population. 
Torture and ill-treatment were widespread and systematic. Although the Syrian authorities 
had lifted the state of emergency in April 2011, they had failed to abolish the State of 
Emergency Law. The practice of secret and other arbitrary detentions, including in 
unofficial detention facilities, continued. While the Syrian Arab Republic claimed that it 
accepted the recommendations calling for investigations and accountability, the authorities 
had failed to prosecute any State official or law enforcement officer for human rights 
violations, which might amount to crimes against humanity. The Security Council should 
refer this situation to the International Criminal Court. The Syrian army continued to fire 
explosive shells into populated areas, in particular in Homs and Edleb, and subjected whole 
cities and neighbourhoods to effective siege. Effective measures had to be taken to allow 
humanitarian access. 
</p>
<p>632. United Nations Watch joined the urgent demands made in the report on the Syrian 
Arab Republic to end attacks on peaceful protestors and activists, to bring violators to 
account, and to end its practice of arbitrarily detaining Syrians for participating in peaceful 
demonstrations and release all those detained, including prisoners of conscience. It 
applauded the vigorous work by some delegations, as well as the strong condemnation 
made by the League of Arab States of the violations by the Syrian Arab Republic, which 
had been suspended from the Human Rights Council. Further international action was, 
however, needed. 
</p>
<p>633. The Union of Arab Jurists regretted the dramatic situation in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, which highlighted the need for reforms. The adoption of the new Constitution 
was an important step in this regard. The implementation of reforms should be continued in 
order to uphold equal rights for all Syrians. Although violence and lack of security had 
reigned in many provinces, the Syrian Arab Republic was a stable country. Human rights 
reforms needed to be undertaken, but human rights should not be politicized to facilitate 
foreign interference. National dialogue was needed, but would only be possible once the 
violence had ended. Economic sanctions should be ended. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>229 
</b></p>
<p>634. The General Arab Women Federation noted that violence was leaving thousands of 
people dead, wounded and traumatized, with dramatic effects on women and children. The 
media had played an unprecedented role in misinforming and blocking efforts for dialogue. 
Economic sanctions were also punishing the population. The Syrian Arab Republic was 
hosting a million refugees from Iraq, who had been given free access to all basic services. 
The Federation considered that criminal acts did not help to provide a solution, and that the 
conflict could only be resolved by peaceful means. It called for a comprehensive process of 
national dialogue, and mechanisms to end the arming, funding and training of insurgent 
groups. It called for a lifting of all sanctions imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
urged the Government to create a climate of trust that would allow for the implementation 
of the new Constitution and reforms. 
</p>
<p>635. Amnesty International noted that the authorities had accepted recommendations to 
guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, opinion and assembly; to end conflict and 
violence and find a peaceful political solution; and to investigate alleged cases of violence 
and deaths. It observed that these commitments appeared cynical and insincere, given the 
situation that prevailed. Amnesty International maintained that some of the violations by 
the authorities amounted to crimes against humanity. It had received the names of almost 
7,000 people who had been killed or died in connection with the protests since March 2011. 
Many had been shot by members of the security forces or died in custody. Thousands had 
been arrested, and many had been held incommunicado and subjected to torture. More 
recently, civilian areas had been attacked with tanks, helicopters, rockets and artillery fire. 
Amnesty International cautioned against proceeding with this review in a routine manner. 
</p>
<p>636. CIVICUS and the Arab NGO Network for Development noted that, since the Syrian 
forces had invaded a number of neighbourhoods with heavy weapons on 3 February 2012, 
widespread destruction and death had resulted, with a particularly heavy impact on women 
and children. Such essential services as water, phone and electricity had been cut, and 
access to medical services and humanitarian assistance was blocked. The authorities had 
even blown up a bridge that people had used to take refuge in Lebanon. Many areas and 
cities, such as Homs and Hama, had suffered a real catastrophe. The Syrian Arab Republic 
had witnessed a great revolution; in order for negotiations to take place, the Government 
had to give up power peacefully so that a State based on human rights could be built. 
Access to the Syrian Arab Republic should be allowed and the army withdrawn from the 
streets. 
</p>
<p>637. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme quoted Victor Hugo by 
stating that &#8220;to remain silent in the face of crime is to participate in crime&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review  
</b></p>
<p>638. The Syrian Arab Republic thanked the delegations that had made constructive 
statements and suggestions, as well as the members of the troika and the secretariat who 
had contributed to the adoption of the report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b>639. The review of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was held on 7 October 2011 in 
conformity with all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, 
and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in 
accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/VEN/1 and A/HRC/WG.6/12/VEN/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/VEN/2); </p>


<p><b>230</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/VEN/3). 
</p><p>640. At its 40th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (see section C 
below). 
641. The outcome of the review of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela comprises the 
report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/12), the views 
of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela concerning the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed 
during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/12/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>642. The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela recalled the significant 
impact that its first review had had at the national level, as evidenced by the participation in 
the preparation of the universal periodic review of thousands of citizens, hundreds of social 
organizations and an array of public institutions from the five branches of Government. 
</p>
<p>643. The completion of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&#8217;s first review entailed the 
opening of a new cycle which, for a society committed to social justice, enhancing 
democracy and the comprehensive realization of human rights, was considered a possibility 
to further develop the political and institutional mechanisms provided for in the 
Constitution to ensure the universal enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>644. The universal periodic review of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in particular 
the interactive dialogue in October 2011, was an opportunity to highlight the revolution that 
the Venezuelan society had had to carry out in order to become a true, tangible, stable and 
lasting democracy; this, in spite of being regularly at the centre of international geopolitical 
events in recent years, especially since the outbreak of the foolish interventionist surge 
called the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; that had been replaced, on behalf of human rights, by the latest 
military marketing product called the &#8220;responsibility to protect&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>645. The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, public authorities, social 
and grass-roots organizations and the people had not squandered one second over the past 
13 years in developing its agenda of political, economic, social and cultural 
democratization, notwithstanding the immense external pressures on it. The Venezuelan 
people had realized that, perhaps, this was the price to pay to build a true democracy, to the 
extent that it contradicted the interests of transnational capital. 
</p>
<p>646. As the Vice-President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs had stated during the review, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had passed in 
this period from an authoritarian and oligarchic State to a democratic and popular one, the 
transformation of which, still ongoing, was accelerating and getting deeper over time. 
</p>
<p>647. Only under a Government of this nature, under a social rule of law and justice as 
established by the Constitution, had it been possible to achieve such impressive progress in 
the implementation of human rights, as shown in the report of the Working Group. The 
delegation reiterated that the maxim of Simon Bolivar, &#8220;Justice is the queen of republican 
virtues, and equality and freedom are supported by it&#8221;, had guided the actions of the 
Government and its national human rights strategy. 
</p>
<p>648. By accepting the vast majority of recommendations made during the interactive 
dialogue (80 per cent of which were already being implemented), and by making numerous 
voluntary commitments, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had made significant </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>231 
</b></p>
<p>progress in complying with its universal human rights obligations and demonstrated its will 
to further develop cooperation with United Nations agencies and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>649. Cuba highlighted the progress made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the 
implementation of public policies designed to eliminate inherited poverty, and highlighted 
the achievement of the first Millennium Development Goal on the eradication of poverty 
and hunger. Cuba also noted the progress made in other areas, such as access to drinking 
water and sanitation, the social inclusion of vulnerable groups and indigenous peoples, 
gender policies, combating racial discrimination, reducing unemployment and the 
launching of programmes to ensure adequate housing. The Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela had implemented programmes and models designed to address the structural 
problems of inequality, social exclusion and discrimination, thus making it possible for its 
people to build freely its economic, political and social future. 
</p>
<p>650. Nicaragua commended the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the social 
transformation it had advanced to overcome the inequalities from the past. It praised the 
country&#8217;s social model, which had allowed the strengthening of its system for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Nicaragua reiterated its commitment to continue 
to work with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the construction of a more just 
international order, to ensure that human rights became a reality. 
</p>
<p>651. Viet Nam commended the efforts and achievements made by the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela, particularly in the areas of economic development, social equity 
and the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela had acted in good faith during and after the review process, and many 
recommendations had enjoyed its support. Viet Nam encouraged the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela to continue to play an active role in the work of the Human Rights Council and 
to contribute to the promotion of dialogue, mutual respect and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>652. China appreciated the constructive spirit demonstrated by the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela during the universal periodic review process. It highlighted the initiatives taken 
by the State in the areas of economic and social development and the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals. China also welcomed the efforts made by the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela to protect the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and 
children. China understood that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was a developing 
country and therefore faced specific challenges, but believed that, with the relentless efforts 
of the Government and the people, and the economic and social policies implemented, this 
would translate into further achievements. 
</p>
<p>653. Uruguay highlighted a number of recommendations that had enjoyed the support of 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in particular its commitment to adhere to various 
international human rights instruments. It also referred to a recommendation to strengthen 
the national system to combat all practices of racial discrimination in accordance with the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had supported a recommendation to continue to facilitate 
and strengthen the work of non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors. 
Uruguay indicated that, on the basis of its own national experience, it considered that 
working in cooperation with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council could 
contribute to the improvement of human rights at the local level. 
</p>
<p>654. Algeria highlighted the commitment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the 
promotion and protection of human rights, as had been reflected by its acceptance of most 
of the recommendations. Algeria was particularly pleased to see that the State had accepted </p>


<p><b>232</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>its three recommendations concerning accession to the International Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, improving conditions for business and also the right to 
housing. It also congratulated the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on its commitment to 
the promotion of economic and social rights, as seen recently during negotiations of the 
draft labour law. 
</p>
<p>655. The Dominican Republic stated that the universal periodic review had shown the 
commitment of the Government to the observance of human rights in its country. It 
commended the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for its spirit of solidarity and 
cooperation, without conditions, that it provided to other peoples of the region by 
undertaking successful programmes in the areas of economic, social and cultural rights. The 
Dominican Republic encouraged it to continue to strengthen its social policies in favour of 
those in need. 
</p>
<p>656. The Islamic Republic of Iran pointed out that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
had actively participated in the universal periodic review process, demonstrating its 
commitment to the work of the Human Rights Council. It made reference to a number of 
recommendations that had been accepted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and 
expressed its confidence that they would be fully implemented in good faith. It commended 
the efforts that had been made by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to raise the living 
standards of its people and to remove social inequality. 
</p>
<p>657. Ecuador highlighted the important results achieved by the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela as part of its efforts to combat poverty, exclusion and marginalization, as seen in 
the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Ecuador commended 
its efforts in the areas of access to health services by the majority of the population, gender 
equality, the attention to children and other vulnerable sectors of the population, economic 
and social development, and the establishment of a process of intercultural and multilingual 
education. Ecuador supported the initiatives for the integration of nations of the region and 
recognized the leading role that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela played in them. 
</p>
<p>658. The Syrian Arab Republic highlighted the positive attitude of the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela to the universal periodic review and the transparency of its national 
report. It expressed appreciation for the State&#8217;s commitment to put into effect the 
recommendations made by it. It noted the State&#8217;s commitment to the international 
instruments to which it was a party, and encouraged it to continue its efforts to maintain its 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to safeguard the rights of its people. The 
Syrian Arab Republic welcomed the positive measures taken with all stakeholders in the 
field of human rights, in particular in education, health and the fight against poverty. It 
applauded the initiatives undertaken by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ensure 
social justice despite the challenges it faced. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was 
moving along the right path to strengthening human rights, and it was encouraged to step 
up those efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>659. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo), accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status, 
acknowledged the Government&#8217;s efforts in the area of human rights, including policies for 
the progressive realization of the rights to health, food, water, land, culture and the 
protection of vulnerable groups. It noted the recent policy to combat violence through the 
control of firearms, and recommended that efforts for a comprehensive strategy on social 
violence should be continued. It requested the Government to continue to strengthen its 
penitentiary policies with a view to overcoming the vulnerability of persons deprived of 
their liberty. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>233 
</b></p>
<p>660. The Indian Council of South America congratulated the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela for its support in heating indigenous homes in North America affected by the 
high cost of fuel. It highlighted and supported the recommendations regarding the rights of 
indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants, as well as those regarding the promotion of 
solidarity, the development of peace and an equitable international order made by Cuba. It 
called on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ratify the Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>661. The Federation of Cuban Women highlighted the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
strengthening legal framework for the equality of men and women. It recognized that the 
Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was one of the most progressive on 
the issue of gender. It also noted the creation of various institutions in the country to 
address this issue. It observed that a UNDP report noted the priority given by the State to 
comprehensive support for pregnant women. The existence of such new forms of social 
organizations as community councils was also acknowledged. 
</p>
<p>662. The World Federation of Trade Unions was in close contact with workers and trade 
unions in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and recognized the realization of important 
economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, such as the fight against exclusion and 
inequality, illiteracy and child malnutrition, as well as the provision of free health services 
to all. It highlighted the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had lowered 
unemployment while its minimum wage was one of the highest in the region. It also 
commended the policies introduced to aid the most vulnerable sectors of society. 
</p>
<p>663. Asociaci&#243;n Cubana de las Naciones Unidas welcomed the strategy adopted by the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to put human beings at the centre of its social policies, in 
such fields as health, education, nutrition and social protection. It stated that UNESCO had 
recognized the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as a territory free of illiteracy. It also 
underscored the high level of social participation through various bodies. The Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela was a true democracy; the Bolivarian revolution had resulted not 
only in material gains for the population but also served to lift their self-esteem. 
</p>
<p>664. Nord-Sud XXI highlighted the State&#8217;s exemplary record in poverty reduction and 
progress in the rights to health and education, and the protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples. These achievements were good practices that could assist other countries. It noted 
the support for the right to development and encouraged the State to examine how to 
enhance the participation of all people in its political processes in a manner that built on 
basic expression and participation rights, and the responsibilities inherent to these rights. 
</p>
<p>665. The International Volunteerism Organization for Women; Education and 
Development, as part of a coalition, expressed its concern with regard to the situation of the 
Yanomami indigenous people, and recommended that the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela guarantee basic services to indigenous peoples, and in particular to the 
Yanomami; continue efforts to ensure that indigenous children in remote zones are 
registered; and continue health reforms, in particular to address child malnutrition and child 
mortality. 
</p>
<p>666. The World Alliance for Citizen Participation-CIVICUS noted the rejection of the 
repeated requests by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to free Judge Afiuni. Areas 
that required urgent attention included the extremely high rate of violence; the systematic 
criminalization of trade union protests, and impunity for the killings of trade union 
activists; threats and restrictions of the rights of indigenous peoples, persons in need of 
international protection and LGBT persons; and the formulation of a national plan of action 
for human rights. 
</p>
<p>667. Human Rights Watch noted that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had rejected 
recommendations on the independence of the judiciary, and that the Supreme Court had </p>


<p><b>234</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>refused to recognize the rulings of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It also noted 
the arbitrary detention of Judge Afiuni since 2009. The Government had undermined the 
right to free speech as well as the ability of human rights defenders to work independently. 
It called on the Government to enforce more carefully its international legal obligations in 
all these areas. 
</p>
<p>668. Instituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice highlighted the inequalities in the 
enjoyment of the right to education affecting the Yanomami indigenous people, noting that 
90 per cent of the Yanomami school-age population had no access to education services, 
and that the remaining 10 per cent had access to primary education only. It added that there 
was a lack of multicultural and intercultural education. It recommended that the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela continue its efforts to guarantee universal education and that it 
provide school structures, teachers and adequate teaching materials to ensure quality 
education to indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>669. Article 19, International Centre against Censorship was concerned at the rejection by 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of recommendations on freedom of expression, and 
indicated that the situation could worsen in 2012. It noted the existence of 40 cases of 
attacks on journalists or limitations of their rights. It reiterated its recommendations that the 
authorities promptly and adequately investigate attacks on the press and journalists, and 
condemn explicitly such attacks, and that legislation decriminalize contempt and slander. 
</p>
<p>670. The Association for the Prevention of Torture welcomed the State&#8217;s acceptance of 
the recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The 
prisons in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela were characterized by high rates of 
violence, which had resulted in an alarming number of deaths in recent years. The 
Association was also concerned at reports that non-governmental organizations had been 
denied access to places of detention and been publicly threatened. It called on the State to 
promptly ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and to create an 
effective national preventive mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>671. The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acknowledged those who, 
with their remarks, had confirmed once again that the universal periodic review was the 
main instrument of the Human Rights Council for the promotion and protection of human 
rights through dialogue and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>672. The delegation reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s determination to implement the 97 
recommendations accepted and its voluntary commitments, a process that had already 
started on 7 October 2011, as soon as its review had ended. 
</p>
<p>673. The delegation reminded the Human Rights Council that the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela had rejected only those recommendations the implementation of which would 
have been in violation of its Constitution or were based on false assumptions, or simply 
were so far from Venezuelan reality that it made no sense to implement them. A detailed 
explanation of these issues could be found in the addendum to the report of the Working 
Group. 
</p>
<p><b>  Iceland 
</b></p>
<p>674. The review of Iceland was held on 10 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Iceland in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/1); </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>235 
</b></p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/3). 
</p><p>675. At its 40th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Iceland (see section C below). 
676. The outcome of the review of Iceland comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/13), the views of Iceland concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>677. The delegation stated that it was a great honour to address the Human Rights 
Council on the adoption of the report on Iceland&#8217;s first universal periodic review, and a 
privilege to engage in an open and encouraging dialogue on the promotion and protection 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p>678. The first cycle of the universal periodic review had proven that the mechanism could 
be a valuable tool to further enhance the protection of human rights. As the Minister for the 
Interior of Iceland, &#214;gmundur J&#243;nasson, had stated during the presentation of the State&#8217;s 
report in October 2011, the process was an opportunity for States to support each other to 
reflect and to increase the focus on the national application of human rights obligations. 
The experience gained and lessons learned in the first cycle of the universal periodic review 
had shown promise for the second cycle. 
</p>
<p>679. The universal periodic review was a valuable instrument for the Government of 
Iceland, as it reviewed the legal and practical implementation of human rights instruments 
in a systematic manner with a view to reporting at both the international and national levels. 
This work was valuable for further national dialogue on how Iceland, as a society, could 
best ensure human rights at every level. On behalf of the Government of Iceland, the 
delegation extended its gratitude to States for the constructive criticism, encouragement, 
advice and recommendations received. 
</p>
<p>680. During its universal periodic review, Iceland had received 84 recommendations, 
which focused on equality and non-discrimination, racism and intolerance, gender pay 
gaps, violence against women and children, improvements in the prison system, 
international human rights obligations and improvements to the structural mechanism for 
the protection of human rights. Many of the recommendations addressed challenging areas 
where the Government of Iceland recognized the need for further action which, in some 
instances, were consistent with ongoing legislative reform. 
</p>
<p>681. On International Human Rights Day, in December 2011, the Ministry of the Interior 
had hosted a public event during which the report of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review was presented; an open dialogue with civil society and the public 
regarding the position of the Government on the recommendations in the report had ensued. 
Following this public consultation, the report was posted on the website of the Ministry of 
the Interior for further examination and comments. 
</p>
<p>682. The delegation stated that, as evident from the addendum to the report of the 
Working Group, the Government of Iceland had accepted some recommendations, 
converted some recommendations into voluntary commitments, and reflected those </p>


<p><b>236</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>recommendations that had already been implemented or were being implemented, as well 
as those recommendations that would undergo in-depth examination before Iceland&#8217;s next 
review. Three recommendations had not been accepted, the first of which concerned the 
withdrawal of its reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
The reasons underlying those reservations remained applicable. 
</p>
<p>683. The other two recommendations encouraged legal definitions that were different 
from those in Icelandic legislation. With regard to &#8220;discrimination&#8221;, the legal definition in 
Icelandic legislation was in line with Iceland&#8217;s obligations under the agreement on the 
European Economic Area. Extensive preparatory legislative work was ongoing, aimed at 
enacting comprehensive equal treatment legislation further in line with legal initiatives on 
equality protection in Europe. The delegation emphasized that non-discrimination was a 
vital aspect of human rights protection in Iceland, and efforts would continue to ensure non-
discrimination in Iceland. 
</p>
<p>684. With regard to torture, the current legislation prohibited torture as a form of 
inhuman treatment as described in the Constitution of Iceland. Any legislative change could 
undermine the main principle on the strict protection of freedom that was firmly enacted in 
Icelandic law and legal practice. 
</p>
<p>685. The delegation stated that recommendations had been made on issues regarding 
violence against women and domestic violence, relating in particular to structural aspects in 
society, such as a lack of effort to increase awareness and to better enable victims of 
violence to find their way to and through the legal system. These recommendations were a 
valuable encouragement for the strong emphasis that the Government of Iceland had put on 
ending violence against women and domestic violence, which included a new plan of 
action. 
</p>
<p>686. The delegation referred to the recommendations on the protection of children from 
sexual abuse, and stated that the establishment of Barnah&#250;s, a child-friendly, 
interdisciplinary and multi-agency centre where different professionals worked under one 
roof in the investigation of child sexual abuse cases, had had a positive impact on the 
protection of children and was an example that other European countries had looked to 
when investigating and processing cases of sexual violence against children. Nevertheless, 
the prevention of sexual abuse against children needed to be strengthened. To that end, the 
Government of Iceland had presented a legislative amendment to the General Penal Code in 
order to ratify the Lanzarote Convention of the Council of Europe and allocated financial 
resources for a prevention and awareness-raising campaign. 
</p>
<p>687. The delegation emphasized that, under the General Penal Code, all children under 
the age of 18 were effectively protected from sexual exploitation. Individuals from the age 
of 15 were permitted to engage in consensual sexual intercourse. This did not diminish their 
legal protection from sexual exploitation or sexual violence, as there was a clear difference 
between sexual relations and sexual violence or exploitation. The Government of Iceland 
was of the view that the criminalization of sexual relations between teenagers would not be 
useful in ending violence against children. 
</p>
<p>688. The delegation stated that the Government had put emphasis on protecting the 
welfare system during the challenging economic times arising from the financial crisis in 
</p><p>2008. It stated, that by way of an example, a consultation group consisting of relevant 
stakeholders had been established to monitor the situation and to make recommendations to 
the Government. The economic turbulence had triggered a lively and substantial social 
debate on the concept and implementation of human rights, and the positive obligations of 
the Government in protecting and ensuring those rights. The universal periodic review had 
given valuable input in that discussion. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>237 
</b></p>
<p>689. It was vital that the outcome of the universal periodic review translate into concrete 
action at the national level. This would take considerable effort and clear political will on 
the part of the Government, in close cooperation with civil society and academia. Extensive 
work had commenced with the preparation of a national plan of action, and included a 
series of monthly meetings to encourage an open dialogue on the protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>690. The national plan of action would include a process to follow up on universal 
periodic review recommendations and outcomes from the treaty bodies. Equally important 
was the work being undertaken to rethink the structural aspects of human rights protection, 
which specifically took into account international encouragement to establish a human 
rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>691. The delegation expressed its gratitude to OHCHR for its invaluable support in the 
universal periodic review process, the troika for its cooperation throughout the process, and 
the Vice President for his leadership. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>692. Algeria noted with satisfaction that Iceland had accepted most of the 
recommendations received, and took note of its positive approach to converting a number 
of recommendations into voluntary commitments. It expressed its appreciation for the fact 
that three of the four recommendations that it had made enjoyed the support of Iceland. It 
welcomed the adoption of the Strategy for Iceland&#8217;s Development Cooperation 2011&#8211;2014, 
which made provision for development assistance programmes. Algeria also took positive 
note of the readiness of Iceland to consider ratifying the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>693. The Republic of Moldova expressed its appreciation to Iceland for having accepted 
the six recommendations that it had made during Iceland&#8217;s review. It welcomed Iceland&#8217;s 
commitment to establishing a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris 
Principles, and was pleased to note that Iceland had taken measures to eliminate 
stereotypical attitudes about the roles and responsibilities of women and men. The Republic 
of Moldova noted, with satisfaction, the steps taken to strengthen efforts to increase the 
number of women in high-ranking positions, particularly in academia, and welcomed the 
use of temporary special measures to encourage the achievement of substantive equality 
between men and women, particularly in the private employment sector. It applauded 
Iceland&#8217;s commitment to eliminate the obstacles faced by women victims of domestic and 
sexual violence when filing complaints and seeking protection, and was pleased to note that 
the State had increased efforts to prevent trafficking in human beings for sexual 
exploitation, including child prostitution. 
</p>
<p>694. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern at the absence of an authority to 
monitor violence and sexual abuse against children, rising incidents of racism and 
xenophobia, prison conditions, gender-based violence, and lenient sentences in cases of 
domestic violence. It recommended the strengthening of efforts in combating racism and 
xenophobia; the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation; strengthening the protection 
framework for the rights of the child; and the introduction of more effective measures 
addressing domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>695. Austria commended Iceland for its constructive participation in the universal 
periodic review process, which Austria was able to witness as a member of the troika. It 
also expressed its appreciation to Iceland for the large number of recommendations 
accepted and welcomed the fact that Iceland had made voluntary commitments regarding </p>


<p><b>238</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the recommendations. It looked forward to the implementation of the 
voluntary commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>696. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit (COC 
Netherlands) and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association 
(ILGA-Europe) recognized Iceland&#8217;s adoption of a neutral definition of marriage, thereby 
granting the same legal status for heterosexual and same-sex married couples. Iceland had 
taken important steps to improve the legal status of transgender people, and efforts had 
been made to simplify name and gender recognition. COC Netherlands and ILGA-Europe 
sought clarification on the time frame envisaged for the introduction and implementation of 
the necessary legislation. They also requested information on the steps planned to advance 
non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. They 
encouraged Iceland to share its best practices with other countries in combating 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. They also urged 
Iceland to consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International 
Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as a guide for 
policy developments. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>697. The delegation, on behalf of the Government of Iceland, thanked the speakers for 
their views and comments, which would be recorded as part of Iceland&#8217;s first universal 
periodic review. It reiterated that the review was an important opportunity for the 
Government to reflect on the human rights situation in Iceland and an important reminder 
that more could be achieved in the areas of human rights, equality and opportunity. 
</p>
<p>698. While Iceland was proud of the progress already made, it saw the universal periodic 
review as an opportunity to improve. Preparing for Iceland&#8217;s first review had provided the 
opportunity to reflect upon how best to protect and promote human rights, for which the 
delegation conveyed the appreciation of the Government of Iceland. 
</p>
<p>699. The delegation concluded its statement by thanking those who had participated in 
Iceland&#8217;s first review. It hoped that the responses provided had demonstrated Iceland&#8217;s 
ongoing commitment to multilateral engagement, human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Zimbabwe 
</b></p>
<p>700. The review of Zimbabwe was held on 10 October 2011 in conformity with all 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Zimbabwe in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/3). 
</p><p>701. At its 40th meeting, on 15 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Zimbabwe (see section C below). 
702. The outcome of the review of Zimbabwe comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/14), the views of Zimbabwe concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>239 
</b></p>
<p>before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>703. Zimbabwe recalled that a total of 177 recommendations had been made. Of the 177 
recommendations, it had accepted 81, 65 did not receive its support and it undertook to 
consider 31 and provide responses thereto prior to or during the nineteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>704. Zimbabwe had had the opportunity to examine the recommendations and was 
pleased to report that, of the 65 recommendations that had not received its support, a total 
of 20 had been accepted, leaving the number of those that did not receive its support at 45. 
The recommendations that had not enjoyed the support of Zimbabwe but were subsequently 
accepted related to the Human Rights Commission, the criminalization of torture, the 
submission of periodic reports to treaty bodies, cooperation with the United Nations special 
procedures, the prevention of politically motivated violence and intimidation, the 
monitoring of places of detention, the ratification of the Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocols to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as equality between men 
and women, including parents and property rights. 
</p>
<p>705. Zimbabwe had also had the opportunity to examine 31 recommendations, which it 
had undertaken to consider and to provide responses. It was pleased to report that all the 
recommendations were then accepted except two. 
</p>
<p>706. The first recommendation that did not enjoy the support of Zimbabwe was to set a 
higher age of criminal responsibility for children and to take all necessary measures to 
establish a specialized juvenile justice system, where children were treated in accordance 
with the principle of the best interests of the child. Zimbabwe explained that the Criminal 
Law (Codification and Reform) Act provided that children under the age of 7 lacked 
criminal capacity and should not be tried or convicted of any crime, while children between 
the ages of 7 and 14 were presumed to lack the capacity to form the intention to commit a 
crime. This recommendation did not enjoy the support of Zimbabwe because children under 
the age of 12 were committing such serious offences as rape. Nevertheless, Zimbabwe had 
in place a pretrial diversion programme for juvenile offenders and the victim-friendly court 
system. These ensured that the principle of the best interests of the child was observed. A 
legal assistance programme to provide children with all forms of legal assistance was in the 
process of being formulated. Moreover, the courts, when adjudicating on cases involving 
juveniles, took into account the fact that the principle of the best interests of the child was 
paramount. 
</p>
<p>707. The second recommendation that did not enjoy the support of Zimbabwe was to 
amend expeditiously the Births and Deaths Registration Act to ensure that all children born 
in Zimbabwe, regardless of their parents&#8217; origin, were issued with birth certificates. 
Zimbabwe pointed out that there was no need to amend the Act as it sufficiently provided 
for the registration of the birth of every child born in Zimbabwe. Each child was issued 
with an appropriate birth certificate in accordance with his or her status. 
</p>
<p>708. Zimbabwe was fully committed to honouring its obligations with regard to the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Zimbabwe then confirmed that it was in line 
with that commitment that the accepted recommendations would be implemented. 
</p>
<p>709. Zimbabwe pointed out that recommendation 94.3 had been omitted in the addendum 
to the report of the Working Group. It did not support that recommendation. </p>

</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>710. Cuba noted that the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 was born from a lengthy 
struggle for democracy, justice, political freedom and self-determination. Since then, 
Zimbabwe had worked for the rights of its citizens. Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts had been restricted 
by unfair sanctions, causing the problems that the country now faced. Cuba welcomed the 
acceptance of its recommendations that Zimbabwe should continue to combat attempted 
foreign interference in domestic matters and to exercise its sovereignty and self-
determination; and that it continue positive action and programmes to guarantee quality 
health and education services, and reduce poverty. 
</p>
<p>711. Angola welcomed many reforms undertaken by Zimbabwe, particularly the creation 
of a national human rights commission, a charter of enforceable rights, and legislation to 
promote and protect human rights in the areas of education, work, health and the 
commitment to the national process to draft a new Constitution. Despite the illegal 
economic sanctions imposed on the country, Zimbabwe had launched several development 
strategies and policies, which had had an impact on the population. Angola made an appeal 
to the international community to lift unilateral sanctions and to support Zimbabwe in its 
efforts for reforms and economic recovery. 
</p>
<p>712. China noted with appreciation Zimbabwe&#8217;s investments in health and education. 
Zimbabwe had made significant progress in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, in 
increasing the rate of literacy, combating poverty, improving social security and eliminating 
discrimination against vulnerable groups. China fully understood the difficulties and 
challenges that Zimbabwe faced as a developing country in socioeconomic development 
and in the protection of human rights. China added that the sanctions imposed by certain 
countries had put a break on economic development, and called for them to be lifted. 
</p>
<p>713. Algeria stated that Zimbabwe and Algeria were linked through fraternity and 
solidarity on a historic basis, and noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s determination to emancipate itself. It 
noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s acceptance of a large number of recommendations, to which some 
others were added after they had initially been rejected. It noted with satisfaction the 
acceptance of recommendations made by Algeria with regard to continuing the process of 
national reconciliation, strengthening the representation of women in decision-making 
processes, and continued positive efforts to reduce the HIV/AIDS mortality rate. 
</p>
<p>714. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea noted that, despite the economic 
challenges arising out of illegally imposed sanctions, Zimbabwe remained committed to 
promoting and protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of its people, as enshrined in 
its Constitution and international conventions, and to participating actively in international 
human rights forums. It highly appreciated the positive steps taken by the Government to 
build a united, strong, democratic and prosperous nation with a high quality of life for all 
by 2020. Zimbabwe&#8217;s commitments and positive efforts to promote and protect human 
rights were appreciated. 
</p>
<p>715. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts in the area of 
social rights, particularly in the field of health, education and assistance to the elderly, 
where the Government was promoting the programme to assist the neediest elderly persons, 
providing monthly pensions, and exonerating them from payments for medical services in 
State institutions. It also noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s important efforts to promote and protect human 
rights, despite the major economic difficulties caused by illegal sanctions imposed by 
developed countries. 
</p>
<p>716. Morocco noted with satisfaction the measures taken for the protection and 
promotion of human rights, and encouraged Zimbabwe to continue along that path. 
Morocco was pleased that the six recommendations it made had been accepted, and wished </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>241 
</b></p>
<p>Zimbabwe success in their implementation. Morocco encouraged Zimbabwe to continue 
with its decision to draw up a national human rights plan of action on the implementation of 
accepted recommendations in partnership with stakeholders, who would assist the 
Government to comply with its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>717. South Africa commended Zimbabwe for all its efforts aimed at attaining the 
Millennium Development Goals in the education and health sectors, and underscored the 
need to lift crippling sanctions and to provide technical assistance and capacity-building 
through various means. It acknowledged the role of the Parliament&#8217;s Thematic Committee 
on Human Rights and of the Zimbabwean Commission on Human Rights. It encouraged 
Zimbabwe to continue its efforts to strengthen these institutions, its programmes aimed at 
poverty eradication, to end gender discrimination, as well as its integrated child protection 
strategies. It wished Zimbabwe well in its constitutional review process and with the 
implementation of the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>718. The United States of America welcomed Zimbabwe&#8217;s decision to adopt the 
recommendation on operationalizing the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. It 
remained deeply concerned about the ongoing lack of human rights protection in 
Zimbabwe. It strongly urged the Government to reconsider many of the recommendations 
that it had declined to support, including to implement fully the Global Political Agreement, 
to repeal or amend the restrictive Public Order and Security Act and the Access to 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act; to invite the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other mandate holders; and to create stronger mechanisms to ensure greater revenue 
transparency from diamond mining, to demilitarize the diamond industry and thoroughly 
investigate cases of beatings and abuse by Government and private security services in the 
Marange area. It urged Zimbabwe to reconsider its decision not to support the 
recommendation to investigate all credible allegations relating to the presidential elections 
of 2008. This was considered important to prevent a recurrence of political violence during 
the next round of elections. 
</p>
<p>719. Belarus stated that the universal periodic review made it possible to evaluate 
Zimbabwe&#8217;s successes in implementing economic, social and cultural rights and improving 
its national legislation. Belarus noted with satisfaction Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts to reduce 
poverty, to combat various different pandemics, to ensure universal national education and 
also to combat trafficking. It shared Zimbabwe&#8217;s concern with regard to the destructive 
influence on the enjoyment of human rights of unilateral coercive measures adopted by 
certain Western countries against the people of Zimbabwe. Such measures should be 
immediately and irrevocably revoked because they were being applied illegally, in violation 
of international law. 
</p>
<p>720. Chad noted with satisfaction that Zimbabwe had accepted a large number of 
recommendations, including the recommendations made by Chad. Given the fact that 
Zimbabwe had accepted a good number of recommendations, the international community 
should provide it with the necessary financial and technical assistance so that it could 
benefit from the experience of others and also be able to address the challenges that it faces 
in the area of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>721. CIVICUS welcomed Zimbabwe&#8217;s decision to accept most recommendations and its 
commitment to engage civil society in its follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
CIVICUS was concerned that Zimbabwe had rejected recommendations relating to the 
reform of laws that curtailed civil liberties and freedoms and the need to address impunity, 
including for investigation of the 2008 electoral violence and bringing to account all 
perpetrators. Additionally, the Government should address the ongoing harassment of 
human rights defenders. CIVICUS called upon the Human Rights Council to urge </p>


<p><b>242</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>Zimbabwe to adopt all necessary measures to address those issues in order to ensure that 
the upcoming elections were free, fair and credible. 
</p>
<p>722. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit (COC 
Nederland) and Action Canada for Population and Development, in a joint statement, stated 
that the Sexual Rights Initiative, a coalition of organizations, was deeply concerned about 
the outright rejection of the constitutional protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual 
and intersex persons. They encouraged Zimbabwe to cease any State-sponsored or State-
condoned attacks on the lives of persons based on their sexual orientation or gender 
identity, and to ensure that all such attacks were investigated, and that those affected had 
access to justice. 
</p><p>723. Human Rights Watch regretted that Zimbabwe had rejected recommendations on 
ensuring the rule of law and respect for human rights, ending impunity, putting an end to all 
forms of intimidation, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention and torture against all 
persons, particularly human rights defenders, political activists and journalists; reform of 
the security sector; ensuring independence of the judiciary; and repealing or amending 
repressive laws. It also regretted that Zimbabwe had rejected crucial recommendations to 
investigate allegations of violations, and made particular reference to reported abuses in the 
2002, 2005 and 2008 elections and under the violent land reform programme. 
</p>
<p>724. The International Commission of Jurists stated that, two years after the signing of 
the Global Political Agreement, human rights remained largely unprotected owing to a lack 
of respect for the rule of law and the regular abuse of power by police, army and other 
government officials. It urged Zimbabwe to halt the repression of legitimate activities by 
lawyers, journalists, human rights defenders and political opponents; to ratify the Rome 
Statute; and to undertake effective legal and judicial reforms necessary for independent and 
effective investigation and prosecution of gross human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>725. United Nations Watch profoundly regretted that the people of Zimbabwe had 
continued to face many of the same violations of their basic human rights as in 2005. The 
Government continued to deny its citizens the minimal guarantees of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. It questioned information contained in the national report 
according to which the Government had provided independent institutions with legislation 
and policy frameworks aimed at protecting and promoting the human rights of its people; 
that the ratification of the Convention against Torture was under active consideration; and 
that Zimbabwean laws limiting basic civil liberties were fair and constitutional mechanisms 
to regulate the conduct of meetings in a democratic State. 
</p>
<p>726. Save the Children International called on Zimbabwe to ensure timely and 
appropriate support for child victims of abuse, to strengthen coordination mechanisms in 
responding to child abuse cases and to conduct prevention programmes through the 
Zimbabwe Republic Police. Concerning the issuance of birth certificates, it called on 
Zimbabwe to amend legislation and to put an end to the problem of stateless children. With 
regard to improving the quality of education, it called on Zimbabwe to demonstrate its 
commitment through plans of action and budgetary allocations to reach the poorest and 
most vulnerable children. 
</p>
<p>727. The Marist International Solidarity Foundation ONLUS and Franciscans 
International, in a joint statement, commented on the right to quality education for every 
child in Zimbabwe. While welcoming Zimbabwe&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations, they 
were concerned about the limited scope of the school curriculum as a major cause for 
school dropout rates and that access to compulsory basic education was limited owing to 
the obligation to pay tuition fees and a development fee in many schools. They called on 
Zimbabwe to significantly increase its education budget. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>243 
</b></p>
<p>728. Verein Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik expressed its profound concern relating to the 
recommendations rejected by Zimbabwe. It encouraged Zimbabwe to ratify as soon as 
possible the Convention against Torture, to transpose the provisions therein into its national 
legislation, and to take immediate and tangible measures to stop the practice of torture. It 
called on Zimbabwe to ratify the Rome Statute and to implement a moratorium on 
executions with a view to abolishing capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>729. Amnesty International welcomed Zimbabwe&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations to 
ensure the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission was compliant with the Paris Principles. 
It was disappointed that Zimbabwe had rejected recommendations to review and amend the 
Public Order and Security Act. Allegedly, police routinely misused the Act to block 
meetings of critics of ZANU-PF, and repressive legislation was used to criminalize the 
rights to freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly. It was dismayed that 
Zimbabwe had rejected the recommendation to investigate reports of human rights 
violations relating to the presidential elections held in 2008, when at least 200 people were 
killed and around 10,000 were injured, most of whom were supporters of the former 
opposition parties. 
</p>
<p>730. Rencontre africane pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the creation of 
a human rights commission and the national policies to promote gender equality and to 
combat domestic violence. Main perpetrators of the violence during the 2008 elections, 
however, still enjoyed impunity. It encouraged Zimbabwe to prepare conditions so that the 
upcoming elections would be conducted in a calm, transparent and free climate. It was also 
concerned at how the press exercised its activities, and encouraged Zimbabwe to improve 
the situation to guarantee freedom of expression and to promote plurality in the media. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>731. Zimbabwe thanked Member States for their statements. It responded to the statement 
made by the United States of America. Zimbabwe posed no threat to the interests of the 
United States, be they political, military, economic or otherwise. The United States of 
America was a powerful State and the sole super-Power; the delegation therefore did not 
understand why it continued to mischaracterize and misrepresent the human rights situation 
in Zimbabwe and to target a small peace-loving country like Zimbabwe with economic 
sanctions, and also by continuing to undermine its internal processes. Zimbabwe&#8217;s crime, if 
a crime it was, was its desire to be in charge of its destiny, to determine its destiny, to have 
control over its resources and to pursue an independent foreign policy in defence of its 
interests. It underscored the fact that the Global Political Agreement was an internal 
document and its implementation was the responsibility of the three political parties that 
were signatories to it. With regard to the Public Order and Security Act, Zimbabwe wanted 
it to be known that the current Act was the outcome of negotiations among the three 
political parties, signatories to the Global Political Agreement and was, in effect, copied 
from South African security legislation. The Access to Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act was similarly a product of inter-party negotiation. The delegation also did not 
understand the reference made by the United States to demilitarize the diamond industry. It 
recalled that the United States, as the current chair of the Kimberly Process Certification 
Scheme, had chaired the meeting that cleared Zimbabwe diamonds for sale internationally. 
The statement by the United States on the diamonds issue indicated that the left hand did 
not know what the right hand was doing. 
</p>
<p>732. Zimbabwe informed the Human Rights Council that a plan of action and a strategy 
for implementing accepted recommendations was being prepared in consultation with 
stakeholders, including civil society. Zimbabwe also underlined the continuous support of 
the United Nations family, in particular the technical and financial assistance provided by 
UNDP during its universal periodic review. UNDP had also made a commitment to assist </p>


<p><b>244</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>Zimbabwe in the preparation of the plan of action and the strategy for implementing the 
accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>733. Zimbabwe acknowledged the important role played by the community of non-
governmental organizations in the launch of its report as well as in its subsequent 
validation. It hoped that those same organizations would work with the Government and 
other stakeholders in the implementation of the recommendations that had emerged from 
this process. Zimbabwe committed itself to working and cooperating fully with all non-
governmental organizations that were genuinely pursuing the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the country and had not joined the bandwagon of the regime-change 
agenda. Zimbabwe lastly thanked all Member and observer States for their constructive 
engagement. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lithuania 
</b></p>
<p>734. The review of Lithuania was held on 11 October 2011 in conformity with all 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Lithuania in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/LTU/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/LTU/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/LTU/3). 
</p><p>735. At its 41st meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Lithuania (see section C below). 
736. The outcome of the review of Lithuania comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/15), the views of Lithuania concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/LTU/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>737. The head of the delegation of Lithuania expressed its appreciation for the valuable 
comments, questions and recommendations made by numerous States during the universal 
periodic review of Lithuania. Lithuania had received a total of 119 recommendations, and 
had accepted the majority of them. 
</p><p>738. The recommendations received covered a broad spectrum of issues. A number of 
recommendations addressed the need to strengthen the protection of persons belonging to 
vulnerable groups or persons in vulnerable situations. Notably, those were 
recommendations to strengthen the protection of persons belonging to groups defined by 
the criteria of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or age. A need for further 
legislative and policy measures was mentioned in this respect. The promotion of diversity, 
tolerance and harmony while fighting intolerance was the gist of these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>739. Another group of recommendations covered the issue of the need to strengthen the 
domestic institutional system for the protection of human rights by ensuring, inter alia, even 
closer cooperation with civil society on human rights-related issues. Certain 
recommendations indicated the need for specific actions by such domestic institutions to </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>245 
</b></p>
<p>ensure the monitoring and continuing implementation of various specific governmental 
policies and strategies. 
</p>
<p>740. Yet another group of recommendations encouraged Lithuania to assume further 
international obligations under human rights treaties, which would both advance the 
protection and promotion of human rights at the domestic level and add an additional 
element to a constructive dialogue with the treaty-monitoring bodies. Lithuania also 
referred to recommendations to strengthen support for international human rights defenders 
and activists. 
</p>
<p>741. Lithuania had made every effort to consider the recommendations received in an 
open-minded and constructive manner. Lithuania&#8217;s position regarding the majority of the 
recommendations had been presented at the session of the Working Group. Lithuania&#8217;s 
position regarding the remaining recommendations was presented in an addendum to the 
report (A/HRC/19/15/Add.1). With regard to recommendations that Lithuania was not able 
to support, the delegation noted that this was largely due to either limited resources or an 
ongoing debate on the way in which certain rights should be implemented in a specific 
context, particularly where competing human rights-based claims were identified. 
Nevertheless, Lithuania saw some of them as indications of possible ways of addressing 
certain human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>742. The delegation noted that the domestic discussion in connection with the preparation 
of Lithuania&#8217;s report, the consideration of the recommendations received and the 
elaboration of related implementation plans had proved to be an effective trigger for the 
development of further legislation, policies and practices that would help it to advance in 
the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>743. The initial cycle of the universal periodic review was the start of a procedure that 
would be instrumental in consolidating the performance of all States in the field of their 
human rights obligations. On its part, Lithuania stressed that the universal periodic review 
process had highlighted certain common issues that may arise in different States in different 
forms, but essentially required the same solutions. The creation of effective national human 
rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles was one such issue. Lithuania 
would certainly draw inspiration from the experience of other States, as expressed in their 
comments and recommendations; their institutions were a valuable tool in the perpetual 
struggle for the full respect, protection and implementation of everyone&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>744. Lithuania highly valued its cooperation with the United Nations human rights bodies 
and procedures. Specifically, it took the universal periodic review as an opportunity to learn 
from others and to reflect. The delegation reiterated its most favourable assessment of this 
form of cooperation within the United Nations and their readiness to both contribute to and 
benefit from this interaction with States Members of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>745. To conclude, the delegation commended the members of the troika, namely the 
Congo, Norway and Qatar, charged with the task of managing the universal periodic review 
of Lithuania, and also the secretariat for its solid, competent and efficient performance. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>746. The Russian Federation welcomed Lithuania&#8217;s support for three of its 
recommendations. It regretted, however, that the only recommendation that Lithuania did 
not support was its appeal to cease all attempts to revise the outcome of the Second World 
War and to glorify Nazi accomplices. It noted that Lithuania had supported another 
recommendation that condemned the opening of the streets of Vilnius to the annual neo-
Nazis march. Every year, on Hitler&#8217;s birthday, the tombs of Soviet soldiers and victims of 
the Holocaust were desecrated while followers display Nazi flags and symbols. The </p>


<p><b>246</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation called upon Lithuania to take measures to put an end to such 
manifestations of neo-Nazism, racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>747. The Republic of Moldova commended Lithuania for its commitment to reinforce 
human rights education, for the measures aimed at improving mechanisms for human rights 
protection, for promoting gender equality, and for combating domestic violence against 
women and trafficking in human beings. It took note with satisfaction of the measures to 
eliminate patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes regarding the role and responsibilities of 
women and men. The Republic of Moldova was pleased to note that Lithuania had 
supported all five of its recommendations, and acknowledged the steps taken to establish a 
coordinating human rights council, as a part of the Ombudsman institution, to ensure 
compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>748. Estonia noted that Lithuania had ratified the core international human rights treaties 
and fully cooperated with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It was 
pleased to note that Lithuania had already implemented, or was in the process of 
implementing, most of the recommendations made during the review. The creation of a 
modern institutional system for human rights in such a short period as 20 years was a 
substantial achievement. Lithuania had also adopted new laws, and introduced a human 
rights culture in the country and a human rights-integrated approach into all its policies. 
Estonia noted that Lithuania had made specific achievements in promoting gender equality, 
combating violence against women and integrating persons with disabilities into society. 
</p>
<p>749. Algeria encouraged Lithuania to intensify its efforts to combat unemployment in the 
light of the economic crisis currently affecting Europe. Algeria was pleased to note that its 
recommendations on the reinforcement of the ombudsman on equal opportunities, on taking 
appropriate measures to ensure equality between men and women in the labour market, and 
on upgrading of the participation of women in public life had been supported by Lithuania. 
Algeria encouraged Lithuania to increase its efforts to improve prison conditions. Lastly, 
Algeria would have liked to see Lithuania support its recommendation on the ratification of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>750. The Islamic Republic of Iran remained concerned at the persistence of xenophobic 
acts and practices of racial segregation; of discrimination against the Roma community and 
racist violence and hate speech against non-European minorities; of the excessive use of 
force by law enforcement officials; and prison conditions, in particular overcrowding and 
the length of pretrial detention. Lithuania should implement policies and actions aimed at 
the effective integration of the Roma community, including employment, education, 
security, health, use of the Roma language, school attendance by Roma pupils and the 
regularization of identity documents. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>751. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC 
Nederland commended Lithuania for supporting recommendations to combat 
discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, ensure full 
respect for freedom of expression and assembly for all, and prevent and prosecute all forms 
of violence and harassment related to sexual orientation and gender identity. It was 
concerned at a proposed amendment to the Constitution defining the concept of family as 
based on heterosexual marriage, and recommended that Lithuania ensure equal rights 
between same-sex and opposite sex couples in its legislation, for example by introducing 
the possibility of partnership registration. It noted that the Law on the Protection of Minors 
from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information set out in itself a message that 
contributed to the stigma of and discrimination against LGBT persons. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>247 
</b></p>
<p>752. Amnesty International welcomed Lithuania&#8217;s support for recommendations to 
protect LGBT persons from discrimination, and to refrain from violating their right to 
freedom of expression and from criminalizing homosexual relations. It welcomed 
Lithuania&#8217;s support for the recommendation to investigate the human rights implications of 
counter-terrorism measures, such as secret detention programmes, and urged the 
Government to cooperate fully with the European Parliament initiative investigating the 
alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
</p>
<p>753. Action Canada for Population and Development, the Sexual Rights Initiative and the 
Family Planning and Sexual Health Association of Lithuania welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
pledge to make a range of affordable contraceptives more widely available, and to improve 
awareness about family planning among women and men. They also welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s support for the recommendation regarding the implementation of mandatory 
sex education in schools and urged the Government to consider integrating the UNESCO 
International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education into a national programme. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>754. During its concluding remarks, Lithuania wished to clarify that the Lithuanian 
authorities never had nor would condone Nazism or its ideology.  
</p>
<p>755. As a democratic country based on the rule of law, Lithuania took steps to ensure that 
guaranteeing the fundamental principles of freedom of expression, freedom of information, 
freedom of assembly and freedom of association on the one hand, and applying all the 
necessary measures and relevant legislation to combat racism, intolerance and 
discrimination on the other, went hand in hand &#8211; systematically, promptly and vigorously, 
and in full compliance with international standards. In addition, every criminal act must be 
investigated and Lithuania would prosecute all those guilty of such acts. 
</p>
<p>756. Furthermore, Lithuania noted that, like many other States, it had developed and 
implemented its own educational programmes and projects aimed at promoting tolerance 
and combating racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>757. Lithuania considered that the remarks on history made during the meeting went 
beyond established facts, and also beyond the aims and tasks of the universal periodic 
review process. Lithuania had never attempted to revise history and believed that an honest, 
thorough debate in other forums on history would facilitate reconciliation based on truth 
and remembrance. 
</p>
<p>758. Lithuania thanked the delegations for their comments, noting that the comments that 
fell within the purview of the Human Rights Council would be brought to the attention of 
relevant authorities, and would be taken into account while preparing the report at the 
second cycle. 
</p>
<p>759. Lithuania added that it had taken note of two recommendations (90.12 and 90.21) 
for which it was currently unable to provide a final response. 
</p>
<p><b>  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>760. The review of Uganda was held on 11 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Uganda in accordance with the annex to

</p><p>761. At its 41st meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Uganda (see section C below). 
762. The outcome of the review of Uganda comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/16), the views of Uganda concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/16/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>763. Uganda extended its appreciation to all member States and civil society 
organizations for their positive recommendations, to which it would pay utmost attention. 
During the universal periodic review, Uganda had received 171 recommendations. It had 
accepted 110, had not supported 19 and had deferred 42 for further consideration. 
Numerous consultative processes had been conducted on the 42 deferred recommendations, 
which culminated in a validation workshop held on 23 February 2012. 
</p>
<p>764. The 110 recommendations accepted were in accordance with the national priorities 
of Uganda, which was in the process of implementing the vast majority of them. Uganda 
was a signatory to all major international human rights instruments, and the rights 
contained therein were, for the most part, justiciable in its domestic courts. 
</p><p>765. Some recommendations contravened constitutional and other laws and had therefore 
been rejected. Nevertheless, Uganda would continue to review its position on all issues with 
a view to issuing an amendment as necessary. 
</p>
<p>766. Uganda recalled that the consultative processes held between 1989 and 2006 had not 
supported the recommendation regarding the abolition of the death penalty. The Supreme 
Court of Uganda had ruled however, that, after three years, a death sentence that had not 
been executed would be automatically commuted to life imprisonment, without remission. 
There has been no enforcement of this penalty since the turn of the century. 
</p>
<p>767. With regard to recommendations on ratifying the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture bill of 2012 
incorporated important provisions of the Convention. The bill was before the Committee on 
Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, for further consultation. It imposed individual 
responsibility for perpetrators of acts of torture. 
</p>
<p>768. Uganda had accepted the recommendation that it should ratify the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and 
pointed out its long-standing legal framework for affirmative action. 
</p>
<p>769. Uganda had accepted the recommendations on domestic relations, and informed the 
Human Rights Council that the Marriage and Divorce bill was before the relevant 
parliamentary committee for scrutiny. The bill dealt with marital rights and duties, 
cohabitation, separation and property rights. 
</p>
<p>770. Uganda sympathized with the recommendation on the issue of enforced 
disappearances, as it resonated with its past, and the period from 1970 to 1985 in particular. 
Uganda stated, however, that the issue did not apply to its national context. It would </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>249 
</b></p>
<p>nonetheless study the issue further with a view to providing a remedy where the situation 
arose and merited consideration. 
</p>
<p>771. Regarding recommendations on access to the Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness, Uganda pointed out that the Convention had been ratified by only 42 States 
and its provisions were not entirely in conformity with the Constitution and laws of Uganda 
relating to the acquisition of nationality. 
</p>
<p>772. Uganda had accepted the recommendations that the Public Order Management bill 
should be brought into line with international human rights instruments, and that it had been 
withdrawn for further consultations. 
</p>
<p>773. Uganda had accepted the recommendation on aligning its policies to the African 
Union policy framework aimed at ensuring access to land and water for pastoralists, and 
referred to the ongoing cooperation between local districts and with Kenya. 
</p>
<p>774. Regarding the recommendation of issuing standing invitations to special procedures 
mandate holders, Uganda would continue to consider requests for country visits on a case-
by-case basis. It reiterated that equal attention should be given to economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>775. Regarding the proposed legislation on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons, Uganda had the position that it was a private member&#8217;s bill, as 
provided for under its Constitution. 
</p>
<p>776. Uganda had accepted recommendations aimed at setting up mechanisms and taking 
measures to prevent the exploitation of children, in accordance with its commitments under 
ILO conventions. 
</p>
<p>777. Lastly, with regard to the recommendation that the State should increase health 
spending to 15 per cent of government budgetary allocation, Uganda subscribed to the 
Abuja Declaration and was working steadily towards the achievement of that target. 
</p><p>778. In conclusion, Uganda appreciated the opportunity afforded to share its best 
practices and to consider its challenges. It was proud of its achievements, and looked 
forward to the opportunity to present its midterm progress report. Uganda had made 
voluntary pledges and commitments, and reported that a standing interministerial 
committee had been established and was in the process of formulating a national plan of 
action and a road map. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>779. Cuba was pleased that Uganda had accepted the two recommendations that it had 
made on socioeconomic development, as well as with regard to the progress made in 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals and in establishing a health programme to 
treat a number of diseases. In spite of the unprecedented world economic crisis, Uganda has 
progressed in its socioeconomic development and increased the enjoyment of human rights 
of its people. Cuba was pleased with Uganda&#8217;s development of infrastructure to achieve a 
better standard of living for its people. 
</p>
<p>780. Chad noted with satisfaction that, to prepare its national report, Uganda had engaged 
in dialogue with all stakeholders in a constructive spirit, which demonstrated the 
commitment of Uganda to the promotion and protection of human rights. Chad commended 
Uganda for having accepted most recommendations made during its review, including 
those made by Chad. It encouraged Uganda to request technical and financial assistance 
from the international community to implement the recommendations accepted. </p>


<p><b>250</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>781. Morocco was pleased with Uganda&#8217;s excellent cooperation with the universal 
periodic review mechanism. It encouraged Uganda to continue with its cooperation with 
international human rights bodies. It was pleased that Uganda had taken up the commitment 
to combat poverty, especially in rural areas. Uganda would need to effectively implement 
all of the programmes taken up in this regard. Morocco was pleased that Uganda had 
accepted 151 of the 170 recommendations made during the review, and that it had accepted 
the recommendation made by Morocco relating to education. It congratulated Uganda on its 
spirit of openness, which had taken the shape of a large number of voluntary commitments 
in its national report. 
</p>
<p>782. Botswana welcomed Uganda&#8217;s decision to accept a significant number of 
recommendations. It commended Uganda for its openness to dialogue and constructive 
cooperation during the review, which demonstrated its commitment to improvement in its 
human rights records. Botswana noted and expressed its support for the progressive 
measures already being taken regarding both institution-building and legislative reform. 
Botswana was encouraged by the acceptance of recommendations aimed at guaranteeing 
the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and at advancing the realization of 
the Millennium Development Goals. Botswana called on the international community to 
support Uganda. 
</p>
<p>783. UNICEF congratulated Uganda on its efforts to reduce poverty and to achieve 
equality in enrolment in primary school education, in accordance with the Millennium 
Development Goals. It welcomed Uganda&#8217;s decision to permit girls who fell pregnant 
during school term to sit their year-end examinations, and encouraged the creation of a 
policy on the re-entry of pregnant girls and child mothers into the school system. UNICEF 
called on Uganda to prioritize the approval of the draft Child Act. It urged Uganda to 
concentrate its efforts on ensuring the conditions for the Global Partnership for Education 
grant were met to aid the attainment of the Education for All goals. 
</p>
<p>784. Algeria noted with satisfaction the measures taken and efforts made by Uganda to 
improve living conditions and the enjoyment of human rights by all citizens. Algeria 
appreciated the acceptance of its recommendations relating to the implementation of the 
national development plan to reduce maternal mortality; to improving living conditions for 
persons with disabilities; to addressing the high cost of justice, especially in poor and rural 
areas; and to consolidating inter-ethnic harmony. Uganda faced various forms of constraints 
in the implementation of human rights, particularly in terms of human and financial 
resources. Algeria therefore called for adequate assistance to be given to Uganda. 
</p>
<p>785. Kenya noted the important measures that Uganda had taken to protect and promote 
human rights. Of particular interest was Uganda&#8217;s ratification of core human rights 
instruments and the steps taken to enact them. Kenya also welcomed Uganda&#8217;s 
strengthening of the human rights infrastructure, including the establishment and 
facilitation of an A-status human rights commission. 
</p>
<p>786. The United Republic of Tanzania applauded several policies and legal and 
administrative measures taken by Uganda relating to the human rights of women, children, 
youth and elderly persons. It was pleased to note the acceptance of its recommendation, as 
well as the voluntary commitments to mainstream human rights into all aspects of 
governance, and to include human rights in the education curriculum of schools. It noted 
such measures as the establishment of a cabinet subcommittee, and a desk to provide 
oversight and guidance, and to coordinate human rights issues at the national level. It urged 
the international community to assist Uganda. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>251 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>787. The Uganda Human Rights Commission commended Uganda for the consultative 
process that underpinned its universal periodic review. The Commission urged the State to 
implement the outcomes from the review and added that it was important to develop a 
national plan of action on human rights that would incorporate them. Some of the 
provisions of the anti-homosexuality bill were in violation of international human rights 
standards; instead of a new bill, existing legislation should be strengthened to address 
same-sex rape and abuse. It urged Uganda to hold accountable those alleged perpetrators 
from the now disbanded Rapid Response Unit in the Uganda Police Force, and to ensure 
that the police respected human rights during rallies. 
</p>
<p>788. Human Rights Watch welcomed the commitment to adopt a national human rights 
plan of action, to establish a human rights desk, and to mainstream rights training for 
security agencies. It urged Uganda to take concrete actions to address impunity and poor 
legislative proposals. It welcomed the acceptance of recommendations to investigate the 
use of excessive force and incidents of torture, and to prosecute and punish the perpetrators. 
Financial compensation is not a sufficient remedy. Human Rights Watch regretted that 
Uganda had categorically refuted the existence and use of &#8220;safe houses&#8221;. It urged Uganda to 
ensure respect for freedom of expression and assembly, and to withdraw its pending public 
order management bill, to invite the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to take specific steps to ensure that the 
anti-homosexuality bill did not pass in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>789. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed its concern over Uganda&#8217;s 
rejection of some recommendations regarding LGBT persons. While accepting 
recommendations to prosecute attacks against LGBT persons, Uganda had rejected those 
recommendations that addressed the root causes of these violations. The Network requested 
information on the specific measures that Uganda intended to take to protect LGBT 
persons. It referred to the reintroduction of the anti-homosexuality bill in Parliament and to 
the shutting down of a workshop on the human rights of LGBT persons a week later by the 
Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity, and also requested information on how Uganda 
planned to respect the rights of sexual minorities. 
</p>
<p>790. The International Commission of Jurists emphasized that the unlawful use of lethal 
force against the peaceful exercise of rights and freedoms, together with the arbitrary arrest 
and harassment of political opponents and human rights defenders, continued to pose a 
threat to the rule of law and respect for human rights in Uganda. It urged Uganda to protect 
the legitimate exercise of freedoms of assembly, association and expression, to ensure that 
the anti-homosexuality bill was not adopted into law, to stop the use of military courts to try 
civilian suspects, to ensure compliance by security and prosecutorial officials with fair trial 
standards, and to end impunity for gross human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>791. The Foundation for Human Rights Initiative and the International Federation for 
Human Rights commended Uganda for having established a cabinet subcommittee to 
provide policy oversight and guidance on human rights issues. They urged Uganda to ratify 
the Second Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights 
and to amend the Constitution to abolish the death penalty. They stated that Uganda was yet 
to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, and called for the 
incorporation into law of the 2010 Prevention and Prohibition of Torture Bill. They 
expressed their concern about freedom of speech and assembly, and the discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. They called on Uganda to reconsider its 
position on all the recommendations that it had rejected. 
</p><p>792. World Vision International and Franciscans International urged Uganda to improve 
the situation for newborn and child mortality rates. They emphasized the continuing </p>


<p><b>252</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>barriers to access to health care. Owing to corruption in the health sector, there was 
persistent theft of many drugs, the administration of expired drugs, abuse of patients and 
impunity of those involved. They strongly urged Uganda to accept the recommendations on 
raising the health budget, and called upon it to implement the existing health-related policy 
and legal framework for strengthening the health system. 
</p>
<p>793. Save the Children, on behalf of the Uganda Child Rights NGO Network, 
commended Uganda for having established the policy, legislative and institutional 
frameworks for the implementation of child rights initiatives, but expressed its regret at the 
chronic underfunding for their implementation. It called on Uganda to allocate sufficient 
resources to maternal and child health, to put in place comprehensive and efficient 
measures for the prevention and combating economic exploitation of children, and to 
implement the universal periodic review recommendations on the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>794. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme commended Uganda for 
the consultations with various actors of civil society in the universal periodic review 
process. It welcomed the efforts with regard to gender equality, and appreciated the recent 
laws passed to combat domestic violence. It remained concerned about reports of torture by 
security agencies, and that Uganda still had not incorporated the Convention against 
Torture into domestic law. It urged Uganda to provide human rights education to police and 
security forces, and to reform its penal code, which currently allows prosecutions and 
convictions motivated by sexual orientation. It urged the Government to revise its 2010 bill 
on press and journalists. It saluted the achievement of A status by the Uganda Human 
Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>795. CIVICUS, HURINET-U and members of the civil society stakeholders&#8217; forum on 
the universal periodic review in Uganda stated that Uganda should reconsider its decision 
not to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteurs on promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and on the right to peaceful assembly and 
association. Uganda should investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of human rights 
abuses during the riots of September 2009 and the Walk to Work demonstrations of 2011. 
They called on Uganda to ratify and enact the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Uganda should ensure that proposed 
legislation did not interfere with its international human rights obligations and, in this 
regard, should set up a committee to review and redraft current bills. Uganda should pass 
the torture bill into law and reconsider the recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>796. United Nations Watch welcomed the recommendations calling on Uganda to put an 
end to laws, policies and practices that were inconsistent with its international human rights 
obligations. It endorsed the call to refrain from enacting the proposed public order 
management bill, and to guarantee freedom of assembly. It supported calls to ease the 
heavy administrative burdens on non-governmental organizations, and to remove the Non-
Governmental Organization Board from the supervision of security agencies. United 
Nations Watch joined the calls to reject the proposed anti-homosexuality bill. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>797. Uganda thanked all States for their constructive comments and views extended to 
the Government and delegation. It thanked, in particular, UNICEF, the Save the Children 
Organization and all the other civil society organizations for their participation, and took 
note of their recommendations and concerns. Uganda looked forward to their 
implementation and to the presentation of its midterm progress report. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>253 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Timor-Leste 
</b></p>
<p>798. The review of Timor-Leste was held on 12 October 2011 in conformity with all 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Timor-Leste in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TLS/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TLS/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TLS/3 and A/HRC/WG.6/12/TLS/3/Corr.1). 
</p><p>799. At its 41st meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Timor-Leste (see section C below). 
800. The outcome of the review of Timor-Leste comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/17), the views of Timor-Leste 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/19/17/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>801. During the interactive dialogue, Timor-Leste had accepted 88 of 125 
recommendations received, and rejected 1. The decisions on 36 recommendations had been 
deferred and, after careful deliberation, the Council of Ministers had decided to accept most 
of them. Nonetheless, some recommendations had not been accepted. Timor-Leste also 
highlighted the fact that certain recommendations incorporated complex issues, and that 
Timor-Leste agreed to some parts, but not to others. 
</p>
<p>802. Timor-Leste had accepted all recommendations relating to the ratification of 
international human rights treaties. It had provided information on measures already taken 
to ensure such action and expressed the hope that the process for the ratification of these 
instruments could be finalized during the next legislative period. 
</p>
<p>803. Timor-Leste referred to recommendations 10, 11, 20 and 26 relating to the 
enactment or amendment of Timorese domestic laws. It informed the Human Rights 
Council that a bill on trafficking in persons has been submitted to the Council of Ministers, 
and that it would probably be submitted to Parliament at the beginning of the next 
legislative period. Timor-Leste also referred to the bill on the execution of penal sanctions, 
which sought to regulate, inter alia, the implementation of presidential pardons. 
</p>
<p>804. With regard to recommendations to empower the National Commission on 
Children&#8217;s Rights to receive complaints, Timor-Leste explained that efforts to strengthen 
the protection of children&#8217;s rights were focused on improving inter-agency coordination and 
the strategic implementation of multidisciplinary actions. This required the Commission to 
be incorporated into the executive structure of the Government, not separate from it. Timor-
Leste recalled that it had a national human rights institute, namely, the Provedoria de 
Direitos Humanos e Justi&#231;a, empowered to deal with complaints, including those relating to 
children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>805. Regarding the recommendation that it should repeal laws that discriminated against 
women, Timor-Leste recalled that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights and duties to 
women and men. No law was intended to discriminate on the basis of gender; existing </p>


<p><b>254</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>inequalities between women and men in Timor-Leste had not resulted from the application 
of laws. 
</p>
<p>806. Timor-Leste recalled that it was a party to several core human rights treaties, 
although it had only reported on two. Despite its enormous benefits, treaty reporting was 
quite a cumbersome exercise. Timor-Leste spoke of its ongoing efforts to meet its treaty 
reporting obligations, and that it had recently established a combined task force for treaty 
reporting under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
It also welcomed current efforts to simplify the mechanisms for treaty reporting. 
</p>
<p>807. Timor-Leste noted that several recommendations concerned the extension of a 
standing invitation to special procedures. It highlighted the fact, that since 2002, it had 
received a number of mandate holders, and had appreciated their contribution to policy 
dialogue in the country. Nonetheless, coordination was needed between the receiving State 
and the special procedures in order for country missions to be effective. For Timor-Leste, 
coordination could be guaranteed by organizing country missions on an ad hoc and case-by-
case basis. 
</p>
<p>808. Timor-Leste recalled that three recommendations related to measures on addressing 
past human rights violations, with specific reference to the follow-up to and implementation 
of the recommendations of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation and 
the Commission of Truth and Friendship. Two recommendations made by the Commission 
for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation on justice had both been implemented. 
</p><p>809. Various policies and programmes had been set up to implement other 
recommendations made by the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation 
addressed to Timor-Leste. 
</p>
<p>810. Timor-Leste was working closely with the Government of Indonesia to implement 
the recommendations of the Commission of Truth and Friendship. 
</p>
<p>811. Timor-Leste was aware of the backlog of cases in the courts and the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office. The entire justice system needed further strengthening, and measures had indeed 
been adopted to that end. Timor-Leste disagreed with claims that the backlog of cases had 
been caused by the salary levels of public prosecutors and public defenders, and did not see 
an increase in salary as a solution to the problem. 
</p>
<p>812. One recommendation had been made that the Government should strengthen its 
response to incidents of violence against members of religious minorities. Freedom of 
conscience, religion and worship was guaranteed in Timor-Leste. There had been incidents 
where problems such as those relating to claims of landownership had arisen in conflicts 
among members of communities who, in some cases, happened to profess a different faith. 
These incidents were merely criminal acts, and had been promptly investigated. Any 
attempt to depict such incidents as religious conflicts reflected a lack of knowledge of the 
real situation or a flagrant misrepresentation of facts. 
</p>
<p>813. On the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations, Timor-Leste 
explained that, despite the lack of a specific plan for their implementation, programmes 
satisfying the objectives of the recommendations accepted could be found in the National 
Strategic Development Plan for 2011&#8211;2030 and in the annual plans of different ministries. 
</p>
<p>814. Timor-Leste concluded by thanking the President of the Human Rights Council for 
her leadership, and the Members and observer States of the Human Rights Council for their 
active participation. It also thanked the members of the troika for their support throughout 
the review process. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>255 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>815. Indonesia praised Timor-Leste for the number of recommendations accepted, 
including those that it had made. It also commended Timor-Leste for having ratified seven 
core human rights conventions in a short period of time. Indonesia stood ready to 
collaborate and move forward on the recommendations made by the Commission of Truth 
and Friendship. As a close neighbour, Indonesia expressed appreciation for the enhanced 
cooperation between the two countries. Furthermore, Indonesia believed that cooperation 
based on mutual respect and friendship would serve the interests shared in bringing mutual 
benefits for the peoples of both countries. 
</p>
<p>816. Cuba noted the challenges faced by Timor-Leste deriving mainly from the unjust 
international economic order. It highlighted Timor-Leste&#8217;s achievements in providing 
health services, in particular hospital services at the community level, and having 
established the national health institute to improve the training of nurses, midwives and 
laboratory technicians. It noted the efforts made to treat tuberculosis and malaria, and the 
recent reduction in child mortality. Cuba expressed its satisfaction at its modest 
contribution through the presence of Cuban medical personnel in Timor-Leste and 
Timorese students in Cuba. It congratulated Timor-Leste on having accepted so many 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>817. Malaysia was pleased to note that, in spite of resource and capacity constraints, the 
Government had accepted a large number of recommendations, and was encouraged by the 
steps taken towards implementing many of them. In addition, it welcomed the various 
mechanisms put in place to guarantee the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, 
including those that focused on economic, social and cultural rights. Malaysia was 
encouraged by the Government&#8217;s commitment to greater interaction with relevant 
international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>818. Viet Nam noted that Timor-Leste was a young nation facing many challenges and 
hardships on its way to development, and highlighted its efforts and achievements in 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. It appreciated Timor-Leste&#8217;s 
acceptance of many recommendations, including Viet Nam&#8217;s recommendations on 
strengthening the rule of law and good governance, promoting rights to education and 
health care, and integrating further into regional and international human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>819. Morocco stated that Timor-Leste&#8217;s review had been an opportunity to appraise both 
the progress made and the difficulties faced in the area of human rights since its 
independence. It praised the Government for having pledged to ratify more international 
conventions as soon as the human resources and institutional capacity necessary were in 
place. Morocco thanked Timor-Leste for having accepted the recommendation it had made, 
and invited the Government to take advantage of the support of the Universal Periodic 
Review Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to assist in the 
implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>820. The Philippines congratulated Timor-Leste on its engagement with the universal 
periodic review, and noted that, as young democracy, Timor-Leste had shown resoluteness 
in upholding the rule of law. It highlighted Timor-Leste&#8217;s ratification of seven human rights 
treaties and several optional protocols since 2003. The Philippines noted with satisfaction 
that Timor-Leste had favourably considered its recommendation on improving its 
legislature, taking into account international human rights obligations. It also considered 
Timor-Leste&#8217;s efforts in building partnerships and exploring cooperation encouraging. It 
commended Timor-Leste for its measures to address the protection of women and children. </p>


<p><b>256</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>821. Monaco congratulated the Government for the acceptance of the recommendations 
accepted and for strengthening its institutions and programmes aimed at establishing rule of 
law. Monaco had encouraged some important Timorese initiatives, including the 
programme to support victims, the national plan for education 2011&#8211;2015 and the 2010 Act 
on the eradication of violence against women. It also welcomed the recent changes in 
national jurisprudence and the new Civil Code, which had established equality between 
men and women in all areas. It hoped that the Code on the adoption of children would be 
finalized soon. 
</p>
<p>822. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted that Timor-Leste, as a young 
democracy, had accepted a large number of recommendations and had started taking the 
necessary steps for implementing them. It acknowledged the significant progress made in 
promoting and protecting the fundamental rights of Timorese citizens. It recognized that the 
Government had cooperated with United Nations human rights mechanisms and with the 
international community in the implementation of international and regional human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>823. Thailand expressed its appreciation for the fact that Timor-Leste had accepted a 
large number of recommendations, including that made by Thailand. It noted that Timor-
Leste had started to implement the recommendations received, and welcomed its 
ratification of human rights instruments. Thailand was convinced that the more Timor-
Leste&#8217;s commitments were converted into practice, the more benefits there would be for the 
Timorese people. It encouraged the international community to assist Timor-Leste and to 
respond positively to its requests for assistance. Thailand was ready to assist and share its 
experience and expertise. 
</p>
<p>824. Algeria noted with satisfaction the progress made by Timor-Leste in the fields of 
human rights, security, economic development and human development since 2005. It 
welcomed the fact that Timor-Leste had accepted the three recommendations made by 
Algeria. It had concurred with one of the conclusions of the national report, namely, that 
the fight for independence of the Timorese people, founded on the right to self-
determination, was fundamentally a fight for human rights, and encouraged the 
Government to continue on that path. 
</p>
<p>825. Romania, as a member of the troika, thanked Timor-Leste for its full availability and 
cooperative spirit exhibited throughout the universal periodic review exercise and for 
having accepted a large number of recommendations. It encouraged Timor-Leste to make 
every effort to implement the recommendations accepted and to further human rights for 
the benefit of its people. Romania was convinced that the upcoming presidential and 
legislative elections would bring further progress. 
</p>
<p>826. Angola recognized the Government&#8217;s commitment to the implementation of several 
of the recommendations received during the review. It highlighted two recommendations: 
one on the strengthening of democratic institutions, the other on combating violence against 
women. Angola welcomed the reforms made in the area of human rights, in particular the 
adoption of a new civil code that guaranteed gender equality, the establishment of an 
independent human rights institution and the creation of a commission against corruption. It 
called on the international community to accompany the efforts and reforms made by 
Timor-Leste. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>827. Provedoria de Direitos Humanos, an A-status human rights institution, noted that a 
total of 125 recommendations had been made. It recognized the challenges faced in a 
young, developing nation and in addressing the needs of its population, who lived for many 
years under occupation. It regretted the delays in addressing the human rights violations </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>257 
</b></p>
<p>committed between 1975 and 1999. Unlike the State, the institution believed that 
reconciliation, national unity and lasting peace could not exist without truth, justice and the 
rule of law. It urged Timor-Leste to keep its promise to implement universal periodic 
review recommendations. The institution and civil society were ready to provide support. 
</p>
<p>828. Instituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice delle Salesiane di Don Bosco, the 
International Volunteerism Organizations for Women, Education and Development, 
Mouvement international d&#8217;apostolat des milieux sociaux ind&#233;pendants and the 
International Organization for the Right to Education and Freedom of Education, 
recognized the efforts of the Government in the area of human rights, in particular 
children&#8217;s rights. They highlighted the adoption of the national strategic plan for education 
2011&#8211;2015 that placed the well-being of children at the centre of school decision-making. 
Nevertheless, they noted different problems in the accessibility, availability and 
acceptability of education. They also noted the persistence of child labour, sexual 
exploitation, child trafficking and violence against children in the country. 
</p>
<p>829. Amnesty International noted that, although two draft laws establishing a national 
reparations programme and a public memory institute had been submitted to Parliament in 
2010, the debate thereon had been delayed. In this way, Timor-Leste continued to deny 
justice and effective reparation to victims of crimes against humanity and grave human 
rights violations committed between 1975 and 1999. It also noted that, to date, not a single 
person had been prosecuted for human rights violations during the occupation. Attempts to 
bring to justice for violations during the 1999 referendum had also been grossly inadequate. 
Amnesty International was disappointed that the universal periodic review had failed to 
adequately address concerns raised in the stakeholders&#8217; summary relating to impunity, and 
urged the international community to do more. 
</p>
<p>830. Save the Children, on behalf of the Child Rights Coalition Timor-Leste, welcomed 
particularly the recommendations on children&#8217;s rights. It called on the Government to 
implement policies to improve the quality of the school food programme. It also called for a 
substantial increase in the budget for education, with a goal of achieving the international 
standard of 20 per cent dedicated to education, as well as the establishment of a truly 
independent and fully resourced national child rights commission. It looked forward to the 
Government&#8217;s continued cooperation with civil society organizations in the follow-up to 
and implementation of universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>831. The Marist International Solidarity Foundation and Franciscans International 
appreciated Timor-Leste&#8217;s commitment to human rights despite the challenges faced. They 
commended the development of the strategic plan of action for education for 2011&#8211;2015, 
which placed the needs of children at the forefront of decision-making and urged Timor-
Leste to maintain its commitment to universal primary education. They noted deficiencies 
with regard to equal access to education, especially for children with disabilities, and urged 
Timor-Leste to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. They 
welcomed the Children&#8217;s Code, which prohibited corporal punishment, and called for 
assurances that child victims of violence would have access to adequate care. It endorsed 
the recommendations on establishing institutional mechanisms to protect children in the 
juvenile justice system, as well as those on integrating the best interests of the child into 
draft legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>832. Timor-Leste thanked all delegations that had contributed to the outcome, as well as 
other stakeholders, including civil society. Unfortunately, as the presidential elections were 
about to be held, neither the representatives of the national human rights institutions nor of 
civil society were able to attend. Nonetheless, their contributions, made through their </p>


<p><b>258</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>representatives, were appreciated. Timor-Leste pledged to be true to its work in the 
implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>833. The President noted that certain recommendations had been considered as partially 
accepted and that, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, these would be 
regarded as noted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>834. The review of the Republic of Moldova was held on 12 October 2011 in conformity 
with all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Republic of Moldova in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/3). 
</p><p>835. At its 42nd meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Republic of Moldova (see section C below). 
836. The outcome of the review of the Republic of Moldova comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/18), the views of the 
Republic of Moldova concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/18/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>837. The delegation of the Republic of Moldova stated that the universal periodic review 
had revolutionized the national system of human rights and was an opportunity to assess 
internally the implementation of international standards. The Government had learned from 
the preparation process and had consulted extensively since the review in October 2011. It 
had held a first joint follow-up meeting with intergovernmental organizations and civil 
society, and would continue to consult all stakeholders in the follow-up. 
</p>
<p>838. The delegation had received 122 recommendations, and had provided most 
responses at the session of the Working Group. Furthermore, responses to the 15 remaining 
recommendations were contained in the addendum (A/HRC/19/18/Add.1). The authorities 
had given and continued to give serious consideration to all recommendations, and each 
recommendation was an opportunity to re-examine positions. The Government had 
responded positively to the overwhelming majority of recommendations by accepting them 
totally or partially. Some of the issues raised focused on challenging areas where further 
attention was required. 
</p>
<p>839. In November 2011, the Strategy for Justice Sector Reform (2011&#8211;2016) was adopted 
by Parliament; in early 2012, a plan of action for the strategy implementation was 
approved. The strategy aims to, inter alia, reform the judicial system, criminal justice, 
access to justice and the execution of justice, and to promote anti-corruption measures, 
professional ethical standards and the monitoring of human rights in the justice system. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>259 
</b></p>
<p>840. Since the adoption of the strategy, the Government had adopted a bill on the 
amendment of legislation regarding the organization and functioning of the judiciary, a bill 
on the selection, career and performance evaluation of judges, and a bill on the functioning 
of specialized courts. 
</p>
<p>841. In accordance with the strategy pillar on human rights, a working group on 
amending the Ombudsman Law had been established with the objective of upgrading the 
status of the national human rights institution, the Centre for Human Rights of Moldova, 
from B to A Status. The delegation expected that a new bill to this end would be adopted in 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>842. The Strategy for Justice Sector Reform also provided for preventing and combating 
torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and fought impunity. The criminal law would be 
amended with a view to removing the statute of limitations for the crime of torture. The 
delegation added that the Government had recently launched a process of equipping all 
police stations and temporary detention facilities with video cameras and video surveillance 
systems for monitoring compliance with the detention regime. 
</p>
<p>843. With regard to reducing the length of custody to 48 hours, the delegation stated that 
implementing this recommendation would require an amendment to article 25 of the 
Constitution, which set the limit at 72 hours. Consequently, this would be a lengthy 
exercise. Moreover, the reduction of the length of custody could prevent law enforcement 
bodies and the judiciary from conducting comprehensive investigations. 
</p><p>844. Regarding the events of April 2009, the delegation agreed that the comprehensive 
inquiry should be continued. To that end, the special commission tasked with compensating 
the victims of these events had resumed its activities. 
</p>
<p>845. The delegation stressed, that in order to strengthen existing rules, the bill on 
preventing and combating discrimination included an indicative list of discriminatory 
criteria and established a council for preventing and combating discrimination. The 
Government had embarked on broad consultations and the bill had been revised according 
to the proposals presented by national and international stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>846. In order to implement the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, the Republic of Moldova was implementing a strategy for the social 
inclusion of persons with disabilities for the period 2010&#8211;2013. The bill on the social 
inclusion of persons with disabilities provided for the development and approval of a 
methodology for determining degrees of disabilities, in accordance with WHO standards. It 
also reorganized the structures and institutions responsible for the coordination of the 
system of social inclusion of persons with disabilities. In November 2011, the Government 
had launched an interministerial working group tasked to rethink the system of decision-
making for persons with psychosocial disorders. 
</p>
<p>847. The delegation also reported on the adoption of amendments to the plan of action to 
support the Roma population for 2011&#8211;2015, which confirmed the commitment to promote 
and implement the social inclusion of Roma. The Government was currently working on a 
comprehensive costing exercise in order to secure the necessary budgetary funds. 
</p>
<p>848. With regard to freedom of religion, the Parliament had adopted, in December 2011, 
amendments to the renamed law on freedom of conscience, thought and religion. Adopted 
as a result of broad consultations, the amendments to the law had the aim of reaffirming the 
commitment of the State to ensure the equality and non-discrimination of all religious 
communities. 
</p>
<p>849. The national legal framework envisaged the creation of the conditions necessary to 
guarantee the respect of the right to education for all children. Pupils and students had the </p>


<p><b>260</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>right to choose the language of instruction at any level of education. A structural reform 
had been launched by the Government. 
</p>
<p>850. For the period 2011&#8211;2012, the network of pre-university institutions in the country 
included 1,456 institutions (schools, gymnasiums and high schools), of which 278 had 
access to education in Russian and 81 were mixed institutions. At the same time, local 
television and radio stations broadcast programmes in languages of national minorities, and 
newspapers and magazines were also disseminated in minority languages. According to a 
public opinion survey conducted in November 2011, the freedoms of the media and of 
access to information were listed as areas that had witnessed the most significant progress 
in the past two years. The delegation concluded by stressing that the recommendations 
received were an important point of reference in the Government&#8217;s continued activity. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>851. Morocco welcomed the decision of the Republic of Moldova to include 
recommendations accepted during the universal periodic review in its national human rights 
plan of action for 2011&#8211;2014. By accepting almost all of the recommendations received, the 
State had reaffirmed its commitment to and full cooperation with the universal periodic 
review mechanism. Morocco welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to human rights, 
democracy and the rule of law. This commitment was shown in particular through the 
progress made towards gender equality and the protection of the rights of women, children 
and minorities, the efforts made for persons with disabilities, the strategy to reform the 
judicial system, the reform of the penitentiary system and the specific measures taken to 
prevent human trafficking. Morocco encouraged the Republic of Moldova in its new 
initiatives, and wished it success in the implementation of the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>852. Estonia noted with appreciation that the Republic of Moldova had already 
implemented and intended to implement a large number of the recommendations made 
during its review. Estonia considered especially important the adoption of the 
comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in line with international standards, the 
policies addressing the root causes of domestic violence, and the awareness-raising 
campaigns and the policies implemented to prevent the mistreatment of women and 
children. The creation of a modern institutional framework for the protection of human 
rights in such a short period of time was a noteworthy achievement. The Republic of 
Moldova had improved its criminal code and legal framework in the areas of juvenile 
justice, human trafficking, peaceful assembly and access to legal and social assistance. 
</p><p>853. Algeria congratulated the Republic of Moldova on the measures taken since October 
2011 for the implementation of recommendations, and encouraged it to finalize the various 
plans for human rights and to implement them. Algeria welcomed the commitment to the 
recommendation on measures to strengthen harmony and tolerance between the different 
segments of society. It noted with great satisfaction that the recommendation for 
strengthening training programmes on human rights for law enforcement officials had 
already been implemented. Algeria noted the State&#8217;s partial acceptance of the 
recommendation for the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. It hoped that the 
consideration of this matter would result in the ratification thereof to ensure better 
protection for this vulnerable category of persons. 
</p>
<p>854. Romania commended the Republic of Moldova for not having rejected any 
recommendation made during the universal periodic review process. In particular, it noted 
with appreciation the acceptance of the recommendations relating to raising awareness of 
the State language in society and the promotion of human rights in the Transnistrian region. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>261 
</b></p>
<p>Romania acknowledged the efforts made to improve legal and institutional framework for 
the protection and promotion of human rights, in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>855. Belarus noted with satisfaction that the Republic of Moldova had accepted the vast 
majority of the recommendations made, which demonstrated the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to strengthening the national capacity to promote and protect human rights. 
The universal periodic review process provided an opportunity to assess achievements, 
including in the reform of domestic laws. Belarus noted with appreciation the 
Government&#8217;s effort to reduce the level of poverty, provide support for the most vulnerable 
groups, guarantee universal primary education, combat human trafficking and protect the 
rights of women and children. It also appreciated the readiness expressed by the 
Government to strengthen the protection of national minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>856. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC 
Nederland and the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) noted, that among 
other commitments, the Republic of Moldova had expressed its unequivocal support to 
ensure that actions would be undertaken to build broad support for the rights of LGBT 
persons in the new anti-discrimination law, and that the right to freedom of expression and 
assembly would be upheld for LGBT communities. Unfortunately, the reality was different. 
The city of Balti and several other local councils had adopted decisions making the region a 
forbidden zone for &#8220;aggressive propaganda of non-traditional sexual orientations&#8221; and 
&#8220;homosexual demonstrations&#8221;. At the same time, the mayor of Chisinau had banned Pride 
manifestations in the past two years. In 2008, a group of Pride participants had been 
exposed to savage reprisals by extremist groups and left unprotected by the police. COC 
and ILGA asked the delegation to explain how it viewed these developments in the light of 
its commitments. In this context, they emphasized that such bans perpetuated a climate of 
homophobia and transphobia. They urged the Government to, inter alia, express its explicit 
support for the Human Rights Council resolution adopted in 2011, in which the Council 
condemned violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, 
and to respond to the recently adopted unconstitutional homophobic decisions made by 
local municipalities. 
</p>
<p>857. The World Alliance for Citizen Participation (CIVICUS) urged the Government to 
adopt a comprehensive and inclusive anti-discrimination law, and to set up effective 
implementation mechanisms to prevent and combat human rights abuses. While expressing 
concern at the violation of the rights of ethnic, religious and sexual minorities, CIVICUS 
urged the Republic of Moldova to take further steps to ensure adequate protection for all 
minorities, including the protection of the rights of LGBT persons. It also encouraged the 
Government to continue its efforts to support the development of a strong, free and 
independent civil society. CIVICUS urged the Government to review and revise its national 
human rights plan of action and other human rights documents with a view to develop a 
policy document that incorporated universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>858. Amnesty International continued to receive reports of torture and other forms of ill-
treatment being used in the Republic of Moldova. It therefore welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to combat torture and other ill-treatment, as recommended by several States. 
Amnesty International was concerned that there had been little progress in prosecuting 
police officers responsible for torture and other ill-treatment during the events following the 
elections in April 2009. During her visit to the Republic of Moldova in November 2011, the 
High Commissioner stressed the need to enact a comprehensive anti-discrimination law 
without delay. In the review at the session of the Working Group, this call had been echoed 
by no fewer than 13 States. Amnesty International joined them in urging the Government to </p>


<p><b>262</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>adopt, without further delay, the Anti-Discrimination Law that had been under discussion 
for almost five years. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>859. The delegation of the Republic of Moldova stated that, by accepting all universal 
periodic review recommendations, the Moldovan authorities had demonstrated that there 
were still issues to be resolved, on the one hand, and the political will of the Government to 
address existing problems, on the other. 
</p>
<p>860. The Ministry of Justice was conducting consultations with civil society and other 
relevant stakeholders to finalize the bill on anti-discrimination. The delegation underlined 
the fact that the bill was fully in line with international standards, and that the issue had 
been artificially politicized. The Government would promote a sensitive policy, which 
would take time and careful work. 
</p>
<p>861. With regard to the recent decisions of local public authorities on the LGBT 
community, the said decisions were administrative acts. Any person who believed that an 
administrative act adopted by a local public authority infringed his or her rights could 
initiate court proceedings. At the same time, the national human rights institution had 
condemned the decisions adopted by a few local councils declaring that they were 
derogating from the legal framework. The authorities would continue to pay special 
attention and to promote dialogue in order to ensure smooth adoption of the anti-
discrimination law. 
</p>
<p>862. Human rights in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova were a priority 
for State authorities. Human rights issues in this region would be part of the agenda of 
official negotiations in the 5+2 format, resumed recently, and would also be raised in the 
framework of the activity of the Working Group on confidence-building measures. 
</p>
<p>863. The delegation stated that, during a careful analysis of the universal periodic review 
recommendations, it had noticed that many have similarities with the concluding 
observations of regional or treaty bodies. In this context and with the support of the United 
Nations country team, the Government had commenced the review and amendment process 
of the national human rights plan of action for 2011&#8211;2014. Earlier in 2012, the monitoring 
commission for the implementation of the plan of action had been established. Shortly after 
the adoption of the universal periodic review outcome, the commission would convene its 
first meeting to establish steps for the implementation of the review recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>864. The review of Haiti was held on 13 October 2011 in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Haiti in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/3). 
</p><p>865. At its 42nd meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Haiti (see section C below). 
866. The outcome of the review of Haiti comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/19), the views of Haiti concerning the </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>263 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/19/19/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>867. The Minister for Justice and Public Security of Haiti expressed his condolences to 
the people and the Government of Belgium following the tragic death of 28 people, 
including 22 children, in a road accident in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>868. Despite the difficult situation in Haiti, the President of Haiti intended to keep his 
electoral promises of respecting the rule of law and human rights. 
</p>
<p>869. The Minister referred to the Government&#8217;s involvement of civil society in the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations, in a national consultation 
that was held on 14 February 2012. Of 136 recommendations made, 122 had been accepted, 
including 3 with reservations, while 14 had been temporarily rejected. The 
recommendations accepted included some that had already been implemented, including 
judicial reform, improvement of the penitentiary system, the fight against impunity, 
violence against women and girls, the right to education, and the rehousing of the victims of 
the earthquake of 12 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>870. With regard to judicial reform, the vacant posts in the Court of Appeal had been 
filled. The members of the Supreme Judicial Council were known and the certification 
process was moving towards its conclusive phase. A new commission, including three 
former Ministers for Justice, had also been created to propose reforms to the President. 
</p>
<p>871. On the improvement of the penitentiary system, the construction of a new prison had 
begun in accordance with the minimum norms accepted at the international level. To 
resolve the problem of prolonged pretrial detention, the Government intended to enforce 
respect for the 48-hour rule provided for by the Constitution. Since February 2012, a new 
commission had been established for judicial authorities to make inquiries in tribunals, 
police stations and detention centres to identify cases of prolonged or abusive detention. A 
new programme had allowed the release of 116 people between July 2011 and January 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>872. The Government had shown its determination to fight impunity by prosecuting 
police officers who were responsible for the death of several detainees during an attempted 
escape after the earthquake of January 2010. The Minister also highlighted the case of Jean-
Claude Duvalier and the Government&#8217;s aim to sensitize the legal authorities to the 
international conventions relating to crimes against humanity and serious violations of 
human rights. The Minister referred to the removal of statutory limitations in cases of 
torture and enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>873. Violence against women had significantly worsened since the earthquake of 12 
January 2010. An international symposium had therefore been organized for January 2012 
to ensure a national policy on this matter. A national forum on issues relating to Haitian 
women was organized in March 2012 with the participation of 600 delegates from various 
national departments under the patronage of the First Lady. A more effective follow-up 
would also be given to cases of female victims of violence and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>874. Education was one of the main priorities of the President. A national fund for 
education was being considered. School transport was free for those enrolled in the public 
system. There had been an appeal for the building of 28 new schools in 7 of 10 
departments, in addition to the reconstruction of the secondary schools damaged by the </p>


<p><b>264</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>earthquake. Furthermore, 300,000 school students would benefit from the national school 
canteen programme. 
</p>
<p>875. Regarding the housing of earthquake victims, in February 2012, the President had 
inaugurated 400 35 m2 homes under Programme 400/100 financed by the Inter-American 
Development Bank. Another programme launched by the Government in August 2011, 
Programme 16/6, supported displaced persons by offering a durable housing solution and 
providing subsidies for their relocation. 
</p>
<p>876. The Minister stated that the Government would have liked to accept all the 
recommendations; however, it was unable to do so and therefore had accepted partially 
some of them. For example, with regard to recommendation 88.71, the Government would 
make every effort to facilitate the access of detainees to health services, food, water and 
sanitation, but was unable to at this time in a uniform manner owing to its limited 
resources. 
</p>
<p>877. The Government was determined to combat the phenomenon of child domestic 
workers. 
</p>
<p>878. With regard to impunity (recommendation 88.100), the Government was determined 
to combat all forms of impunity, but did not believe that it was necessary to establish a 
commission on impunity. 
</p>
<p>879. Lastly, some of the recommendations demanded a broad national consensus before 
their adoption; the Government had therefore decided to reject 14 of them. These 
recommendations could be regrouped under four themes: the ratification of the 1954 and 
1961 Conventions on the Reduction of Statelessness; the adoption of a code on children, 
which also depended on the elaboration of a family code; the establishment of a national 
human rights institution in conformity with the Paris Principles; and the issuance of a 
standing invitation to all special procedures. 
</p>
<p>880. The Minister closed his introductory statement by thanking the President, the troika 
and the staff of OHCHR for their important contribution to the universal periodic review of 
Haiti. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>881. Uruguay commended Haiti for its engagement with the universal periodic review, 
and applauded the fact that its recommendations on administration of justice, reconstruction 
and education were being implemented. Uruguay highlighted the commitment of Haiti to 
combat impunity and the priority given to education. It also paid tribute to the efforts made 
by Haiti to build decent homes for victims of the earthquake. It encouraged Haiti to 
continue to intensify the fight against all forms of trafficking in women. Uruguay 
considered that the ratification of human rights instruments by Haiti would strengthen its 
legal framework to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>882. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that Haiti faced a number of constraints 
caused by the 2010 earthquake. The humanitarian crisis threatened human rights. It 
expressed its concern at the cholera epidemic, but praised Haiti&#8217;s efforts to allocate grants 
to rebuild schools and housing, even though it was still insufficient. The Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela reiterated its call to developed countries and the United Nations to 
provide the support and humanitarian assistance needed by Haiti. It made also a call for the 
cancellation of its external debt. 
</p>
<p>883. Cuba stated that Haiti still needed to overcome constraints to implement human 
rights policies. Haiti&#8217;s situation had been affected by the global economic crisis and by 
internal crises, such as natural disaster and poverty. Cuba reiterated that improving Haiti&#8217;s </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>265 
</b></p>
<p>situation remained a global obligation. Haiti needed the help of the United Nations and 
Member States to strengthen its sovereignty and self-determination. Cuba acknowledged 
that Haiti had accepted its recommendations on poverty and inequality reduction, the 
organization and extension of education and health systems, the extension of the housing 
supply and the relocation of affected persons. 
</p>
<p>884. India commended the efforts made by Haiti to participate in the universal periodic 
review process despite the daunting challenges posed by the aftermath of the earthquake. It 
welcomed the encouraging steps taken towards the right to decent housing and the 
rehousing of those made homeless in 2010, as well as the efforts to eradicate hunger and to 
combat human trafficking. Haiti&#8217;s courageous and resilient approach to rebuilding and 
stabilizing the country despite its lack of resources and in the wake of natural disasters was 
notable. The international community should therefore continue to extend technical 
assistance and capacity-building in accordance with Haiti&#8217;s needs. 
</p>
<p>885. Morocco stated that, despite the crises and disasters that had affected Haiti, most 
particularly the earthquake of 2010, Haiti had still managed to keep its commitment to the 
Human Rights Council by submitting its universal periodic review report, which contained 
ambitious programmes aiming at the construction of a favourable economic and social 
environment for the exercise of human rights. Morocco welcomed the fact that Haiti had 
accepted 122 recommendations out of 136 made, which reflected Haiti&#8217;s determination to 
ensure respect for human rights. Morocco noted with appreciation the acceptance of its 
recommendation on a plan of action for national reconstruction and development and 
national strategies for education for all and to ensure training for judges, judicial authorities 
and law enforcement officers, particularly in the area of human rights. It encouraged Haiti 
to pursue its intention to formalize the interministerial committee, which had prepared 
Haiti&#8217;s first review, and make it a standing committee. 
</p>
<p>886. The United States of America commended Haiti for already implementing one of its 
recommendations by filling four vacancies at the Supreme Court. This included filling the 
vacancy of the presidency of the Court of Appeal, a step that would allow the creation of a 
superior judicial council. It was also pleased that Haiti had agreed to take the necessary 
steps to permit the judicial system to combat impunity effectively. It urged Haiti to continue 
to take steps to ensure accountability, which would help to strengthen the rule of law and to 
break the pervasive cycle of impunity that hindered reconciliation and limited Haiti&#8217;s 
economic development. The United States also echoed the recommendations made by Peru 
and France, and accepted by Haiti, that it should continue cooperation with the Independent 
Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti. The continuation of the Independent 
Expert&#8217;s mandate would assist in the identification of new technical assistance 
opportunities and other collaboration to help Haiti to advance human rights. 
</p>
<p>887. France stated that, despite the efforts of the Haitian authorities and the scale of the 
mobilization by the international community and the United Nations, the challenges in 
overcoming the consequences of the earthquake that devastated Haiti on 10 January 2010 
were vast. The restoration of the rule of law and the full respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in Haiti should be a priority. The Independent Expert on the 
situation of human rights in Haiti had a major role to play in providing advice and assisting 
Haiti in implementing the necessary reforms. The Independent Expert could also draw the 
attention of the international community to Haiti&#8217;s needs. France would continue to work 
actively alongside Haiti in building democracy and promoting human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>888. Algeria appreciated the fact that Haiti had accepted a large number of universal 
periodic review recommendations. Haiti&#8217;s efforts, with the assistance of the international 
community, had led to achievements in recovery and reconstruction. Algeria congratulated 
Haiti on the measures taken to strengthen political stability. It paid tribute to the frank way </p>


<p><b>266</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>in which Haiti had addressed the human rights situation during its review. Algeria 
recognized that natural disasters, the fragility of the ecosystem and climate change all had a 
negative impact on human rights. Given the scale of the difficulties that Haiti had to face, it 
was vital that the international community continue to provide assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>889. Instituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice, on behalf of a coalition of non-
governmental organizations, welcomed the finalization of the very detailed operational plan 
for 2010&#8211;2015 by the Ministry of National Education and Professional Training and 
contained in &#8220;Towards reforms of Haiti&#8217;s education system&#8221;, which showed Haiti&#8217;s 
determination to respond ambitiously and specifically to its fragmented education system. It 
hoped that Haiti would be able to implement the plan as soon as possible in order to 
promote free mandatory schooling for all children at the primary-school level, and also to 
improve the quality of all levels of education by 2015. It recommended that Haiti take into 
account a human rights-based approach in all its initiatives so as to ensure equitable 
reconstruction and to build a fairer society based on the integration into the education 
system of the most vulnerable groups, particularly girls, children with disabilities, poor 
children, undocumented children and children living in rural areas. Special attention had to 
be paid to children who had become disabled as a result of the earthquake and who also 
needed psychological support in adapting to their new conditions. It recommended that 
Haiti make plans and establish a system of direct monitoring of private schools. It also 
suggested the standardization of curricula and school handbooks, the training of teachers 
and that priority be given to the quality of teaching and learning. 
</p>
<p>890. Human Rights Advocates noted that people were still living in internal displacement 
camps and the fact that Haiti had not yet adopted a comprehensive rehousing plan, despite 
regional recommendations. It commended Haiti for having ratified the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Despite the evidence against Jean-
Claude Duvalier, the judge had dismissed all crimes against humanity. Human Rights 
Advocates recommended that Haiti and the international community assure a fair and 
transparent judicial process. It recalled that senatorial and local elections had not been held 
in November 2011, and recommended that a permanent electoral council be appointed and 
all due measures be taken accordingly. 
</p>
<p>891. Human Rights Watch congratulated Haiti on having passed a bill to ratify the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Haiti had to take steps 
towards the realization of the rights enshrined in the Covenant and fulfil its obligations 
under other human rights treaties, which included ensuring that women and girls had access 
to reproductive and maternal health services. It was concerned, however, that Haiti&#8217;s 
attitude to holding former President Jean-Claude Duvalier to account had seriously 
damaged its credibility with regard to the upholding of a core and fundamental element of 
human rights. Under human rights conventions to which Haiti was a party, statutes of 
limitations were inapplicable to cases of gross human rights violations proscribed by 
international law. Nonetheless, in November 2011, the new State prosecutor had 
recommended the dismissal of the human rights charges against Mr. Duvalier, while the 
President, Michel Martelly, had suggested that he would pardon or amnesty him. On 30 
January 2012, the instructing judge had found that the statute of limitations in the criminal 
code prevented the prosecution of human rights crimes. The President had listed building 
the rule of law as a priority in his reconstruction efforts. If the concept of the rule of law 
had any meaning, however, it was that those accused of the worst crimes should be brought 
to justice and given a fair trial. Impunity in the Duvalier case would entrench the distrust 
that many Haitians had in the justice system. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>267 
</b></p>
<p>892. The Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti expressed its concern at the 
implementation of the recommendations accepted by Haiti, and criticized the exclusion of 
certain non-governmental organizations in the national consultation process. Regarding 
justice, it noted that Haiti had to first, inter alia, set up its judicial system and strengthen its 
capacity. It added that Haiti had to facilitate access to free legal assistance, especially for 
the most vulnerable, and referred to the case of Duvalier. With regard to gender-based 
violence, it stressed the need to train police and judiciary personnel on gender and sexual 
exploitation issues. It also expressed its concern at the cholera epidemic. 
</p>
<p>893. Amnesty International welcomed the adoption by the National Assembly of 
legislation for the ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, and urged Haiti to strengthen its efforts to make the rights enshrined in the 
Covenant a reality for the Haitian people. It was concerned at the recent judicial decision to 
drop criminal charges against Jean-Claude Duvalier for grave human rights violations 
committed under his Government, some of which might amount to crimes against 
humanity. This decision reinforced the prevailing impunity and was a clear setback in 
efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Haiti. It urged Haiti to ensure that alleged crimes 
committed under his rule were investigated and that those responsible were brought to 
justice. The issue of housing rights remained largely unaddressed in the reconstruction 
process. Thousands of people had been forcibly evicted or relocated, without adequate 
safeguards or prior consultation. Evictions should be a measure of last resort, and always be 
carried out in accordance with international human rights standards. Violence against 
women and girls remained a serious problem, and impunity for such crimes prevailed. 
Amnesty International urged Haiti to complete the drafting, adoption and implementation 
of new legislation to combat violence against women and girls, and to protect their rights. 
</p>
<p>894. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme thanked Haiti for its clear 
and detailed universal periodic review report. It acknowledged some progress, such as the 
establishment of human rights defence institutions, and congratulated Haiti on, inter alia, 
the abolition of the death penalty and the establishment of a brigade for the protection of 
minors. It encouraged Haiti to continue its efforts in housing, combating the sexual 
exploitation of women, girls and children, improving the situation of detainees, including 
juveniles, and fighting corruption. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>895. The Minister thanked States for their comments. He reiterated the commitment of 
the new authorities to the establishment of the rule of law and to contribute significantly to 
improve the living conditions of the Haitian people, especially with regard to education and 
housing. The Minister also reported on the new housing policy where no one could be 
evicted without alternative relocation. The Minister thanked the international community 
for its support. 
</p>
<p><b>  Antigua and Barbuda 
</b></p>
<p>896. The review of Antigua and Barbuda was held on 4 October 2011 in conformity with 
all relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Antigua and Barbuda in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ATG/3). </p>


<p><b>268</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>897. At its 42nd meeting, on 16 March 2012, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Antigua and Barbuda (see section C below). 
</p><p>898. The outcome of the review of Antigua and Barbuda comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/19/5), the views of Antigua and 
Barbuda concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/19/5/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>899. Pursuant to Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s request and on its behalf, the President of the 
Human Rights Council presented the State&#8217;s views on the recommendations, given that 
Antigua and Barbuda could not be present at the meeting. Antigua and Barbuda had 
submitted its position and views on the recommendations in writing, which could be found 
in the addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>900. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda had accepted all recommendations 
contained in paragraph 68 of the report of the Working Group, except for the ones noted 
below, of which due note was taken. 
</p>
<p>901. With regard to the recommendation on strengthening its legal arsenal by acceding to 
the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
Antigua and Barbuda stated that any alteration of existing legislation and binding judicial 
pronouncements on matters relating to the death penalty was not an acceptable position. 
That apart, Antigua and Barbuda would seek to adopt the other provisions of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>902. On issuing a standing invitation to all special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council, Antigua and Barbuda acknowledged the importance of the special procedures in 
ensuring that human rights obligations under the various conventions were respected and 
upheld. It also expressed its willingness to cooperate, but could not accept that 
recommendation at the current time because of the financial burden and additional 
requirements that such an invitation would impose on a small island developing State like 
Antigua and Barbuda. However, it would continue to monitor the implications with a view 
to accepting such invitations in the future. 
</p>
<p>903. Concerning recommendations 68.23 to 68.25, on raising the age of criminal 
responsibility, Antigua and Barbuda was aware of the emotional, mental and relative 
intellectual maturity of juveniles and would give active consideration to the 
recommendations to increase the legal minimum age for criminal responsibility in 
accordance with internationally acceptable standards. 
</p>
<p>904. On recommendation 68.31, with regard to implementing public awareness 
campaigns on discrimination based on sexual preference, Antigua and Barbuda recognized 
the human rights of all citizens. However, the issue of discrimination based on sexual 
orientation was still a matter of concern, and it was of the view that implementing policies 
based on sexual orientation required extensive public consultation and education, given the 
current predisposition of its people and their religious influences and indoctrination. 
</p>
<p>905. On recommendation 68.8, that it consider the ratification of those international 
instruments of human rights to which it was not yet party, Antigua and Barbuda was a party 
to a number of core human rights instruments and would continue to work towards 
completing the accession process to those that it considered acceptable following cabinet 
and/or public consultation. </p>


<p>GE.13-14768 <b>269 
</b></p>
<p>906. Antigua and Barbuda welcomed this exercise and was grateful to the States 
Members of the Human Rights Council for their commendations on its work in progress, as 
well as their recommendations on areas in which more work was needed. In that regard, 
Antigua and Barbuda welcomed the continued support and encouragement of the Council 
as it strove to achieve the high ideals being pursued by that august body. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>907. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela appreciated Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s 
cooperation with the universal periodic review and its commitment to human rights. It 
welcomed the efforts made by Antigua and Barbuda in the realization of human rights 
despite the challenges faced. During the review, it had appreciated Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s 
achievements in educational policies, providing school lunches to primary schools in 
disadvantaged zones, guaranteeing free primary and secondary education, and taking 
measures to strengthen the school system at all levels in order to meet universal education 
goals in 2013. It encouraged Antigua and Barbuda to continue to promote social policies 
with the support of the international community. It appreciated the participation of Antigua 
and Barbuda in the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>908. For Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda was a fraternal country that shared the history, 
cultural traditions and challenges of island States in the Caribbean. Antigua and Barbuda 
had worked for the socioeconomic development of its society through integration projects 
to which Cuba had also contributed, particularly in the area of health, education and 
developing its infrastructure. In its endeavours, Antigua and Barbuda had been affected by 
an unfair international order, a global crisis and challenges facing humanity. Cuba 
highlighted the human rights achievements of Antigua and Barbuda, such as the actions to 
fight and reduce poverty and to provide family services and social welfare. Universal 
primary and secondary education was a reality in the country. Cuba also highlighted the 
actions to prevent HIV/AIDS. To promote social security, gender issues and employment, 
and to preserve and promote culture, were priorities for the Government. Equally important 
was attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Cuba congratulated Antigua and 
Barbuda on having accepted a large number of recommendations, including those made by 
Cuba. It recommended that the report of the Working Group be adopted, and reiterated its 
solidarity. 
</p>
<p>909. Singapore was encouraged by Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s constructive participation in 
the review. As a fellow member of the Alliance of Small Island States, Singapore 
recognized the challenges faced by Antigua and Barbuda in its economic development. 
Despite these challenges, Antigua and Barbuda had made significant progress in enhancing 
the enjoyment of human rights by its people. Antigua and Barbuda had demonstrated its 
commitment to human rights. Singapore endorsed the adoption of the report of the Working 
Group and wished the country success in the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>910. Morocco congratulated Antigua and Barbuda on having accepting a large number of 
the recommendations, including those made by Morocco, and reiterated its readiness to 
strengthen bilateral cooperation in the field of human rights. Morocco believed that the 
challenges and constraints faced by Antigua and Barbuda, as a small island State, were 
numerous. These could not be overcome through the efforts of the national authorities 
alone. The people of Antigua and Barbuda were strong in their will and solidarity and able 
to continue the march towards strengthening democracy and the rule of law. The 
irreversible attachment of Antigua and Barbuda to human rights could only be attained by 
help from donors and international partners. The latter should respond to the needs 
expressed by Antigua and Barbuda, notably regarding capacity-building and technical 
assistance. Morocco encouraged Antigua and Barbuda to make the best of the universal </p>


<p><b>270</b> GE.13-14768 
</p>
<p>periodic review exercise, an excellent opportunity to exchange best practices with a view to 
finding solutions to difficulties that affect small islands States. 
</p>
<p>911. Algeria recalled that, during the review, it had welcomed Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s 
commitment to human rights despite the human, environmental and financial difficulties 
that it faced, like other small island States. Algeria repeated its call to the international 
community to provide assistance to these island States to support their efforts to promote 
and protect human rights. Algeria welcomed the fact that Antigua and Barbuda had 
accepted most of the recommendations, including the ones made by Algeria with regard to 
accession to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the establishment of a national 
human rights institution. Algeria wished Antigua and Barbuda success in implementing the 
recommendations accepted, and encouraged it to continue its work in the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>912. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, also on behalf of the Meeting Emotional 
and Social Needs Holistically and the Caribbean Forum for Liberation and Acceptance of 
Genders and Sexualities, called the attention of the Human Rights Council to the particular 
challenges relating to sexual orientation and gender identity faced by rights-holders in such 
small island developing States as Antigua and Barbuda. Contrary to the State&#8217;s view that 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity did not exist, such acts were 
ongoing. It urged Antigua and Barbuda to follow up on police reports filed, consistent with 
its acceptance of recommendation 67.28 to end such violence, and to address its root 
causes. Non-governmental organizations were committed to working with the Government 
in drafting policies and initiatives to which Antigua and Barbuda committed in 
recommendation 67.29, to address such discrimination. Antigua and Barbuda had 
acknowledged changes in public opinion with regard to same-sex conduct and admitted to 
having made little use of the serious indecency statute. The law, however, sanctioned 
violence, drove stigma and, especially in small island States, fuelled fear to exercise the 
rights to freedom of assembly and expression. It urged Antigua and Barbuda to follow other 
Caribbean States and declare a moratorium on enforcing laws against private sexual 
conduct between consenting adults. It also congratulated Antigua and Barbuda on its 
planned accession to several human rights conventions, and thanked the many States that 
made those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>913. Amnesty International welcomed the fact that there had been no executions in 
Antigua and Barbuda in the past 11 years, and also the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
rigorously apply international standards for fair trials in all death penalty cases. It was 
disappointed, however, that Antigua and Barbuda had rejected the recommendations made 
by six States to abolish the death penalty. It recalled that the death penalty violated the right 
to life, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It urged Antigua and 
Barbuda to impose a formal moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to 
abolishing it; to commute all death sentences to terms of imprisonment; to ratify the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and to vote in 
support of the next General Assembly resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death 
penalty. It welcomed Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s commitment to condemn human rights 
violations against persons on the grounds of sexual orientation and to institute policies and 
initiatives to address discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It 
emphasized, however, that the removal of discriminatory laws was a first step in fighting 
the stigma surrounding homosexuality, and it regretted Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s rejection of 
recommendations to decriminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same 
sex. It also welcomed Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s support for recommendations to sign and </p>
