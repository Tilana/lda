</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Ms. Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official visit to 
Zambia from 6 to 11 December 2010. The objective of this visit was to examine the 
situation of violence against women in the country taking into account its causes and 
consequences, and the State responses to prevent such violence, protect and provide 
remedies to women who have been subjected to such violence, and to prosecute and punish 
the perpetrators.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the visit, consultations were held in Lusaka with the Vice-President and 
high-ranking officials at the Ministries of Justice, Community Development and Social 
Services, and Education. In addition meetings were held with high-ranking officials of the 
Gender in Development Division of the President&#8217;s Office, the Directorate of Public 
Prosecutions, the National AIDS Council, and the Victim Support Unit of the Police Force. 
Meetings were also held with the Deputy Director of the Lusaka Local Court, the 
Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Governance, Gender and Human Rights, 
and members of the Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>3. She also met with representatives of civil society organizations, including women&#8217;s 
groups, United Nations agencies and representatives of a number of donor countries. The 
Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a women&#8217;s shelter run by civil society 
organizations in Lusaka, the One Stop Centre at the University Teaching Hospital, the 
Crisis Response Centre at the Mazabuka Hospital, the detention cells of Matero police 
station in Lusaka and the women&#8217;s wing of Lusaka Central Prison, where she heard 
testimonies from a number of women. She was also received by Chief<b> </b>Naluama, Naluama 
Chiefdom, at Munali Hills, Mazabuka District. 
</p>
<p>4. While regretting that a number of meetings originally scheduled could not take place 
due to sudden requests for cancellation, the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her deep 
appreciation to the Government for its full cooperation. She is also very grateful to the 
United Nations Country Team for the support extended prior to and throughout the visit. 
The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Zambia is a landlocked country, rich in natural resources, with a population close to 
10 million people, of whom 50.8 per cent are females according to the 2000 Population 
Census. The country is divided into nine provinces and 74 districts. By 2008 life 
expectancy at birth was 40 years. Despite significant economic growth in the last decade, 
this growth has not yet reached the most vulnerable, and extreme poverty persists in the 
country. The 2008 MDG Progress Report indicated that in 2001 the incidence of extreme 
poverty stood at 51 per cent, with rates higher in the rural areas and was more prevalent 
among female-headed households. 
</p>
<p>6. Zambia is a country where customary law and its institutions are still vibrant and 
where traditional leaders continue to influence and shape societal norms. This impacts 
women in different ways as structures and attitudes within the family and the community 
marginalize women and male preference practices continue to be perpetuated. These 
deeply-embedded patriarchal values have led to women remaining discriminated against 
and disadvantaged in a number of sectors and being at a higher risk of violence. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>7. The report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty highlighted the fact that gender discrimination remains pervasive and that this 
discrimination has limited women&#8217;s access to land, education, credit and other productive 
assets and has created a power imbalance preventing women and girls from having full 
control over their lives. This has led to women being overrepresented among the extremely 
poor, the unemployed, the illiterate and those living with HIV/AIDS - while at the same 
time being underrepresented in political and decision-making bodies. Widespread violence 
against women is also one of many realities which exacerbate women&#8217;s subjugation in 
Zambian society.1 
</p>
<p>8. The Government has not shied away from these problems and has repeatedly 
acknowledged that meaningful development cannot take place without addressing 
fundamental gender issues and particularly those of women&#8217;s empowerment. In the Fifth 
National Development Plan (FNDP) gender was addressed both as a cross-cutting and also 
as a specific issue. In the Sixth National Development Plan, 2011-2015, the Government 
has committed to continue advancing gender mainstreaming into policies and legislation 
and supporting the socio-economic empowerment of all, especially women. It has also 
undertaken to integrate comprehensively into policies and programmes international and 
regional instruments on gender to which the State is party. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The status of women in the country  
</b></p>
<p>9. Zambia has ratified most of the core international and regional human rights 
instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights on 
the Rights of Women in Africa. De jure equality between women and men is partially 
incorporated in the domestic formal legal system starting with provisions in the 
Constitution. De facto, women continue to be discriminated against in many ways and in 
different sectors. Societal attitudes and gender norms, which arise out of patrilineal and 
patrilocal practices, put women at a disadvantage and increase the risk of women being 
subjected to violence in the family, community, and at the hands of or with the 
acquiescence of State agents. 
</p>
<p>10. Approximately 50 per cent of women are married by the age of 18. Education has an 
important consequence on the age of marriage and women with secondary school education  
or higher get married more than seven years later than those with no education.2 More than 
one-quarter of young women aged 15-19 have already begun childbearing: 22 per cent are 
mothers and an additional 6 per cent are pregnant with their first child. Young motherhood 
is more common in rural areas than in urban areas.3 The 2007 maternal mortality rate for 
Zambia was 591 per 100,000 live births.4 
</p>
<p>11. About 60 per cent of women aged 15-49 interviewed in the ZDHS were employed 
compared with almost 100 per cent of men. According to the ZDHS, &#8220;among those who 
were employed, men were more likely to earn cash, while women were more likely to be 
unpaid&#8221;. Women who earned cash generally earned less than their husbands or partners. 
</p>
<p>12. HIV/AIDS has a disproportionate impact on the lives of women and girls as they 
carry the brunt of the burden generally in caring for people living with AIDS.<b> </b> In addition

</b></p>
<p>violence infringes the rights of women and girls and diminishes their ability to protect 
themselves against HIV/AIDS.<b> </b></p>
<p>13. The 2008 MDG Progress Report indicates that, while access to education has 
improved, challenges remain in terms of improving the quality of educational achievement. 
The status of girls&#8217; education is relatively good and the trend has shown a growth in their 
enrolment, which is at 98 per cent, compared to that of males, which is 96 per cent. Yet 
completion levels among female students remain lower than those of males. Females have 
higher dropout rates at all levels of the school system. Between 2003 and 2006 the ratio of 
girls to boys in primary school was fairly stable at a level close to 1.0. The ratio in 
secondary school seems to have undergone a notable decline from 0.0 to 0.73 during the 
same period. With regard to tertiary education, the years 2003-2007 saw a higher rate of 
enrolment of male students in the University than that of females despite affirmative action 
allowing 30 per cent extra places for females. Women continue to be underrepresented in 
technical and vocational education programmes, where they make up less than 20 per cent 
of enrolments, and are mainly involved in the traditional female occupations, such as 
hairdressing, secretarial work, health care, hotel work, garment manufacture and home 
economics. 
</p>
<p>14. Women in Zambia have limited access to productive resources such as land, and 
support services such as credit facilities. Women are disadvantaged by the lack of 
knowledge and/or understanding of the legal complexities that affect land matters such as 
how to register land, take ownership and contest land rights. Although the Government has 
started implementing affirmative action in allocating titled land to women, onerous 
requirements, including developing the land within short timelines coupled with persistent 
discriminatory practices related to land and inheritance issues continue to pose challenges 
to women&#8217;s access to land and their economic empowerment. Women&#8217;s access to credit 
remains limited as commercial banks require collaterals against loans which women are 
usually unable to provide as they do not own land or property.5 
</p>
<p>15. In terms of women participating in decision-making processes, women remain 
largely underrepresented at most levels of Government. The proportion of seats held by 
women in Parliament was 14 per cent in 2004 and 12 per cent in 2006, which is below the 
30 per cent and 50 per cent recommended by the Southern Africa Development Community 
and the African Union respectively. In October 2009 the Government reported that 
Parliament had 22 elected female members out of a total of 150. In 2009, at Cabinet level 3 
out of 26 portfolios were held by women. At the local government level, out of 1,422 
councillors, 94 are women; there are four female town clerks or council secretaries and a 
handful of heads of department in the 72 councils across the country. 6 Female 
representation in the justice system reflects similar trends: in the Supreme and High Courts 
out of a total of 43 judges, 13 are women (30.2 per cent); in the Magistrate Courts, out of a 
total of 119 magistrates, 27 are female (22.6 per cent) and in the local courts, out of 
approximately 808 justices, 90 are female (11.1 per cent).7

</p>
<p><b> IV. Manifestations of violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>16. Women in Zambia experience a variety of forms of violence including battery, 
sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, defilement and incest, inter alia. Violence against 
women is one of the most pervasive means by which gender inequalities are manifested and 
this has a strong nexus with the social, economic and cultural situation of women.  
</p>
<p>17. 47 per cent of Zambian women have suffered from physical violence at some point 
since the age of 15. One in ten women has experienced sexual violence.8 The 2005 Zambia 
Sexual Behaviour Study indicates that 15.1 per cent of female respondents reported having 
experienced forced sex and that 17.7 per cent of urban females and 13.7 per cent of rural 
females reported being subjected to sexual violence. According to reports, the age group of 
women most affected is the 20-24 age group. 54 per cent of Zambian women had suffered 
from spousal or partner abuse at some point in time, whether physical, emotional or sexual. 
Forty-three per cent of married women reported having experienced some form of physical 
or sexual violence by their husbands or partners in the year preceding the survey. 70 per 
cent of married women who had experienced physical violence report that the perpetrator of 
the violence was a current husband or partner. Women whose husbands or partners abused 
alcohol were more likely to suffer from physical or sexual violence than women whose 
husbands or partners did not. Furthermore, one in ten women reported having suffered from 
acts of physical violence during pregnancy. Sixty per cent of women and 50 per cent of 
men agree that a husband is justified in beating his wife for certain reasons.9 
</p>
<p>18. Gender inequality is prevalent in many sectors and is reflected in the low status and 
limited opportunities for women and girls. In addition to poverty, cultural and traditional 
practices continue to infringe the rights of women and girls. Some of the customary 
practices which contribute to discrimination against women and fuel violence include 
sexual cleansing,10 initiation ceremonies which indoctrinate young women to be submissive 
to male domination, early marriages, <i>malobola </i>or<i> lobola</i>, or bride price, and polygamy. 
</p>
<p>19. A strong patriarchal framework and the family structure favour men over women at 
all levels and in all spheres of life, posing serious impediments to the advancement of 
women. Although social attitudes are gradually changing, especially in urban settings, 
women continue to occupy a subordinate position, and remain economically dependent on 
men. 
</p>
<p>20. Many interlocutors the Special Rapporteur talked to expressed concern at the fact 
that the general population seems to condone violence as a way to solve conflicts 
particularly within the domestic sphere. The visit coincided with the 16 Days of Activism 
against Gender Based Violence, and the media was active in covering the issue of gender-
based violence. Nevertheless, views were articulated to the effect that the media reportedly 
contributes to fuelling the generic acceptance of violence, including against women and 
girls.11 
</p>
<p>  
 8 See footnote 2. 
 9 Ibid. 
 10 In many communities, there is a practice whereby the surviving female spouse is cleansed after the 
</p>
<p>death of her husband. The cleansing may be symbolic or may take the form of sexual intercourse with 
a member of the deceased spouse&#8217;s family. Someone who refuses to be cleansed is marginalized; 
hence many women subject themselves to this rite unwillingly.  
</p>
<p> 11 Discussion with interlocutors who did not provide specific examples. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>21. Domestic violence remains a serious problem in the country and beatings of women 
by intimate partners remains widespread. Throughout her visit, the Special Rapporteur 
heard numerous accounts of tragic stories of violence, such as that of a young woman, M. 
N., whose boyfriend cut her face and ear, or that of another woman, B. L., whose husband 
stabbed her with a broken bottle, slicing off part of her nose and then continued punching 
and kicking her as she lay on the ground. 
</p>
<p>22. Many women are subjected to violence not only by their husbands but also by their 
husbands&#8217; families. The practice of <i>malobolo or lobola</i>, bride price, is still widespread in 
the country, and this leads the husband and in-law family to believe that they have 
purchased the bride and therefore are allowed to subject their &#8220;property&#8221; to violence and 
other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>23. Early marriages still persist, particularly in rural areas, as parents perceive a girl 
child as a source of wealth. It is also reported that the practice of early marriages may 
contribute to high maternal mortality rates in the country as women who die in childbirth 
are mostly young and undergo prolonged labour or other complications. The persistence of 
early marriages combined with bride price places young girls in an extremely vulnerable 
position. 
</p>
<p>24. Yet the available official statistics do not appear to reveal the true extent of the 
problem of domestic violence. In 2009, the Victim Support Unit of the Police Force 
reported, inter alia, 244 cases of rape, 188 cases of indecent assault, 45 cases of threats of 
violence, and 53 cases of use of insulting language. Looking closely at the data on rape, for 
example, the majority of reported cases, i.e. 131 out of the 244 mentioned above, had not 
reached the court. A number of barriers impede higher rates of reporting of incidents of 
domestic violence. Women prefer to conciliate with the perpetrator mostly because of 
family and social pressures and because of economic dependence on the perpetrator. Access 
to the formal justice system is difficult for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 
women do not trust the system, as it has failed to hold perpetrators accountable.12 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Defilement 
</b></p>
<p>25. Violence against children and particularly girl children is also pervasive in the 
country. A number of illustrative cases were brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. 
These include the case of G.M., a 13-year-old girl, who was raped by the uncle she was 
living with following her mother&#8217;s death. G., a 14-year-old girl, was sexually abused at the 
age of six by her three older stepbrothers, while B.M., an orphan from Chinsali, was 
continuously raped by the uncle who was providing her with shelter and education. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur heard on various occasions that cases of defilement13 had 
been on the rise. Statistics from the Victim Support Unit confirmed that cases of defilement 
had been increasing, from 696 cases reported in 2007 to 1,676 cases reported in 2009. 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See V1, F.1 below.  
 13 The Penal Code defines defilement as &#8220;any person who unlawfully and carnally knows any child 
</p>
<p>commits a felony and is liable, upon conviction, to a term of imprisonment of not less than 15 years 
and may be liable to imprisonment for life&#8221; (section 138).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women in the transnational arena  
</b></p>
<p>27. Zambia is a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children 
trafficked for forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking occurs within 
the country&#8217;s borders where women and children from rural areas are exploited in cities in 
involuntary domestic servitude or other types of forced labour. To a lesser extent, Zambia is 
a destination country for migrants from Malawi and Mozambique who are exploited in 
forced labour or commercial sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>28. Women who are irregular migrants in the country are also exposed to higher risks of 
violence. The Special Rapporteur was informed that female migrants, particularly those 
engaging in sex work, are often subjected to sexual abuse. They are also unable to negotiate 
safe sex, thus becoming at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Women migrants are even more 
reluctant than Zambian women to seek assistance from law enforcement officers and health 
service providers because of their irregular status.14 
</p>
<p>29. Violence against women, including defilement, rape, early marriages and survival 
sex, continues to be a major problem affecting women asylum seekers and refugees, both 
those in camps and settlements and those residing in urban areas outside the designated 
settlements. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur observed that female detainees, whether in police custody or 
in prisons, have to endure harsh living conditions. During her visit, she observed that, for 
example, the living conditions in the women&#8217;s wing of Lusaka Central Prison could amount 
to degrading practices. Fifty-seven women inmates shared one cell and 59 shared another 
with two toilets and one shower in each cell for night use. For daytime use there were five 
additional toilets and showers. The prison administration provided inmates with two meals 
a day and additional food was brought in by families or donations. Those female detainees 
whose families were unable to visit them could only rely on the food provided by the prison 
administration and a share of what the prison received from donations. Cooking utensils 
and stoves were also generally brought by family members. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that female detainees, whether in police 
custody or in prisons, received little medical attention for pre-natal and post-natal care and 
treatment, and for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis testing, with little or no adequate nutrition 
support. Incarcerated pregnant women reported non-existent or inadequate pre- and post-
natal care and treatment. Pregnant women also faced stigma when accessing maternity care 
in public hospitals accompanied by prison officers.15 
</p>
<p>32. The Human Rights Commission is mandated by Section 9 of the Human Rights 
Commission Act, Chapter 48 of the Laws of Zambia, to assess and monitor the conditions 
in police and prison detention facilities, and it regularly undertakes inspections of such 
facilities throughout the country. The Commission reports point to general patterns of poor 
and degrading living conditions, including congestion of female wings in prisons, lack of 
adequate water and sanitation facilities, and dilapidated infrastructure not fit for human 
habitation. In addition, in many prison facilities including that visited by the Special 
Rapporteur, juvenile women offenders were held with adults; children and babies were

</b></p>
<p>living with their inmate mothers in distressing conditions; and female inmates on remand 
were held with female convicted inmates.16 
</p>
<p>33. Women in detention facilities are also allegedly subjected to abuse, violence and 
humiliating and degrading punishment in order to extract confessions. Women are also 
offered release in exchange for sex. In a number of prisons women inmates reported 
beatings, slapping and stroking with a stick as a form of punishment.17 The case of J.S., 
which was brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention, is emblematic. J.S. from Chainda 
died in police custody allegedly after being beaten and raped by police officers at the 
station where her husband had taken her to report a marital conflict, and to seek counselling 
from the Victim Support Unit. The police denied the allegations and claimed that J.S. 
hanged herself while in detention although the post-mortem did not reveal any sign of 
suicide by hanging. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Violence against girls in and around schools 
</b></p>
<p>34. Violence against girls in education establishments remains a problem. Surveys 
undertaken by civil society organizations revealed that sexual and physical forms of 
violence exist in schools and are mainly perpetrated against female pupils by male school 
staff and schoolboys.18 Girls are not only at risk of being subjected to violence in schools 
but also on the journey to and from school. Great distances to schools also render girls more 
vulnerable to harassment on the way. Girls are reported to have sexual relationships with 
minibus and taxi drivers as a way of coping with transport costs. In addition, weekly 
boarding pupils living in rented lodging and makeshift dormitories are more likely to suffer 
from violence and have a higher risk of dropping out of school due to pregnancy.19 
</p>
<p><b> V. Achievements in the State response to violence against 
women 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Developments in the legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur visited the country during a very exciting time concerning 
developments in the constitutional and legislative frameworks. The review process of the 
Constitution, which started in 2007 with the establishment of the National Constitutional 
Conference,20 was close to completion at the time of her visit. From 2007 to 2010 the 
National Conference led a participatory process of analysis and review of the current 
Constitution which included eight plenary sessions, 295 committee meetings, and the 
production of an initial report, the draft constitution and a final report.21

</p>
<p>36. The Draft Constitution of August 2010 contains a number of important 
advancements within the Bill of Rights and now includes provisions for the protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights and the rights of specific groups such as persons with 
disabilities, youth and older persons. Concerning women&#8217;s rights, the draft Bill has not 
retained proposals put forward during the National Constitutional Conference process to 
strengthen the protection of relevant rights including, for example, the right to reproductive 
health; to acquire, change or retain nationality; to choose residence and domicile; to 
guarantee guardianship and adoption rights; or to choose a family name, inter alia. The 
Draft Constitution provides for the establishment of a Gender Equality Commission 
mandated to &#8220;promote respect for gender equality and the protection, development and 
attainment of gender equality&#8221; (Article 246). The Special Rapporteur learned, subsequent to 
her visit, that Parliament rejected the draft Constitution on 29 March 2011, except for the 
Bill of Rights which, like the Constitution, must be approved by referendum. 
</p>
<p>37. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the general excitement concerning the 
Anti-Gender Based Violence Bill 2010, which was before Parliament. She subsequently 
took note with appreciation that the Bill was passed by Parliament, in February 2011, and, 
at the time of writing, was awaiting Presidential approval. The production of specific 
legislation aimed at providing protection for women who have been subjected to violence is 
long overdue. The first step leading to the current Bill dates back to 2000 when the 
Technical Committee on Strengthening of Laws, Enforcement Mechanisms and Support 
Systems relating to Gender-Based Violence, particularly against Women and Children was 
constituted to make recommendations to deal with this problem. The Committee 
recommended, inter alia, that gender violence be defined and criminalized, and that specific 
legislation be enacted to address violence against women and children.22 The 
recommendations of the Committee led to the enactment of the Penal Code Amendment 
Act No. 15 of 2005 which made the provisions of the Penal Code related to violence against 
women and children (Chapter XV) more punitive. These amendments also created the new 
offences of sexual harassment and harmful cultural practices. 
</p>
<p>38. This Bill, which, according to stakeholders, went through a highly consultative 
process, is believed by many to introduce important innovations. It stipulates that one single 
act may amount to gender-based violence (Section 4); it focuses on protecting the victims, 
including removing them from violent environments and making provision for the creation 
of Government-run shelters; it creates the Anti Gender-Based Violence Committee with a 
monitoring and advisory role (Section 31); and it establishes the Anti-Gender Based 
Violence Fund (Section 32) to provide basic material support to victims, including 
counselling and rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>39. The Intestate Succession Act was enacted in 1989 with the purpose of regulating 
inheritance for individuals who die without a will and eradicating the practice of property 
grabbing, which has disproportionately affected surviving female spouses and children. 
Although the adoption of this law represented an important step forward, grabbing of 
property has remained an extensive practice partly due to the fact that penalties provided 
for depriving beneficiaries of property and assets do not sufficiently act as a deterrent and

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>social norms continue unchanged.23 This law also fails to address negative mourning rites, 
such as &#8220;sexual cleansing&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p>40. Concerning the Government&#8217;s response to addressing trafficking in persons, the 
Anti-Human Trafficking Act of 2008 criminalized all forms of trafficking and prescribed 
penalties that range from 25 years to life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>41. While statutory laws such as those above may provide for formal equality for 
women, the day-to-day life of the majority of the Zambian population is governed by 
customs and traditions which inform customary laws and practices. These are administered 
by local courts insofar as they are not repugnant to natural justice, morality or incompatible 
with written law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Developments in the institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Office of the Minister for Gender and Women in Development evolved over 
time. It began as a Women&#8217;s Desk prior to 1984. In 1996 it was integrated into the Cabinet 
Office with the mandate to provide leadership in coordinating and monitoring gender 
mainstreaming. In 2006 the position of Minister responsible for Gender and Women in 
Development was established and in 2008 the position of Deputy Minister was added. The 
department was given the status of National Women&#8217;s Machinery as it is the Government 
department responsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of 
the National Gender Policy. The Office also manages the implementation of the Joint 
Gender Support Programme, 2008-2011, which provides the national medium-term 
framework for development cooperation in the promotion of gender equality and the 
empowerment of women. For the first time in 2010, the Office obtained a stand-alone 
budget from Cabinet.25 
</p>
<p>43. The National Gender Policy adopted in 2000 provides guidelines on integrating 
gender issues into all national development processes. It also contains the main 
commitments of the Government in the elimination of violence against women including 
the following: promotion of awareness-raising campaigns to change harmful traditional 
practices; encouragement of victims to report all cases of violence and sexual abuse; 
establishment of mechanisms to coordinate efforts between the police, social workers and 
legal personnel; establishment of institutions in charge of the rehabilitation of women and 
girl victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>44. In April 2010 the Gender and Women in Development Office also produced the 
National Plan of Action on Gender-Based Violence (NPA-GBV), 2010-2014 in order to 
facilitate the implementation of previous recommendations scattered across several national 
policies, plans of action and reports. The Plan focuses on four main strategic areas: 
legislative and policy review; advocacy and awareness creation; capacity-building of 
relevant stakeholders involved in the delivery of interventions against gender-based 
violence such as psychological support, health services and security and protection; 
strengthening the coordinating mechanisms. The Gender and Women in Development 
Office has produced comprehensive National Guidelines on the management of cases of 
gender-based violence which are aimed at providing a uniform and clear framework to 
manage cases of violence against women and girls.

</p>
<p>45. In November 2010 the Government adopted the National Gender Communication 
Strategy which seeks to change the negative perceptions and attitudes towards gender that 
have perpetuated gender inequalities in the country. 
</p>
<p>46. The Government also has in place a system of Gender Focal Points in all Ministries 
and provincial administrations. On paper, these focal points are to be nominated at a senior 
level. In practice, these functions are often delegated to junior officers. The efficacy of the 
focal point system remains to be assessed, as terms of reference for these focal points had 
only recently been drawn up and allocation of additional resources for the officers acting as 
gender focal points had not yet been determined. 
</p>
<p>47. The Ministry of Community Development and Social Services, through its two 
departments of social welfare and community development, is mandated to deal with 
victims of human trafficking and to provide for the protection of children who have been 
subjected to abuse, neglect and exploitation. It also has a variety of support programmes for 
women including the organization and management of groups, and the provision of skills 
for income-generating activities in order to reduce women&#8217;s economic dependency. The 
Ministry has also collaborated in a number of awareness-raising activities on gender-based 
violence conducted through school debates, door-to-door campaigns in communities, 
mobile video shows and road shows, community drama activities, and television and radio 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>48. The Government&#8217;s response to HIV/AIDS has shown sustained commitment to 
invest resources and strategies to address the challenges of HIV/AIDS. The National AIDS 
Strategic Framework 2011-2015 aims at providing an overall strategy for the planning, 
coordination and implementation of the multi-sectoral response based on available evidence 
and emerging social and epidemiological issues. The framework is guided by a number of 
fundamental principles including the adoption of a human rights-based and gender-sensitive 
approach recognizing that the epidemic in Zambia has a gender bias.26 The National Plan of 
Action to reduce HIV infection among women and girls 2010-2014 aims at reducing 
women and girls&#8217; vulnerability to HIV infection and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS at 
individual, household, community and institutional levels through sustained action to 
strengthen the implementation of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights. 
</p>
<p>49. In Parliament, the Committee on Legal Affairs, Governance, Human Rights and 
Gender Matters was created in 1999 with the task of ensuring that gender issues are given 
priority and prominence in the governmental activities overseen by the Parliament, and also 
in legislative and policy processes. 
</p>
<p>50. The Human Rights Commission was established in 1996 by virtue of article 125 of 
the Constitution and its mandate is articulated in the Human Rights Commission Act, 
Chapter 48 of the Laws of Zambia. The Commission has established five thematic 
committees including one on Gender Equality Rights whose priorities are legal 
empowerment of women and initiatives to eradicate violence against women. At the time of 
the visit the Commission had conducted a number of legal literacy programmes in rural 
communities whereby 1,760 people had been trained, half men (headmen) and half women 
in almost every province. Despite the important work the Commission has conducted over 
the years, it remains understaffed and under-resourced and has to rely on other State entities 
for the implementation of its recommendations.

</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional and legal reform 
</b></p>
<p>51. Although the draft Constitution is a very considerable overall achievement, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates her concerns at the fact that article 23.4 in the current 
Constitution which permits discriminatory laws and practices in the area of personal and 
customary laws has been retained in the draft text (article 48) despite the guarantee of equal 
status of women found in article 11 of the current Constitution. Despite the numerous calls 
by national and international entities including the United Nations Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee, both the current and draft Constitutions stipulate that in case of conflict 
between customary and statutory laws, the former prevails and excludes the application of 
the gender equality principle in matters such as &#8220;adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, 
devolution of property on death&#8221; (Article 23.4(c)). 
</p>
<p>52. A number of stakeholders the Special Rapporteur met expressed concern at the 
inclusion of the expression &#8220;life begins at conception&#8221; in article 40 of the draft Constitution 
as they fear it may limit women&#8217;s access to reproductive health services including access to 
safe abortion services even when their lives were at risk. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur acknowledged that the Anti-Gender-Based Violence Bill 
2010 is an important step forward in providing frameworks that should be ultimately 
conducive to stepping up the fight against all forms of violence against women. However, 
because the Bill is so comprehensive, it appears ambitious and is not accompanied, to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s knowledge, by financial and capacity-building plans, which are key to 
its effective implementation. 
</p>
<p>54. While choosing to focus this Bill on the protection of women and girls rather than 
on definitions and criminalization of acts of violence and abuse, it was generally agreed that 
a complete reform of the response to gender-based violence would not be effective without 
a parallel review of certain criminal aspects. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur noted 
the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2010, passed by Parliament in February 2011, which 
revises certain penal provisions related to sexual offences and most importantly introduces 
a minimum punishment of 15 years for the offence of rape. However, the definition of what 
constitutes rape could be broadened to reflect developments in international law. 
Furthermore, the offence of marital rape is still considered neither an offence nor an 
aggravated circumstance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislation pertaining to violence against the girl child 
</b></p>
<p>55. Concerning defilement and abuse of children the word &#8220;unlawful&#8221; in article 138 of 
the Penal Code is problematic as it may suggest that there are instances in which one may 
have lawful carnal knowledge of a child.27 The age of the child (16) in section 138 is not in 
conformity with international human rights standards. In addition the offence of defilement 
appears to be perceived as possible only against girls whereas the Penal Code uses the term 
&#8220;child&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  
 27 As reiterated by the Supreme Court in <i>Rex. v. Chinjamba, </i>under customary law there is no minimum 
</p>
<p>age for marriage and thus there can be lawful carnal knowledge of a child, which remains, however, 
contrary to international human rights obligations. While the Government is to be commended for 
discouraging the practice of underage marriages, it should also seek to address this anomaly.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>56. The Marriage Act stipulates a minimum age of 21 for a marriage to be contracted 
without the consent of parents or guardians. A number of provisions of this Act relating to 
age exemptions are however problematic. Section 33, for example, considers null and void 
a marriage between persons either of whom is under the age of 16 years. However, the 
same section is not applicable when a High Court judge has given consent to the marriage 
after receiving an application and being satisfied that the case is not contrary to public 
interest. In addition, section 17 permits a marriage when either party is less than 21 years of 
age, with the consent of the parents or guardians. This section, however, does not specify 
the minimum age of its application, thus increasing the likelihood that marriages may be 
contracted by 16-year-olds and possibly younger persons, where there is parental consent. 
Finally, section 34 stipulates that &#8220;nothing in this Act shall affect the validity of any 
marriage contracted under or in accordance with any African customary law, or in any 
manner, apply to marriages so contracted&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Statistics and data collection 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur noted limitations in current efforts in collecting data related 
to violence against women. A number of governmental entities and civil society 
organizations collect data on violence against women, each of them for their own purposes 
and frequently at micro level and through individualized data collection tools, which makes 
data analysis cumbersome.28 The available statistics are not consistently and coherently 
brought to the macro level and analysed in a comprehensive way. In addition, general 
statistics on crime, such as those related to murder, are not disaggregated by the sex of the 
offender or the victim. The lack of systematic disaggregated data, and a system to manage 
in a centralized manner the data and information available, has affected the ability to 
provide a comprehensive situation analysis in relation to violence against women. This has 
consequently impacted planning and decision-making responses.    
</p>
<p>58. The Zambia Law Development Commission while undertaking research for the 
development of comprehensive legislation to combat gender-based violence found it &#8220;very 
difficult to obtain useful data to show the extent of the problem&#8221;.29 It was, therefore, unable 
to fully ascertain whether the rise in reported cases was due to a rise in crime, or to 
increased awareness of rights and remedies and thus increased reporting of violence, and 
also whether interventions put in place have been effective. During her visit, the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s observations confirmed this uncertainty.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Social and cultural context of women 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to the National Gender Policy,30 certain cultural beliefs and customs have 
perpetuated gender imbalances which have disadvantaged women. These include traditional 
ways of socializing girls and boys, which are transmitted through formal and informal 
institutions such as the family, schools, places of work and courts of law. Certain roles 
assigned to girls tend to make them submissive and foster an inferiority complex. Boys on 
the other hand are assigned roles which are highly valued and are prepared for becoming 
decision-makers. 
</p>
<p>60. The assigned roles within the family and community affect women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; 
performance in education, employment and other aspects of life, whereas these roles lead

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>men and boys to dominate in decision-making at household and community level as well as 
to control family and community assets.31 
</p>
<p>61. The persistence of beliefs and roles which privilege men as holders of authority 
within the family and society, continue to contribute to high levels of violence against 
women. For example, spouse beating by a man is still regarded as a domestic issue and 
therefore a private affair. A number of practices in various communities also tend to limit 
women&#8217;s access to and ownership of property, including traditional land, particularly in 
rural areas, despite such communities being dominated by females. 
</p>
<p><b> E. HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>62. Zambia has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world with an adult HIV 
prevalence rate of 14.3 per cent in 2007, with a gender breakdown of 16.1 per cent women 
and 12.3 per cent men living with HIV/AIDS. Nearly 80 per cent of all Zambians infected 
with HIV are under the age of 25. Younger women and older men are mostly infected with 
HIV with prevalence reaching a peak for women in the 30-34 age group. In 2009 an 
estimated 82,681 adults were newly infected with HIV, 59 per cent of whom were women 
and 41 per cent men. It is further estimated that for every two people on treatment, five 
more are newly infected, of whom three are women.32 
</p>
<p>63. HIV prevalence in Zambian prisons appears to be significantly higher (27 per cent) 
than the prevalence in the general adult population, although systemic data on this is not yet 
available. Access to treatment, care and support is available in larger prisons but almost 
non-existent in smaller settings that lack general prison-based health services. Prison 
confinement may increase vulnerability to HIV due to unprotected sex in the form of rape, 
non-availability and non-use of condoms as well as the high prevalence of STIs.33 
</p>
<p>64. It is established that gender inequalities fuel the epidemic and hamper efforts to 
prevent new infections among women. Women&#8217;s subordinate status within intimate 
relationships, their economic dependence on male partners and their fear of being 
abandoned or assaulted make it difficult for them to negotiate safe sex and to use condoms 
consistently. 34 Culturally women are taught never to refuse to have sex with their husbands 
regardless of the number of extra-marital partners they may have or their unwillingness to 
use condoms, even when they are suspected to have HIV or sexually transmitted infections. 
Socialization processes include traditional and cultural initiation ceremonies whereby 
women are taught to accept that men can have multiple partners, and can initiate violence 
within a marital relationship. The low use of condoms in marital and other stable 
relationships is also due to pressure on women to demonstrate their fertility.35 
</p>
<p>65. Violence against women may constitute an obstacle to women accessing HIV 
testing, counselling and treatment services. Perpetrators of violence against women are 
mainly current or former husbands or live-in partners, boyfriends and male relatives. Thus 
for the majority of victims, fear of abandonment, divorce and the consequent loss of 
property may compel women to hide their HIV status and their antiretroviral treatment.36

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>Conversely, women&#8217;s inability to protect their access to property and resources because of 
the structural deficiencies of both the justice and societal systems may impede their 
adherence to antiretroviral treatment. Widows and divorcees in particular, who may be 
deprived of all assets by partners and in-laws, are often unable to afford transportation costs 
to regularly visit clinics, and obtain adequate food and nutrition, which are essential for the 
success of antiretroviral treatment.37 
</p>
<p><b> F. Lack of effective remedies  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>66. Among the stakeholders that the Special Rapporteur met with, there is general 
agreement that there is widespread impunity in relation to cases of violence against women 
and that underreporting of cases of violence against women remains extensive. In addition 
the formal justice system is mostly inaccessible to women due to geographical distance, 
cumbersome and lengthy procedures, and lack of protection of and support for victims. 
</p>
<p>67. The penalties for offences related to violence against women are quite severe, with 
maximum jail terms of life imprisonment for rape, seven years for abduction and life 
imprisonment for defilement and incest with girls aged under twelve years old. Unlike 
offences of murder and aggravated robbery, which are tried by the High Court, all offences 
against morality, including those related to violence against women, are not categorized as 
serious crimes and as such do not reach the High Court. Such categorization, compounded 
by judicial discretion in the subordinate courts, result in hardly any cases of violence 
against women, regardless of their gravity, being tried by the High Court.  
</p>
<p>68. A number of additional criminal procedural and evidentiary elements remain 
problematic. Section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that subordinate courts 
may promote reconciliation for assault and other offences not amounting to a felony. This 
provides an avenue whereby many cases are not prosecuted, as victims tend to favour 
reconciliation, due to imbalance in power relations and economic dependence. In addition, 
if victims are unable or unwilling to cooperate during the investigation or trial stages, it is 
difficult for the investigation and prosecution to continue <i>proprio motu.</i>38 
</p>
<p>69. Although section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for the medical 
examination of the accused person at any time during the trial by order of the court, there is 
no way of compelling an accused person to provide specimens during investigations. This 
may lead to loss of evidence, especially in sexual assault cases. 
</p>
<p>70. Additionally, offences related to violence against women are bailable according to 
section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which permits bail upon provision of 
sufficient sureties except in cases of murder, treason, aggravated robbery and theft of motor 
vehicles if a person is a subsequent offender. If the offender is admitted to bail, he may 
intimidate the witnesses and the victims, especially when they are related or know each 
other.39 
</p>
<p>71. Forensic expertise and equipment remain insufficient particularly to conduct DNA 
analysis. DNA samples are currently sent to South Africa for analysis. 
</p>
<p>  
 37 Ibid. 
 38 Section 157 (vii) of the Criminal Procedure Code states that unless a court otherwise allows, all evidence must be 
</p>
<p>taken from the witness box. 
 39 The Anti-Gender Based Violence Bill provides for protection orders to address concerns related to 
</p>
<p>witness and victim protection.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur was also informed by the women she interviewed in the 
Lusaka Central Prison that access to legal representation is a daunting challenge. Many 
women detainees meet their defence counsels for the first time in courtrooms and legal aid 
counsels often do not provide professional services to them. 
</p>
<p>73. The Victim Support Unit was created in 1994 by virtue of the Police Service 
Amendments Act No. 14 of 1999 with the mandate to deal with cases of child abuse, 
human trafficking, spousal abuse, victimization of elders and rape and sexual harassment. 
The Unit may mediate in a reported case, investigate a complaint, offer counselling and 
apprehend and prosecute the offenders. While the Unit represents a significant step forward 
in the police response to violence against women, it is not in a position to fill the structural 
gaps highlighted in this report. In particular the Unit is compelled to operate within a 
formal justice system which generally disadvantages women and a societal system where 
customary laws and practices are predominantly used. In addition there is no system in 
place to follow up on the situation of women who report cases and return to their families 
and communities. Efforts by the Unit are also curtailed by a number of problems 
concerning logistics, transport, and human resources, especially in the provinces. In 
addition there are generally no private rooms where victims can be interviewed, and 
insufficient numbers of same-sex police officers to conduct interviews. Despite ongoing 
efforts to train officers in psychosocial counselling, human rights, gender and women&#8217;s 
rights, many of the challenges remain. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Application of customary law 
</b></p>
<p>74. Zambian ethnic groups practise their customs and traditions and apply them in their 
day-to-day lives. However the application of customary law and practices may give rise to a 
number of difficulties, particularly in relation to women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>75. At the local level victims&#8217; families more often opt for compensation through 
customary institutions rather than pursuing criminal proceedings through the formal system. 
This mainly results from family and societal pressure, economic dependence on the 
perpetrator, and the challenges identified above as regards the formal justice system. 
</p>
<p>76. Local courts, which replaced native courts, administer justice according to 
customary law by virtue of the Local Courts Act, chapter 29 of the Laws of Zambia. They 
are at the lowest level in the hierarchy of the courts, and the most popular as they are cheap 
(litigants do not need lawyers), simple in nature and procedure, and easily accessible 
(generally present in every district and community). Besides simple torts, contracts and 
petty crimes, the main workload of local courts is the law relating to non-statutory 
marriages, namely divorce, reconciliation, custody of children, payment of <i>malobola or 
lobola</i>, pregnancy suits, compensation for adultery, elopement and devolution of the 
property of persons who die without a will. 
</p>
<p>77. There are a number of structural shortcomings in the functioning of local courts 
which, considering that the main workload relates to issues related to women&#8217;s rights, may 
affect women&#8217;s access to effective remedies including concerning cases of interpersonal 
violence. For example, legal representation in local courts is excluded in all civil matters 
and may be allowed under exceptional circumstances in criminal cases. Also, prosecution 
services are limited in these courts. The Special Rapporteur learned that in local courts 
messengers are de facto used as prosecutors, a practice which is not legal but tolerated 
because of the failure of the Directorate of the Public Prosecutions to provide prosecution

<p>78. Local court justices complain of distressing working conditions and low salaries 
which are frequently not paid on time. The conditions of service of local court justices, 
including accommodation, transport and subsistence allowances, as well as their training </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>needs, are neglected. Efforts to improve the conditions of the judiciary have mostly focused 
on the High Court and the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>79. There is a disproportionate gender imbalance in the staffing position of local courts. 
It has been argued that, in rural areas, when a vacancy for a court justice occurs, the local 
court officer requests the area chiefs to submit names for consideration by the Judicial 
Service Commission, and that the local chiefs seem to be inclined towards male 
candidates.40 
</p>
<p>80. These deficiencies notwithstanding, the potential of local courts and customary law 
may not have been fully explored. Customary laws and local courts, which have a fluid and 
evolving nature, have the ability to depart from the strict application of customary laws, 
particularly where this would lead to discriminatory, unfair and oppressive results - 
depending on the leadership of such forums. Some positive developments that were shared 
with the Special Rapporteur included, for example, instances of local courts ordering, in 
divorce cases, the payment of a lump sum or periodic maintenance instead of only ordering 
a distribution of domestic property, as was previously the case. Others have introduced the 
notion of the best interest and welfare of the child in cases of child custody.41 Such judicial 
decisions reflect the possibilities for jurisprudence which reflects the human rights norms of 
equality, justice and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Coordinated response  
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur noted that there are no policy guidelines across the health, 
psychosocial, or legal sectors mandating coordinated, prompt and supportive services to 
victims. Counselling services are generally not available except in some of the shelters run 
by civil society organizations and some of the one stop centres existing in certain hospitals. 
With respect to the provision of psychosocial support, many social workers have no 
specific training in addressing cases of violence against women, have little institutional 
support, large caseloads, and extremely limited resources, thus resulting in difficulties in 
providing adequate services to victims. 
</p>
<p>82. With regard to the health sector response, the Special Rapporteur noted that there 
does not seem to be a policy or guideline on dealing with gender-based violence, nor do 
health professionals have adequate capacity to routinely identify and manage such cases. 
Most hospitals and clinics lack adequate drugs, equipment and supplies to diagnose or treat 
problems associated with violence against women. 
</p>
<p>83. According to the Medical Practitioners Act, only medical practitioners could 
complete the medical reports required for prosecution of cases of violence against women 
which resulted in the exclusion of peri-urban and rural areas, mostly staffed by clinical 
officers and nurses. The Health Professions Act No. 24 of 2009, which repealed and 
replaced the previous Act, has filled the legal gap as it no longer restricts who may make a 
complete medical report in these cases. De facto, however, there seems to be continuing 
adherence to the old law. Further, the Special Rapporteur learned that, although medical 
forms should be provided free of charge, there are practices whereby police stations charge 
victims for photocopying the forms, as these stations do not have regular funds for 
replacing stationery. While commending the work of the One Stop Centre at the University 
Teaching Hospital in Lusaka and the Coordinated Response Centre of Mazabuka Hospital, 
which she visited, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that victims have to pay for 
medical forensic examinations where such services are available. 
</p>

 41 Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>84. The One Stop Centre in the University Teaching Hospital provides a comprehensive 
response to sexually abused children (between 0 and 15 years) which include medical tests 
and treatment, including post-exposure prophylaxis, coordination with the Victim Support 
Unit for delivery of medical and other forms and preparation of prosecution files, and 
provision of expert evidence in court. It is regrettable that there are so few centres of this 
type (there are only six) and the comprehensive service they provide is mostly not available 
in ordinary health centres. In addition the One Stop Centre is unable to follow closely the 
cases of those who do not return to the Centre and cannot trace the level of prosecution 
unless this information is reported by those victims who return to the centre for follow-up. 
There is no protocol among the centre, police and prosecution services for a systematic 
tracking and follow-up system. Regrettably this type of centre is primarily financially 
supported by donors. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the information she received 
whereby the 6th National Development Plan includes one budget line for supporting the 
Lusaka One Stop Centre. 
</p>
<p>85. Another major gap is the fact that the Government has not so far funded any shelter 
to house victims of abuse and violence who run away from their abusers. Currently there 
appear to be approximately eight safe houses including shelters and drop-in centres run by 
the Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association and the A Safer Zambia (ASAZA) coalition. 
While commending the work of civil society organizations in filling this gap, the Special 
Rapporteur noted with concern that the due diligence obligation to protect women from 
violence rests upon the State. 
</p>
<p>86. Women who experience violence have difficulty in obtaining information on their 
rights and on the services available to them, and often lack legal representation in court 
cases. Despite the provision of free legal aid for those who cannot afford legal costs, this 
has not to date had a significant impact due to the limited capacity and resources of the 
Legal Aid Board. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government has secured a number of important legal and institutional 
achievements in the areas of gender, equality and protection from violence against 
women in the context of complex and difficult social and economic challenges. Yet 
these achievements have not translated into concrete improvements in the lives of the 
majority of women in the country, who remain marginalized, discriminated against 
and at high risk of being subjected to violence. Women&#8217;s access to justice and 
protection is impeded by generalized impunity, limited numbers of shelters, lack of or 
insufficient legal representation and limited awareness of their rights, as well as by 
economic dependency and societal reluctance to recognize numerous forms of violence 
as crimes and human rights violations requiring serious attention. The persistence of 
negative customary and religious practices, despite efforts by State institutions to 
regulate some of them, continues to exacerbate discrimination against women and 
women&#8217;s position of dependence and subordination. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer to the 
Government the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Law and policy reforms  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government and all State institutions should work together to repeal 
Article 23.4c of the current Constitution (article 48 of the draft Constitution) as a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>matter of priority in order to render the constitutional framework of the country 
compliant with the international human rights obligations the State has assumed.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Government should organize the referendum required to validate the draft 
Bill of Rights, as quickly as possible, so as to address current protection gaps. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The enactment of the Anti-Gender-Based Violence Bill should be promptly 
completed; and should be accompanied by dedicated budget allocations for its 
effective implementation, and also accompanied by action plans to build the capacity 
of all relevant actors. In addition, the Fund to be established in accordance with this 
bill should aim at strengthening and ensuring continuity in the work that civil society 
organizations have been commendably doing, including the running of shelters for 
and the provision of coordinated responses to women and girls victims of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Legislation should be enacted to establish an effective and independent Gender 
Equality Commission, with an equivalent status to that of the Human Rights 
Commission. The Commission should strive to complement the work on gender 
equality and women&#8217;s rights that existing bodies have carried out thus far. It should 
also be provided with adequate resources to effectively exercise its mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Additional amendments to the Penal Code that should be considered include: 
review of the definition of rape; introduction of aggravating circumstances for the 
crime of rape, such as when it is committed within intimate relations; review of the 
definition of defilement, age of the child in defilement offences; exceptions for 
marriages under 16 years of age; review of the category of relatives who may be 
considered as committing incest to include extended family members who take care of 
children. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>As regards corporal punishment, the Local Courts Act allowing for corporal 
punishment should be amended to reflect the jurisprudence emanating from the 1999 
High Court case which found corporal punishment to be unconstitutional.42 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should monitor the implementation of the Health Professions 
Act particularly as it relates to the provision of medical reports in violence against 
women cases. Educative work on this law should also be an integral part of its 
implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Government has taken a number of positive steps to encourage girls&#8217; 
education, including bursaries for vulnerable girls, the building of high schools for 
girls in every province, and the introduction of the re-entry policy promoting girls&#8217; 
return to school after giving birth. Further measures are necessary to make schools 
violence-free environments. In this respect the Ministry of Education, should, as a 
matter of urgency, develop and adopt regulations to prevent and protect schoolgirls 
from violence as well as put in place frameworks and systems for effective 
implementation of such regulations as directed by the High Court in 2008.43 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Affirmative action measures should be adopted to increase the participation of 
women in the political, economical, social, cultural and judicial sectors, particularly to 
reverse the gender imbalance in these sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government should ensure sustainability of the budget of the Gender in 
Development Division to enable it to carry out effectively its main task of integrating 
and coordinating gender in all public policies and strategies. 
</b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Measures should be taken to strengthen the provision of legal aid to women 
who have been subjected to violence, including those charged with murder of the 
abuser.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government should take the necessary measures to ensure that interviews 
of victims and witnesses of violence be held in separate rooms in police stations. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Government should sanction those entities which charge women victims of 
violence for medical reports and other forms and should provide all offices with 
adequate stationery supplies. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Legislation should be amended to establish that responsibility for prosecuting 
violence against women lies with the prosecution authorities and not with the 
survivors of violence, and to explicitly prohibit conciliation in all cases of violence 
against women, both before and during legal proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Legislation should be amended to mandate proper collection of, and the timely 
testing of collected medical and forensic evidence, and the submission to court of 
medical and forensic evidence where possible. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In cases where it is warranted, the Government should take those measures, 
whether legislative, administrative or other, necessary to provide victims with 
alternative means of giving evidence without having to confront the defendants. This 
could be ensured, for example, through the use of in-camera proceedings, as it is 
currently permitted in the trials of juveniles. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Government should take measures to establish a coordinated and 
integrated referral system to include all sectors such as the health, police, legal, social 
welfare and education sectors with a view to addressing the protection needs of 
women and girls who have been subjected to violence. To this end, regulations, 
protocols and instructions should be developed to provide clear guidance to 
practitioners. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Statistics and data collection 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Government should establish a system for standardized data collection and 
analysis, disaggregated by sex, race, age, ethnicity and other relevant characteristics, 
in order to understand the magnitude, trends and patterns of the problem. 
Monitoring and evaluation tools must also be developed to evaluate progress made in 
eradicating violence against women in a clear systematic way. Such tools should also 
be devised and integrated in the demographic and health surveys. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Social and cultural context of women 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Legislative efforts must be continuously pursued alongside widespread 
endeavours to educate and change the mindsets of men, women and children, through 
all available means including schools, the media, and traditional and religious leaders. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Government jointly with the customary law entities should clarify the 
relationship and boundaries between customary laws and institutions and the civil 
and criminal justice system. Creative ways must be found to codify victims&#8217; right to be 
treated in accordance with human rights and gender equality standards. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The media should be trained and sensitized to issues related to women&#8217;s rights 
generally and violence against women in particular, in order to contribute to changing 
the predominant social and cultural beliefs and attitudes that are harmful to women. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>110. <b>Capacity-building for all those involved in providing responses to women who 
have been subjected to violence should as a minimum continue, be strengthened, 
systematized and tailored to the specificities of every sector concerned. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the support provided to date by 
international organizations and donor agencies in the promotion of gender equality 
and the fight against violence against women and encourages them to continue 
working with the Government particularly to implement the above recommendations. 
In particular she would like to recommend that United Nations and international 
specialized agencies support the National Human Rights Commission in carrying out 
its mandated tasks, including those related to the promotion and protection of 
women&#8217;s human rights, in both the public and private spheres.
