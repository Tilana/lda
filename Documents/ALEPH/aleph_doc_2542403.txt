      to such expenditure,  the Company shall retain the right to participate on
      the same  basis as the  investors  in  future  expenditure  programs  on a
      pro-rata basis.  Should the Company not provide the requested funds within

      such manner as may  reasonably  be negotiated  between the parties.  As of
      April 30, 2005, $496,619 (2004 - $475,584) had been spent on the property.
      During the year ended April 30, 2005, the Company  expended $4,207 (2004 -

      commercial  project on one or more of the leases is economic and wishes to
      construct  a  commercial  project,  the  Company is required to notify the

      will be  secured  by a lien,  first  charge or  security  interest  on the
      royalty lands, and that the royalty is assignable or transferable  subject

      each barrel of crude  bitumen  produced,  saved and sold from the project.
      The Company then bought back $0.0015 Canadian of the royalties for 200,000

10.   EARTH ENERGY LICENCE AGREEMENT
On August 12,  2003,  the Company  became  party to an  exclusive  license
      agreement  for  Canada,  Central  and  South  America  with  Earth  Energy
      Resources  Ltd.  ("Earth  Energy")  and West Peak  Ventures of Canada Ltd.
      ("West Peak") for the use of Earth Energy's proprietary catalytic process.
      The process includes a proprietary Catalyst in conjunction with processing
      equipment  to separate  hydrocarbons  from sand,  shale or oil.  Under the
      terms of the underlying  license agreement with Earth Energy,  the Company
      was to have paid $375,799, subject to certain conditions, of which it paid
      $106,508. The Company was also to pay a royalty of 5% and had the right to
      purchase  catalyst and processing  equipment  from Earth Energy  Resources
      Ltd. for cost plus 25%. In  conjunction  with this  agreement  the Company
      also had a three-year  option,  on the same terms,  on a Central and South
      American  license  agreement  with the exception that the license fee is a
      one-time payment of $500,000 US.
During the year ended April 30, 2005 the above noted licence agreement was
      cancelled  and  replaced  with a new  agreement  whereby the Company is to
      receive a 2.5% of gross revenue and 12.5% of net profits from product sold
      and income earned (the "Royalty")  from products and processes  related to
      certain patented chemical  formulations  utilized for applications related
      to the extraction of oil from surface mines tar sands,  oil shale and soil
      reclamation  (the  "Catalyst")  in Canada.  The  Company may also elect to
      receive a similar  Royalty  from Central and South  America,  subject to a
      payment of $500,000  that may be paid by way of offset and  forfeiture  of
      the first  $500,000 in Royalties.  Earth Energy has the right to name four
      entities and their affiliates upon which the Company will only receive 50%
      of the Royalty.  The Company also has the right to purchase the  Catalyst,
      at cost,  and  equipment  from  Earth  Energy,  at cost plus  25%,  on any
      properties  that the  Company  has a  greater  than 15%  interest.  As the
      present  value  of  this  agreement  is  currently   undeterminable,   the
      previously  recorded  licence costs have been written down by $106,507 and
      the licence is now recorded as $1.

      payable in either shares, subject to an effective registration  statement,
      or cash. Should the Company elect to make the monthly payment in cash then

12.   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES, continued
To finance the acquisition of the Eagles Nest Prospect the Company entered
      into a private  placement of its securities  whereby the Company issued 8%
      Convertible Notes (the "Notes") with stock purchase warrants for aggregate
      principal amount of $5,200,000 (the "Original Offering"),  all pursuant to
      a  Subscription   Agreement  (the   "Subscription   Agreement")  with  the
      purchasers.  Under  the  terms of the  Original  Offering,  the  Notes are
      convertible to shares of the Company's  common stock (the "Common  Stock")
      at $0.40 per share of Common Stock. However,  pursuant to the subscription
      agreement,  amounts not expended on successful bids,  associated costs and
      first year  rentals are to be refunded on a pro-rata  basis.  The refunded
      amount totals $4,472,813, as only $727,187 was used in connection with the
      acquisition of the Eagles Nest Parcel and related  costs.  Under the terms
      of the Original  Offering,  the purchasers  will also receive bonus shares
      equal  to  10%  of  the  refunded  amount   allocable  to  the  respective
      purchasers,  which  bonus  shares  will be issued at the rate of $0.40 per
      share.  Also,  purchasers  will receive  warrants based on one warrant per
      $0.40  invested  by a  purchaser,  after  the  refunded  amount  has  been
      distributed to the purchaser.  The warrants are  exercisable for two years
      from the issue date at an exercise price of $0.55 per share.
Effective  August 31, 2005, some of the purchasers  elected not to receive
      their pro-rata  portion of the refund  amount.  Rather,  those  purchasers
      elected to be included  under amended terms to the Original  Offering (the
      "Amended Offering").  Under the terms of the Amended Offering, a purchaser
      will  receive a new  convertible  promissory  note in the  amount of their
      principal  investment  not refunded  (the "New  Note"),  which New Note is
      convertible  into  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock at a per share
      conversion  price of $0.90 per share.  The purchaser will also receive one
      warrant for each $0.90 of principal invested in the Amended Offering. Each
      warrant  is  exercisable  to  purchase  one  share of  common  stock at an
      exercise price of $1.30 per share for one year.
Of  the  total  $5,200,000  raised  in  the  Original  Offering,  $727,187
      convertible  notes were  issued  under the  Original  Offering  along with
      1,817,967  warrants to purchase that same number of common shares at $0.55
      until  September  19, 2007,  $2,339,602  was  refunded  along with 584,878
      common  shares at a deemed cost of $233,951  which has been  recorded as a
      non-cash  financing  expense,  $2,133,186  convertible  notes were  issued
      pursuant to the amended  terms along with  2,370,206  warrants to purchase
      that same number of common  shares at $1.30 until  September  19, 2006 and
      555,670  common  shares  were  issued as finders  fees at a deemed cost of
      $222,268 which were included in consulting  expenses.  In conjunction with
      these  convertible  notes and warrants the Company has recorded a non-cash
      financing expense of $1,493,096.
The subscription  agreements relating to the Original Offering and Amended
      offering  contains  certain  registration  rights for the shares of common
      stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  the  notes,  the  exercise  of  the
      underlying warrants, bonus shares issued and finders fee shares issued. To
      date he Company has not filed its registration  statement and as such a 2%
      penalty has been accrued as at October 31, 2005.

      Phase one  consists of research at an  estimated  cost of $50,000,  which,
      along with the  information  gathered is to be split  equally  between the
      parties. Subsequent phases involve further research and feasibility geared
      ultimately towards a production contract where the major Canadian chemical

16.   Subsequent Events
Subsequent to October 31, 2005 the Company  completed a private  placement
      of 15,068,000  units at $1.50 per unit whereby each unit  consisted of one
      common  share and one  share  purchase  warrant.  Each two  warrants  will
      entitle the holder to purchase an  additional  common share of the Company
      at $2.00 until december 12, 2007. The Company has agreed to pay finders up
      to 6% in cash plus warrants equal to 6% of the warrants  issued on similar

      must respond to any queries to that resale  registration  statement within
      two weeks of receipt or else be subject to an additional  penalty as to 2%
      for each two weeks  thereafter.  The penalties  shall be payable in either
      shares  at a  deemed  price  of  $1.50  USD or  cash at the  unit  holders

Also subsequent to October 31, 2005 the Company issued agreed to issue 3.2
      million common shares,  with piggyback  registration  rights, to financial
      advisors  of the  Company  at a  deemed  cost  of  $5,376,000  whereby  in
      consideration  for services  rendered  under their  respective  consulting
      agreements, the shares will be earned evenly over the six months ended May
      2006. The contracts with the financial  advisors may be canceled on thirty
      days notice.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plans of
Operations
The  following  information  should be read in  conjunction  with the  unaudited
consolidated  financial  statements  included  herein,  which  are  prepared  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP") in the United
States for interim financial information. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars
unless otherwise stated.
All payments to be made in the future have been expressed in U.S.  dollars using
an exchange rate of $1 U.S. = $1.1771 Cdn.
Plan of Operations
The Company is in the  exploration  stage and does not currently have any income
from operating activities. The Company expect to use all of its existing working
capital  on  exploration  activities.  Management  intends  to raise  additional
capital  through the  issuance of equity and or debt to finance  operations  and
invest in other business opportunities,  however, no assurance can be given that
the  Company  will be  successful  in its  exploration  activities,  in  raising
additional capital or that other business opportunities will be found.
During the six months  ended  October  31,  2005 the  Company's  subsidiary  OQI
completed  the purchase of the  remaining  51% interest in the Firebag Tar Sands
Project by paying $357,540. OQI now has a 100% interest in the property, subject
to certain  royalties,  whereby it may explore and develop oil sands deposits in
an area comprising approximately 850,000 acres in the Province of Saskatchewan.
To finance  the  acquisition  of the  Firebag  Tar Sands  Project and to provide
funding for an  exploration  program OQI issued  1,524,875  Flow-through  Common
Shares  and  767,628  units  under a private  placement  for gross  proceeds  of
$3,490,464.  Each unit  consisted of one common share and warrant  entitling the
holder to acquire one common share at $1.70 ($2.00 CND).  These warrants  expire
as to 717,628  warrants on May 31, 2007 and 50,000 warrants on June 15, 2007. In
conjunction  with this  financing  OQI also issued agents  warrants  whereby the
agent may acquire up to 146,475  common  shares and 14,000 common shares both at
$1.49 ($1.75 CND) until May 31, 2008 and June 15, 2008  respectively and 146,475
common  shares and 14,000  common shares both at $1.70 ($2.00 CND) until May 31,
2008 and June 15,  2008  respectively.  The  Company  has  recorded  a  non-cash
financing expense of $124,001 relating to these warrants.
Also during the six months ended October 31, 2005, the Company agreed to convert
the  non-refundable  payment of $437,962  that the Company  made  (through  OQI)
towards the  purchase of the 51% interest in the  property  into 297,688  common
shares and a warrant to acquire up to an  additional  647,688  common  shares at
$1.70 ($2.00 CND) until June 13,  2007.  As at October 31, 2005 the Company held
7,297,688  common  shares,  representing  54.55% of the issued  and  outstanding
shares  of  OQI.  The  non-controlling   shareholders  45.45%  interest  in  OQI
represented $3,936,114 of its net assets.
The focus of OQI  during  the six  months  ended  October  31,  2005 has been on
completing  the acquistion of the Firebag East  Prospect,  securing  funding and
preparing  for an estimated  $3,200,000  drill program that is expected to begin
shortly.

Subsequent to October 31, 2005 the Company converted its convertible note in OQI
into 788,769  common shares  increasing  its holding in OQI to 8,086,457  common
shares representing 57.49% of the issued and outstanding shares of OQI.
Also  subsequent  to October  31,  2005 the  Company  entered  into a  financing
agreement with OQI whereby it may purchase up to  $12,743,182  ($15 million CND)
units prior to January 31, 2006. Each unit is to be priced at $5.10 ($6 CND) and
will consist of one common share on one share purchase warrant.  Every two share
purchase  warrants  will  entitle the Company to purchase an  additional  common
share at $8.50 ($10 CND) for a period  ending nine months from the closing date.
Pursuant to this  agreement  the Company has  committed to financing OQI as to a
minimum of $2,123,864  ($2.5 million CND) on or before  January 31, 2006 through
the purchase of these units or by way of  exercising  existing  securities.  The
proceeds from this financing will be used by OQI to fund a spring drill program.
The Company entered into an agreement with three third parties (collectively the
Triple 7 Joint Venture) to post, acquire, develop and produce oil sands deposits
located in the Athabasca  Region of Alberta,  Canada (the Triple 7 Joint Venture
Agreement)  whereby in consideration  for the expertise and industry  experience
provided  by Triple 7 Joint  Venture  the Company has agreed to pay the Triple 7
Joint Venture  $127,432  ($150,000  CDN) payable in common shares for any leases
acquired  pursuant to a specific  Alberta Crown sale of leases.  The Company has
also  agreed  to pay the  Triple 7 Joint  Venture  partners,  as  ongoing  fees,
$127,432  ($150,000  CDN) in cash or common  shares  (at the  discretion  of the
Company)  on the first and second  anniversary  dates of the  Agreement.  Shares
issued under the agreement are subject to "piggyback"  registration  rights.  On
the third  anniversary date of the agreement the Company shall pay to the Triple
7 Joint Venture $382,295  ($450,000 CDN) per parcel of acquired leases that have
not been surrendered, or for which no commercial project has been identified. In
the event  that the  Company  receives  a  feasibility  study,  conducted  by an
independent third party, that indicates that a commercial project on one or more
of the leases is economic and wishes to construct a commercial project, they are
required to notify the Triple 7 Joint Venture. Upon commencement of construction
of such a commercial project the Company shall pay to the Triple 7 Joint Venture
the sum of $5,097,272 ($6,000,000 CDN). In addition to such payments the Company
has  granted  each of the  Triple 7 Joint  Venture  partners  a  royalty  in the
acquired  leases of $0.03  Canadian  on each barrel of crude  bitumen  produced,
saved and sold from the Acquired  Leases,  or $382,295  ($450,000 CDN) per year,
whichever is greater.  Such royalty is governed by the royalty procedure,  which
stipulates,  among other  things,  that the  royalty  will be secured by a lien,
first charge or security  interest on the royalty lands, and that the royalty is
assignable or transferable subject to a right of first offer to Township.
On August 24, 2005 the Company  through its wholly owned  subsidiary,  Township,
acquired one lease pursuant to the Triple 7 Joint Venture at a cost of $727,187.
This  prospect  will be  known  as the  Eagles  Nest  Project.  To  finance  the
acquisition  of the project the Company  issued  convertible  notes  pursuant to
which it also  granted  royalties  of $0.0073  Canadian  on each barrel of crude
bitumen produced,  saved and sold from the project. The Company then bought back
$0.0015  Canadian of the  royalties  for 200,000  common shares at a deemed cost
$80,000 which has been recorded as an exploration expense.
The Company  expects to do a winter  drill  program on the Eagles Nest  Prospect
which is estimated to cost around $2,000,000 and has incurred $91,371 in related
costs to October 31, 2005.

<PAGE>
To finance the  acquisition of the Eagles Nest Prospect the Company entered into
a private placement of its securities  whereby the Company issued 8% Convertible
Notes (the "Notes") with stock purchase warrants for aggregate  principal amount
of  $5,200,000  (the  "Original  Offering"),  all  pursuant  to  a  Subscription
Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") with the purchasers. Under the terms of
the Original  Offering,  the Notes are  convertible  to shares of the  Company's
common stock (the "Common  Stock") at $0.40 per share of Common Stock.  However,
pursuant to the subscription agreement, amounts not expended on successful bids,
associated  costs and first year rentals are to be refunded on a pro-rata basis.
The refunded amount totals  $4,472,813,  as only $727,187 was used in connection
with the  acquisition  of the Eagles Nest Parcel and  related  costs.  Under the
terms of the Original  Offering,  the purchasers  will also receive bonus shares
equal to 10% of the  refunded  amount  allocable to the  respective  purchasers,
which  bonus  shares  will be  issued  at the rate of  $0.40  per  share.  Also,
purchasers  will receive  warrants  based on one warrant per $0.40 invested by a
purchaser,  after the refunded amount has been distributed to the purchaser. The
warrants are  exercisable for two years from the issue date at an exercise price
of $0.55 per share.
Effective  August 31, 2005, some of the purchasers  elected not to receive their
pro-rata portion of the refund amount.  Rather,  those purchasers  elected to be
included under amended terms to the Original Offering (the "Amended  Offering").
Under  the  terms of the  Amended  Offering,  a  purchaser  will  receive  a new
convertible  promissory  note in the amount of their  principal  investment  not
refunded  (the "New  Note"),  which New Note is  convertible  into shares of the
Company's  common stock at a per share  conversion price of $0.90 per share. The
purchaser will also receive one warrant for each $0.90 of principal  invested in
the Amended  Offering.  Each  warrant is  exercisable  to purchase  one share of
common stock at an exercise price of $1.30 per share for one year.
Of the total $5,200,000 raised in the Original  Offering,  $727,187  convertible
notes were issued under the Original  Offering along with 1,817,967  warrants to
purchase  that same number of common  shares at $0.55 until  September 19, 2007,
$2,339,602  was refunded  along with 584,878  common  shares at a deemed cost of
$233,951  which has been recorded as a non-cash  financing  expense,  $2,133,186
convertible notes were issued pursuant to the amended terms along with 2,370,206
warrants to purchase that same number of common shares at $1.30 until  September
19, 2006 and 555,670  common shares were issued as finders fees at a deemed cost
of $222,268 which were included in consulting expenses.  In conjunction with the
issuance of these  convertible  notes and  warrants  the Company has  recorded a
non-cash financing expense of $1,493,096.
The  subscription  agreements  relating  to the  Original  Offering  and Amended
offering  contains  certain  registration  rights for the shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the notes, the exercise of the underlying  warrants,
bonus shares issued and finders fee shares  issued.  To date the Company has not
filed its registration statement and as such a 2% penalty has been accrued.
During the six months ended  October 31, 2005 the Company  continued to evaluate
its  Pasquia  Hill Oil Shale  Prospect  and has spent  $71,838 on a small  drill
program related to the prospect.

<PAGE>
Also  during the six months  ended  October  31, 2005 the company was focused on
raising funding for general  working capital  purposes and issued 7% convertible
notes for an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000. The Company has agreed to
make monthly  payments equal to one-twelfth of the initial  principal  amount of
the note plus any other amounts due,  including  interest.  The monthly payments
for the first  three  months  may be  deferred  until the  fourth  month and are
payable in either shares,  subject to an effective  registration  statement,  or
cash.  Should the Company elect to make the monthly payment in cash then it must
pay  130%  of the  principal  plus  100% of any  other  amounts  due,  including
interest.  If the Company elects to have the monthly payment paid in shares then
the note  holders may convert at anytime  thereafter  into common  shares of the
Company at the lesser of i) $0.60,  ii) 135% of the  average of the five  lowest
closing  bid  prices of the  Company's  common  stock for the ten  trading  days
preceding  the  effective  date  of a  registration  statement  registering  the
underlying  shares and  warrants  for resale and iii) 70% of the  average of the
five lowest closing bid prices of the Company's common stock for the ten trading
days preceding the date of conversion.  Should the Company fail to make a timely
election to pay in cash or shares or to actually  make the cash payment then the
holders  of the  notes  may  determine  whether  they want to be paid in cash or
shares on the terms noted above.  Pursuant to this  offering the Company  issued
500,000,  warrants to purchase  that same number of common shares at $0.45 until
June 9, 2007,  5,000,000  warrants to purchase that same number of common shares
at $0.55 per share until June 9, 2007 and  2,500,000  warrants to purchase  that
same number of common  shares at $1.50 until June 9, 2007. In  conjunction  with
this  offering  the Company has paid  $200,000 in finders fees and has agreed to
pay a finders fee of 10% from any of the  5,000,000  warrants  to purchase  that
same  number of common  shares  at $0.55 per share  until  June 9, 2007 that are
exercised.  In conjunction with these convertible notes and warrants the Company
has recorded a non-cash financing expense of $1,722,950. The balance outstanding
pursuant  to these  convertible  notes as at October  31,  2005 is $755,434 as a
result of the  conversion of $1,297,199 of principle and interest into 2,776,712
common  shares.  Subsequent to October 31, 2005, a further  $50,000 of principle
and interest was converted into 83,333 common shares.
During the six months ended October 31, 2005 Energy 51, a privately held oil and
gas  exploration  and  development  company,  in which  the  Company  held a 25%
interest  completed an equity  financing  whereby it raised  $14,182,000 and the
Company's interest was reduced to around 2%.
As part of the  Company's  investment  in Energy 51 must be offered the right to
participate  on all  prospects  generated  by Energy 51 until  April  2006.  The
Company has elected to  participate  in the Sylvan Lake and Barrhead oil and gas
prospects   and  included  in   exploration   costs  is  $259,120  and  $28,993,
respectively,  in  related  exploration  costs.  To  date  the  results  of  the
exploration efforts on both prospects is unknown.  The Company intends to review
prospects  of merit as they  come  along and to  invest  in them  provided  that
financing is available.
Changes in Financial Condition
During the six months  ended  October 31, 2005 the primary  focus of the Company
was on  completing  the  purchase of the Firebag Tar Sands  Prospect,  obtaining
funding for  exploration  programs and accessing and  acquiring  other  possible
investment opportunities within the Athabasca Tar Sands region which resulted in
the Eagles  Nest  prospect.  During the six months  ended  October  31, 2004 the
primary focus of the Company was on the  exploration of its Pasquia  Hills,  Oil
Shale prospect,  completing  agreements to purchase the Firebag Sask., Tar Sands
prospect and finding funding for the Company.
As a result of the above noted financing the Company incurred non-cash financing
expenses of  $3,573,997(2004  - $1,211,421) for the six months ended October 31,
2005.  The Company also agreed  during the six months ended  October 31, 2005 to
extend the expiry date of 2,380,000  warrants for one year to September 14, 2006
and as a result  recorded an non-cash  financing  expense of $2,112,012  (2004 -
$nil).
27
<PAGE>
Consulting  expenses  for the six months  ended  October 31, 2005 of  $1,315,767
(2004 - $973,845)  included  stock option  compensation  expenses of  $1,072,056
(2004 - $0) related to the  issuance of options to  employees  and  consultants.
Consulting fees also included fees related to successful financing attempts that
were paid in stock and cash and totaled  $580,456  (2004 - $0). The Company paid
its directors $60,262 (2004 - $138,000). OQI had consulting expenses of $206,583
that did not occur during the six months ended October 31, 2004.
Exploration  costs for the six months  ended  October 31,  2005 were  $1,073,033
(2004 - $200,875) and included  payments related to the Sylvan Lake and Barrhead
oil and gas  prospects  as to $359,120 and  $28,993,  respectively.  Included in
exploration  costs is $79,272 in  conjunction  with its  interest in the Sulfoxy
Joint  Venture,  $91,371  in costs  associated  with the Eagles  Nest  prospect,
$71,838  in costs  associated  with the  Pasquia  Hills Oil Shale  prospect  and
$97,668 in costs incurred by OQI related to the Firebag Tar Sands prospect. Also
in included in  exploration  is $233,333  related to property  acquired from the
Anhydride Limited Partnership which was subsequently  written off. The Company's
exploration  costs  during the three  months ended July 31, 2004 were related to
the exploration of its Pasquia Hills Oil Shale Project.
Advertising  and promotion costs during the six months ended October 31, 2005 of
$625,257 were up significantly  from the six months ended October 31, 2004 where
they were $115,940 as a result of the engagement of consulting firm whereby they
agreed to be paid in common  shares of the Company.  Pursuant to this  agreement
the  Company  issued  2,000,000  common  shares  and booked an  advertising  and
promotion  expense of $430,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2005. As the
agreement  calls for the  services to be provided  over the one year life of the
agreement the Company had a prepaid expense of $430,000 as at October 31, 2005.
Professional  fees for the three months ended July 31, 2005 of $187,899  (2004 -
$149,435)  continues  to be major  expense  of the  Company  as it inures  costs
related to business evaluation and financing issues.
As the Company is now significantly  more active and is maintaining two separate
offices,  one in Calgary  and one in  Vancouver,  its  office  costs for the six
months  ended  October  31,  2005 of $157,399  (2004 - $97,853)  have  increased
substantially  when compared to the six months ended October 31, 2004.  Likewise
its rent costs for the six months  ended  October  31,  2005 of $29,582  (2004 -
$12,570) have increased as a result of maintaining the two offices.
Interest and bank charges of $157,399  (2004 - $97,853) for the six months ended
October 31, 2005 are higher as a result of the timing when  various  convertible
notes and  interest  were issued.  Also during the six months ended  October 31,
2005 the  Company  had a  significant  cash  balance on hand as it was  awaiting
approvals for its fall exploration  program which resulted in interest income of
$50,739 (2004 - $nil).
During the six months  ended  October 31, 2005 the Company  sold its interest in
its  subsidiary  Anhydride  Petroleum  (Canada) Inc. for nominal  proceeds which
resulted in the Company  recording a $736,782  recovery of exploration  expenses
pertaining to accounts payable of the subsidiary.
In total the Company experienced a net loss of $8,766,271 or $0.14 per share for
the six months ended  October 31, 2005,  compared to a net loss of $2,856,429 or
$0.12 per share for the six months ended October 31, 2004.  The Company  expects
to continue to incur  operating  losses and will  continue  to be  dependent  on
additional  equity or debt  sales and or  property  joint  ventures  to fund its
activities in the future.
28
<PAGE>
We have no revenues, and our operating results, profitability and future rate of
growth depend solely on our ability to successfully  implement our business plan
and our  ability to raise  further  funding,  as well as OQI's  ability to raise
funding for its projects. We currently have approximately  $8,000,000 in cash on
hand which we plan to utilize for current and or upcoming  exploration  programs
and general  working  capital  purposes.  It is expected  that the Company  will
continue to need further funding and we plan to fund future operations by way of
joint venture  agreements and or other forms of financing,  including the public
offering or private placement of equity or debt securities.  However,  we cannot
assure  you that  joint  venture  partners,  debt or  equity  financing  will be
available to us on acceptable terms to meet these requirements.  The Company has
no revenues.
