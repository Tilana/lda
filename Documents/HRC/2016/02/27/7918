<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), 
Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to Sudan from 14-23 November 2012, at the 
invitation of the Government of Sudan. Pursuant to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, 
</p>
<p>contained in Human Rights Council resolution 14/6, he sought to examine the situation of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sudan, with a focus on Darfur, the three Protocol 
Areas and the situation of persons of South Sudanese origin in Sudan. Various contexts of 
internal displacement, both new and protracted, continue to be evident in Sudan, including 
displacement due to armed conflict, communal violence and conflicts over resources. A 
number of important agreements have been signed to address outstanding issues that 
perpetuate conflict and displacement, which demonstrate the efforts and some progress by 
the Government of Sudan, but these have not always been inclusive enough or have stalled 
due to their slow implementation. 
</p>
<p> Issues related to humanitarian access, the capacity of the Government and 
insufficient preventive measures have adversely impacted assistance and protection 
services. At the same time, durable solutions have been affected by continued insecurity in 
parts of the country, lack of services and livelihood opportunities in areas of return, 
underlying land issues and lack of a comprehensive durable solution strategy that, in 
addition to returns, would also facilitate other solutions such as local integration. The

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 14/6 
and at the invitation of the Government of Sudan, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official visit to Sudan 
from 14 to 23 November 2012. The Special Rapporteur undertook this visit in order to 
examine the situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country, with a particular 
focus on Darfur and persons of South Sudanese origin remaining in Sudan. The Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are based on his findings during the visit, 
and on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (Guiding Principles).1 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with various Government interlocutors, 
including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Social 
Welfare and the Minister of Health, the Human Rights Coordination Council of the 
Ministry of Interior and representatives of the Humanitarian Aid Commission, both in 
Khartoum and in the field. He also met with representatives of the National Human Rights 
Commission, the Director of the Internally Displaced Persons Centre, the Commission of 
Voluntary Humanitarian Work, the Darfur Regional Authority and the Justice, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. During his field visits, he had the opportunity to engage with 
local government representatives, including the governors (Walis) of North, West and 
South Darfur, as well as members of civil society, traditional leaders and United Nations 
officials, including various units within the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation 
in Darfur (UNAMID) and the Deputy Joint Special Representative. He especially 
appreciates that he was able to meet with communities affected by internal displacement in 
the different parts of Darfur that he visited, as well as with persons of South Sudanese 
origin living in and around Khartoum and at departure points. He regrets that he was unable 
to visit some of the IDPs in North Darfur, as was originally scheduled, due to a national 
holiday the day after his arrival. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government of Sudan for 
its invitation, constructive engagement and willingness for ongoing cooperation with the 
mandate. He is grateful to the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in the 
Sudan, the Office for Coordination and Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UNAMID, in particular its 
human rights unit, which provided invaluable support during the preparations for as well as 
throughout the visit. He also wishes to express appreciation for the cooperation and support 
provided by the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and the internally displaced 
persons and persons of South Sudanese origin with whom he met and who shared their 
concerns and experiences with him.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and socioeconomic context  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Political context  
</b></p>
<p>4. Sudan has been affected by long-standing civil wars between the north and the 
south, and in the eastern and western regions of the country. Demands for greater political 
autonomy for these regions, recognition of their sociocultural diversity, issues related to the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>distribution of wealth and political inclusiveness of Sudan&#8217;s peripheral regions have been at 
the heart of these conflicts.2 The country&#8217;s longest-running civil war between the north and 
the south saw its conclusion through a referendum held in January 2011 in support of the 
independence of South Sudan, which came into effect on 9 July 2011.  
</p>
<p>5. In eastern Sudan, the conflict which had become violent by 1995, resulted in the 
signing of the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement in October 2006. In the western region of 
Darfur, the conflict spurred by the struggle for power and land intensified as of 2003 and 
has caused massive displacement over the years. A series of ceasefires agreed during this 
long-standing conflict have failed, as did the Darfur Peace Agreement, signed under the 
auspices of the African Union (AU) in May 2006. More recently, some political progress 
was achieved through the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD).  
</p>
<p>6. President Omar Hassan al- Bashir, who came to power in a military coup in 1989, 
was elected president in 1996, 2000 and again in 2010, which marked Sudan&#8217;s first multi-
party elections in 24 years, although these elections came under criticism by some 
international observers.3 Sudan is in the process of drafting a new national constitution, 
which has raised questions regarding the transparency and the participatory and inclusive 
character of the constitutional review process, and the extent to which the Constitution 
would resolve issues such as the different conflicts affecting the country.4  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Socioeconomic and environmental context  
</b></p>
<p>7. While Sudan is the third largest country in Africa, and benefits from considerable 
natural resources, endemic poverty affects 47 per cent of the population.5 The lack of access 
to basic services and a social safety net, particularly in peripheral regions, is reflected in 
indicators such as low access to improved drinking water and sanitation facilities (20.8 per 
cent), primary school completion (62.7 per cent), full immunization of children (39.3 per 
cent), birth registration (59.3 per cent) and high under-five and maternal mortality rates.6 
The United Nations estimates that 4.4 million people are in need in Sudan. 7 </p>
<p>8. Largely dependent on oil, the economy of Sudan has been impacted by the 
independence of South Sudan. South Sudan&#8217;s decision to suspend oil production and 
damage to the oil production facilities in Higlig has placed a burden on the Sudanese 
economy and led the Government to impose a number of austerity measures in 2012 aimed 
at addressing the resulting budget deficit. The majority of the measures involved cuts in 
development spending and federal transfers to state governments for the provision of basic 
services. As a net importer of food, Sudan has been particularly affected by currency 
instability and inflation rates of over 30 per cent, resulting in high food prices and import 
costs for basic goods. 8

</p>
<p>9. Sudan is undergoing a significant demographic shift, which includes a near 
doubling of its population since 1983 and a rate of urbanization which has risen from an 
estimated 17 per cent in 1970 to approximately 40 per cent at present.9 In addition to 
internal migration from rural areas for economic reasons, urbanization has also been 
spurred by displacement due to insecurity and conflict, with people fleeing in large 
numbers to urban areas. The proliferation of arms has increased banditry and has also had a 
significant impact on livelihoods and access to services. At the State level, many 
government institutions lack the capacity and funding to adequately provide services to 
populations in their area.10 National capacities with regard to crisis prevention, 
preparedness and management are also inadequate.  
</p>
<p>10. In addition, deteriorating environmental conditions, in part attributable to climate 
change, have led to an increase in failed growing seasons, desertification, deforestation and 
erratic rainfall. These conditions are important factors in exacerbating food insecurity and 
vulnerability, negatively affecting health, water and sanitation conditions and reducing the 
availability of natural resources such as water and grazing lands. This has led to increased 
competition and conflict over scarce resources, particularly between pastoralist and 
agriculturalist communities.11  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights instruments and institutions  
</b></p>
<p>11. Sudan is a party to most of the core international human rights treaties, although it 
has not ratified some of the related Optional Protocols.12 As per article 27 (3) of the 
Sudanese Interim Constitution of 2005, all rights and freedoms enshrined in international 
and regional human rights instruments ratified by Sudan are considered an integral part of 
the national Constitution. Some national and international actors have called for a revision 
of national laws to ensure consistency with the Constitution, transparency and broad-based 
participation in the constitutional review process and improvements to the Bill of Rights in 
line with international human rights.13 In 2011, Sudan underwent the universal periodic 
review (UPR), which resulted in a number of recommendations relating to humanitarian 
access and IDPs.14  
</p>
<p>12. Sudan has a number of national institutions responsible for human rights, including, 
inter alia, the Advisory Council on Human Rights, the National Committee on International 
Humanitarian Law, the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly and the 
National Commission for Human Rights. With regard to the latter, the Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government and international partners to support the Commission through 
capacity-building, training and other measures to facilitate its compliance with the Paris 
Principles.15

</b></p>
<p><b> C. History, causes and extent of internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>13. The historical pattern of internal displacement in Sudan is deeply rooted in political 
tensions between the centre and peripheral regions, often related to demands for reforms in 
the distribution of wealth, power and greater recognition of the country&#8217;s diversity.16 These 
tensions have led to armed conflicts in certain areas of the country, some of which have 
become protracted, impacted civilian populations who have suffered grave violations of 
their human rights and international humanitarian law, loss of livelihoods and forced 
displacement. At the time of the visit, internal displacement continued to profoundly impact 
the human rights of millions of people in Sudan, including IDPs in Darfur, people of South 
Sudanese origin in Khartoum and other areas of the country, and IDPs in the three Protocol 
Areas &#8211; Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The United Nations has reported a total of 
4.4 million people in need in Sudan, including over 1.4 million IDPs in camps in Darfur, 
who are receiving food aid; nearly 140,000 IDPs and/or severely affected people in Blue 
Nile; and over 500,000 in South Kordofan. Between 220,000 and 350,000 people of South 
Sudanese origin living in Sudan are also of concern; many of them require assistance.17  
</p>
<p>14. The armed conflict between the South Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army in South 
Sudan and the Government of Sudan lasted several decades, from 1956 to 1972, and 
resuming again 1983. It was brought to an end by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) signed in January 2005, which set out detailed transitional power-sharing 
arrangements and the status of the three Protocol Areas namely, Abyei, Southern Kordofan 
and Blue Nile.18 The many years of civil war resulted in approximately 4 million IDPs, an 
estimated 2 million of whom returned to South Sudan, Abyei and Southern Kordofan 
between January 2005, the signing of the CPA, and  end-2009.19 Initiatives to facilitate the 
return to the south of persons of South Sudanese origin still living in the north, including in 
and around Khartoum, also accelerated, especially as of August 2010. A large percentage of 
IDPs from the south were hosted in the greater Khartoum area, which had already received 
and locally integrated many IDPs during the two previous decades.20 
</p>
<p>15. Following the nationwide election held in April 2010 under the terms of the CPA, a 
referendum on Southern Sudan self-determination was held in January 2011, and resulted in 
the independence of Southern Sudan and the creation of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 
July 2011. While this signified compliance with the CPA, no resolution had been reached in 
three key areas. These included the border between Sudan and South Sudan, which was the 
subject of renewed fighting that impacted on a number of issues (such as border security, 
access to migratory routes and water and grazing rights for nomadic groups); oil sector 
agreements and citizenship and residency status for people of South Sudanese origin still 
living in Sudan. Renewed fighting in the three Protocol Areas since independence has 
caused new displacements and delayed the referendum on the final status of Abyei, as well 
as the completion of the popular consultation process in South Kordofan and Blue Nile 
</p>
<p>16. In Darfur, the conflict which began in early 2003 between two allied groups &#8211; the 
Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM) &#8211; and the Government of Sudan, resulted in large-scale internal displacement, which 
has become protracted. Despite the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in May 
2006 between the Government of Sudan and a faction of the SLM/A, further 
fractionalization among the rebel groups resulted in renewed violence and the failure of the

</p>
<p>DPA. This was followed by a number of unsuccessful agreements and renewed fighting 
between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and different rebel groups, as well as between the 
rebel groups themselves. By January 2009, there were an estimated 2.7 million IDPs, a 
further 2 million people considered affected by the conflict, and 300,000 people killed.21 
Some political progress was achieved with the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in 
Darfur (DDPD) between the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice 
Movement (LJM) - a grouping of small armed movements in Darfur &#8211; in July 2011. 
However, a comprehensive peace settlement, including with the larger armed opposition 
movements such as the JEM and the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) had 
not yet been attained at the time of the visit, and while some returns have taken place in 
parts of Darfur, other areas have seen continued fighting and new internal displacements.22 
</p>
<p>17. While the Special Rapporteur was not able to visit Eastern Sudan, this region has 
also been affected by violent conflict and displacement, especially since 1995 with the 
eruption of armed conflict between the army and the Eastern Front, an insurgent coalition. 
In 2006, these parties signed the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement, but its implementation 
has been slow.23 As of 31 March 2013, there were an estimated 30,000 people of South 
Sudanese origin and approximately 150,000 IDPs in the eastern Sudan states of Gedaref, 
Red Sea and Kassala,24 which have humanitarian access restrictions. The region continues 
to show the worst development indicators in the country, although the relatively calm 
political and security situation prevailing more recently has allowed some recovery and 
development activities to go forward.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks for assistance and protection of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic legal, policy and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>18. Sudan has neither signed nor ratified the 2009 African Union Convention for the 
Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention). 
The Special Rapporteur is nonetheless encouraged that the Government is conducting a 
study in this regard. Sudan has ratified the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in 
Africa&#8217;s Great Lakes Region (2006), and in particular, the Protocol on the Protection and 
Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons &#8211; which requires States parties to respect and 
integrate the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (Guiding Principles) 
(E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2) into their national legislation &#8211; and the Protocol on the Property 
Rights of Returning Persons. 
</p>
<p>19. In January 2009, the Government of Sudan adopted the National Policy on 
Internally Displaced Persons. The policy covers all stages of displacement due to conflict or 
natural disasters, sets out the rights of IDPs &#8211; including the right to security and inclusion in 
development programmes &#8211; and promotes the principles of participation, as well as of 
voluntariness and freedom of choice with respect to durable solutions. It also establishes 
Government responsibilities throughout all phases of displacement, specifying the roles of 
all levels of government in the planning of IDP activities.25 Of note are the provisions

<p>recognizing the Guiding Principles, the obligation of the State to ensure that the rights of 
IDPs are upheld through national implementing legislation and a derogation provision 
stipulating conditions under which some rights can be temporarily suspended. However, 
implementation of the policy has been slow, in part due to the lack of fully functional 
Government monitoring mechanisms, such as the High Committee on IDPs. With regard to 
implementation of the policy, relevant stakeholders noted a lack of due recognition and 
attention to IDPs outside of camps and settlements. Non-camp IDPs, especially in urban 
and semi-urban areas, have become virtually &#8220;invisible&#8221;, with no standard registration or 
other procedure to identify them and respond to their protection or assistance needs. In 
relation to durable solutions, while the national IDP policy provides for return and local 
integration or resettlement, the emphasis has generally been placed on returns, for which it 
has been important to establish joint verification mechanisms with the Government, in 
order to confirm voluntariness. A number of domestic laws, such as the Child Act (2010), 
and the Armed Forces Act (2007)26, and regional peace agreements, such as the DDPD, also 
contain pertinent references to IDPs and forced displacement (see chap. IV below).  
</p>
<p>20. The Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) is the key Government body responsible 
for the coordination of IDP programmes between State agencies or ministries and other 
concerned government bodies, and national and international NGOs and donors. It is also 
responsible for providing technical support, facilitating relevant procedures and assisting 
with the preparation, implementation and assessment of IDP programmes. The national IDP 
policy gives the High Committee on IDPs a more policy, planning and monitoring role, and 
tasks it with identifying the role of relevant stakeholders.27 Separately, the Sudan High 
Level Committee (HLC) is charged with overseeing humanitarian action in Darfur, 
although it has been largely inactive to date, and a Coordination Committee has been 
established in the interim to coordinate activities between the Government, the United 
Nations and NGOs.28  
</p>
<p>21. The creation of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA), under the provision of the 
DDPD, was officially launched in February 2012, and constitutes one of the most 
significant political and institutional developments in Darfur recently. Issues related to the 
return and reintegration of IDPs and refugees have been assigned to the Voluntary Return 
and Resettlement Commission (see DDPD, chap. IV).29 
</p>
<p>22. Government ministries particularly involved in IDP affairs include the Ministry of 
Humanitarian Affairs and the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security. Other relevant 
Government institutions include the National Centre for IDPs and Voluntary Return. The 
Joint Procedures Centre, established in 2006, aims to bring together relevant government 
departments and ministries in order to address the bureaucratic aspects (e.g. visas, 
registrations, work permits) related to NGO work in Sudan.  
</p>
<p>23. There are an estimated 3,800 national NGOs active in the area of humanitarian 
assistance in Sudan. In order to secure technical agreements with the Government of Sudan, 
United Nations agencies and international NGOs are required to engage with Sudanese 
counterparts and contribute to building their capacity. Capacity-building activities have 
become an even more central issue since 2011, with restrictions on access to conflict areas

</p>
<p>24. While the Special Rapporteur believes that it is critical to advance national 
capacities to manage humanitarian and displacement situations, he is of the view that this 
should not negatively affect humanitarian access for the United Nations or international 
NGOs which continue to be essential to providing the high level of technical and logistical 
capacity necessary to manage the large-scale humanitarian situations affecting the country; 
mobilize the necessary resources; monitoring and evaluation; and ensure safeguards are in 
place to uphold the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality in situations of 
conflict. Moreover, a key component of capacity-building should aim at enabling timely 
and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need and the promotion of 
development and recovery activities to consolidated durable solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International response and frameworks  
</b></p>
<p>25. The humanitarian operation in Sudan continues to be one of the largest in the world, 
with the United Nations and partners appealing for approximately US$1 billion in 2012 and 
2013, respectively, in order to assist over 4.4 million people in need, representing over 12 
per cent of the population of Sudan.31 At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 
however, response to the humanitarian needs in Sudan was considerably constrained by 
declining humanitarian funding, as only 53 per cent of requirements had been committed by 
donors for 2012 activities.32 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. In addition to engaging with relevant government institutions, such as the HAC, the 
international humanitarian response is facilitated by coordination mechanisms such as the 
humanitarian country team and the sector coordination system, which includes sectors such 
as food security and livelihoods, health and protection. In 2012, the Governance, 
Infrastructure and Economic Recovery sector was established to strengthen early recovery 
efforts and the link between humanitarian assistance and durable solutions.33 
</p>
<p>27. Regional actors have played an important role in the humanitarian response and in 
peace processes, recovery and development in Sudan. In addition to a number of NGOs 
from the region which operate in Sudan and bilateral agreements, such as those intended to 
assist returns in Darfur in the context of the DDPD, other examples include the Tripartite 
Initiative (United Nations, League of Arab States, African Union) to secure humanitarian 
access to South Kordofan and Blue Nile State.34  
</p>
<p>28. Despite the long-standing and large-scale humanitarian operations in Sudan by the 
international community, several challenges persist in ensuring their effective 
implementation. These include constraints on access to affected populations due to conflict-
related security concerns and government regulations, a decrease in humanitarian funding 
and a lack of sufficient national capacity, including of line ministries.35

<p><b> IV.  Responses to internal displacement: prevention, protection 
and durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p>29. The various crises and displacement situations in Sudan have required distinctive 
response frameworks, often in the form of regional policies, agreements and institutional 
structures, which address the specific challenges of each situation and the local 
environment. While it is not possible in this report to address in detail the multiple 
situations of internal displacement in the country, this chapter provides an analysis of the 
situation in Darfur and the situation of people of South Sudanese origin living in Sudan, 
based on the field locations visited and the displacement situations which the Special 
Rapporteur was able to focus on during his visit. A briefer analysis is provided with regard 
to the situation in the three Protocol Areas: Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Darfur  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prevention and progress to date in finding solutions 
</b></p>
<p>30. Now in its 10th year, the crisis in Darfur has evolved into a protracted internal 
displacement situation and the largest humanitarian operation in Sudan. Despite some 
improvements in security and notable political developments, these have not led to 
significant improvements in the overall humanitarian situation, and returns that have taken 
place have been counterbalanced by new displacements. Nearly 40 per cent of the 
population of Darfur (3.5 million people) continued to receive humanitarian assistance in 
2012, approximately half of whom were registered IDPs living in camps.36  </p>
<p>31. While improvements in security, especially in West Darfur, enabled an estimated 
203,000 people to return home since early 2011, over 114,000 new displacements were 
reported in 2012.37 More recently, from January to March 2013, a number of violent clashes 
between different groups have caused further displacement, continuing to reveal a pattern 
of multiple causes, including tribal clashes, armed conflict between government security 
forces and armed movements38 and sporadic violence between nomads and farmers.  
</p>
<p>32.  The international community has provided support to Darfur since armed conflict 
broke out in 2003 ( which led to the displacement of nearly 2 million people and many 
deaths), including humanitarian assistance, support to peace processes and the 
establishment of peacekeeping operations.39 Under the auspices of the African Union, and 
with the support of the United Nations and other partners, the Darfur Peace Agreement 
(DPA) was signed in 2006, and a renewed peace process was again initiated in 2010, 
culminating in the DDPD (July 2011), which includes specific provisions on IDPs.  
</p>
<p>33. An unprecedented African Union/United Nations Hybrid peacekeeping operation in 
Darfur (UNAMID) was established by the Security Council (resolution 1769) on 31 July 
2007, thereby replacing the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). UNAMID&#8217;s mandate 
has been renewed yearly, with the latest extended to 31 July 2013 (Security Council 
resolution 2063). It includes protection of civilians, monitoring the implementation of

<p>agreements, promotion of human rights and rule of law, providing assistance towards an 
inclusive political process and restoration of security conditions to enable the provision of 
humanitarian assistance.40  
</p>
<p>34. During 2012, the DDPD launched its first phase of implementation, established  the 
Darfur Regional Authority (DRA) and undertook the division of Darfur into five, rather 
than the previous three states. Although the DDPD did not, at the time of Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, include the three largest armed movements in Darfur, it has become the 
focus of Government and international efforts to bring about peace and long-term solutions 
for affected communities. As part of these efforts, a Darfur Joint Assessment Mission was 
undertaken by UNDP in 2012 in order to identify needs and priorities. This was followed 
by the International Donor Conference for Reconstruction and Development in Darfur, held 
in Doha in April 2013,  which aimed at securing the necessary funds for recovery and 
development projects.  
</p>
<p>35. The DRA, created under the DDPD, includes a total of 21 representatives from all 
five Darfur states. Despite its significant role and mandate, namely  to act as the link 
between the federal Government and the Darfur states, and to ensure coordination of the 
five states in the implementation of the DDPD, the DRA continues to be severely under 
resourced and constrained by the prevailing security situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Current situation of IDPs in camps and host communities  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Humanitarian access and security  
</i></p>
<p>36. While access to the majority of people in need in Darfur has been possible, factors 
such as insecurity, bureaucratic impediments and access restrictions have constrained 
humanitarian responses and negatively affected the operating environment for international 
humanitarian organizations in particular.41 New government procedures for humanitarian 
personnel to travel to Darfur were instituted in 2012, which resulted in confusion and 
prevented some United Nations staff and NGOs from travelling to Darfur for several 
months. The Government&#8217;s announcement in March 2013 regarding the removal of travel 
restrictions on humanitarian agencies operating in Darfur is therefore welcome and its rapid 
implementation is strongly encouraged. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur stresses the 
concern of IDP leaders with whom he met, who explained that the humanitarian situation in 
the camps had deteriorated significantly since the expulsion in 2009 of international NGOs. 
Other interlocutors noted increased constraints and government restrictions on  
humanitarian access in areas dominated by armed movements or where the population is 
perceived as being aligned to the &#8220;wrong communities&#8221;, which affects the provision of 
medicines, protection and other services.  
</p>
<p>37. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, security both within 
and outside the camps was compromised by a number of factors, including, inter alia, 
alleged infiltration and violations in some camps by armed groups; violations committed by 
government security forces and the Central Reserve Police in charge of security inside the 
camps; lack of humanitarian access, which could ensure protection and monitoring 
activities and continued insecurity outside the camps, due to the activities of armed militia 
groups and banditry. Moreover, protection sector activities in Darfur have been especially

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>constrained by access issues, the security situation in some areas and the limited capacity of 
sector partners.42 
</p>
<p>38. Displaced women and girls continue to be at increased risk of sexual and gender-
based violence (SGBV) and various forms of abuse and exploitation. Internally displaced 
women with whom the Special Rapporteur met highlighted the security risks they faced 
when venturing outside the camps, and the need for more security within the camps. During 
a verification exercise conducted in areas of return in 2012, it was found that the separation 
of families was becoming a troubling trend: part of the family would remain in the IDP 
camp in order to maintain their registration and access to related services (e.g. education), 
while other family members would return seasonally in order to cultivate their land. 
Maintaining family registration in the camps was also used as a precaution against the 
unpredictable security situation or agricultural output, as the family could return to the 
camp if necessary. This strategy was reinforced by the fact that the World Food Programme 
(WFP) does not have long-term food assistance in areas of return in Darfur. As a result of 
these family survival strategies, there were an increasing number of female-headed 
households and unaccompanied minors in the IDP camps, representing a significant 
protection concern.  
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, legal and psychosocial support continue to be extremely limited. 
According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur, in cases of rape and sexual 
assault, follow-up by police &#8211; in the form of investigations and arrests, for example &#8211; 
continue to be rare, thereby perpetuating a culture of impunity. While improvements in the  
responses to these concerns by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Social Affairs 
(MoSA) are encouraging, more institutional capacity is required to address this problem in 
IDP and conflict-affected communities, and to establish legal referral and support services 
for survivors, as well as sensitization and capacity-building for service providers and law 
enforcement officials.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Capacity and sectoral challenges 
</i></p>
<p>40. With regard to the provision of services, various sectors have encountered 
implementation challenges related not only to access, but also to the decrease in bilateral 
funding, delays in donor disbursements and other factors. Problems due to funding 
constraints in 2012 in the health sector for example, has meant that the running of health 
facilities had to be handed over to MoH. In view of MoH&#8217;s limited human and financial 
capacity, this transfer is expected to result in a decrease in the number and quality of 
services.43 In the emergency shelter and non-food items sector, various delays and 
impediments to delivery were encountered in parts of Darfur, due to security, transportation 
and funding issues. Government restrictions on the movement of supplies alone resulted in 
an estimated 33 per cent of targeted beneficiaries in Darfur not receiving the expected rainy 
season replenishments of shelter and non-food items.44 This was noted by the Special 
Rapporteur during his visit to camps, where many IDPs were living in rudimentary and 
tattered make-shift shelters which provided little protection from the elements.  
</p>
<p>41. In the water, sanitation and hygiene sector, significant achievements were possible 
at the national level in 2012. However, in Darfur, the creation of two additional states has 
stretched the already limited capacity and resources in this sector in the region, as have new 
displacements and reduced funding.45

</p>
<p><b> 3. Durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Areas of return: security, services and livelihoods  
</i></p>
<p>42. Of the three durable solutions available to IDPs, returns have been given priority in 
the DDPD. However, various interlocutors with whom the Special Rapporteur met, 
including IDPs, government representatives and organizations working with IDPs in 
Darfur, have stated, that while voluntary returns should be facilitated, other alternatives, 
such as local integration, should also be part of a comprehensive durable solution strategy.  
</p>
<p>43. The security situation and lack of services in areas of return remain key challenges 
to sustainable returns. Some IDPs with whom the Special Rapporteur engaged, including 
women, stated that it was too early to speak of significant returns, stressing that while 
access to land was central to returns, their lands continued to be occupied. They also 
highlighted security concerns related to continued activity by the Janjaweed and stated that 
in their opinion, neither the Government nor UNAMID were capable of protecting them, 
citing the example of the attacks in Kutum (August 2012) and the Hashaba massacre 
(September 2012). DRA representatives with whom the Special Rapporteur met reiterated 
the need to establish security for people in areas of return, including through promotion of 
an inter-Darfur dialogue addressing the relationship between nomads and settlers &#8211; an issue 
affecting the stability of rural areas. They noted that since most areas outside of cities in 
Darfur  have been evacuated due to the conflict, with many people displaced to IDP camps 
or settlements, those areas were now largely occupied by nomads. They also stated that 
while the nomadic groups may not necessarily claim that the land is solely theirs, there is 
still need to undertake concerted dialogue on this and related issues. With regard to 
dialogue with IDPs, including on returns, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn of the 
IDPs and Refugees Conference which took place in Darfur on 25 and 26 March 2013.  
</p>
<p>44. Incidents of communal violence, particularly between nomadic and farmer 
communities in Darfur, continue to stem from competition over scarce resources and issues 
related to the use of land and water. Such conflicts are often triggered by the destruction of 
crops by the livestock of nomadic populations or demands that farmers provide a share of 
the crops in return for the use of the land. The proliferation of small arms has also rendered 
peaceful conflict resolution more difficult. The DDPD provides for the implementation of 
DDR among the nomadic population and for a commission to deal with land issues. 
However the  implementation of these initiatives is expected to take a significant amount of 
time. 46 In this context, it would be important to provide greater support to initiatives that 
offer practical solutions to immediate situations and a conflict management mechanism, 
such as the &#8220;forums for dialogue&#8221; set up by some communities to address how to minimize 
damage to crops. 
</p>
<p>45. A number of actors with whom the Special Rapporteur met also highlighted the 
need to place stronger emphasis on including nomadic communities in assistance efforts, 
(especially in West Darfur), in regional dialogues, so as to better understand their needs, 
and in other processes, such as the DDPD consultative process. The Special Rapporteur is 
pleased that the Darfur Peace and Stability Fund includes support to the nomadic 
community and that a steering committee led by United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) is looking into how to improve engagement with nomadic groups and strengthen 
community dialogue; he encourages further efforts in this regard.  
</p>
<p>46. The neglect and destruction of infrastructure in rural Darfur over the last decade, the 
resulting lack of basic services as well as water scarcity and droughts in the region have

 46 UNHCR, &#8220;Darfur: Return monitoring&#8221; (see footnote 29), p. 3.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>also been key impediments to large-scale IDP returns.47 DRA representatives acknowledged 
that conditions must be sufficient to attract returnees, and informed the Special Rapporteur 
that the reconstruction process in Darfur is supposed to include the creation of services 
outside of cities and in areas of return. The Government of Sudan is to contribute $200 
million in the first year and $300 million in the second to this process, with additional funds 
expected from the donor conference held in Qatar on 7 and 8 April 2013. As part of this 
plan, Qatari international NGOs are planning to start work on five &#8220;service centres&#8221; (or 
&#8220;model villages&#8221;), comprised of a school, health centre, police station, mosque, and other 
basic facilities in each of the five states in Darfur. Sites for these centres have been 
identified, although there have been delays in getting the projects started. While the Special 
Rapporteur supports initiatives to provide better services in rural areas, some interlocutors 
raised concerns about the environmental impact of these projects, the types of building 
materials likely to be used, and whether there will be adequate livelihood opportunities at 
these sites to sustain returns.  
</p>
<p>47. Several of the above challenges to sustainable returns were also confirmed during a 
verification mission undertaken in 2012 to monitor returns in West, Central North and 
South Darfur.48 In addition to security, lack of access to livelihood opportunities and basic 
services, including water and education facilities (at reasonable distance); hostile 
communities and insufficient presence of law enforcement officials &#8211; conditions which, 
place women and girls at increased risk of SGBV were some of the issues identified.  
</p>
<p>48. It was found that the absence of NGOs and partner agencies, especially 
development partners capable of bringing sufficient funding and technical capacity for 
longer-term programming in areas of return, and the lack of capacity of local state 
government to ensure sustained social services were important factors impeding returns. 
Other constraints to durable returns included the lack of food assistance and institutions for 
solving land disputes in areas of return; insufficient information on IDPs and their 
intentions and the slow implementation of the DDPD.49 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Urbanization and local integration 
</i></p>
<p>49. While some of the 1.4 million IDPs currently living in IDP camps may elect to 
return to their areas of origin, it is expected that a significant percentage will opt to locally 
integrate in or near their current host towns and cities. The Special Rapporteur was 
encouraged by the openness to this option that was manifested by many Government 
representatives he met with. In this context, he believes it would be desirable, with the 
support of the international community, to conduct a profiling exercise in order to 
determine the current demographic breakdown and needs of IDPs, as well as their 
intentions with regard to durable solutions, so as to ensure a timely and effective urban-
planning process. This would ensure that solutions are devised with and around IDPs, that 
urban infrastructures and services, as well as livelihood, land and housing issues, are 
addressed accordingly.  
</p>
<p>50. High population and urban growth rates in Darfur (50 per cent), which have  been 
largely accelerated by conflict and displacement,50 pose significant challenges to urban 
management. Careful planning, however, can help to address many of these as they can 
mitigate the expansion of informal urban settlements and related problems such as poor 
access to services; security of tenure and housing rights; construction in areas prone to

</p>
<p>natural or other hazards; risk of mass evictions due to safety reasons, legal land claims or 
development projects. Experience has shown that such conditions, if they are not prevented, 
often generate a cycle of urban or secondary displacement, poverty and insecurity.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Transition from humanitarian emergency to durable solutions  
</i></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that while there continue to be pockets of 
insecurity and fighting in some parts of Darfur, the international community and the 
Government of Sudan believe that there are now significant opportunities for achieving 
durable solutions for IDPs in Darfur. In this context, it is all the more pertinent that urban 
planning and rural development processes fully integrate the needs of IDPs. The Special 
Rapporteur notes, however, that some sections of the Darfur population &#8211; including IDPs &#8211; 
remain in a situation of deep vulnerability and need, including with respect to food security,  
which is expected to remain a concern throughout 2013.51 He believes that a combined 
approach that addresses the immediate as well as the durable solutions needs of  IDPs, and 
which is based on a profiling of their needs and vulnerability, more accurate camp 
population figures and information on their intentions, will provide more targeted and 
effective interventions without the risk of neglecting urgent humanitarian concerns. 
Moreover, various actors noted that while there was an awareness of the need to focus more 
on finding durable solutions for IDPs, underlying challenges, such as those relating to 
insecurity, land use and livelihoods in areas of return need to be addressed.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Participation and reconciliation  
</i></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur wishes to commend the Government of Sudan and all 
concerned actors for facilitating a process of engagement which enabled IDP 
representatives to participate in the development of the DDPD. However, IDP and civil 
society groups have expressed concern that since its signature, there has been little 
participation in its implementation procedures. Repeated emphasis was also placed on the 
need to work towards a more inclusive peace agreement that would include all armed 
movements; to encourage the Government of Sudan to address the situation in Darfur 
through political solutions rather than military ones; as well as to cease Government 
policies that are &#8220;tribe-based&#8221; and which perpetuate conflict in the region. The Special 
Rapporteur also wishes to highlight the concerns expressed by various IDPs and civil 
society groups with regard to the lack of a political environment for discussion and debate 
on matters of concern to them and the risk of arrest. He stresses that freedom of expression 
is fundamental to the participation of IDPs in any peace and political process, the search for 
durable solutions and the justice and reconciliation process.  
</p>
<p>53. With regard to justice and reconciliation, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to 
learn that the Justice, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (JTRC) in Darfur, was 
planning field visits and ongoing dialogue sessions with local constituencies and IDP 
leaders in all five Darfur states. Representatives of the Commission underlined the need for 
a neutral mechanism that provides for legal accountability for the atrocities committed in 
Darfur since 2003, and compensation to victims, as well as a reconciliation process which 
mends social relationships and mechanisms to prevent the breakdown of peace in the 
future. In order to implement these activities, however, they highlighted the need for 
training, sharing of good practices, and resources, which required increased donor 
commitment.

<p><b> B. Persons of South Sudanese origin 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Overview  </b></p>
<p>54. Between the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 to 2012, one 
year after South Sudan&#8217;s independence, approximately 2 million people of South Sudanese 
origin who were living in Sudan have returned to South Sudan. It is estimated that some 
220,000 to 350,000 people of South Sudanese origin now remain in Sudan.52 The Special 
Rapporteur found that many who wished to go to South Sudan were unable to do so due to 
lack of means, limited transportation or insecurity, while others who may have wished to 
remain in Sudan were concerned about their future status in the country and the loss of 
livelihoods. He was pleased to note that no forcible mass deportations have taken place to 
date and also notes the formal establishment of a nine-month grace period for persons of 
South Sudanese origin to regularize their stay in Sudan. However, he regrets that the 
regularization of their status was not possible by the 8 April 2012 deadline, as the necessary 
mechanisms (e.g., to issue required identification documents) were not put in place in a 
timely manner by either Sudan or South Sudan.53 
</p>
<p>55. At the time of the visit, the Special Rapporteur found that a significant number of 
persons of South Sudanese origin remained stranded in open-air departure points and transit 
stations in Khartoum, including some people who had moved to these sites before the 
referendum on independence, with the hope of being provided assistance to return. This has 
resulted in dire emergency-like living conditions that are not viable for prolonged periods. 
This was starkly visible in the poor physical condition of the grounds, tattered tents and 
lack of basic services, such as sanitation facilities, in the sites visited. The international 
community has provided some assistance to people at these sites as well as support to the 
documentation processes. However, such support has been significantly constrained, due, 
inter alia, to limitations related to humanitarian access.54  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Durable solutions for persons of South Sudanese origin 
</b></p>
<p>56. Some progress on returns was possible in 2012, thanks to transportation assistance 
provided to people unable to afford the cost and an airlift operation by the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) in June 2012 of nearly 12,000 persons who had been 
stranded at the Kosti way station. However, by the time of the visit, security concerns along 
transit routes and the closing of border crossings due to fighting and disagreements between 
the two countries meant that, for the most part, very few returns were possible. As such, an 
estimated 40,000 persons remained in open-air departure points in Khartoum while some 
3,000 to 4,500 people were at the Kosti way station.  
</p>
<p>57. As Sudanese citizens, many people of South Sudanese origin have lived in and 
around Khartoum and in other parts of Sudan for many years or even generations, and 
many who had been  displaced there during the war had long integrated into their host 
communities. However, many people recounted to the Special Rapporteur how, in the 
context of escalating tensions around the referendum and partition, and the generally 
unstable political relations between the two countries, they had lost their jobs and been 
subject to harmful rhetoric and threats in the media and within their communities. This 
resulted in a  social climate which rendered their continued stay in Sudan unviable. Others 
also expressed concern regarding their properties and other assets in Sudan, which they 
would be obliged to either abandon or sell below market price when the time came to leave.

</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the signing of the Framework Agreement 
on the Status of Nationals of the other State and Related Matters (Framework Agreement) 
by the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan on 27 September 2012. This Framework 
Agreement, which provides for the terms for the regularization of stay of persons of South 
Sudanese origin wishing to remain in Sudan, can, if implemented in a timely and effective 
manner, facilitate local re-integration as a durable solution. However, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that without the adoption of a clear policy or legislation that takes 
into consideration the status of South Sudanese as former nationals of Sudan, it may be 
difficult for persons of South Sudanese origin to meet a number of requirements provided 
for in the existing legal framework on immigration for the issuance of residency permits 
(e.g. certain medical requirements, proof of re-entry into Sudan, possession of a national 
passport). In the context of State secession, he believes that guarantees against statelessness 
and a meaningful and effective right of option regarding citizenship should be provided to 
the persons concerned.55 He urges the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to take 
practical measures to rapidly implement the Framework Agreement in this spirit. He notes 
that special interventions may be necessary in the application of the agreement to border 
tribes and nomadic communities, including awareness-raising and legal assistance services.  
</p>
<p>59.  Moreover, until durable solutions in the form of returns or regularization of their 
status in Sudan have been attained, it is essential that the human rights of persons of South 
Sudanese origin be protected. He urges the Government of Sudan to promote a culture of 
respect for their rights and to investigate and prosecute any violation thereof. The very 
difficult conditions at some departure points, including with regard to water, sanitation, 
shelter, health care and other basic services, require urgent attention and monitoring.

<p><b> C. Protocol Areas: Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile 
</b></p>
<p>60. Continued fighting in South Kordofan and Blue Nile since June 2011 and 
throughout 2012 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), has severely limited access and the response by 
the international humanitarian community to the nearly 800,000 IDPs and severely affected 
persons in these areas. The United Nations has no presence in SPLM-N-controlled areas, 
and no assistance has been delivered from within Sudan. International humanitarian 
organizations have continued to support assistance efforts undertaken by the Government 
and national organizations in government-controlled areas, despite security concerns and 
government restrictions on movements of international staff. In August 2012, the Tripartite 
Initiative, instigated jointly by the African Union, the League of Arab States and the United 
Nations, resulted in two separate Memoranda of Understanding between the Tripartite 
Parties and the Government of Sudan, on the one hand, and the SPLM-N, on the other, and 
a Plan of Action intended to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in 
SPLM-N-held areas in the two states. While the Government has accepted the Plan of 
Action, the SPLM-N had not yet done so at the time of writing, so that the plan remained 
unimplemented.56<b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. In the case of Abyei, humanitarian access has generally been restricted from 
Khartoum, so that the majority of assistance has been provided by humanitarian 
organizations based in South Sudan. There are reports that some movement back to Abyei 
have taken place, particularly following the withdrawal of South Sudanese Police, the 
Sudanese Police and SAF from the area in May 2012, which allowed the United Nations

<p>Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) to implement its stabilization mandate.57 The 
Special Rapporteur is particularly encouraged that the negotiations undertaken in Addis 
Ababa in March 2013, under the auspices of the African Union Commission, resulted in the 
signing of the Implementation Matrix for the nine agreements between Sudan and South 
Sudan, including the Agreement on Temporary Arrangements for the Administration and 
Security of the Abyei Area.58  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Various contexts of internal displacement, both new and protracted, are evident 
in Sudan, including displacement due to armed conflict, communal violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts over resources as a result of the effects of climate change. The Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan has made some efforts to try to address the sources as well as the consequences of 
</b></p>
<p><b>internal displacement, and to work towards peace and sustainable solutions. In Darfur, 
</b></p>
<p><b>these include the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur of July 2011, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>contains some provisions for achieving durable solutions for IDPs and returnees, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Framework Agreement</b> <b>on the Status of Nationals of the other State and Related 
Matters provides a mechanism allowing for the regularization of stay of persons of 
</b></p>
<p><b>South Sudanese origin in Sudan. In the three Protocol Areas, the Government has 
</b></p>
<p><b>endeavoured to provide humanitarian assistance in their areas of control, but a political 
</b></p>
<p><b>solution is urgently required. While the various agreements to which the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan has committed offer new opportunities to work towards peace and durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions, visible results for affected communities continue to be challenged by a number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of factors, including the lack of comprehensive political solutions and the slow pace of 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of existing agreements, insecurity, limited access and capacity, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>insufficient preventive measures, such as conflict-resolution mechanisms. The resulting 
</b></p>
<p><b>human and socioeconomic toll on the country has created deep vulnerabilities among 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement-affected communities, already affected by environmental challenges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including more frequent and prolonged droughts and food insecurity which is 
</b></p>
<p><b>exacerbated by conflict and rising food prices. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>In particular, issues related to humanitarian access and Government capacity 
have challenged the effectiveness of assistance and protection programmes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international support. A more open and enabling environment could reverse this 
</b></p>
<p><b>dynamic and create the required space for greater solutions-oriented cooperation. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>a context could provide the opportunity for the implementation of practical measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>that can respond to new displacements, better protect and assist IDPs affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>protracted displacement, and secure a long-awaited transition from humanitarian to 
</b></p>
<p><b>durable solutions.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>64. In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations.

<p>65.  <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Sudan:</b> 
</p>
<p><b><i>  IDP legislative, policy and institutional frameworks  
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a) <b>Develop a comprehensive national framework on internal displacement, 
including national legislation, in line with the relevant Great Lakes Protocols, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the African Union Convention for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention), and ratify the latter at the earliest opportunity. In this context, review the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national IDP policy with a view to making any necessary changes and provide the 
</b></p>
<p><b>required institutional resources for effective implementation of the policy and legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks;  
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Humanitarian access 
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b) <b>Establish and implement clear, predictable and transparent procedures, 
which are communicated to all parties concerned and which facilitate timely, effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>and unimpeded humanitarian access at the capital, regional, state and local levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including for the staff of the United Nations, its implementing partners and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international NGOs;  
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  National capacity-building  
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c) <b>In cooperation with the international community, continue to strengthen 
capacity-building efforts for national actors in all sectors, including with regard to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of human rights, protection, and durable solutions for IDPs (including 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups), access to services and mainstreaming of the </b>&#8220;<b>Do No Harm</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle in humanitarian action; 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Enabling environment, participation and consultation  
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d) <b>Strengthen systems of work and cooperation with NGOs, civil society, 
the United Nations and communities affected by internal displacement, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote the principle of freedom of expression, meaningful consultation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation and information-sharing with a view to enhancing mutual trust and 
</b></p>
<p><b>more effective responses to displacement and development approaches; 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Addressing underlying causes triggering or exacerbating internal displacement  
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e) <b>Initiate a multi-stakeholder process or mechanism, such as a 
commission, to look into the root causes and exacerbating factors triggering or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prolonging internal displacement in Sudan, with the aim of providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations on immediate, medium- and long-term strategies to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>various challenges, including, inter alia, the slow-onset effects of climate change; 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts between pastoralist and farmer communities; land and resource 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>political processes to resolve conflict and displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Prevention and mitigation 
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(f) <b>Establish or further develop early-warning, conflict-resolution and 
mediation mechanisms, including at the local level, to address issues and conflicts which 
</b></p>
<p><b>are likely to trigger forced internal displacement or pose an obstacle to durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions. Where effective and consistent with human rights standards, consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>adapting existing community structures and traditional conflict-resolution mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>for this purpose;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>  Information collection and dissemination 
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(g) <b>Strengthen information-gathering and management systems relating to 
internal displacement, including, inter alia, updated and disaggregated statistics on 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs in camps and in non-camp situations, and their needs and intentions with regard 
</b></p>
<p><b>to durable solutions; the situation of particularly vulnerable groups (e.g.

<p><b><i>  With regard to Darfur 
</i></b></p>
<p><b> </b>(h) <b>Develop, in cooperation with the international community and affected

</b></p>
<p><b>activities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(i) <b>Continue engagement with relevant actors with a view to achieving more 
comprehensive and inclusive political solutions and/or agreements to the conflict that

</b></p>
<p><b>particular, promote investments and assistance in areas of return, especially in 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>underlying land and insecurity issues (including between pastoralist and farmer
