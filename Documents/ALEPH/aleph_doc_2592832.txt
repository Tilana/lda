NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Interim Financial Statements - The interim consolidated financial statements included herein
have been prepared by the management of Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P., without audit. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations have been made.
A.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures normally required by
GAAP, or those normally made in an Annual Report on Form 10-K, although the Company
believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. It is
suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto which are incorporated in Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P.’s annual report on
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 25, 2016.
The results of operations for the interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of the results
to be expected for the full year.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates impacting the
Company’s financial statements include revenue and expense accruals and oil and gas
reserve quantities. In the oil and gas industry, and especially as related to the Company’s
natural gas sales, the processing of actual transactions generally occurs 60-90 days after the
month of delivery of its product. Consequently, accounts receivable from production and oil
and gas sales are recorded using estimated production volumes and market or contract prices.
Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recorded in subsequent period’s
financial results. As is typical in the oil and gas industry, a significant portion of the Company’s
accounts receivable from production and oil and gas sales consists of unbilled receivables. Oil
and gas reserve quantities are utilized in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and
amortization and the impairment of oil and gas wells and also impact the timing and costs
associated with asset retirement obligations. The Company’s estimates, especially those
related to oil and gas reserves, could change in the near term and could significantly impact
B.
the Company’s results of operations and financial position.

EVERFLOW EASTERN PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization - Everflow Eastern Partners, L.P. (“Everflow”) is a Delaware limited partnership
which was organized in September 1990 to engage in the business of oil and gas acquisition,
exploration, development and production. Everflow was formed to consolidate the business
and oil and gas properties of Everflow Eastern, Inc. (“EEI”) and subsidiaries and the oil and
gas properties owned by certain limited partnership and working interest programs managed
or sponsored by EEI (“EEI Programs” or the “Programs”).
C.
Everflow Management Limited, LLC (“EML”), an Ohio limited liability company, is the general
partner of Everflow and, as such, is authorized to perform all acts necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes and conduct of the business of Everflow. The members of EML are
Everflow Management Corporation ("EMC"); two individuals who are officers and directors of
EEI and employees of Everflow; one individual who is the Chairman of the Board of EEI; one
individual who is an employee of Everflow; and one private limited liability company founded
by an individual who is a director of EEI. EMC is an Ohio corporation formed in September
1990 and is the managing member of EML. EML holds no assets other than its general
partner’s interest in Everflow, nor does it have any liabilities. In addition, EML has no separate
operations or role apart from its role as the Company’s general partner.
D.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Everflow, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including EEI, and interests with joint venture
partners (collectively, the “Company”), which are accounted for under the proportional
consolidation method. All significant accounts and transactions between the consolidated
entities have been eliminated.
Cash and Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
E.
Cash and Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  The Company
maintains, at various financial institutions, cash and equivalents which may exceed federally
insured amounts and which may, at times, significantly exceed balance sheet amounts due to
float.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and equivalents include $1,024,535
and $1,004,953, respectively, of joint venture partner advances, which are funds collected and
held on behalf of joint venture partners for their anticipated share of future plugging and
abandonment costs, including interest earned.

EVERFLOW EASTERN PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Investments – The Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and
consist of shares held in a mutual fund that invests primarily in investment grade, U.S. dollar
denominated short-term fixed and floating rate debt securities. The mutual fund seeks current
income while seeking to maintain a low volatility of principal. Dividend earnings on
investments amounted to approximately $14,700 during the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016. The Company did not hold any investments during 2015.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board established a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs and defines valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives highest priority to Level I inputs and lowest priority to Level III inputs. The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
F.
Level I – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of
the reporting date.
Level II – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly
or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of
models or other valuation methodologies.
Level III – Pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instrument and include situations
where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the
determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.
The Company’s investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted prices available
in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1.
Asset Retirement Obligations - GAAP requires the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. For the Company, these obligations include
dismantlement, plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and associated pipelines and
equipment. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depleted over the estimated useful life of the related asset.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
G.Asset Retirement Obligations (continued)
The estimated liability is based on historical experience in dismantling, plugging and
The estimated liability is based on historical experience in dismantling, plugging and
abandoning wells, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserves estimates,
estimates of the external cost to dismantle, plug and abandon the wells in the future and
federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using an assumed credit-
adjusted, risk-free interest rate. Revisions to the liability will likely occur due to: changes in
estimates of dismantlement, plugging and abandonment costs; changes in estimated
remaining lives of the wells; changes in federal or state regulations regarding plugging and
abandonment requirements; and other factors. At December 31, 2015, the Company made
revisions in estimates of remaining lives of wells.
The Company has no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling its asset retirement
obligations. The Company has determined that there are no other material retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets.
The schedule below is a reconciliation of the Company’s liability for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015:

Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes oil and gas revenues when production is
sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred, title and risk
of loss have transferred to the purchaser, and collectability of the revenue is reasonably
assured. The Company utilizes the sales method to account for gas production volume
imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recognized only when gas is produced and sold
on the Company’s behalf. The Company had no material gas imbalances at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. Other revenues consist of gain on sale of deep rights and other
miscellaneous revenues. Gain on sale of deep rights is recognized when title to deep mineral
interests has been transferred and all terms and conditions to the sale have been met. Other
miscellaneous revenues are recognized at the time services are rendered, the Company has a
contractual right to such revenue and collection is reasonably assured.

H.Revenue Recognition (continued)
The Company participates (and may act as drilling contractor) with unaffiliated joint venture
partners and employees in the drilling, development and operation of jointly owned oil and
gas properties.
Each owner, including the Company, has an undivided interest in the jointly owned properties.
Generally, the joint venture partners and employees participate on the same
drilling/development cost basis as the Company and, therefore, no revenue, expense or
income is recognized on the drilling and development of the properties. Accounts and notes
receivable from joint venture partners and employees consist principally of drilling and
development costs the Company has advanced or incurred on behalf of joint venture partners
and employees (see Note 6). The Company earns and receives monthly management and
operating fees from certain joint venture partners and employees after the properties are
completed and placed into production.
Income Taxes - Everflow is not a tax-paying entity and the net taxable income or loss, other
than the taxable income or loss allocable to EEI, which is a C corporation owned by Everflow,
will be allocated directly to its respective partners. The Company is not able to determine the
net difference between the tax bases and the reported amounts of Everflow’s assets and
liabilities due to separate elections that were made by owners of the working interests and
limited partnership interests that comprised the Programs.
I.
The Company believes that it has appropriate support for any tax positions taken and, as such,
does not have any uncertain tax positions that are material to the financial statements.  The
Company's tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as
various state and local taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed.
Allocation of Income and Per Unit Data - Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement,
initially, 99% of revenues and costs were allocated to the Unitholders (the limited partners) and
1% of revenues and costs were allocated to the General Partner. Such allocation has changed
and may change in the future due to Unitholders electing to exercise the Repurchase Right
and select officers and employees electing to exercise options (see Note 3).
J.
Earnings per limited partner Unit have been computed based on the weighted average number
of Units outstanding during each period presented. Average outstanding Units for earnings per
limited partner Unit calculations amounted to 5,587,616 and 5,601,003 for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
New Accounting Standards – In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”).  ASU 2014-09 is intended to improve the financial
reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers by providing a principle
based approach.  The core principle of the standard is that revenue should be recognized
when the transfer of promised goods or services is made in an amount that the entity expects
to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of goods and services.  ASU 2014-09 also
requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The
K.
original effective date for financial statements issued by public companies was for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.   In July 2015, through issuance of ASU
2014-15, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption
is permitted prior to the original effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of these standards on the financial statements.
The Company has reviewed all other recently issued accounting standards in order to
determine their effects, if any, on the consolidated financial statements. Based on that review,
the Company believes that none of these standards will have a significant effect on current or
future earnings or results of operations.

Note 3.Partners’ Equity
Units represent limited partnership interests in Everflow. The Units are transferable
subject to the approval of EML and to the laws governing the transfer of securities. The
Units are not listed for trading on any securities exchange nor are they quoted in the
automated quotation system of a registered securities association. However, Unitholders
may have an opportunity to require Everflow to repurchase their Units pursuant to the
Repurchase Right.
F-12
Table Of Contents
EVERFLOW EASTERN PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 3.Partners’ Equity (continued)
The partnership agreement provides that Everflow will repurchase for cash up to 10% of
the then outstanding Units, to the extent Unitholders offer Units to Everflow for
repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Right. The Repurchase Right entitles any
Unitholder, between May 1 and June 30 of each year, to notify Everflow that the Unitholder
elects to exercise the Repurchase Right and have Everflow acquire certain or all Units.
The price to be paid for any such Units is calculated based upon the audited financial
statements of the Company as of December 31 of the year prior to the year in which the
Repurchase Right is to be effective and independently prepared reserve reports. The price
per Unit equals 66% of the adjusted book value of the Company allocable to the Units,
divided by the number of Units outstanding at the beginning of the year in which
the applicable Repurchase Right is to be effective less interim cash distributions received
by a Unitholder. The adjusted book value is calculated by adding partners’ equity, the
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and the tax effect included in
the Standardized Measure and subtracting from that sum the carrying value of oil and gas
properties (net of undeveloped lease costs). If more than 10% of the then outstanding
Units are tendered during any period during which the Repurchase Right is to be effective,
the Investors’ Units tendered shall be prorated for purposes of calculating the actual
number of Units to be acquired during any such period. The Company determined that the
price associated with the 2016 Repurchase Right, based upon the December 31, 2015
calculation, was negative, and as such the Company did not offer to repurchase Units in
2016. The Company has not made a distribution in 2016.
The Company has an Option Repurchase Plan (the “Option Plan”) which permits the grant
of options to select officers and employees to purchase certain Units acquired by the
Company pursuant to the Repurchase Right. The purpose of the Option Plan is to assist
the Company to attract and retain officers and other key employees and to enable those
individuals to acquire or increase their ownership interest in the Company in order to
encourage them to promote the growth and profitability of the Company. The Option Plan
is designed to align directly the financial interests of the participants with the financial
interests of the Unitholders. The Company did not grant any options in 2016. In June 2015,
the Company granted options to officers and an employee. All options granted were
exercised on the same date.
Units repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Right and Units issued through the
exercise of options pursuant to the Option Plan (collectively the “Units Activity”) for the
years 2014 and 2015 are as follows:
Per Unit
 Calculated

Units issued through the exercise of options pursuant to the Option Plan. There were no
instruments outstanding at June 30, 2016 or 2015 that would potentially dilute net income
per Unit.

Note 4.Gas Purchase Agreements
The Company has multiple contracts with Dominion Field Services and Interstate Gas
Supply (collectively, the “Gas Purchasers”) which obligate the Gas Purchasers to
purchase, and the Company to sell and deliver, certain quantities of natural gas
production from the Company’s oil and gas properties throughout the contract periods.
The Company may elect to lock-in specific volumes of natural gas to be sold in specific
months at a mutually agreeable price. The Company has elected to lock-in various
monthly quantities of natural gas which total 690,000 MCF from November 2016 through
October 2017 at various monthly weighted-average pricing provisions averaging $2.46 per
MCF, net of regional basis adjustments. Pricing provisions with the Gas Purchasers apply
to certain fixed quantities on a monthly basis with excess monthly quantities being priced
based on the current spot market price, plus or minus a current regional basis adjustment.
The impact of these contracts on the Company’s future oil and gas sales cannot fully be
measured until actual production volumes and prices have been determined.
Note 5.Commitments and Contingencies
The Company operates exclusively in the United States, almost entirely in Ohio and
Pennsylvania, in the business of oil and gas acquisition, exploration, development and
production. The Company operates in an environment with many financial risks, including,
but not limited to, the ability to acquire additional economically recoverable oil and gas
reserves, the inherent risks of the search for, development of and production of oil and
gas, the ability to sell oil and gas at prices which will provide attractive rates of return, the
volatility and seasonality of oil and gas production and prices, and the highly competitive
and, at times, seasonal nature of the industry and worldwide economic conditions. The
Company’s ability to expand its reserve base and diversify its operations is also
dependent upon the Company’s ability to obtain the necessary capital through operating
cash flow, borrowings or equity offerings. Various federal, state and governmental
agencies are considering, and some have adopted, laws and regulations regarding
environmental protection which could adversely affect the proposed business activities of
the Company. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, current and future
regulations may have on the operations of the Company.
The Company has natural gas delivery commitments to two Gas Purchasers (See Note 4).
Management believes the Company can meet its delivery commitments based on
estimated production. If, however, the Company cannot meet its delivery commitments, it
may be required to purchase natural gas at market prices to meet such commitments
which may result in a gain or loss for the difference between the delivery commitment
price and the price at which the Company is able to purchase the natural gas for redelivery
(resale) to its customers.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 5.Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
In conjunction with the sale of approximately 28,800 acres of deep rights made in 2012, the
Company agreed to perpetuate the producing leases for a minimum period of five years. If
the Company fails to perpetuate the producing leases during such five-year period, it shall
refund to the purchaser the portion of the purchase price attributable to the affected
properties based on an allocated value of $1,250 per acre (the “Refund Price”), provided
however, that should the Company revive or otherwise renew such expired leases within
three months of their expiration, the purchaser shall have the right to acquire the deep
rights on such revived or renewed leases for the Refund Price. The Company has
assessed the shallow operations of all properties from which deep acreage was sold and
does not believe a reserve for potential refunded acreage to be necessary at June 30,
2016.
The Company is party to various legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of
its business. The Company believes certain of these matters will be covered by insurance
and that the outcome of other matters will not have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Note 6.Related Party Transactions
The Company’s officers, directors, affiliates and certain employees have frequently
participated, and will likely continue to participate in the future, as working interest owners
in wells in which the Company has an interest. Frequently, the Company has loaned the
funds necessary for certain employees to participate in the drilling and development of
such wells. Initial terms of the unsecured loans call for repayment of all principal and
accrued interest at the end of four years, however, the loan amounts are reduced from
payments made by employees and as production proceeds attributable to the employees’
working interests are not remitted to the employees but rather used to reduce the amounts
owed by the employees to the Company. If an outstanding balance remains after the initial
four-year term, the Company and employee shall, acting in good faith, agree upon further
repayment terms.
Employees remain obligated for the entire loan amount regardless of a dry-hole event or
otherwise insufficient production. The loans carry no loan forgiveness provisions, and no
loans have ever been forgiven. The loans accrue interest at the prime rate, which was
3.50% at June 30, 2016.
In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company has not extended any
loans to officers or directors since 2002. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company has extended various loans, evidenced by notes, to two employees with
origination dates ranging from December 2010 to December 2015. In addition, three
subsequent addenda extending additional two-year payment terms to certain notes are
outstanding at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Employees’ notes receivable,
including accrued interest, amounted to $88,124 and $124,437 at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.

Working capital of $19.8 million as of June 30, 2016 represented a decrease of
$647,000 from December 31, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in cash and equivalents,
offset somewhat by an increase in investments and a decrease in accrued expenses. The
decrease in cash and equivalents was primarily the result of cash held at December 31,
2015 being used in operating and investing activities during the six months ended June
30, 2016. The increase in investments was the result of purchases of shares in a mutual
fund that invests primarily in investment grade, short-term fixed and floating rate debt
securities. The decrease in accrued expenses was primarily the result of all payroll and
retirement contributions accrued at December 31, 2015 having been paid during the six
months ended June 30, 2016.
The Company funds its operation with cash generated by operations and/or
existing cash and equivalent balances. The Company has had no borrowings since 2003
and no principal indebtedness was outstanding as of August 10, 2016.

Table Of Contents
The Company’s cash flow used in operations before the change in working capital was
$688,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 million as
compared to $938,000 of cash flow provided by operations before the change in working
capital during the prior comparable period. Changes in working capital from operations
other than cash and equivalents decreased cash by $467,000 during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 due primarily to a decrease in accrued expenses. Cash flows used in
operating activities was $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Management of the Company believes cash flows and existing cash and equivalents
should be sufficient to meet the current funding requirements of ongoing operations and
capital investments to develop and/or purchase oil and gas properties. The Company has
not paid a quarterly cash distribution since October 2015 and it does not anticipate
resuming the payment of quarterly distributions during 2016. The Company’s intentions
may change, however, based upon unforeseen changes in the national and/or regional oil
and gas markets and their related effect on cash flows or other unrelated factors that have
an unforeseen effect on cash flows.
The Company has multiple contracts with Dominion Field Services and Interstate Gas
Supply (collectively, the “Gas Purchasers”) which obligate the Gas Purchasers to
purchase, and the Company to sell and deliver, certain quantities of natural gas
production from the Company’s oil and gas properties throughout the contract periods.
The Company may elect to lock-in specific volumes of natural gas to be sold in specific
months at a mutually agreeable price. The Company has elected to lock-in various
monthly quantities of natural gas which total 690,000 MCF from November 2016 through
October 2017 at various monthly weighted-average pricing provisions averaging $2.46 per
MCF, net of estimated regional basis adjustments. Pricing provisions with the Gas
Purchasers apply to certain fixed quantities on a monthly basis with excess monthly
quantities being priced based on the current spot market price, plus or minus a current
regional basis adjustment. The impact of these contracts on the Company’s future oil and
gas sales cannot fully be measured until actual production volumes and prices have been
determined.

Revenues for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased $820,000
and $2.3 million, respectively, as compared to the prior comparable periods. Both
decreases were primarily the result of decreases in crude oil and natural gas sales.
Crude oil and natural gas sales decreased $811,000, or 52%, during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. Crude oil and natural
gas sales decreased $2.1 million, or 60%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the prior comparable period. The decreases were primarily the result of less
natural gas and crude oil volumes produced and lower average natural gas and crude oil
prices received during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared
to the prior comparable periods. The decrease in natural gas volumes produced during
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior
comparable periods was primarily the result of Company operated properties being
voluntarily shut-in during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 that were
not shut-in during the prior comparable periods.
5
Table Of Contents
The Company recognized $28,000 of other revenues during the six months ended June
30, 2016, a decrease of $76,000 as compared to the prior comparable period. Other
revenues of $104,000 recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2015 were
primarily the result of a sale of deep mineral interests associated with 80 acres held by a
lease owned by the Company. The Company retained the rights to the shallow portion of
the acreage sold. The Company did not recognize any sales of deep mineral interests
during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Production costs decreased $263,000, or 37%, during the three month period ended June
30, 2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. Production costs decreased
$453,000, or 28%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
prior comparable period. These decreases were primarily the result of less costs
associated with Company operated oil and gas properties voluntarily shut-in during the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 that were not shut-in during the prior
comparable periods, as well as less costs associated with oil and gas properties operated
by third parties.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $177,000, or 15%, during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. DD&A
decreased $229,000, or 10%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
the prior comparable period. The primary reasons for the decreases are lower natural gas
and crude oil volumes produced and less depletable bases of oil and gas properties
available to deplete during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the prior comparable periods. The decrease in natural gas volumes
produced was primarily the result of Company operated properties being voluntarily shut-
in during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 that were not shut-in
during the prior comparable periods. The decrease in crude oil volumes produced was
primarily the result of natural production decline. Less depletable bases of oil and gas
properties is primarily the result of $21.9 million of DD&A, write down/impairment and
abandonment of properties recognized during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
The effects of lower natural gas and crude oil volumes produced and less depletable
bases of oil and gas properties on DD&A was offset somewhat by the effects of lower
projected natural gas and crude oil reserves and additional oil and gas properties being
depleted during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
prior comparable periods. The decrease in projected natural gas and crude oil reserves is
primarily the result of lower benchmark natural gas and crude oil prices indexed
throughout the first six months of 2016 as compared to the benchmark prices indexed
throughout the prior comparable period. The lower 2016 benchmark prices project to
decrease reserves at December 31, 2016, the next scheduled valuation date, which will in
turn project to decrease the average economic life of the Company’s oil and gas
properties as compared to December 31, 2015, the prior valuation date. Additional oil and
gas properties being depleted are primarily the result of $5.1 million of additions to proved
properties and asset retirement obligations recognized at December 31, 2015 in
association with revisions made to remaining lives of wells.
Accretion expense decreased $56,000, or 37%, during the three month period ended June
30, 2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. Accretion expense decreased
$94,000, or 31%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
prior comparable period. The primary reasons for these decreases was the result of more
asset retirement obligations being fully accreted at January 1, 2016 as compared to
January 1, 2015, which resulted in less discounted asset retirement obligations available
to accrete during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
prior comparable periods.

Table Of Contents
General and administrative expense decreased $46,000, or 8%, during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. General and
administrative expense decreased $110,000, or 9%, during the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the prior comparable period. The primary reason for this decrease is
the result of cost-cutting measures management has implemented in response to the
current environment of depressed crude oil and natural gas prices within the national and
regional oil and gas industries and its related effects on the Company’s sales, operational
cash flows and working capital.
The Company reported a net loss of $1.3 million and $3.1 million during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, whereas the Company reported a net loss of
$1.0 million and $1.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively. The additional net loss recognized in both periods was primarily the result of
decreases in crude oil and natural gas sales, offset somewhat by decreases in production
costs, DD&A, accretion expense and general and administrative expense. The additional
net loss recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior
comparable period was also the result of a decrease in other revenues. The Company’s
net loss represented 146% and 61% of total revenues during the three month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s net loss represented 187%
and 45% of total revenues during the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting
policies that affect the Company’s more complex judgments and estimates are described
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015.
Forward-Looking Statements
Except for historical financial information contained in this Form 10-Q, the statements
made in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). In addition, words
such as “expects,” “anticipate,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” variations of
such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements include price fluctuations in the gas market in the Appalachian Basin, actual oil
and gas production and the ability to locate economically productive oil and gas
prospects for development by the Company. In addition, any forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.

the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15 (the “evaluation”). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation,
management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
The certifications of the Company’s CEO and CFO are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2
to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and include, in paragraph 4 of such certifications,
information concerning the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. Such certifications should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in this Item 4., including the information incorporated by reference
to our filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a more complete
understanding of the matters covered by such certifications.
(b)     Changes in internal control over financial reporting. No change in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred
during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
