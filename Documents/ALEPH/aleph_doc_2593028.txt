Chesapeake will purchase any Notes that have been validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase, subject to all conditions
to the Tender Offers having been either satisfied or waived by Chesapeake, promptly following
the Expiration Date (the date of such acceptance and purchase, the “Settlement Date”), subject to
the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the 2038 Tender Cap, the Acceptance Priority
Levels and proration as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Settlement Date is expected to
occur on the second business day following the Expiration Date, assuming the conditions to the
Tender Offers have been either satisfied or waived by Chesapeake at or prior to the Expiration
Date.
Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount and proration as described in the Offer to
Purchase, all 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (the “2037 Notes”) validly
tendered will be accepted for purchase before any 2038 Notes validly tendered are accepted for
purchase. Accordingly, if the aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) of 2037
Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date equals or exceeds the Aggregate
Maximum Purchase Amount, Chesapeake will not accept for purchase any 2038 Notes. If the
aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) of 2037 Notes validly tendered at or
prior to the Expiration Date exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, 2037 Notes
validly tendered will be accepted for purchase on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate
principal amount of 2037 Notes validly tendered. Once all 2037 Notes validly tendered have
been accepted for purchase, subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the 2038
Tender Cap and proration as described in the Offer to Purchase, 2038 Notes validly tendered will
be accepted for purchase. If the aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) of 2037
Notes validly tendered is less than the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount and the aggregate
purchase price of 2037 Notes and 2038 Notes validly tendered exceeds the Aggregate Maximum
Purchase Amount, 2038 Notes validly tendered will be accepted for purchase on a pro rata basis,
based on the aggregate principal amount of 2038 Notes validly tendered. If the aggregate
purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) of 2038 Notes validly tendered at or prior to the
Expiration Date exceeds the 2038 Tender Cap, 2038 Notes validly tendered will be accepted for
purchase on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount of 2038 Notes validly
tendered.
The Tender Offers are not conditioned upon a minimum amount of Notes of any series, or a
minimum amount of Notes of all series, being tendered. However, the Tender Offers are subject
to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to
Purchase, including receipt by Chesapeake of net proceeds from a concurrent secured term loan
agreement on terms satisfactory to Chesapeake in an amount sufficient to fund the payment of
the Total Consideration and to fund the consideration for the Concurrent Tender Offers. The term
loan agreement is expected to be with one or more banks, investment banks, insurance
companies, mutual funds or other institutional lenders providing for floating rate term loans
aggregating $1.0 billion. Such term loans are to be secured by the same collateral as the liens on
the collateral securing the Company’s existing revolving credit facility (with a position in the
collateral proceeds waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility) and are to be guaranteed by the
same subsidiaries that guarantee, among other obligations, such revolving credit facility.
Chesapeake also announced today that it has commenced separate tender offers to acquire up
to $500 million in aggregate purchase price of its outstanding 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior
Notes due 2017, 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017, 7.25% Senior Notes due 2018, Floating Rate
Senior Notes due 2019, 6.625% Senior Notes due 2020, 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020,
6.125% Senior Notes due 2021, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021, 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022
and 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Concurrent Tender Offers”). Chesapeake’s obligation to
consummate the Tender Offers is not subject to completion of the Concurrent Tender Offers.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as the dealer manager in the Tender Offers. Global Bondholder
Services Corporation has been retained to serve as both the depositary and the information
agent for the Tender Offers. Persons with questions regarding the Tender Offers should contact
Goldman, Sachs & Co. at (toll-free) (800) 828-3182 or (collect) (212) 902-6941. Requests for

should be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (toll-free) (866) 470-4200 or

Securities and Exchange Commission later today. Chesapeake will make available to holders of
the Notes, directly or through the Depository Trust Company, documents specifying the terms,
conditions and procedures for validly tendering and withdrawing Notes (copies of which will be
attached as exhibits to such Schedule TO). Note holders are encouraged to read these
documents carefully before deciding whether to tender their Notes. Holders of the Notes and
other interested parties may obtain a free copy of these documents at the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s website, www.sec.gov.

None of Chesapeake, its board of directors, its officers, the dealer manager, the depositary, the
information agent or the trustee with respect to the Notes, or any of their respective affiliates,
makes any recommendation that holders tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of the
principal amount of their Notes, and no one has been authorized by any of them to make such a
recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to whether to tender their Notes and,
if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. The Tender Offers are made only by the Offer to
Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal. This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor
a solicitation of an offer to sell any notes in the Tender Offers. The Tender Offers are not being
made to holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not
be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction
in which the Tender Offers are required to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Tender
Offers will be deemed to be made on behalf of Chesapeake by the dealer manager or one or
more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.
