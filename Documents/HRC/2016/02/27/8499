The human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on human rights 
and access to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, resolutions 7/22 of 28 March 
2008, 12/8 of 1 October 2009 and 15/9 of 30 September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 64/292 of 28 July 2010, in which the 
Assembly recognizes the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human 
right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights,  
<i> Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> relevant provisions of declarations and programmes with regard to 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation adopted by major United Nations conferences 
and summits, and by the General Assembly at its special sessions and during follow-up 
meetings, inter alia, the Mar del Plata Action Plan on Water Development and 
Administration, adopted at the United Nations Water Conference in March 1977, Agenda 
21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted at the United 
Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992, and the Habitat 
Agenda, adopted at the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in June 
1996, Assembly resolutions 54/175 of 17 December 1999 on the right to development, and 
58/217 of 23 December 2003 proclaiming the International Decade for Action, &#8220;Water for 
Life&#8221; (2005&#8211;2015),  
<i> Noting</i> <i>with interest</i> relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human right 
to safe drinking water and sanitation, including the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first 
Africa-South America Summit, in 2006, the message from Beppu, adopted at the first Asia-
Pacific Water Summit, in 2007, the Delhi Declaration, adopted at the third South Asian 
Conference on Sanitation, in 2008, and the Sharm el-Sheikh Final Document, adopted at 
the Fifteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Movement of 
Non-Aligned Countries, in 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve 
fully the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing, in that context, the resolve of 
Heads of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration, to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe 
drinking water, and to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as 
agreed in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document adopted at the High-
level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium 
Development Goals entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals&#8221;,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 884 million people lack access to improved 
water sources and that more than 2.6 billion people do not have access to improved 
sanitation as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund in their 2010 Joint Monitoring Programme report, and alarmed that, every year, </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>approximately 1.5 million children under 5 years of age die and 443 million school days are 
lost as a result of water- and sanitation-related diseases,  
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> the need to focus on local and national perspectives in considering the 
issue, leaving aside questions of international watercourse law and all transboundary water 
issues, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate 
holders of the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate 
holder shall discharge his or her duties in accordance with those resolutions and the 
annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the recognition of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the affirmation by 
the latter that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right 
to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human 
dignity;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also welcomes</i> the work of the independent expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including the 
progress in collecting good practices for her compendium,1 the comprehensive, transparent 
and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions 
for her thematic reports and compilation of good practices, as well as the undertaking of 
country missions;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Taking note</i> <i>with interest</i> of the statement of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights on the right to sanitation,2 as a complement to the Committee&#8217;s 
general comment No. 15;3 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the current mandate holder as a special 
rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation for a period of three 
years;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, in fulfilling his or her mandate: 
</p>
<p> (a) To promote the full realization of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by, inter alia, continuing to give particular emphasis to practical solutions with 
regard to its implementation, in particular in the context of country missions, and following 
the criteria of availability, quality, physical accessibility, affordability and acceptability;  
</p>
<p> (b) To pay particular attention to persons belonging to vulnerable and 
marginalized groups, including by respecting the principles of non-discrimination and 
gender equality; 
</p>
<p> (c) To work on identifying challenges and obstacles to the full realization of the 
human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as protection gaps thereto, and to 
continue to identify good practices and enabling factors in this regard;  
</p>
<p> (d) To monitor the way in which the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation is being realized throughout the world; 
</p>

torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending 
that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, 
used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> (d) Not to expel, return (<i>refouler</i>), extradite or in any other way transfer a person 
to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be 
in danger of being subjected to torture, stressing the importance of effective legal and 
procedural safeguards in this regard, and recognizing that diplomatic assurances, where 
used, do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, 
humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement;  
</p>
<p> (e) To ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment obtain redress, are awarded fair and adequate compensation and 
receive appropriate social, psychological, medical and other relevant specialized

centres or facilities where victims of torture can receive such treatment and where effective 
measures for ensuring the safety of their staff and patients are taken;

and encourages States to prohibit under domestic law acts constituting cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment;

degrading treatment or punishment have no subsequent involvement in the custody, 
interrogation or treatment of any person under arrest, detention, imprisonment or other </p>

amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> (i) To protect medical and other personnel for their role in documenting torture 
or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in treating 
victims of such acts;

for further information and views on individual communications of the relevant treaty 
bodies, including the Committee against Torture and the Subcommittee on the Prevention 
of Torture;  
</p>
<p> (k) To adopt a gender-sensitive approach in the fight against torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, paying special attention to gender-
based violence that constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment;  
</p>
<p> (l) To become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a matter of priority, and to give early 
consideration to signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol thereto and to designating or 
establishing truly independent and effective national preventive mechanisms for the 
prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a 
timely manner;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reminds</i> States that:  
</p>
<p> (a) Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical 
integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or to torture; 
</p>
<p> (b) Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the Committee against Torture and the

Council on the right to food, in particular Assembly resolution 65/220 of 21 December 
2010 and Council resolution 13/4 of 24 March 2010, as well as all resolutions of the 
Commission on Human Rights on the issue,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council, at which 
the Council analysed the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
realization of the right to food for all, and Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 
18 September 2008 and 12/10 of 1 October 2009,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 
2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 
2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing 
Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national 
food security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained 
in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation 
that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained </p>


<p><b>66</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
are essential, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food 
insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made in 
reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, 
determined and concerted action is taken,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of 
several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic 
factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global 
climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant 
technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed 
countries,  
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned </i>by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have 
serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, 
which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and 
alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, 
especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean,  
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food,  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the 
realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing the importance</i> of reversing the substantial decline of assistance devoted to 
agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in 
productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional 
farmers and the most vulnerable groups, as well as national and international policies that 
are conducive to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all 
relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>67 
</b></p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the evolution of the world food crisis, which 
seriously undermines the realization of the right to food for all, especially for one sixth of 
the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer from 
hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Considers</i> <i>it intolerable</i> that, according to an estimation by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the 
age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are 
undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an 
additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of 
the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could 
produce enough food to feed twelve billion people;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of 
women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to 
food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and 
water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and 
technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Stresses the need</i> to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including, in particular, 
rural women and vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and 
effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take 
steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as 
possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing 
appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to:  
</p>
<p> (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food; </p>


<p><b>68</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p> (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government;  
</p>
<p> (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population; 
</p>
<p> (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop 
rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food security, with a special focus on the 
gender-sensitive dimension;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, 
paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the 
measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses</i> that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and 
consider ways to integrate, where applicable and according to national contexts, the 
recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food33 in policies and programmes;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recognizes</i> that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural 
areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are 
especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the 
fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an 
increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural 
policies are important tools to achieve food security and rural development; and that 
support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key 
element to food security and the provision of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to

Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in countries experiencing serious drought 
and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests</i> all States and private actors, and international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective 
realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields;  
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security;  
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food;  
 21. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Stresses</i> that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries;  
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty;  
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Recognizes</i> that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of 
halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, 
as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the 
Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Reaffirms</i> that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; </p>


<p><b>70</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Urges</i> States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance, as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability and the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities relating to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country 
has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and 
strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Invites</i> all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Encourages</i> developing countries to establish regional arrangements where 
they do not exist, with the support of the international community and development 
partners to ensure adequate food production and thereby contribute to ensuring food 
security, in particular in developing countries that have scarce fertile land; 
</p>
<p> 31.  <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations of a regional approach towards ensuring food security, and expresses its 
appreciation at the current collaboration with all Rome-based institutions working 
comprehensively towards the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution 
of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of 
ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to 
adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and the increased price volatility of 
agricultural commodities on international markets, particularly on people in developing 
countries and on net food-importing countries; 
</p>
<p> 35. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and 
net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Council;

recommendations contained therein;  </p>

<p> 37. <i>Supports</i> the fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as extended 
for a period of three years by the Council in its resolution 13/4, and takes note with 
appreciation of the work conducted by the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his 
mandate; 
</p>
<p> 38. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, as part of his mandate, to continue to

by the General Assembly on 2 June 2006 and the Declaration of Commitment on 
HIV/AIDS, adopted by the Assembly on 27 June 2001,

people in low- and middle-income countries lack access to antiretroviral therapy, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, that an estimated one million end-stage AIDS patients 
have no access to treatment for moderate to severe pain, and that many people in need fail 
to receive treatment for tuberculosis and other HIV-related opportunistic infections, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States 
to ensure access for all, without discrimination, to medicines, in particular essential 
medicines that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality,

World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS Agreement), the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public 
Health, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 30 August 
2003 on the implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration and, when formal 
acceptance procedures are completed, the amendments to article 31 of the TRIPS

action on the social determinants of health, of 22 May 2009,

maternal mortality and morbidity and that, in countries with high HIV prevalence, AIDS-
related complications are one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that more than sixteen million children under the age of 18 
have been orphaned by AIDS, and that about fourteen million eight hundred thousand of 
these children live in sub-Saharan Africa, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the continuing high prevalence of HIV among key populations at 
higher risk, as defined in the 2011&#8211;2015 Strategy of the Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS, endnote 41 (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;key populations&#8221;), and the need to 
ensure their unimpeded access to HIV-related prevention, treatment, care and support,

<p><i> Mindful </i>of the importance of ensuring national, regional and international legal 
environments that ensure universal access to HIV-related prevention, treatment, care and 
support, including for key populations,

stigma, violence and abuses that affect the enjoyment of human rights and often lead to 
particular targeting of people living with, presumed to be living with or affected by 
HIV/AIDS and members of key populations, as well as to increased vulnerability to HIV, 
and also recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen programmes or measures 
to eradicate multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, violence and abuse, in 
particular by adopting or improving penal or civil legislation to address these phenomena, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of achieving Millennium Development Goal 6 (to 
combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases), and noting that poverty, inequality and 
food insecurity increase people&#8217;s vulnerability to HIV, posing increased risks of infection to 
populations in every region while at the same time undermining the socio-economic 
conditions of people living with HIV or those affected by the epidemic, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that stigma and discrimination are major obstacles to an effective HIV 
response, that discrimination on the basis of HIV status, actual or presumed, is prohibited 
by existing international human rights standards, and that the term &#8220;or other status&#8221; in non-
discrimination provisions in international human rights texts should be interpreted as 
covering health status, including HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all is an essential element in the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including in 
the areas of prevention, care, support and treatment, and that such a response reduces 
people&#8217;s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and prevents stigma and related discrimination against 
people living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i>, in view of the increasing challenges presented by HIV/AIDS, 
including apparent trends to enact criminal and other laws that are counterproductive to 
HIV prevention, treatment, care and support efforts and the ongoing application of HIV-
specific restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of HIV-positive people, the need for 
intensified efforts to ensure universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all in order to reduce vulnerability to HIV, prevent HIV/AIDS-
related discrimination and stigma and reduce the impact of AIDS,

<p> (a) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 
49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign 
and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (b) Planned Israeli settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam 
settlements in the occupied West bank, which constitutes a new settlement block; 
</p>
<p> (c) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 
2011 amounting to several thousand, including a large number of permanent buildings and 
structures, which undermine the efforts of the international community to advance the

Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (e) The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (f) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
occupied Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent, in which case it would be tantamount 
to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (g) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West 
Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, which is in clear violation of 
international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (h) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated 
closure of the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious 
humanitarian situation for the civilian population, as well as having impaired the economic 
and social rights of the Palestinian people;

the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (j) The latest Israeli plans to demolish hundreds of houses in occupied East 
Jerusalem, including their decision to demolish more than eighty eight houses in the Al-
Bustan neighbourhood of Silwan, which would result in the displacement of more than two

of person, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on human rights and terrorism and on 
the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism,

renewing its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and 
combat terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms 
and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and 
security of States and destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, and that 
the international community should take the steps necessary to enhance cooperation 
to prevent and combat terrorism,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further</i> that the promotion and protection of human rights for all 
and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that

religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their families, 
expressing its profound solidarity with them, and stressing the importance of 
providing them with assistance,

<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review

<p>324. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and President&#8217;s statements PRST/8/1 and PRST/9/2 on modalities and practices for the 
universal periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the ninth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, held from 1 to 12 November 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>325. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement 8/1, the section below 
contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, 
Member and Observer States of the Human Rights Council, as well as general comments 
made by other relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>  Liberia 
</b></p>
<p>326. The review of Liberia was held on 1 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Liberia in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBR/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBR/1/Corr.1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBR/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBR/3). 
</p><p>327. At its 31st meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the State under review (see section C below). 
328. The outcome of the review on Liberia comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/3), the views of Liberia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>329. In its intervention to the Human Rights Council, Liberia provided an update of 
activities and progress made since its review by the Working Group, as well as additional 
information to questions raised and its response to recommendations on which it had not 
yet taken a position. 
</p>
<p>330. Regarding questions raised about cooperation with human rights mechanisms and, in 
particular, whether Liberia would consider extending a standing invitation to special 
procedures, for these procedures to have the desired impact, it was essential that they 
engage with countries that are fully aware of their international human rights obligations 
and commitments. Liberia had begun to take measures to understand fully its regional and 
international human rights obligations and to analyse the roles and functions of United </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>Nations special procedures. Therefore, though it would consider extending a standing 
invitation in the future, it firmly believed that the first stage in this process is to build the 
capacity and knowledge of all relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>331. With regard to allegations of torture, Liberia continued to investigate and prosecute 
State actors accused of torture and had instituted human rights education and training for 
relevant authorities. In addition, Liberia was currently considering the adoption of an anti-
torture bill. The draft bill, which was presented to the House of Representatives in August 
of 2010, was presented for discussion during the January 2011 session. 
</p>
<p>332. Liberia also informed the Human Rights Council that the Subcommittee on the 
Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
had carried out a visit to the country in December 2010. Since the visit, the preliminary 
report of the Subcommittee had been distributed and the country was currently considering 
ways to incorporate the Subcommittee&#8217;s recommendations into programmes to improve 
conditions in detention centres and to protect citizens from torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>333. On questions raised regarding ethnic-based discrimination, Liberia was aware of the 
need to handle ethnic-based violence and disputes with cultural sensitivity while ensuring 
that all citizens receive equal treatment under the law.  
</p>
<p>334. Liberia provided information on measures taken to implement universal periodic 
review recommendations and to examine recommendations it had deferred.  
</p>
<p>335. First, it had accelerated the process for drafting and adopting the national human 
rights action plan for Liberia, and adopted a number of initiatives, including finalizing the 
workplan for nationwide consultation workshops. 
</p>
<p>336. Second, it had distributed the draft report of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review to all relevant Government and non-governmental institutions, identifying 
priorities and issues for special focus. Identified priorities would be a part of the nationwide 
consultation and would be included in the national human rights action plan.  
</p>
<p>337. Third, it had established links with other national planning activities and working 
groups to implement the universal periodic review recommendations, including 
Government organs and bodies working to implement recommendations concerning the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>338. Fourth, in collaboration with the United Nations, the Government had conducted a 
retreat on pretrial detention to determine what needed to be done to improve the work of the 
task force on pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>339. Liberia then addressed recommendations on which it had deferred taking a position. 
It observed that it had accepted 72 of 113 recommendations received.  
</p>
<p>340. Liberia was not able to take a position on deferred recommendations on the 
ratification of human rights instruments; female genital mutilation and trial by ordeal; and 
the 2008 law on the death penalty. Furthermore, it was not able to take a position on the 
implementation of some of the recommendations of the truth and reconciliation 
commission, sexual and gender-based gender violence, and pretrial detention 
</p>
<p>341. On the ratification of human rights instruments, Liberia reiterated that it was in the 
process of researching the full extent of its regional and international obligations and taking 
steps to submit overdue reports. It was thus currently unable to take a position on 
recommendations relating to the ratification and incorporation of international human rights 
conventions. However, as evidenced in accepted recommendations, it would consider 
ratifying human rights instruments.  </p>


<p><b>152</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>342. On the issues of female genital mutilation and the practice of trial by ordeal, Liberia 
explained that these were deeply-rooted traditional practices and discussions of these issues 
were often strongly resisted. Nonetheless, practitioners of female genital mutilation and 
trial by ordeal who caused harm to others had been held accountable under existing penal 
laws. Additionally, the Government was taking steps to engage local communities and to 
determine best ways to address these issues. However, the process was ongoing and 
therefore Liberia was currently unable to accept or reject all recommendations relating to 
these issues.  
</p>
<p>343. On the implementation of recommendations of the truth and reconciliation 
commission, Liberia informed the Human Rights Council that, two months earlier, the 
Supreme Court of Liberia had adopted a decision that found that the commission&#8217;s 
recommendation to ban certain Liberians from politics for 30 years was unconstitutional as 
the people concerned had not been afforded due process. Nevertheless, in the meantime, the 
Government had begun to implement other recommendations of the report, and a task force 
continued to review the report to advise on the implication of the implementation of 
recommendations. However, at this time, Liberia was unable to take a position on 
recommendations relating to the commission&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>344. Regarding recommendations on the death penalty law, Liberia was aware of existing 
concerns and ensuing recommendations emanating from its obligations under the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it 
acceded in 2005. Liberia recalled that high criminal rates had demanded the reintroduction 
of the death penalty. It stressed, however, that the current administration had not signed any 
warrant to carry out a death sentence and that the Supreme Court had been disinclined to 
enforce such penalties, commuting them to life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>345. Nevertheless, the repeal of the law allowing for the death penalty to be imposed 
would take more time and understanding by the Liberian people, and consultations with 
them in this regard had been initiated. However, for the reasons stated, Liberia was not able 
to take a position on recommendations relating to this issue.  
</p>
<p>346. Liberia referred to concrete steps taken to evaluate cases of sexual and gender-based 
violence, including the enactment of enabling legislation in 2008, creating a specialized 
criminal court, the establishment of a special prosecution unit to complement the work of 
the court, specialized training for relevant authorities and the adoption of a number of 
measures to support victims. 
</p>
<p>347. It was further stated that capacity and resource constraints still impeded full 
implementation of all of the recommendations relating to sexual gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>348. With regard to pretrial detention, Liberia explained that this was a concern of the 
utmost priority, but that, given the country&#8217;s present circumstances, most notably its limited 
resources, it was not able to take a position on this recommendation.  
</p>
<p>349. Despite the above, Liberia had implemented a number of initiatives to combat the 
problem and provided examples, including, among others, the creation of a special pretrial 
detention task force, and ongoing review and work towards law reform pertaining to jury 
law, criminal procedure and subject matter jurisdiction. 
</p><p>350. In conclusion, Liberia stated that it was eager to work with partners committed to 
assist the country during its post-conflict, peacebuilding effort, and thanked those working 
with it to create a stable and democratic country. </p>

displaced persons and refugees, and in re-establishing the country&#8217;s administration, 
economy and infrastructure, the rule of law and respect for human rights. It reiterated its 
call for appropriate international assistance to be granted to allow Liberia to act on 
priorities that had been set to improve living conditions. It also praised Liberia for having 
accepted 72 of the 113 recommendations received, 4 of which were made by Algeria. It 
encouraged Liberia to pursue the consolidation of the peace process in the country, with a 
specific strategy to emerge from the crisis and suited to the country&#8217;s specific 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>352. Cuba expressed appreciation for the fact that Liberia had accepted its 
recommendations, in particular those to continue efforts to promote and protect the rights of 
vulnerable groups such as children, women, persons with disabilities and the elderly. It 
welcomed Liberia&#8217;s strategies and plans for socio-economic development and to reduce 
poverty. Its efforts had to be supported by the international community. Cuba called upon 
developed countries to redouble their cooperation and financial assistance. It called on 
Liberia to continue to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>353. Nigeria noted with satisfaction that Liberia had accepted a large number of the 
recommendations made, and had taken positive steps to implementing them, which was an 
expression of its willingness to cooperate with relevant United Nations mechanisms. 
Nigeria encouraged Liberia to improve its policies and programmes to promote and protect 
human rights, including by promoting the status of women, girls, children and those with 
disabilities. It also encouraged Liberia to continue its efforts to guarantee the full enjoyment 
of all human rights of its people and the attainment of its Millennium Development Goals 
targets, and called upon the international community to support the country in this regard. 
</p>
<p>354. Morocco stated that Liberia was an example of democratic transition and 
reconstruction after civil conflict and highlighted that it was the first African country to 
have a woman president. It welcomed the fact that Liberia had accepted over 72 
recommendations, including those made by Morocco on education and human rights 
training. Liberia, as a least developed country, should benefit from the assistance it needed 
in order to ensure the follow-up to the recommendations. In this regard, it highlighted the 
need to make operational the fund put in place to assist developing countries in the follow-
up to universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>355. South Africa noted with appreciation the consultative process undertaken in the 
preparation of the national report, and encouraged Liberia to continue this interaction 
during the follow-up to implement the recommendations accepted during the review. It took 
note of the negative impact of its history of conflict and highlighted the importance of 
addressing the challenges set out in the national report. It encouraged the international 
community to provide the required technical assistance. It appreciated the fact that Liberia 
had addressed specific recommendations on violence against women and that these had 
been positively considered.  
</p>
<p>356. Switzerland thanked Liberia for its addendum and presentation. It recalled that 
article 32 of Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 states that recommendations that enjoy 
the support of the State concerned are to be identified as such. Other recommendations 
were to be noted. It added that, by stating that recommendations were neither accepted nor 
rejected, the delegation of Liberia did not respect article 32. It asked Liberia, like all other 
States under review, to state clearly which recommendations it accepted and which it 
rejected. It noted that, without such a clear position, a proper follow-up to 
recommendations was not possible. </p>

<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>357. S&#252;dwind noted that, despite the steps taken to combat sexual and gender-based 
violence, the high prevalence of female genital mutilation remained a matter of major 
concern, as did rape and other forms of sexual violence committed in Liberia. Over half of 
the rape cases reported involve girls under the age of 16. More than 20 per cent of those 
submitted to female genital mutilation die from excessive bleeding. It stated further that 
Liberia&#8217;s deep-rooted gender inequalities, inefficient justice system and immense poverty 
constitute major obstacles to the elimination of sexual and gender-based violence and 
female genital mutilation. S&#252;dwind urged Liberia, as a matter of priority, to declare female 
genital mutilation a criminal act, to take specific measures to prevent that practice, to 
combat impunity and to promote accountability of all reported cases of sexual and gender-
based violence.  
</p>
<p>358. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted that Liberians 
continued to suffer from the physical and psychological effects of years of violence. It also 
took note of the culture of impunity, corruption at the State level and the judiciary, and the 
general mistrust of public officials. Recourse to popular justice sometimes resulted in the 
killing of women accused of sorcery. It expressed concern for the stability and security of 
Liberia and its neighbours because of recruitment of mercenaries. It welcomed the 
establishment of a commission for human rights and encouraged emphasis on women&#8217;s and 
girls&#8217; rights, and judicial reinforcement. It invited Liberia to incorporate ratified 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p>359. Amnesty International expressed its concern, shared by many States, regarding the 
introduction in 2008 of legislation reintroducing the death penalty for persons convicted of 
armed robbery, terrorism or hijacking offences, if these crimes resulted in death. It 
considered that this legislation directly violated the State&#8217;s obligations under the second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It urged 
Liberia to abolish the Armed Robbery Act and to maintain the de facto moratorium on 
executions, in place since 1979. It was also concerned that rape and other forms of sexual 
violence against women and girls remained widespread, as did domestic violence and 
forced and underage marriage. It urged Liberia to act promptly to give effect to the 
recommendations made during the review regarding these issues.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>360. Liberia thanked those present for recognizing the efforts made, noting that these had 
been carried out in a post-conflict environment, which is a very difficult and complex 
situation. Liberia provided additional information on action taken to combat sexual and 
gender-based violence and examples of the prosecution of such cases. Liberia thanked the 
Human Rights Council once again for receiving its report and assured those present that it 
would continue its efforts in areas of concern. 
</p>
<p>361. The President of the Human Rights Council expressed his deep appreciation to 
Liberia for the comprehensive and very interesting intervention, and observed that, 
according to Council resolution 5/1, States under review should either support or note 
recommendations and therefore, following the standing practice, those recommendations on 
which Liberia was unable to pronounce itself at this time were noted.  
</p>
<p>362. Liberia clarified that a previous document had been submitted in that regard and 
noted that its current statement clarified its position.  </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>155

<p><b>  Malawi 
</b></p>
<p>363. The review of Malawi was held on 1 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Malawi in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MWI/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/MWI/1/Corr.1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MWI/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MWI/3). 
</p><p>364. At its 31st meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Malawi (see section C below). 
365. The outcome of the review on Malawi comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/4), the views of Malawi concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>366. Malawi remained committed to carry out its obligations with regard to all treaties to 
which it was a State party. When deciding to ratify international instruments, Malawi was 
guided by the fundamental democratic principles enshrined in articles 7, 8, 12 and 13 of its 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>367. Malawi addressed each of the 23 recommendations mentioned in paragraph 104 of 
the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>368. Malawi had no immediate plans to ratify the second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and would continue to listen to the 
people regarding the issue of the death penalty (recommendations 104.1, 104.7, 104.8 and 
104.10). 
</p><p>369. Malawi would consider the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (recommendations 104.8, and 104.9). 
370. Malawi would consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which was an 
ongoing process (recommendations 104.2, and 104.9). 
371. Malawi would consider the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (recommendations 
104.3 and 104.9). 
372. In September 2010, Malawi ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention of the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
(recommendations 104.6 and 104.8). 
373. Malawi had neither immediate plans nor the intention to ratify the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families (recommendation 104.8), the International Convention for the Protection of all 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance (recommendations 104.2, 104.8 and 104.9) and the </p>


<p><b>156</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (recommendations 104.8 and 
104.9). However, Malawi was engaged in an ongoing process of consideration of treaties 
that it might ratify. 
</p>
<p>374. Malawi would consider ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and had amended its Penal Code to criminalize 
genocide under domestic law (recommendation 104.5). 
</p><p>375. Regarding recommendations 104.4, 104.11, 104.12 and 104.13 calling upon Malawi 
to harmonize its national legislation with the international treaties to which Malawi is a 
State party, the Malawian Law Commission would continue to review the national 
legislation to bring it into conformity with the State&#8217;s international commitments. 
</p>
<p>376. Regarding recommendation 104.14 encouraging Malawi to ensure that human rights 
treaties are given full legal effect in domestic laws and recommendations 104.15 and 
104.16 calling on it to ensure that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women is given full legal effect in its legislation, the delegation 
stated that Malawi would strive to ensure that human rights treaties, including the 
Convention, were given that effect, and that this was an ongoing process. 
</p>
<p>377. With regard to recommendations 104.17 and 104.18 encouraging Malawi to raise the 
minimum age of criminal responsibility, the age of criminal responsibility had been raised 
from 7 to 10 years in the 2010 amendment of the Penal Code. According to the same 
amendment, a person under 14 years of age was not criminally responsible unless it could 
be demonstrated that, at the time of the commission of the crime, they had knowledge that 
they ought not to commit the crime. 
</p>
<p>378. In 2010, Malawi enacted a comprehensive law on the rights of the child, the Child 
Care Protection and Justice Act (recommendation 104.19). 
</p><p>379. With regard to recommendation 104.20 calling upon Malawi to extend a standing 
invitation to all special procedures, Malawi would consider this option and respond to the 
Council at an appropriate time. 
</p>
<p>380. With regard to recommendation 104.21 encouraging Malawi to promote equality 
between men and women, Malawi had taken active steps and would continue to work with 
international mechanisms to this end.  
</p>
<p>381. Regarding recommendations 104.22 and 104.23 encouraging Malawi to guarantee 
that no children under 14 years of age are admitted to employment and to amend the 
Constitution to raise to 18 years the minimum age for engaging in hazardous work, Malawi 
would properly address these issues.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>382. Algeria welcomed Malawi&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and respect of human 
rights. It encouraged Malawi to pay particular attention to the realization of its programmes 
to fight poverty with the assistance of the international community. Algeria commended 
Malawi&#8217;s acceptance of three of the four recommendations it had made, namely with regard 
to its 2020 socio-economic development strategy, the strengthening of its cooperation with 
regional and international mechanisms and the harmonization of the country&#8217;s laws with its 
international commitments. However, Algeria noted that Malawi had not accepted to ratify 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>383. Cuba praised Malawi&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations relating to strategies for 
socio-economic development and plans to reduce poverty. Despite the challenges faced, </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>157 
</b></p>
<p>Malawi had demonstrated progress in health care, prevention and education on HIV/AIDS 
and in food self-reliance. It encouraged Malawi to continue to implement measures to 
promote and protect the human rights of its population. It called for the international 
community to step up its cooperation and financial assistance as a positive contribution to 
these efforts. 
</p>
<p>384. Botswana<b> </b>welcomed Malawi&#8217;s acceptance of many of the recommendations made 
during the Working Group discussions. Botswana was aware of the challenges that some 
recommendations posed for national legislative processes and the administrative 
frameworks of any country. Botswana hoped that Malawi would benefit from the support of 
the international community in meeting its domestic and international obligations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>385. The United States of America expressed deep concern at Malawi&#8217;s law criminalizing 
homosexuality and recent steps that had made this law more severe by criminalizing lesbian 
relations. While the United States was troubled by Malawi&#8217;s amendment 46 to its Penal 
Code, which could expand existing limitations on media freedoms and political speech, it 
was encouraged by the Government&#8217;s public statement of 28 February 2011 clarifying the 
section&#8217;s limited purview. The United States recommended that Malawi should pursue 
steps to end discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and 
enshrine its commitment to free expression through appropriate modifications to 
amendment 46 of the Penal Code. It expressed appreciation for the fact that Malawi had 
provided clear responses to the recommendations during the Working Group discussions. 
However, it was disappointed that Malawi had not met the minimum requirements of 
Council resolution 5/1 in identifying which recommendations enjoyed its support, despite 
indicating that there were several recommendations that it accepted.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>386. Nigeria<b> </b>welcomed the steps taken to date to implement the recommendations 
adopted. Nigeria encouraged Malawi to continue its efforts to promote and protect human 
rights. Nigeria called on the international community to provide all necessary technical 
assistance to the Government for the better implementation of the recommendations 
accepted by Malawi. 
</p>
<p>387. Morocco welcomed the fact that Malawi had accepted 65 recommendations. It 
referred to Malawi&#8217;s Constitution, which recognized the principles of democracy and rule 
of law, and contained several human rights provisions. Morocco welcomed the acceptance 
of all five of its recommendations and referred to the importance of providing technical 
assistance to Malawi for the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>388. South Africa<b> </b>appreciated the commitment of the Government of Malawi to prioritize 
issues such as<b> </b>sustainable economic growth, social protection, social development, 
infrastructure development and improved governance. The number of women in high-level 
positions in government was also a reflection of Malawi&#8217;s promotion of gender equality. 
South Africa welcomed Malawi&#8217;s acceptance of a large number of recommendations. It 
encouraged Malawi to follow an inclusive process when implementing the accepted 
recommendations and that all concerned stakeholders are involved in the follow-up process. 
</p>
<p>389. The United Republic of Tanzania welcomed the implementation of Malawi Vision 
2020 with a view to providing a quality life for all. It commended the Government&#8217;s 
achievements with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, its fight against hunger 
and the reduction of maternal deaths. It praised the provision of free education at the 
primary level and its positive impact on children&#8217;s enrolment. It encouraged the 
Government to favourably consider acceding to key pending international human rights 
instruments to which it was not a party. It called on the international community to continue 
lending its full support for the efforts made by Malawi to implement its human rights 
obligations. </p>


<p><b>158</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>390. Zimbabwe<b> </b>encouraged Malawi to continue its excellent work in promoting and 
protecting human rights.<b> </b>Zimbabwe thanked the delegation for its updated presentation and 
for its acceptance of most recommendations, and its commitment to implementing them. 
Zimbabwe noted the recommendations that did not enjoy Malawi&#8217;s support and expressed 
the view that Malawi would continue to look at them at the appropriate time.<b> </b>Zimbabwe 
stood with other countries for the promotion and protection of the human rights of 
Malawian citizens and of all humankind. 
</p>
<p>391. Switzerland regretted that only one of the four recommendations it made had been 
accepted. It requested clarification on the position taken by Malawi with regard to all 
pending recommendations, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>392. The Malawi Human Rights Commission stated that it would play a consultative and 
coordinating role with the Government and non-governmental organizations, to ensure that 
the universal periodic review recommendations, including those rejected, were discussed 
and all stakeholders reached a common position. The approach to be adopted would be to 
link international instruments and treaties with the recommendations, so that the public 
could hold informed discussions on these issues. The Commission suggested that a timeline 
for follow-up be identified and that an inter-ministerial committee to monitor the 
implementation of the recommendations be established. It hoped that a number of 
improvements in the areas where the international community raised concerns could be 
made during the second cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>393. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme congratulated Malawi on 
its Vision 2020 project for socio-economic development. It welcomed the creation of a 
human rights commission, the mediator&#8217;s office and the ratification of most human rights 
instruments. It expressed concerns at detention conditions, at reports on torture and other 
ill-treatment inflicted by the members of the police, and at the prevalence of impunity. It 
encouraged Malawi to reform its criminal code in order to abolish discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. Lastly, it praised Malawi&#8217;s efforts to combat violence against women 
and human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>394. World Vision International welcomed Malawi&#8217;s commitment to work on areas such 
as children rights and violence against women. It was concerned about shortcomings in the 
educational system, and encouraged the Government to strengthen its efforts to improve 
education and health care, particularly for people living in rural areas, women, children, 
people living with disabilities and those living with HIV/AIDS. It noted that Malawi&#8217;s 
expenditure on health care fell short of the amount estimated to deliver the essential health 
package, which should be provided free of charge at all public health facilities. It urged the 
Government to put in place strong and clear mechanisms for follow-up on the 
implementation of recommendations that would allow the participation of both Government 
and civil society. World Vision was fully committed to assist Malawi in implementing its 
commitments.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>395. Franciscans International was encouraged that Malawi had accepted 
recommendations to take more effective measures ensuring accessibility of crucial public 
services in rural areas and to make education one of its top priorities. It regretted the fact 
that Malawi had rejected several recommendations relating to compulsory primary 
education, in contravention of article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
noted that overcrowding and poor teaching had been a major drawback to quality 
education, and recommended that Malawi increase its education budget to improve 
infrastructure and teaching resources for more fully trained teachers.<b> </b></p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>159 
</b></p>
<p>396. Action Canada for Population and Development regretted that Malawi had rejected 
all the recommendations calling for the prohibition of discrimination against the LGBTI 
community, as well as the decriminalization of same-sex relations. It also regretted that, in 
February 2011, Malawi had amended section 46 of the Penal Code giving powers to a 
minister to ban newspapers. It raised concerns about the Government&#8217;s decision to 
intimidate human rights defenders through public ridicule, as well as harassment of workers 
of non-governmental organizations. It therefore called on Malawi to reflect on the universal 
periodic review recommendations on these issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>397. Malawi stated that, of 127 recommendations received, it had accepted 82 and 
rejected 45. 
</p><p>398. Regarding the comment that Malawi would establish an inter-ministerial committee 
to monitor progress of the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations, 
the delegation explained that an inter-ministerial committee responsible for human rights 
issues was already in place and that it would also monitor progress regarding 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>399. With regard to the amendment of section 46 of the Penal Code, former section 46 
granted absolute powers to the Minister for Information for regulating publications. The 
Law Commission, tasked with the mandate of reviewing the laws of Malawi, had 
recommended that section 46 should be amended to bring it into line with the Constitution. 
The delegation explained that section 46 had been amended accordingly, and that the 
powers of the Minister to regulate publications were no longer discretional but based on 
reasonable grounds, and that the Minister&#8217;s decision was subject to judicial review. Malawi 
highlighted that this was an improvement over the previous situation and that, if the 
Minister were not entitled to exercise these powers, society would be exposed to child 
pornography, incitement to genocide and the like. Section 46 was amended therefore to 
protect the children and society of Malawi. 
</p>
<p>400. Malawi explained that economic and social rights were recognized in the 
Constitution, which provided for their progressive realization. Although many resources 
were required for the fulfilment of these rights, and notwithstanding its own limited 
resources, the country had taken steps to progressively fulfil the social and economic rights 
of its people. 
</p>
<p>401. Malawi thanked all the delegations for their comments and recommendations, and 
stated that it would take them into consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p>402. The review of Mongolia was held on 2 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Mongolia in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MNG/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/MNG/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MNG/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MNG/3). </p>


<p><b>160</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>403. At its 31st meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Mongolia (see section C below). 
</p><p>404. The outcome of the review of Mongolia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/5), the views of Mongolia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>405. The delegation of Mongolia expressed its appreciation for the constructive 
engagement of Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council in the interactive 
dialogue on Mongolia&#8217;s universal periodic review. In recent months, the Government had 
held extensive dialogue and consultations with relevant State agencies and non-
governmental organizations regarding the recommendations made during the interactive 
dialogue as well as Mongolia&#8217;s voluntary commitments. 
</p>
<p>406. Recalling that 129 recommendations had been made by delegations during the 
review in November 2010, Mongolia had accepted 118 of these recommendations and 
postponed the consideration of 11. After careful consideration of the remaining 11 
recommendations in the post-interactive dialogue period, the Government decided to accept 
8 recommendations and not to accept 3 recommendations at this stage. 
</p>
<p>407. The delegation provided further explanations on its position towards the above-
mentioned 11 recommendations. With regard to recommendations 86.1 and 86.2, Mongolia 
expressed its willingness to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and to the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, having in mind that the 
accession to these instruments was linked to Mongolia&#8217;s national security interests. While 
the Government had submitted its findings and conclusions on accession to these 
conventions to Parliament, the final decision fell to Parliament and thus, the Government 
was not in a position to declare acceptance of recommendations 86.1 and 86.2 at this stage. 
</p>
<p>408. Similarly, Mongolia was not in a position to accept recommendation 86.3, which 
requested to mandate the Constitutional Court to act upon violations of individual rights 
and freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. The Government had found it impractical 
to mandate the Constitutional Court, which carried supreme supervision over the 
implementation of the Constitution, to receive and address all individual complaints 
regarding the breach of the constitutional rights and freedoms, as the Constitution stipulated 
that the Court should review and pass judgement on disputes at the request of Parliament, 
the President, the Prime Minister, the Supreme Court or the Prosecutor General and/or on 
its own initiative on the basis of petitions and information received from citizens. 
Furthermore, specialized courts on civil and administrative cases functioned to deal with 
the above-mentioned cases. Nevertheless, the Government expressed its commitment to 
study the proposal further. 
</p>
<p>409. The Government had accepted recommendation 86.4, which requested to consider 
accepting individual complaint mechanisms, such as those provided for in the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention 
against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Mongolia 
was already a party to the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and to the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination 
against Women, and would consider the possibility of making declarations provided for in </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>the respective articles of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>410. Mongolia accepted recommendation 86.5 regarding the adoption of measures to 
explicitly prohibit, prevent and punish discrimination on any grounds, including on the 
basis of HIV/AIDS status. In November 2009, a working group had been set up to elaborate 
amendments to the Law on the Prevention of HIV/AIDS, and the draft amendments 
included anti-discrimination clauses. 
</p>
<p>411. Mongolia accepted recommendations 86.6 and 86.7 relating to the role of the 
National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia in the adoption and implementation of 
the gender equality law and the participation of women in decision-making. The Parliament 
had already adopted the Law on Gender Equality, which specified the role of the 
Commission in its implementation. As noted by the delegation, the Law also provided 
ample opportunities for women to be included in upper and/or high-level decision-making 
processes. 
</p>
<p>412. Mongolia also accepted recommendations 86.8 and 86.9. In this respect, a working 
group had been established to elaborate amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal 
Procedure Code to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, 
as well as hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>413. The delegation reported that the declassification of death penalty sentences imposed 
in the past and the removal of classification of information on death penalty were planned 
to be implemented after the approval of the bill and other measures on the abolition of the 
death penalty. Furthermore, in its spring session, Parliament scheduled to debate 
Mongolia&#8217;s accession to the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. With this in mind, 
Mongolia accepted recommendations 86.10 and 86.11. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>414. Algeria welcomed the progress made by Mongolia in the area of human rights, 
which was illustrated by the establishment of various mechanisms for human rights 
protection, the ratification of major international instruments and the establishment of a 
moratorium on the death penalty. Algeria also expressed its appreciation for the acceptance 
by Mongolia of 126 recommendations, including 3 recommendations made by Algeria. 
Algeria was encouraged by Mongolia&#8217;s determination to continue its efforts to promote and 
protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>415. Thailand noted Mongolia&#8217;s determination to overcome socio-economic and 
development challenges while striking a balance between economic growth and human 
rights. Thailand expressed its readiness to promote South-South cooperation, particularly in 
the area of sustainable agricultural production and income-generating activities. Thailand 
welcomed the acceptance by Mongolia of recommendations addressing vulnerable groups, 
such as women, children and persons with disabilities. Thailand expressed its support for 
Mongolia&#8217;s efforts to combat human trafficking and expressed its readiness to share its 
experiences and identify concrete areas of mutual cooperation. 
</p>
<p>416. Morocco took note of the progress made by Mongolia in the area of human rights. 
By accepting 126 of 129 recommendations made during the review, Mongolia reaffirmed 
its commitment to human rights and to the universal periodic review. This also reinforced 
the dialogue and cooperative approach demonstrated by Mongolia during the review 
process. Morocco remained conscious of the difficulties and challenges that Mongolia 
might face in implementing these recommendations. In this regard, Morocco called on the 
international community to support Mongolia in its endeavours. </p>


<p><b>162</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>417. The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia stated that the 
recommendations made during the interactive dialogue of the Working Group covered 
important aspects and challenges of Mongolia and supported the fact that the Government 
had accepted 126 of 129 recommendations. It assured that, even though the issue of the 
ratification of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families depended on decision of Parliament and thus, the Government could not take a 
final and firm position at this stage, the Commission would make special efforts to ensure 
Mongolia&#8217;s accession to these treaties by carrying out an awareness-raising campaign and 
advocacy to explain the importance of those treaties for Mongolians. The Commission 
expressed the view that individual cases of human rights violations should be addressed to 
national courts instead of the Constitutional Court. Efforts should thus be made to ensure 
that the national courts issue fair decisions regarding such individual cases. 
</p>
<p>418. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development regretted that Mongolia had 
not provided a written response to the 11 pending recommendations. It underlined the fact 
that issues relating to land, water and environmental rights had not received due attention, 
and expressed its disappointment that Mongolia had not accepted the recommendation 
requesting to mandate the Constitutional Court to act upon violations of individual rights, 
particularly for the land and environmental rights of indigenous and herder communities. 
The Forum mentioned that 50 per cent of the population lived in the capital and were at 
high risk owing to a uranium exploration project, while nomadic herders made up 25 per 
cent of the population and were being pushed off their lands because of mining projects. 
The Forum also underlined the contradiction between water scarcity and the desertification 
challenge, on one hand, and the approval of mining projects in the Gobi Desert, on the 
other. 
</p>
<p>419. The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development referred to reported 
frauds and vote buying during the 2008 parliamentary elections. Several candidates and 
supporters of opposition parties struggling against the ballot-counting fraud had been 
arrested and criminal charges were laid against them. It urged the Government and political 
parties to shore up their political will to reform the Law on Elections on the basis of human 
rights and democratic principles, norms and values to ensure free and fair elections. It 
stated that the courts and Prosecutor&#8217;s office must reconsider all illegal processes to ensure 
people&#8217;s right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>420. Amnesty International welcomed Mongolia&#8217;s support for the recommendations to 
ratify the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and urged the early implementation of these recommendations. It had raised 
expectations that the death penalty would be abolished in national legislation. Amnesty 
International also called on Mongolia to ensure the effective implementation of 
recommendations to bring the definition of torture in national legislation into line with 
international standards. While welcoming Mongolia&#8217;s support for the recommendation to 
ensure access to health care, adequate housing, education and safe drinking water and 
sanitation for all, especially people living in <i>ger</i> districts, Amnesty International was 
concerned about the lack of adequate housing, infrastructure, sanitation and drainage 
therein. 
</p>
<p>421. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC 
Nederland NGO encouraged Mongolia to include discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and gender identity, as well as health conditions and disability, in its 
Constitution to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and other 
minorities, such as people with disabilities and people living with HIV/AIDS, enjoyed 
equal rights and freedoms. It commended Mongolia for accepting the recommendations to </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>163 
</b></p>
<p>enact broad anti-discrimination legislation that explicitly prohibits discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity, and stated that the Government should include civil 
society organizations in the implementation of these recommendations. It encouraged 
Mongolia to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in 
its broader human rights and awareness-raising activities; to apply the Yogyakarta 
Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to sexual 
orientation and gender identity; and to report regularly on progress made in the 
implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>422. The delegation stated that the Government would pay special attention to several 
key areas in order to guarantee civil participation in decision-making processes and the 
right to vote and further develop the relevant legal framework; ensure the right to a healthy 
and safe environment by developing laws in this field, including the mining sector; provide 
access and relevant infrastructure to facilitate the participation of persons with disabilities 
in public life; address violations of the rights of minorities; and develop legislation to 
provide effective redress for those violations. 
</p>
<p>423. In conclusion, the delegation stated that Mongolia, by being fully aware of the 
magnitude of the efforts required to implement the accepted recommendations in the 
upcoming years, would seek technical assistance from relevant international and non-
governmental organizations, as well as bilateral assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Panama 
</b></p>
<p>424. The review of Panama was held on 16 March 2011 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Panama in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/PAN/1/Rev.1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/PAN/1/Rev.1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/PAN/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/PAN/3). 
</p><p>425. At its 32nd meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Panama (see section C below). 
426. The outcome of the review of Panama comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/6), the views of Panama concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/16/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>427. The Minister for Government of Panama, Roxana Mendez, recalled that the 
promotion, protection and respect for human rights was a priority for her Government and 
was a matter of public policy. </p>


<p><b>164</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>428. The addendum presented by Panama comprised answers, observations and 
comments on the recommendations received, as well as its position on pending 
recommendations. The addendum also contained a section on the implementation of 
universal periodic review voluntary pledges and commitments. 
</p>
<p>429. Regarding ratifications, on 22 February 2011, the National Assembly adopted four 
instruments: the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; the Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons; and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>430. Accession to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was still under study. The 
Government had held meetings with the OHCHR regional office and sought the opinion of 
experts on the extent of the obligations of these two instruments in order to make an 
informed decision. 
</p>
<p>431. The Government had also established a task force on ILO Convention No. 169, 
which had concluded its work and favoured its ratification. 
</p>
<p>432. Panama was already implementing the recommendation requesting the alignment of 
national laws and policies with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. The delegation gave examples of national legislation and 
policies protecting the rights of women, including the campaign &#8220;Maltrato Cero&#8221;, Law No. 
4 of 1999 prohibiting gender discrimination, and the bill against femicide. As a result, 
women&#8217;s participation in the labour market had considerably increased, although it 
remained a challenge.  
</p>
<p>433. On the issue of discrimination, the Government was considering the possibility of 
amending Law No. 16 of 2002 to enhance and strengthen the competencies of the national 
commission against discrimination. Measures of protection for Afro-Panamanians were 
also under study, including a plan of action. Panama had also accepted the recommendation 
on the Yogyakarta Principles, as long as they did not infringe on the Constitution or the 
human rights international obligations of Panama.  
</p>
<p>434. The delegation recalled that, in relation to the Bocas del Toro incidents of July 2010, 
the Government had established a dialogue process on Law No. 30/2010, with the 
participation of the main social stakeholders, governmental agencies and representatives of 
the National Assembly. The process had concluded with six new laws on the environment, 
public procurement, the Penal Code, the Labour Code, the national police and commercial 
aviation. In addition, the Government had set up a special commission of inquiry on the 
incidents, which concluded its work and had presented a report to the President of Panama. 
Furthermore, the Government had created an office of permanent dialogue that had taken a 
series of measures to assist the victims or persons affected by the incidents. 
</p>
<p>435. The Supreme Court had granted constitutional status to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. The delegation also presented several programmes aimed at combating 
child labour and its causes, and school dropouts, including the programme &#8220;Red de 
Oportunidades&#8221;, from which 63,245 families in extreme poverty benefited. Regarding the 
legal responsibility of children, those aged between 12 and 14 years would not be sent to 
jail and would be put in the charge of the national secretariat for children, adolescents and 
family. The delegation recalled that corporal punishment was banned by the Penal Code. 
However, since Panama did not have a specific law on this matter, it was considering 
enacting one. On the basis of observations made by treaty bodies, Panama had embarked 
upon an ample process of consultation to draft a bill that would raise the minimum age of 
marriage for women and men. </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>165 
</b></p>
<p>436. With reference to the death of five minors held in the Tocumen reclusion centre, the 
President of Panama had stated that this was a criminal act contrary to the Government&#8217;s 
penitentiary policy. The Attorney General had charged nine police officers and three 
civilians. Panama had also taken measures to restructure the penitentiary system as a whole. 
The judiciary had begun the implementation of a programme to address the case load. As a 
result, 17,399 cases had been solved, while 85,034 cases were still pending. Moreover, in 
2011, the new procedural system would progressively come into force. 
</p>
<p>437. Panama had adopted legislation recognizing the right to land of indigenous peoples 
and the conducting of consultations. The Government was also trying to build a positive 
environment to promote dialogue with indigenous communities on the code of mineral 
resources and the development of mining activities in Panama. 
</p>
<p>438. With regard to issues relating to migrants and refugees, Panama was committed to 
guarantee the security and effective protection to all persons entering its territory looking 
for protection or asylum, particularly the protection against refoulement on borders, and no 
penalties for illegal or irregular entry. 
</p>
<p>439. Panama could not accept a recommendation on the right to peaceful assembly. On 
the other hand, Panama recognized freedom of association for civil society, and unions in 
particular. The Government was studying the possibility of amending the Labour Code, in 
consultation with employers and unions, in order to reduce the minimum number of 
workers required to establish a union. 
</p>
<p>440. In conclusion, the delegation announced that the Government, with the support of 
the OHCHR regional office, was drafting an executive decree to establish a permanent 
inter-agency commission to follow up the implementation of the international obligations 
and commitments of Panama in the area of human rights. Furthermore, the Government had 
already adopted a decision to extend an open invitation to the special procedures, an 
invitation that was to be sent in the near future. 
</p>
<p>441. The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>442. Algeria noted with appreciation Panama&#8217;s views on recommendations, its voluntary 
pledges and replies, its commitment to the universal periodic review and the broad 
involvement of civil society in the preparatory process. It commended Panama for its vision 
of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, and for its promotion 
and protection of human rights on an equal and non-discriminatory basis. It noted that 
Algeria had made five recommendations, which enjoyed Panama&#8217;s support, or were 
regarded as having been implemented or in the process of implementation. It encouraged 
Panama to pay due attention to its voluntary pledges and commitments, particularly those 
regarding international law and the outcome of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>443. The United States of America welcomed Panama&#8217;s support for many 
recommendations and its agreement to take measures to improve prison conditions in 
accordance with international human rights law. It sought information about the bill on 
prison overcrowding. It commended Panama&#8217;s support for recommendations to undertake a 
consultative process with labour and civil society leaders to review legislation to ensure the 
protection of the human rights of workers, including freedom of assembly. It also 
commended the implementation of recommendations to effectively investigate the 
excessive use of force during the July 2010 national strike in Changuinola, and enquired 
about concrete steps in this regard. It commended Panama&#8217;s intention to strengthen respect 
for women&#8217;s rights, including adequate funding for the Women&#8217;s National Institute and </p>


<p><b>166</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>other offices promoting equal opportunities, and focusing on combating gender 
discrimination and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>444. Uruguay welcomed Panama&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations and the 
information on the process of recent ratification of some international human rights 
instruments. It also welcomed the strengthened cooperation with the OHCHR regional 
office. Uruguay encouraged Panama to finalize the standing invitation for special 
procedures, which would enable closer cooperation and technical assistance. Concerning 
education, it welcomed the information on improving infrastructure and projects to ensure 
the enrolment of all children in schools, and the tours, conducted mostly in indigenous 
areas, to identify children working in prohibited activities, such as agriculture. It 
commended Panama for home visits by social workers guiding parents and allocating 
scholarships, thus withdrawing over 100 children from the labour market and reintegrating 
them into the educational system. It appreciated the information on progress made in 
combating discrimination and on women&#8217;s rights, and encouraged Panama to continue in 
the same direction. 
</p>
<p>445. Morocco applauded Panama for the openness demonstrated throughout the universal 
periodic review, illustrated by the frank and constructive debate in the Working Group 
discussions. It noted with appreciation the important number of recommendations accepted, 
reflecting Panama&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. It 
particularly noted Panama&#8217;s acceptance of the three recommendations made by Morocco, 
on human rights training for security forces and prison and judicial personnel, the 
promotion of rights of migrants and refugees, and the comparison of Panama&#8217;s experience 
with that of other States Members of the United Nations. It noted with interest Panama&#8217;s 
efforts to improve the human rights situation and to realize economic, social and cultural 
rights despite difficulties faced, particularly poverty and crime. Morocco called on the 
international community to assist Panama in its efforts. 
</p>
<p>446. Brazil welcomed Panama&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations made and its 
openness to take the measures necessary to ensure the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Brazil confirmed its readiness to share its perspective and experience regarding the 
protection and promotion of human rights. It noted with interest Panama&#8217;s decision to 
establish an inter-institutional committee to continue to monitor the implementation of 
accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>447. Guatemala recognized Panama&#8217;s efforts in the promotion and protection of human 
rights, and noted the progress made in the implementation of many recommendations, 
underlining Panama&#8217;s acceptance of most of them. Guatemala also noted the progress made 
in the ratification of human rights instruments and the extension of a standing invitation to 
special procedures. It appreciated the information provided on migrant workers and 
migrants in general, and expressed hope that progress in this area of concern would 
continue. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>448. The International Voluntarism Organization for Women, Education and 
Development expressed its concern at the situation of indigenous peoples and those in 
marginalized areas, especially in Darien. It noted that, despite Panama&#8217;s abundant water 
resources, most areas far from cities suffered from a partial or total lack of safe drinking 
water, and insufficient aqueducts. It recommended that Panama guarantee the right to water 
for all its citizens and invite the independent expert on the human right to safe water and 
sanitation to visit the country. Despite the adoption of law No. 34 in 1995, it noted that the 
current education system neither provides bilingual education nor recognizes the value of 
indigenous culture. It recommended that Panama implement legislation to guarantee </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>teachers adequate remuneration to allow them to perform their duties in remote areas and to 
provide adequate training on the value of indigenous cultures. 
</p>
<p>449. Amnesty International welcomed Panama&#8217;s support for recommendations on 
ensuring an independent investigation into the events of 2010 in Bocas del Toro and its 
intention to prosecute those responsible for violations during national strikes. It expressed 
concern that security forces appeared to have used excessive force resulting in deaths and 
injuries. It noted that the special commission set up by the Government had recommended 
bringing those responsible to justice and incorporating the Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials into national guidelines. It noted 
Panama&#8217;s support for the recommendation that it ensure that the press is not targeted and 
guarantee freedom of expression. It raised concern about the case of two Spanish journalists 
who were arrested in February 2011, later deported and prohibited re-entry. It urged 
Panama to reconsider their expulsion and to guarantee all journalists the right to carry out 
their work without fear of reprisal. 
</p>
<p>450. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme congratulated Panama&#8217;s 
efforts to adhere to a number of international and regional human rights instruments and 
welcomed the signature of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. It 
welcomed Panama&#8217;s will to integrate women into the country&#8217;s sustainable development 
through a policy of equal opportunities. It encouraged Panama to adopt a better policy and 
strategy for the promotion and protection of indigenous rights. It called for full 
investigation of the events in Bocas del Toro in July 2010. It noted the recent reform of the 
Mining Code aimed at attracting new investors, and hoped that this change had not been to 
the detriment of indigenous peoples present in territories with large copper resources. It 
saluted the Government initiatives to improve detention conditions through investment in 
prison infrastructure and penal administration. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>451. The delegation of Panama thanked the participants for the constructive dialogue 
during its universal periodic review, and stated that the Government would spare no effort 
to follow up on recommendations and to improve the human rights situation in Panama for 
all, and that it was open to further cooperation with OHCHR in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Maldives 
</b></p>
<p>452. The review of Maldives was held on 3 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Maldives in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/ MDV/1/Rev.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/2 and A/HRC/WG.6/MDV/2/Corr.1); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/3).  
</p><p>453. At its 32nd meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Maldives (see section C below). 
454. The outcome of the review of Maldives comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/7), the views of Maldives concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not </p>


<p><b>168</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/16/7/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>455. Maldives considered the universal periodic review process to be a unique and useful 
exercise from the outset of the preparation of its national report in consultation with non-
governmental organizations and the National Human Rights Commission. The delegation 
emphasized the particular usefulness of holding an enlightening and constructive dialogue 
with States Members of the United Nations. Maldives used this dialogue to assess the 126 
recommendations received and returned to the Human Rights Council to offer its responses 
to the recommendations and to outline how it intended to implement them. The delegation 
saw this process as a different way to think and act in the sphere of human rights. 
</p>
<p>456. The approach of Maldives to the universal periodic review process had been 
premised on the same principles with which it approached all interaction with the Human 
Rights Council. It strove to be transparent and willing to listen. This approach was evident 
in the national report and the interactive dialogue.  
</p>
<p>457. The delegation gave detailed feedback on the 126 recommendations made since it 
had kept all recommendations pending. This decision stemmed from the seriousness with 
which Maldives approached the universal periodic review process and the desire to give full 
and proper consideration to all recommendations.  
</p>
<p>458. The delegation stated that, since that time, the Maldives universal periodic review 
standing committee, comprising Government departments, the Human Rights Commission 
and civil society, had met to review the recommendations. Important and sensitive 
recommendations had been the subject of a cabinet debate. This demonstrated the 
importance that the Government attached to the universal periodic review process and to 
the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>459. Maldives had submitted in writing its detailed response to all recommendations, in 
the interest of openness and transparency.  
</p>
<p>460. Maldives had been able to accept, fully or partially, 100 of the 126 
recommendations. These recommendations covered a wide range of important issues and, 
when implemented, would make a significant positive contribution to human rights in 
Maldives.  
</p>
<p>461. The delegation highlighted the position of the State with regard to its international 
human rights commitments, infrastructure and legislation by accepting to ratify the two 
remaining conventions to which it was not yet party, namely the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. Maldives also agreed to look into replacing the reservation to article 21 of the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child with an explanatory declaration, and to significantly 
reduce the scope of their reservation to article 16 of the Convention of the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>462. The nascent institutions of Maldives needed to be strengthened and to accept all 
recommendations regarding, for example, enhancing the independence, competence and 
professionalism of its national human rights commission.  
</p>
<p>463. On the legislative level, Maldives had accepted all the recommendations calling on 
the country to draft, table or adopt legislation designed to improve human rights protection, 
and pledged to implement the recommendations calling for the expeditious adoption of the 
new Penal Code, as well as specific laws dealing with equality and non-discrimination. It </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>169 
</b></p>
<p>assured the Council that it was a strong advocate of equality for all in society, including 
such vulnerable groups as women, children and the disabled, and had already moved to 
adopt strong laws in areas such as domestic violence and the rights of persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>464. Maldives had also accepted all recommendations aimed at strengthening the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in the country, including in the areas of 
health, education, employment, trafficking, drug rehabilitation and juvenile delinquency.  
</p><p>465. Maldives did not accept some recommendations at the present time because, in 
many cases, it was committed to take small steps with a view to being able to consider them 
favourably during future universal periodic review cycles. The delegation clarified its 
position on the use of different terms in its official written response. Where it was stated 
&#8220;partially accept this recommendation&#8221;, the recommendation was taken as accepted but 
subject to the explanation given; where it stated &#8220;takes note of this recommendation&#8221;, 
Maldives was sympathetic in principle but could not accept the recommendation at the 
present time.  
</p>
<p>466. With regard to the recommendation on capital punishment (100.6), which was 
rejected, Maldives was committed to maintain a moratorium on the death penalty as its 
recent vote in the General Assembly demonstrated. 
</p>
<p>467. The delegation reminded the Council that there had not been an execution in the 
country for half a century and that Maldives had voted in favour of the moratoriums on the 
death penalty at the General Assembly in 2011. However, at the present time, it was not 
able to accept the recommendation to either abolish the death penalty or to ratify the second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>468. With regard to the recommendation on corporal punishment, in particular public 
flogging, the Government intended to consult with relevant national and international 
authorities to assess whether the application of corporal punishment, as currently practised 
in Maldives, was compatible with its international obligations under the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It would also 
consult on whether the newly independent judiciary in the country had the capacity to pass 
down such punishments in a manner fully consistent with the Constitution and international 
human rights law, in particular those provisions dealing with non-discrimination on the 
basis of gender.  
</p>
<p>469. With regard to freedom of religion, Maldives had been a fully Muslim country since 
its conversion to Islam. In the national consciousness, being a Maldivian and a Muslim 
could not be separated. The central role of Islam in the national identity made it extremely 
difficult to introduce principles of freedom of conscience into the country. Notwithstanding, 
Maldives fully understood the importance of tolerance and understanding in all walks of 
life, including in religion. In this regard, it had decided, as a first step, to accept 
recommendation 100.91 suggesting steps to encourage and facilitate domestic awareness-
raising and open public debate on religious issues. Bearing in mind that perceptions of 
human rights and religion in Maldives were heavily influenced by relevant international 
debates and norms, Maldives had decided to host, in 2012, a major international conference 
on modern sharia jurisprudence and human rights. In this regard, the delegation requested 
support from the international community. 
</p>
<p>470. For the third major category of recommendations on lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender rights, the delegation was not able to accept them. National law did not 
discriminate against people on the basis of their sexual orientation, and in practice lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender persons enjoyed the same rights as other members of society. 
However, at the same time, there were no laws in Maldives that explicitly promoted and 
protected the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>471. Algeria was following closely the transition of Maldives towards democracy. 
Algeria welcomed its cooperation with human rights treaty bodies and its efforts to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals and to improve social indicators, including in the area 
of public health. It also expressed appreciation for the efforts made to mitigate the 
consequences of its vulnerability to certain environmental factors.  
</p>
<p>472. Sri Lanka commended the withdrawal by Maldives of its reservation to article 7 of 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
active review of the reservations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sri Lanka congratulated Maldives on 
becoming a member of ILO. It noted the process of Maldives becoming a party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. It also noted the progress made in combating narcotics and 
trafficking in persons, but stressed that further action was needed. It welcomed the leading 
role of Maldives regarding the resolutions on human rights and climate change, which 
highlighted the human rights implications of anthropogenic climate change.  
</p>
<p>473. Saudi Arabia noted the commitment of Maldives to human rights, as demonstrated 
in its cooperation with all United Nations human rights mechanisms and its eagerness to 
continue this international cooperation and the frank human rights dialogue. It noted that 
Maldives was party to most international human rights instruments and commended it for 
receiving and facilitating a number of visits by special procedures mandate holders. Saudi 
Arabia appreciated the spirit of cooperation demonstrated by the delegation of Maldives, as 
well as the efforts made by the Government in the area of human rights, especially in 
legislative and institutional areas. 
</p>
<p>474. Cuba noted the efforts of Maldives to implement the recommendations made during 
the review. It welcomed the State&#8217;s approach to the recommendations made by Cuba, 
namely the implementation of strategies and plans related to social and economic 
developments, and the measures taken to guarantee the rights to education and to health. 
Cuba welcomed the steps taken in the area of health, improving the indicators relating to 
life expectancy, infant mortality and the eradication of malaria and polio. Cuba highlighted 
the achievements made in the area of education through guaranteeing free primary and 
secondary education, which had improved the situation of women, the elderly, children and 
persons with disabilities. Cuba stressed that the international community should provide 
Maldives with support in relation to the implementation of its policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>475. Botswana was encouraged by the determination of Maldives to meet its obligations 
to promote and protect human rights, which was evident from its openness and constructive 
engagement, including the decision of the Government to accept many of the universal 
periodic review recommendations. It commended Maldives for its continued leadership in 
climate change issues, as demonstrated as a Member of the Human Rights Council and 
even before.  
</p>
<p>476. Morocco congratulated Maldives on its successful review and noted that it had been 
an occasion to take account of the progress made in the area of human rights, in spite of 
poverty and climate change-related challenges. Morocco welcomed the fact that Maldives 
had accepted its recommendations concerning the promotion of equality between men and 
women in all areas, and combating violence against women. Morocco encouraged the 
continuation of efforts to ensure the transition to democracy and the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Morocco encouraged the international community to 
support Maldives in its development efforts. </p>

<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>477. Forum Asia and the Maldivian Democracy Network appreciated the efforts made in 
convening the universal periodic review standing committee for the inclusive debate with 
all stakeholders, and urged that the committee be maintained for universal periodic review 
follow-up activities with measurable implementation plans. They called on the Government 
to formulate a comprehensive policy to protect the rights of migrant workers and victims of 
trafficking by allowing registration of undocumented migrants, and to establish a bureau to 
ensure access to justice. They urged the Government to accede to the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. Forum Asia and the Maldivian Democracy Network reiterated the 
recommendations to strengthen the capacity and independence of the judiciary and to 
improve the human rights education of the judiciary and the public, and encouraged the 
country to seek the technical assistance of OHCHR in this area. They called on Maldives to 
counter negative stereotypes of women and acknowledged the major challenges of 
discrimination, hate speech and corruption, which the Government must confront.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>478. The delegation concluded by thanking the Working Group and the Human Rights 
Council for the constructive dialogue, and described the next steps in the implementation of 
accepted recommendations and other agreed steps.  
</p>
<p>479. At the time of its review in the Working Group, Maldives established a universal 
periodic review standing committee composed of relevant Government departments, local 
non-governmental organizations and the National Human Rights Commission. The 
committee was constituted to prepare the report, to consider the recommendations and to 
have responsibility for implementing them in time for the second cycle of the universal 
periodic review in four years&#8217; time. Maldives would submit a mid-term review on the 
progress made in implementation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Andorra 
</b></p>
<p>480. The review of Andorra was held on 3 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Andorra in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/AND/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/AND/1/Corr.1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/AND/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/AND/3). 
</p><p>481. At its 32nd meeting, on 16 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Andorra (see section C below). 
482. The outcome of the review of Andorra comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/8), the views of Andorra concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/16/8/Add.1). </p>


<p><b>172</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>483. Andorra expressed its satisfaction with the interactive dialogue held during the ninth 
session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. It recalled its adoption of 
30 international human rights conventions since 1993, when it joined the United Nations. It 
thanked the 22 delegations that had intervened during the interactive dialogue for their 
interest. Commenting on the universal periodic review as a new peer-review process, 
Andorra noted that Member States possessed unequal economic and human resources and 
faced different challenges. Some States, like Andorra, had never been entangled in a global 
conflict nor had they been victims of a dictatorship or a revolution. Therefore Andorra 
believed that it would be more effective and useful to take into account each State&#8217;s 
cultural, geographic and historical distinctive features when they came before the Human 
Rights Council for their universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>484. Andorra supported the idea of international solidarity, in particular for the 
ratification of human rights conventions. However, it was not easy for Andorra to adhere to 
new conventions owing to its limited human and financial resources. 
</p>
<p>485. Andorra had accepted 24 of 56 recommendations made during Working Group 
discussions, and this was testimony to the progress that it had made in the area of human 
rights. The corporal punishment of minors was punished by criminal laws, gender equality 
policies had been set up and it had become party to other international conventions. 
</p>
<p>486. In parallel, the Government had considered 30 recommendations and decided not to 
accept two of them owing to the complexity in their implementation.  
</p>
<p>487. Andorra had accepted to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its Optional Protocol (parts of recommendations 84.4, 84.7 and 84.10), the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the 
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation 
and Sexual Abuse (recommendations 84.15 and 84.16).  
</p><p>488. Other accepted recommendations related to the review of existing legislation, 
including the Marriage Law, to achieve compliance with the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (recommendations 84.17 and 84.27); the 
submission and presentation of pending reports to treaty bodies (recommendation 84.24); 
the effective protection of the rights of foreigners residing in the country and the active 
promotion of anti-discrimination policies, including in law enforcement practices 
(recommendation 84.25); the regulation and guarantee of the rights of workers in 
accordance with the standards of the European Social Charter, through dialogue with social 
agents and social stakeholders, and by seeking maximum parliamentary consensus 
(recommendation 84.28); and the establishment of a system of data collection to allow the 
compilation of an inventory of the problems faced by immigrants in areas such as 
employment and access to public office, to enable measures to solve these problems and to 
better evaluate their situation and consolidate efforts to ensure that their rights are respected 
(recommendations 84.29 and 84.30). 
489. Andorra acknowledged the importance of adopting the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol (parts of recommendations 
84.1, 84.2, 84.4, 84.5, 84.6, 84.7, 84.9 and 84.10), but stressed the difficulties it faced to 
date to make a firm commitment to their ratification.  
</p>
<p>490. With regard to the amendment to legislation to decriminalize abortion under certain 
circumstances, such as pregnancies as a result of rape (recommendation 84.18), Andorra 
would consider the possibility of amending the Penal Code to decriminalize this medical act 
when carried out in Andorra. Finally, with regard to joining the International Labour </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>Organization and ratifying its core conventions (recommendation 84.14), Andorra could not 
commit to such an accession at this time but would consider it carefully.  
</p>
<p>491. Andorra referred to the addendum to the report of the Working Group 
(A/HRC/16/8/Add.1), where it had explained the reasons for its decision not to accept the 
remaining pending recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>492. Algeria thanked Andorra for its response to the recommendations made during 
Working Group discussions. Algeria greatly appreciated the acceptance of two of its 
recommendations, namely on strengthening cooperation between the Group on 
Interreligious Dialogue and the National Commission of Andorra in UNESCO, and on the 
presentation of due periodic reports to the international human rights instruments. Algeria 
was also pleased by the fact that Andorra had accepted the recommendation relating to the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It invited Andorra 
to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and to consider the possibility of creating a 
national human rights institution. Algeria expressed its satisfaction with the progress 
achieved by Andorra in combating all forms of discrimination, in promoting children&#8217;s 
rights and ensuring access to health care and education. As a result of these efforts, Andorra 
was among the top 30 countries ranked on the human development index. Algeria 
encouraged Andorra to continue on this path. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>493. Andorra expressed its gratitude for having participated in this key exercise to the 
protection of human rights. It hoped that the universal periodic review, as a unique tool, 
would continue to contribute to the improvement of the human rights situation in all 
countries. It thanked the secretariat and the troika for their excellent work and outstanding 
cooperation. It also thanked all the delegations who, through their recommendations, had 
expressed their interest in the human rights situation in Andorra. It reiterated the State&#8217;s full 
commitment to protect human rights and to continue down the path it had taken 18 years 
ago to ensure the well-being of its citizens by respecting their rights and liberties.  
</p>
<p><b>  Bulgaria  
</b></p>
<p>494. The review of Bulgaria was held on 4 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: <b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Bulgaria in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/1/Corr.1 and 2);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/2 and A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/2/Corr.1 and 2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/BGR/3). 
</p><p>495. At its 33rd meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Bulgaria (see section C below). 
496. The outcome of the review of Bulgaria comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/9), the views of Bulgaria concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented </p>


<p><b>174</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(A/HRC/16/9/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>497. Bulgaria stated that the universal periodic review process had allowed it to take 
stock of its human rights situation, to draw attention to what had already been accomplished 
and to exchange views on what remained to be done, including the enhancement of national 
capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights to the benefit of all persons 
residing in the country.  
</p>
<p>498. The delegation highlighted the State&#8217;s intention to accept as many recommendations 
as possible. Bulgaria accepted without any reservations the overwhelming majority of the 
recommendations made (102 out of 113). Another four recommendations of which Bulgaria 
took note were also accepted in principle, as their implementation might require legal 
adjustments, allocating adequate budgetary resources or strengthening or improving 
administrative capacity. The delegation provided assurances that those recommendations 
would remain on Bulgaria&#8217;s agenda in the follow-up period.  
</p>
<p>499. Regarding recommendation 31, Bulgaria recalled that it had already extended a 
standing invitation to all special procedures, so it accepted this recommendation.  
</p>
<p>500. The delegation explained that 40 of the accepted recommendations had already been 
implemented or were under implementation. For example, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment had already been submitted to the National Assembly for ratification. Equally, 
the institution of the ombudsman, created in 2005 in accordance with the Paris Principles 
and with the assistance of the International Coordinating Committee, intended to submit the 
necessary application for accreditation in compliance with the Statute of the International 
Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p>501. Regarding the recommendations relating to the deinstitutionalization of children 
(recommendations 15, 20, 27, 77 and others), Bulgaria reiterated the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to close all remaining specialized institutions for children over the next 15 
years and to replace them with community-based supportive centres.  
</p>
<p>502. The delegation briefly addressed the recommendations regarding the situation of 
Roma in Bulgaria (recommendations 18, 29, 86, 93, 95 and others). The Government had 
the political will to take adequate steps aimed at improving the situation of the Roma. The 
delegation emphasized that satisfactory results could only be achieved through a shared 
effort and proportional responsibilities among the Government, the Roma and their leaders, 
and the non-governmental organizations involved in Roma integration. 
</p>
<p>503. Of 113 recommendations made to Bulgaria, only five of them had not been accepted 
(recommendations 2, 24, 59, 81 and 107), mainly owing to constitutional and other legal 
constraints, some of them concerning the independence of the judiciary (see 
recommendations 81 and 107). 
504. Two recommendations (64 and 108) had been partially accepted. The delegation 
stated that the first part of recommendation 64 was not in accordance with its domestic 
constitutional framework.<b> </b>Bulgaria considered that the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities were duly guaranteed by the Constitution and other legislation in accordance 
with article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe.  </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>505. According to the delegation, the second part of recommendation 108 was, 
regretfully, irrelevant. The delegation explained that Bulgaria, as a State party to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, fully implemented all of its 
provisions, including those of its article 27. Likewise, Bulgaria abided by the provisions of 
the European Convention on Human Rights and strictly implemented the decisions of the 
European Court of Human Rights vis-&#224;-vis Bulgaria.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>506. Algeria appreciated Bulgaria&#8217;s acceptance of an important number of 
recommendations, including two made by Algeria, on the establishment of a national 
human rights institution and on the fight against all forms of religious hatred, 
discrimination, racism, extremism and xenophobia. Algeria noted the explanation for the 
rejection of the recommendation on the ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Algeria 
would have like to see this recommendation accepted in the spirit of recommendation No. 
1737 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Algeria hoped that Bulgaria 
would accept recommendation 4 calling for effective measures to improve the health-care 
sector and the right to health.  
</p>
<p>507. Morocco noted with satisfaction Bulgaria&#8217;s indication of the existence of an 
independent national human rights institution in conformity with the Paris Principles and its 
intention to apply for accreditation in 2011. Morocco welcomed Bulgaria&#8217;s reform of its 
judicial system through its judicial strategy, and indicated that the activities undertaken in a 
targeted and coordinated manner among all stakeholders favoured the adoption of the 
strategy as a best practice to be followed. It also appreciated the various actions taken in 
favour of vulnerable groups, in particular children and persons with disabilities, including 
in the spheres of education, employment and health. Morocco thanked Bulgaria for having 
accepted its recommendations concerning the systematic inclusion of human rights 
education and training in the education system and in vocational training, as well as on the 
integration of the Roma in Bulgarian society.  
</p>
<p>508. Turkey thanked Bulgaria for its responses to the recommendations made. It 
commended the achievements made by Bulgaria in various fields and welcomed the 
development of their bilateral relations. Turkey expressed the view that the Turkish 
minority in Bulgaria was a bridge of friendship, and recalled that Turkey had made 
recommendations during the universal periodic review with a view to strengthening that 
bridge further. Turkey trusted that its messages of friendship were heard by Bulgaria, and 
wished to continue to enhance their cooperation in every possible field. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>509. COC Netherlands and ILGA-Europe commended Bulgaria for all positive steps that 
it had taken in the past for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
persons, but reiterated the need to implement various universal periodic review 
recommendations for them. It highlighted the importance of the development and 
implementation of effective hate crime legislation, and encouraged Bulgaria to include civil 
society in the development of education and training programmes to overcome 
discriminatory patterns against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and ethnic 
minorities. It suggested that Bulgaria further develop work in this area by applying the 
Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as a guide to assist in policymaking.  
</p>
<p>510. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme took note of the National 
Strategy for Children 2008&#8211;2018 to improve the situation of those children living in </p>


<p><b>176</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>national and municipal institutions. Despite the measures taken, it remained concerned 
about discrimination against and ill-treatment of Roma, given the high levels of illiteracy 
and poverty affecting Roma children, and urged Bulgaria to guarantee to the Roma 
minority the full and effective enjoyment of their rights. It expressed concern about the 
continued sexual exploitation of women and children in Bulgaria in spite of the efforts 
made to combat human trafficking. It encouraged Bulgaria to ensure that detention 
conditions fully meet international standards, and to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>511. The Islamic Human Rights Commission stated that the Roma Muslims residing in 
Bulgaria had experienced prejudice and endured some of the worst forms of racism and 
Islamophobia. Roma families were routinely denied access to education, employment, 
health care and housing. Studies had shown that Roma Christians were in a better position 
than Roma Muslims, which resulted in many Roma Muslims converting out of their 
religion to seek a better lifestyle. Bulgaria had not made available any organized support to 
the Muslim Roma minority. The Commission urged Bulgaria to provide the Muslim Roma 
minority with the same standard of living as other citizens, thereby respecting their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>512. Bulgaria thanked all delegations and non-governmental organizations for their 
interest and active contribution to the universal periodic review of Bulgaria. 
</p>
<p>513. Bulgaria stated that its written response to the recommendations made during the 
Working Group discussions offered a reply to many of the questions raised.  
</p>
<p>514. Nevertheless, the delegation confirmed that the Bulgarian authorities would closely 
monitor any alleged manifestation of racism against and intolerance of any person in their 
jurisdiction and, if necessary, would take resolute steps to punish such acts. Relevant 
statistics on hate crimes were being gathered and analysed by the Ministry of the Interior, 
the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the commissions for protection against discrimination 
and for protection of the rights of the child. The delegation drew attention to the Penal Code 
amendments of 2009 relating to propaganda, with the addition of provisions on the 
incitement to ethnic hostility or hatred in speech, print or other mass media or through 
electronic information systems or other means. The Constitution of Bulgaria provided for 
the equal treatment of all national or foreign citizens residing in the territory of Bulgaria, 
regardless of their religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>515. Bulgaria assured participants that it would consider all recommendations made and 
of its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in Bulgaria, as well as 
its firm support for the universal periodic review process.

<p><b>  Honduras  
</b></p>
<p>516. The review of Honduras was held on 4 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: <b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Honduras in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/HND/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/HND/Corr.1);

<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HND/3). 
</p><p>517. At its 33rd meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Honduras (see section C below). 
518. The outcome of the review of Honduras comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/10), the views of Honduras concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>519. The importance of the universal periodic review to Honduras was demonstrated by 
the high-level delegation led by the Vice-President that attended the review in November 
</p><p>2010. Honduras recalled that the country had undergone a deep political crisis that had 
revealed the difficulties the country faced in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
One of the legacies of this crisis was the polarization of society, which was critical for the 
realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p>520. One of the main challenges for the authorities was to rebuild the confidence of 
society in State institutions. To this end, and under the leadership of the Secretary of Justice 
and Human Rights, a national dialogue with all civil society sectors was pursued with the 
objective of establishing a common and prioritized human rights agenda within the 
framework of the national plan of action for human rights. Honduras had sought the 
cooperation of civil society organizations when following up on universal periodic review 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>521. Of the 129 recommendations received during the review, Honduras had accepted 
117 and postponed 12 for further consideration. Honduras welcomed all remaining 
recommendations, except the one calling for the strengthening of the investigative capacity 
of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (recommendation 83.10) and the recommendation 
encouraging it to establish an institution specifically addressing the rights of the child (first 
part of recommendation 83.6). Honduras postponed these recommendations for budgetary 
reasons.  
</p>
<p>522. Honduras reported on the measures taken to comply with other pending 
recommendations; drafts laws had been submitted to Congress to amend the provisions of 
articles 117 and 321 to the Penal Code, incorporating as an aggravating circumstance of the 
crime of assassination and as an element of the crime of discrimination, respectively, the 
fact that the crimes had been committed on the basis of the sexual orientation or gender 
identity of the victim, the disability of victims and the fact that they pertained to an 
indigenous or Afro-descendant community. The processes for adhering to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the Convention on Protection of Children 
and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption had been launched. The Special 
Prosecutor for Indigenous and Afro-descendant Peoples had requested the demarcation and 
regularization of indigenous lands, investigated reports on the usurpation of their lands and 
initiated proceedings to determine responsibilities for the allegedly irregular concession of 
rivers in indigenous lands.  
</p>
<p>523. Honduras also reported that it would hold the first world summit of Afro-descendant 
peoples in August 2011, in the city of La Ceiba, and that a presidential decree had 
established 2011 as the International Year of Afro-descendants.  
</p>
<p>524. With respect to its voluntary pledges and commitments, Honduras pointed out that: </p>


<p><b>178</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p> (a) With the technical support of OHCHR, consultations with civil society had

</p>
<p> (b) Through the National Prevention Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture 
and with the support of civil society organizations, an amendment to the Penal Code had 
been prepared, in order to align the national definition of torture with that of the 
Convention against Torture; 
</p>
<p> (c) A draft law to prevent and suppress human trafficking had been prepared; 
 (d) The Office of the Public Prosecutor had designed a new information system 
to better collect disaggregated data about victims and perpetrators; 
</p>
<p> (e) A comprehensive policy on social cohesion and public security for the period 
2010&#8211;2022 had been adopted in the national plan; 
</p>
<p> (f) A protocol for the protection of victims had been established; appropriate 
protective measures would be adopted with the victim&#8217;s consent, and investigations about 
the source of threats would be conducted; 
</p>
<p> (g) The General Directorate of the Unit for the Protection of Human Rights 
Defenders had been placed under the supervision of the Secretary of Justice and Human 
Rights;  
</p>
<p> (h) The President of the Republic had requested the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations to implement a pilot project for strengthening the capacity of the Prosecutor 
Offices of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to investigate and prosecute organized 
crime and to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>525. Honduras acknowledged the special vulnerability to which children, women, 
members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, journalists, social 
communicators and human rights defenders were exposed, as well as the institutional 
weaknesses for investigating human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>526. The United States of America commended the establishment of the Secretariat of 
State for Justice and Human Rights and the Secretariat of State for Indigenous and Afro-
Honduran Affairs, and welcomed the agreement to ensure financial and other resources to 
the above-mentioned bodies and to the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights. 
It commended efforts to investigate the cases of murdered journalists and human rights 
defenders and to ensure protection for the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights. It 
applauded the agreement to institute human rights education programmes for police, 
diplomats and security forces, including sensitization for dealing with members of the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The United States of America was 
encouraged that Honduras would examine recommendations to adopt comprehensive anti-
discrimination legislation to protect vulnerable groups, and wished to know what concrete 
steps had been taken in this regard and what actions against perpetrators of abuses against 
these groups had been adopted. Likewise, it was interested in knowing what concrete steps 
Honduras was taking to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>527. Thailand noted with appreciation the national reconciliation plan and was pleased 
that Honduras had accepted all of its recommendations. Thailand welcomed Honduras&#8217; 
support for the recommendation to draw up laws against trafficking in persons and hoped 
that Honduras would continue to work to ensure that national policies relating to human 
trafficking were implemented. Thailand also welcomed the efforts made to address </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>179 
</b></p>
<p>domestic violence and violence against women, and encouraged Honduras to strengthen the 
protection system. Furthermore, it commended efforts to enhance gender equality. It 
welcomed the fact that Honduras was in the process of promoting human rights education 
and training, and encouraged Honduras to incorporate human rights education in school 
curricula. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>528. The World Organization against Torture welcomed the establishment of the 
Secretariat of State for Justice and Human Rights, the announcement regarding the creation 
of a special unit to investigate crimes against journalists and hate crimes against lesbians 
and gays, and the financial support for the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human 
Rights. Nevertheless, it regretted that attacks and threats against and harassment of human 
rights defenders continued, especially from military intelligence. It welcomed the draft laws 
to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. It regretted, however, the prevalence of high 
levels of impunity. 
</p>
<p>529. Istituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice was concerned about the poor quality of 
education in the country and recommended that Honduras take concrete actions to increase 
budget allocations and to provide subsidies to the poorest families. It was of the view that 
the measures taken to tackle violence against children, domestic abuse and trafficking had 
been insufficient, and encouraged the implementation of relevant laws and the prosecution 
of perpetrators. It also recommended that Honduras conduct awareness-raising campaigns 
to prevent and combat the economic exploitation of children. It encouraged Honduras to 
provide adequate housing, nutrition, health care and educational opportunities to the 
approximately 10,000 children living in street situations. 
</p>
<p>530. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit (COC 
Netherlands) regretted that crimes against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, transsexual, transvestite and intersex communities were systematic and on the 
increase, a situation that was worsened by the intolerance and hatred against members of 
that community. COC Netherlands called for the investigations of recent killings of 
members of the above-mentioned communities and for measures to ensure adequate, 
prompt and transparent investigations of killings, intimidations and other abuses against the 
said communities. 
</p>
<p>531. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues was concerned that 
Honduras had not taken sufficient actions to combat impunity and instead appointed to 
Government posts high-level military officers involved in the institutional crisis of 2009. It 
also regretted that no measures had been taken to reinstate the judges dismissed in May 
</p><p>2010. It noted that the Government had not accepted recommendations concerning action 
against gender discrimination, discrimination against vulnerable groups and members of the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, even though violence against these 
groups was on the increase. It called on Honduras to accept, as soon as possible, all 
recommendations and to manifestly express its commitment to translate these 
recommendations into concrete action to ensure to all Hondurans the enjoyment of their 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>532. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme recalled that Honduras 
had endured a major political upheaval in recent years. National legislation should be 
brought into line with international norms to effectively address issues such as torture, 
enforced disappearance and the sexual and commercial exploitation of children. While it 
welcomed the creation of the Secretariat for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Affairs, it 
considered that more needed to be done to combat racial discrimination. It hoped that more 
would be achieved to address impunity and prosecute extrajudicial killings, and encouraged 
Honduras to strengthen the role of the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights </p>


<p><b>180</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>by ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>533. The Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims regretted that Honduras 
had not taken any initiative to effectively prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. The national preventive mechanism against torture still did not have 
enough resources to carry out its activities, the proposal made by civil society to broaden 
the current definition of torture in legislation had been rejected and the adoption of the new 
penitentiary law had been stalled. Victims of human rights violations were invisible despite 
the law on compensation now before Congress. Honduras should display true interest in 
complying with universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>534. Amnesty International welcomed the State&#8217;s voluntary pledge to initiate a process of 
consultations on a national human rights plan with the involvement of civil society. When 
at least 10 journalists were murdered in 2010, Amnesty International urged Honduras to 
immediately implement the recommendations on the protection of journalists and human 
rights defenders. It welcomed the acceptance of recommendations on investigations and 
prosecutions of crimes committed against lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons. 
Amnesty International considered that the acceptance of recommendations relating to the 
investigation of the grave human rights violations that occurred after the 2009 institutional 
crisis was a first welcome step. However, it was disappointed at the rejection of 
recommendations to drop disciplinary proceedings against the judges dismissed for 
expressing opposing views on the institutional crisis. 
</p>
<p>535. Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez welcomed the promise by 
Honduras to investigate the murder of journalists and to legally recognize community-based 
media. However, it recalled the murder of 10 journalists in 2010 and that the precautionary 
measures requested by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had not been 
fully implemented. Honduras had failed to amend the telecommunications law and attacks 
on community radio broadcasters were on the rise. This prompted allegation letters from 
United Nations and Commission special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, to which 
Honduras had not yet replied. Owing to intensive lobbying, Honduras vowed to investigate 
the murders and other attacks on journalists. This, however, had not been the case, and it 
reiterated its demand for an end to attacks on journalists. 
</p><p>536. Plan International, Inc. welcomed the recommendations on children living under 
difficult circumstances and stated that Honduras should take the measures necessary to 
guarantee human rights to children and establish an institution to protect the rights of 
indigenous children and those living in remote areas. Plan International stated that there had 
been no progress in the recommendations guaranteeing access to justice, preventing re-
victimization and ensuring rehabilitation, and provided figures on the prosecution of 
assassinations of children and youths. It added that no progress had been made on child 
labour and the sexual exploitation of children; Honduras should therefore implement 
recommendations from various human rights mechanisms to strengthen the institutions 
dealing with children. Plan International recalled the responsibility of the State in 
guaranteeing the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>537. The Centre for Justice and International Law stated that Honduras had not 
implemented any recommendation to improve the administration of justice and the 
independence of judges. A constitutional reform had established the High Council of the 
Judiciary without ensuring a separation of administrative and judicial functions, and judges 
continued to be appointed on the basis of political recommendations. Honduras had no will 
to make reparations for violations of the independence of the judiciary. Lack of judicial 
independence had led to impunity, such as in the cases of murder of women. In 2010, 64 
women were killed, while the unit set up to investigate such cases faced serious problems in </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>181 
</b></p>
<p>fulfilling that task. As a consequence of a lack of political will, impunity continued to 
prevail. 
</p>
<p>538. The African Commission of Health and Human Rights Promoters congratulated 
Honduras on its role as sponsor of the Global Summit of People of African Descent, to be 
held in August 2011. It recalled the historical clash between cultures on the American 
continent, where discrimination persisted. The Commission underlined the loss of 
languages and ancestral traditions and referred to the specific case of the Garifuna people, 
who preserved their languages but needed support to preserve their territory. It welcomed 
the commemoration of the month of Persons of African Descent in April 2011, while the 
Garifuna people would celebrate the 214th year of their existence in Honduras. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>539. Honduras had accepted all 129 recommendations received during the review and had 
postponed only two owing to budgetary concerns. 
</p>
<p>540. Honduras reported that: 
</p>
<p> (a) It had extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, who had accepted to visit the country in September 2011; it had 
also invited the Special Rapporteur on the right to education and the Chairperson-

exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination to conduct visits to the country; 
</p>
<p> (b) A presidential decree had been adopted, establishing, as a national policy, a 
road map for the prevention and eradication of child labour and its worst forms; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Secretary of Social Development would provide financial and technical

for the prevention and eradication of child labour for the period 2008&#8211;2015; 
</p>
<p> (d) The commission against commercial sexual exploitation of children had 
begun a consultation process before presenting a draft law on trafficking to Congress; 
</p>
<p> (e) A national policy on nutritional and food security had been adopted in order

social protection, water and sanitation, and basic infrastructure; 
</p>
<p> (f) Congress had passed a law incorporating the crime of forced disappearance 
into domestic legislation; 
</p>
<p> (g) Congress had initiated a consultation process regarding the draft law on the 
council of the judiciary and the judicial career; 
 (h) Similarly, a consultation process regarding a draft law on the protection of 
Honduran migrants and their families had been launched; 
</p>
<p> (i) A trust fund for Hondurans abroad had been established to help migrants 
living in poverty and in situations of vulnerability; 300 persons had already been assisted; 
</p>
<p> (j) A national policy for the advancement of juveniles had been established in 
order to coordinate State efforts and civil society contributions for the improvement of life 
conditions of juveniles; 
 (k) A national policy on climate change had been adopted with the purpose of 
implementing adaptation and mitigation measures; 
</p>
<p> (l) Congress had repealed the Law on the State of Emergency; </p>


<p><b>182</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p> (m) A draft law on reparation to victims of human rights violations had been 
submitted to Congress for approval; 
</p>
<p> (n) Acknowledging the vital importance of freedom of expression in 
consolidating a democratic society based on the rule of law, several measures had been 
taken to ensure the free exercise of this freedom, including the training of 150 investigative 
agents whose tasks included the investigation of attacks against journalists; 
 (o) The fight against impunity was at the top of the Government&#8217;s agenda, and 
the President of the Republic continued to pursue the establishment of a United Nations 
pilot project for enhancing the capacity of justice sector institutions to tackle the 
phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>541. Honduras reiterated its call to all sectors of civil society to engage in a national 
dialogue to establish an agreed agenda for addressing national priorities. 
</p>
<p>542. Honduras thanked Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council and 
civil society organizations for contributing to the exchange about the human rights situation 
in the country. 
</p>
<p>543. Honduras would submit a mid-term report on the implementation of universal 
periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>544. Honduras also pledged to continue dialogue with States and civil society, and 
acknowledged the importance of the universal periodic review in the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>545. Honduras thanked the members of the troika (the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland, the Russian Federation and Thailand), as well as the staff of the 
secretariat for their support during the review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lebanon 
</b></p>
<p>546. The review of Lebanon was held on 10 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Lebanon in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/LBN/3). 
</p><p>547. At its 34th meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Lebanon (see section C below). 
548. The outcome of the review of Lebanon comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/18), the views of Lebanon concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>183 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>549. After conveying to Japan its sympathy and condolences with regard to the natural 
disaster that had befallen the country, Lebanon stated that it appreciated the efforts of the 
Human Rights Council to promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>550. Lebanon had been a victim of wars of others on its land and was taking steps to 
make up for the standstill in the country during successive crises. It was updating its laws in 
line with the principles promoted by the Human Rights Council, which were also the 
essence of the State of Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>551. The delegation thanked all countries that had provided comments and 
recommendations, noting that it would make efforts to take all comments into 
consideration. Lebanon also appreciated the work of civil society and hoped to work hand 
in hand with civil society organizations to create an enabling environment for these 
organizations to pursue their legitimate interests and concerns. 
</p>
<p>552. Lebanon recalled that it had accepted a large number of recommendations, some of 
which had already been implemented or were in the process of implementation. With 
regard to the recommendations the consideration of which Lebanon had postponed, the 
delegation reported that all recommendations had been accepted, with the exception of a 
part of one recommendation. In this context, the delegation referred to an annotated list of 
recommendations that it had submitted to provide further clarifications. Lebanon was 
pleased to announce that it had accepted to extend a standing invitation to all special 
procedures mandate holders to visit the country, and that preparation of overdue reports to 
treaty bodies, including the Committee against Torture, was under way. 
</p>
<p>553. Concerning women&#8217;s rights, the delegation pointed out that six draft laws were 
currently before the Chamber of Deputies and that the National Commission for Lebanese 
Women had submitted to the Ministry of Justice proposals to eliminate discriminatory 
provisions from legislation, in particular provisions having an economic effect. These 
proposals were currently being considered by the Ministry. Lebanon had accepted all 
recommendations on the protection of women from domestic violence, and a draft law on 
this matter was in preparation. Lebanon had also accepted a recommendation concerning 
crimes of honour, pointing out that the draft penal code that had been submitted to 
Parliament eliminated provisions mitigating the seriousness of the crime so as to align it 
with other crimes for which the law provides appropriate punishment. 
</p>
<p>554. With regard to Palestinian refugees, Lebanon highlighted the establishment of a 
Lebanese-Palestinian dialogue, which was a mechanism of cooperation conducted in a 
positive and realistic manner, together with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and donor countries, to address pending issues, 
including those relating to identity documents, the situation of camps and the reconstruction 
of the Nahr el Bared camp. Regarding the economic situation of Palestinian refugees and 
their right to work, the Ministry of Labour had authorized Palestinians living in Lebanon to 
work in many professions that had previously been reserved for Lebanese nationals. 
Provisions had also been made to ensure that Palestinians would receive compensation for 
arbitrary dismissal as well as end of service benefits that were equal to those received by 
Lebanese citizens. 
</p>
<p>555. The delegation added that, in line with its accession to the Convention against 
Torture in 2000 and the Optional Protocol thereto in 2008, it had accepted all 
recommendations concerning torture and was also following up on recommendations made 
by the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture following its visit to Lebanon in 2010. 
With regard to enforced disappearances, Lebanon had accepted all recommendations to 
determine the fate of disappeared persons, in line with the relevant Ministerial </p>


<p><b>184</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>pronouncement of 2009, although implementation mechanisms would depend on internal 
and external circumstances. 
</p>
<p>556. Recalling the role of Lebanon in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the delegation emphasized its eagerness to preserve its principles and to address 
human rights issues, but acknowledged that its limited resources and political difficulties 
had slowed down the process of finding appropriate solutions. 
</p>
<p>557. Concerning the issue of Palestinian refugees, the delegation stated that it could not 
solve the Palestinian tragedy on its own and that it could take decisions neither at the 
expense of its own people nor at that of the Palestinian cause. Although Lebanon would 
shoulder its part of the responsibility, it was primarily for the international community to 
carry this burden. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>558. Saudi Arabia stated that the acceptance by Lebanon of the majority of 
recommendations, including those made by Saudi Arabia, reflected the positive interaction 
of Lebanon with human rights mechanisms. Lebanon had consistently cooperated with the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms and engaged positively in the field of human 
rights. The review of Lebanon had offered an opportunity to learn about the efforts made in 
Lebanon to improve laws and institutions in the field of human rights. Saudi Arabia hoped 
that these efforts, as well as the cohesion by which Lebanese society, with its religious and 
cultural diversity, was characterized, would continue. 
</p>
<p>559. Qatar commended Lebanon for its engagement in the review process, which had 
allowed the Human Rights Council to learn about its efforts in the promotion and protection 
of human rights. Qatar noted Lebanon&#8217;s cooperation with special procedures and other 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, and its preparedness to work in a positive spirit 
with the Council, demonstrating its determination to improve the human rights situation 
and overcome the challenges it faces. Lebanon had acceded to most human rights 
instruments and developed a national plan of action for their implementation, including the 
establishment of appropriate institutions. 
</p>
<p>560. Algeria commended Lebanon for the way in which the national report had been 
prepared and followed up, noting that the report allowed the Human Rights Council to have 
a clear view of the significant efforts made by Lebanon to improve the human rights 
situation. A large number of recommendations had been accepted during the interactive 
dialogue, including those made by Algeria. This reflected, once again, the commitment of 
the Lebanese authorities to further promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>561. Egypt appreciated Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to overcome the crises and wars that it had 
suffered, including efforts to bring legislation into line with international human rights 
principles, and its openness to dialogue with all stakeholders. Egypt welcomed the steps to 
implement accepted recommendations, including the transmission of draft laws to the 
Council of Deputies for review and adoption, particularly on women&#8217;s rights. Lebanon had 
accepted recommendations concerning domestic violence and intended to adopt specific 
legislation and conduct an awareness-raising campaign to mobilize support. Egypt further 
appreciated efforts made with regard to the rights of Palestinian refugees and acknowledged 
the relevant difficulties, especially resource constraints. It appealed to the international 
community to shoulder its responsibility and to intensify its efforts to achieve the settlement 
of the question of Palestine, as well as a comprehensive and just peace in the region. 
</p><p>562. The Syrian Arab Republic acknowledged the effective participation of Lebanon in 
the review process, noting that Lebanon had submitted a report that demonstrated 
transparency as well as a realistic attitude and professionalism. The national report showed </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>the true situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country and was a 
reflection of the efforts made to promote and protect them. The fact that Lebanon had 
further accepted the pending recommendations demonstrated its readiness to strengthen its 
engagement with the international community with the aim of strengthening human rights 
protection. 
</p>
<p>563. Armenia valued Lebanon&#8217;s readiness to enhance cooperation with special 
procedures by extending an open and standing invitation, thus enhancing dialogue on 
human rights in line with its rich pluralistic traditions. It commended the determination of 
Lebanon to safeguard freedom of expression, reflected by the acceptance of Armenia&#8217;s 
recommendations, and appreciated its commitment to protect cultural heritage and the 
intention to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the 
Diversity of Cultural Expressions. It noted Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to bring together Government 
agencies, communities and civil society and observed that follow-up to the review would 
consolidate the human rights agenda and serve the cause of unity and solidarity. 
</p>
<p>564. Iraq was pleased that Lebanon had accepted the recommendations that it had made, 
and appreciated the efforts made by the Government to prepare the report in spite of the 
difficulties faced by the country, which, however, had not affected the full enjoyment of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country, which was a model of pluralism 
and cultural and religious diversity. Iraq commended the sincere will of Lebanon to move 
towards further promotion of human rights. The report had provided an opportunity to take 
note of the implementation of fundamental human rights in a democratic and pluralistic 
country, in which rights were respected in spite of difficult circumstances. Iraq called on 
Lebanon to draw up effective plans to implement the recommendations and its voluntary 
pledges. 
</p>
<p>565. Jordan noted the importance that Lebanon attached to the promotion and protection 
of human rights, including through institutional and legislative initiatives and by acceding 
to regional and international instruments. Lebanon had developed a legislative framework 
and national strategy to protect human rights, particularly to combat child labour and assist 
victims of trafficking. Jordan welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s efforts to protect freedom of expression 
and opinion and to develop a legislative framework for the media, and also to promote the 
right to education and the right to health, among others. It further noted the measures to 
promote women&#8217;s autonomy and emancipation at the social and political levels, including 
their participation in decision-making, and to put an end to honour crimes. 
</p>
<p>566. Mauritania appreciated the achievements made by Lebanon in the field of human 
rights and its efforts to promote and protect human rights. These achievements, as well as 
the fact that Lebanon had accepted the great majority of recommendations, were proof of a 
true political will in favour of the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>567. Yemen commended Lebanon&#8217;s cooperation with civil society and noted its 
important role as a symbol for freedom, as well as the role of Beirut as a regional and 
international centre hosting numerous human rights-related events. It took note of its efforts 
to promote and protect human rights in line with the principles of the Universal Declaration 
on Human Rights so as to ensure freedom and prosperity in line with laws and mechanisms 
ensuring the enjoyment of civil, political, social and other fundamental rights. Yemen 
commended Lebanon for the efforts made to further promote human rights and appreciated 
its acceptance of 83 recommendations, including those made by Yemen. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>568. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s intention to 
improve the working possibilities and conditions of Palestinian refugees. It remained 
concerned, however, at the absence of concrete measures. It urged that Palestinian refugees </p>


<p><b>186</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>be allowed to practise professions freely and that they be issued personal identity 
documents. Acknowledging the challenges relating to foreign occupation and Palestinian 
refugees, it regretted that they were being used to justify the deprivation of rights. 
Disregard for freedom of movement accompanied by military interference had led to the 
neglect, exclusion and marginalization of Palestinian refugees, particularly in the Nahr el 
Bared camp. It also noted discrimination related to property issues, particularly the 
exclusion of Palestinian from the right to own property. 
</p>
<p>569. Istituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice delle Salesiane di Don Bosco welcomed 
the achievements made by Lebanon in the promotion and protection of human rights, and 
the sincere and responsible way in which the Government had handled the review. It noted, 
however, that, despite efforts to improve the quality of education, problems remained. For 
instance, measures taken to facilitate the integration of the most vulnerable children in 
ordinary schools were insufficient. It called for the adoption of a bill extending compulsory 
schooling to the age of 15 years. It also hoped that the Government would make public 
education free, modernize school infrastructure and equipment and improve the quality of 
public education. It remained concerned at the situation of Palestinian children living in 
refugee camps, of whom only 20 per cent had access to public education. Moreover, it 
noted that Palestinians were victims of de jure and de facto discrimination with regard to 
the right to work. 
</p>
<p>570. Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 2008. At the same time, it noted that 
its unofficial moratorium on the death penalty had not yet been formalized and referred to 
42 people on death row who experienced uncertainty as a result. It urged Lebanon not to 
abstain from votes on a global moratorium at the General Assembly. It opposed 
discriminatory provisions regarding marriage, divorce, parenting and inheritance in 
Lebanon&#8217;s multiple personal status codes and regretted the discrimination in nationality 
rights against children born to Lebanese mothers where the father is of a different 
nationality. It recommended lifting all reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to the ratification of its Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>571. The Khiam Rehabilitation Centre for Victims of Torture expressed concern that 
recommendations would not be implemented because of the existence of different factions 
in Lebanon, which divided the population. A plan of action was needed to implement the 
recommendations and to end torture in detention. It also noted a need to improve family 
laws, to end violence against women and to abolish capital punishment. It stated that 
different factions must not prevent Lebanese citizens from being equal in dignity and rights, 
and called on Lebanon to review rejected recommendations. 
</p><p>572. Human Rights Watch welcomed the outcome report of Lebanon, which included 
recommendations on the rights of women, refugees, migrants and victims of enforced 
disappearance. It would have liked the review of Lebanon to have reflected concerns on the 
continued detention of foreigners following the end of their sentences. It acknowledged that 
the amendment of the Labour Law to facilitate work permit requirements for Palestinian 
refugees was a step in the right direction, and urged the Government to remove other laws 
and restrictions that discriminate against Palestinians. It was disappointed by the rejection 
of some recommendations to amend laws discriminating against women. It welcomed the 
bill introduced in February 2011 by the Minister for Labour to regulate and protect migrant 
domestic workers, and urged its adoption. It also welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s pledge to establish 
an independent national commission to investigate the whereabouts of missing persons and 
victims of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>573. World Vision International noted a growing acceptance in Lebanon of the idea that 
children have the right to participate and be heard in matters affecting them. It appreciated 
the fact that children were included in civil society consultations for the preparation of the </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>187 
</b></p>
<p>upcoming report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s 
acceptance of recommendations relating to trafficking, child labour and the clearing of 
landmines. A common concern raised by the Children&#8217;s Council related to the difficulties 
faced by stateless children and those without identity papers, especially regarding their 
access to education, health care and future employment. It urged Lebanon to reconsider 
recommendations on the right to acquire a nationality. 
</p>
<p>574. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the 
establishment of a national human rights institution and an ombudsman, expressed support 
for the training of security forces and commended Lebanon&#8217;s accession to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture. It regretted, however, that, despite the 
imposition of a moratorium, the death penalty remained in force. Rencontre africaine 
remained concerned at the lack of freedom of movement of refugees, and regretted the fact 
that migrant workers were not protected by the Labour Code. It invited Lebanon to 
decriminalize homosexuality and to eliminate discrimination of women in law and practice. 
</p>
<p>575. Amnesty International welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s support for recommendations to amend 
its national legislation to include a definition of torture conforming to the Convention 
against Torture. It was disappointed at Lebanon&#8217;s rejection of recommendations aimed at 
amending legislation discriminating against Palestinian refugees, and urged the Lebanese 
authorities to keep these recommendations under review. It welcomed Lebanon&#8217;s 
willingness to examine a recommendation to establish an independent body to investigate 
the whereabouts of missing persons and to consider ratifying the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It regretted that Lebanon 
had rejected recommendations to abolish the death penalty and to end the prerogative of 
military courts to try civilians. 
</p>
<p>576. Pax Christi International, International Catholic Peace Movement welcomed the fact 
that Lebanon had accepted a significant number of recommendations relating to torture. In 
this regard, article 401 of the Penal Code was ambiguous and did not criminalize torture. It 
added that the establishment of a national prevention mechanism conforming to obligations 
under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture should not be delayed by the 
creation of bodies with a monitoring mandate within the ministries of justice and the 
interior. It believed that a clear division of responsibilities within the Government could 
prevent further delays in reporting to the treaty bodies. It regretted the fact that Lebanon 
had rejected recommendations relating to capital punishment and was concerned about 
death penalties imposed by the Military Tribunal, which did not adhere to international fair-
trial standards. The Government was in breach of international human rights law for 
allowing the military courts to continue to adopt non-military tasks and to try civilians. 
</p>
<p>577. The African Association of Education for Development focused its comments on the 
rights of domestic workers, stating that women from East Africa suffered from diverse 
forms of abuse in Lebanon and were without protection. Physical violence was a frequent 
occurrence, freedom of movement was not assured, working hours did not provide for 
periods of rest and passports were withheld. Taken together, this situation could be 
described as a contemporary form of slavery. There had also been cases of sexual abuse and 
many foreign women workers were victims of human trafficking. It appreciated the work of 
journalists, trade unionists and non-governmental organizations with affected women. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>578. The delegation of Lebanon valued all remarks made; Lebanon attached great 
importance to the contributions of civil society organizations, with which it intended to 
have an ongoing dialogue. </p>


<p><b>188</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>579. With regard to those few recommendations that could not be accepted, this was due 
to the fact that, at the present time, Lebanese citizens were to a large extent not in 
agreement with the proposed changes. This was for instance the case in relation to the 
recommendation to abolish the death penalty. While the Ministry of Justice had submitted a 
draft bill to this effect, the bill had not found majority approval. 
</p><p>580. In general terms, Lebanon was in a particular situation insofar as its people were 
composed of 18 religious communities, whose religious courts decided on personal matters 
in line with the rules and principles relating to each faith. At present, the political 
representation of all these faiths was the appropriate solution by which the interests of all 
Lebanese citizens were respected and a mutual understanding within Lebanese society 
could be maintained. 
</p>
<p>581. With regard to the issue of domestic workers, Lebanon acknowledged that there 
were isolated incidents of abuse. The Ministry of Labour was addressing this issue and had 
already prepared a draft bill and a model contract in different languages understood by 
migrant workers. The Ministry had also adopted a system to regulate employment agencies, 
with provisions for end of service benefits for domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>582. Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon enjoyed full freedom of movement. 
Checkpoints for access to camps had been set up only to prevent certain individuals that 
had committed violations from seeking refuge in camps in order to flee prosecution. Delays 
in the reconstruction of the Naher el Bared camp were partly due to unfulfilled pledges by 
donors and partners. Minefields around the camp also still had to be eliminated. 
Palestinians living in Lebanon today were entitled to carry out many different professions, 
and identity cards had been issued to those who had not previously held such documents, so 
that families could register their children in schools and have access to social services. 
</p>
<p>583. Lebanon thanked again all countries for their valuable ideas and proposals, which it 
would duly take into consideration. Lebanon would welcome any additional proposals and 
would continue its cooperation with civil society, which made an important contribution to 
the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Marshall Islands 
</b></p>
<p>584. The review of the Marshall Islands was held on 5 November 2010 in conformity 
with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Republic of the Marshall Islands in 
accordance with the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MHL/1 and A/HRC/WG.6/9/MHL/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MHL/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MHL/3). 
</p><p>585. At its 34th meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Marshall Islands (see section C below). 
586. The outcome of the review of the Marshall Islands comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/12), the views of the 
Marshall Islands concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/16/12/Add.1). </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>189 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>587. The delegation of the Marshall Islands thanked OHCHR, the Human Rights Council 
and the Working Group for assisting the Marshall Islands in the universal periodic review 
process and provided an abbreviated summary of its responses to all the 38 
recommendations it received during the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>588. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.1 to 56.8 relating to ratification 
of or accession to the main international human rights treaties and the relevant optional 
protocols, and abiding by the principles therein. The delegation stressed that the Marshall 
Islands was in serious need of technical and financial assistance in order to properly 
implement the treaties and to continue its efforts regarding those to which it is not a party. 
As a positive example of where such assistance produced results, the delegation indicated 
that the Marshall Islands was currently in the process of acceding to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>589. Regarding recommendations 56.9 to 56.12, on the establishment of a national human 
rights institution, the Marshall Islands could not at this time consider these 
recommendations owing to its limited national resources. The Women&#8217;s Office under the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs should be strengthened before a national human rights 
institution could be considered. 
</p>
<p>590. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.22 to 56.27, to further review its 
laws and policies to ensure conformity with international human rights standards. The 
delegation stated that the Resource Development Committee would work with appropriate 
bodies in ensuring development of the laws. The delegation invited the international 
community to provide it with technical and financial assistance to allow it to adhere to the 
international human rights standards and the provisions of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>591. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.13 and 56.14, and mentioned 
the positive efforts made with the support of UNICEF and non-governmental organization 
partners to address children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>592. With regard to recommendations 56.15 to 56.19 and 56.25, on women&#8217;s rights and 
domestic violence, the Marshall Islands expressed its commitment to address domestic 
violence and other issues affecting women. Positive efforts had been made to raise 
awareness and a bill was currently pending in the national Parliament. Some progress had 
been made regarding the education of women and economic opportunities. The delegation 
stressed that more work was needed to address the serious imbalance in female 
participation in the Parliament. It added that any related constitutional action should 
continue to ensure the democratic principles of free elections. 
</p>
<p>593. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.20, 56.21, 56.22, 56.33 and 
56.34, and remained committed to properly implement children&#8217;s rights and improve the 
situation of children at the national level. The delegation highlighted the establishment of a 
child rights office and that, with the assistance of UNICEF, baseline research would enable 
the development of necessary policies. 
</p>
<p>594. With regard to the rights of persons with disabilities, the Marshall Islands accepted 
recommendations 56.28 and 56.29. The delegation stressed that, although these rights were 
not specifically afforded in the Constitution, there were already policies and laws that 
address special education and the health of children with disabilities, as well as access to 
parking facilities. </p>


<p><b>190</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>595. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.30 and 56.31, to continue to 
implement strategies and plans for socio-economic development. Increasing national data 
capacity had improved policy advice and highlighted efforts made since 2010 towards an 
updated national development plan, as well as a new national consensus under way. 
</p>
<p>596. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendation 56.35, to promote and protect the 
rights of prisoners and ensure that living standards and detention facilities abide by 
international standards. The delegation acknowledged the poor living conditions in 
detention facilities, and stated that the Marshall Islands was already considering 
improvements, including building renovations and rehabilitation programmes for juveniles, 
although resources were limited. 
</p>
<p>597. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendation 56.36 relating to climate change and 
noted the development of a road map and policy framework to provide a holistic approach 
and further partnership. The delegation expressed its disappointment that so few nations 
responded to the issue the Marshall Islands raised regarding climate change impact and 
rising sea levels, especially since immediate action could sharply reduce the long-term risks 
of climate change, which could no longer be ignored. The World Bank was currently 
undertaking a study on climate change and the human rights implications in the Marshall 
Islands. An academic conference planned for May 2011, co-sponsored by the Marshall 
Islands and Colombia University, could further address some of the critical and 
unprecedented issues in international law with regard to rising seas and climate change. 
</p>
<p>598. The Marshall Islands accepted recommendations 56.37 and 56.38, and had already 
extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement 
and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>599. The delegation acknowledged the need to make critical progress in key human rights 
areas, and stressed that the only barrier was limited means. It stressed that its own political 
will was not enough to achieve many of its affirmed goals under the universal periodic 
review process. It emphasized the importance of building capacity through partnerships, 
which required efforts to build bridges with local communities (recommendation 56.32). 
Unless it received such support, success would be limited or persistent gaps would be seen 
in progress at the next universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>600. Algeria welcomed the acceptance by the Marshall Islands of its two 
recommendations, on accession to the two human rights covenants and the implementation 
of human rights in the areas of education, health, housing and development. Regarding its 
third recommendation, on the establishment of a national human rights institution, Algeria 
took note that this would be considered at a later stage. Algeria called on the international 
community to show solidarity with this island nation and to help it to overcome its resource 
constraints, which were amplified by the impact of the financial and economic crises, as 
well as by climate change. Algeria encouraged the Marshall Islands to continue its efforts to 
overcome obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>601. Morocco congratulated the Marshall Islands on its open spirit, demonstrated during 
the review, and its determination to follow the path of development and democracy. It 
noted with interest the efforts made to strengthen the judicial system, improve conditions of 
detention and reinforce freedoms of expression, information, religion, assembly and 
association, as well as the efforts to fight violence against women. Morocco was pleased to 
note that three of its recommendations had been accepted. It called on the international </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>191 
</b></p>
<p>community to support the efforts of the Marshall Islands to overcome the obstacles 
hindering the fulfilment of its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>602. Cuba was pleased to note that the Marshall Islands had accepted its 
recommendations, in particular with regard to the continuation of programmes and 
measures to ensure the enjoyment of the right to education and the right to health. Cuba 
welcomed the policies and programmes adopted by the Government and encouraged it to 
continue its efforts to mitigate the negative impact of climate change, in particular with 
regard to the full enjoyment of all human rights. The effects of climate change were indeed 
a reason for concern with regard to areas such a nutrition, education and health. Cuba also 
encouraged the Marshall Islands to continue the implementation of measures to promote 
and protect the human rights of its people. 
</p>
<p>603. New Zealand welcomed the intention of the Marshall Islands to address the matter 
of ratification of major international human rights instruments, and that it was actively 
pursuing the problem of violence against women, while conceding that further efforts were 
needed. In the area of children&#8217;s rights, it noted the information that a review of child 
protection legislation was under way, with the assistance of UNICEF. It noted that the 
review would help to identify gaps in child protection, as well as measures to address them. 
New Zealand welcomed these responses while acknowledging the limited resources of the 
Marshall Islands as a small State. 
</p>
<p>604. Maldives welcomed the decision by the Marshall Islands to support most of the 
recommendations made, including those that it had made. With regard to challenges and 
vulnerabilities resulting from climate change, Maldives applauded the acceptance by the 
Marshall Islands to take a rights-based approach to adaptation, and welcomed the 
information provided on the holistic approach taken. Maldives called on the international 
community to assist the Marshall Islands in its efforts to improve the human rights 
situation. Finally, it stressed the importance of working with the international community to 
explore the benefits of opening a mission in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>605. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace<b> </b>encouraged the 
Marshall Islands to ratify core human rights conventions. It recommended that the Marshall 
Islands should issue a standing invitation to special procedures and offer to assist in future 
visits by mandate holders. It emphasized the importance of human rights education, which 
should become a part of the curriculum. It hoped that the Marshall Islands would partner 
with regional and international non-governmental organizations and institutions of higher 
education to develop positive curriculum models. It noted that many non-governmental 
organizations in the region were interested in a regional human rights body for the Pacific, 
and hoped that the Marshall Islands would participate. The Association also highlighted 
environmental and health issues, in particular as a result of past nuclear testing and in 
connection with climate change, and stressed the importance of a human rights-based 
approach to adaptation. 
</p>
<p>606. United Nations Watch<b> </b>welcomed and encouraged the commitment of the Marshall 
Islands to accept virtually all recommendations, including in particular the 
recommendations to ensure that human rights are afforded full legal protection; that 
legislation and policies on women&#8217;s rights and the elimination of violence against women 
be prioritized; that human rights organizations be actively involved in the follow-up to the 
review; and that existing laws be reviewed and revised to ensure that they are non-
discriminatory. With regard to international engagement on human rights, United Nations 
Watch noted that the Marshall Islands had consistently stood against aiding and abetting 
selectivity and for upholding equality, non-discrimination and the promotion of peace. </p>


<p><b>192</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>607. The delegation concluded by thanking the Working Group and the Human Rights 
Council for the constructive dialogue during its universal periodic review, and it looked 
forward to continued cooperation. It also looked forward to the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Croatia 
</b></p>
<p>608. The review of Croatia was held on 8 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Croatia in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/1; 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/1/Corr.1 and A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/1/Corr.2); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/3). 
</p><p>609. At its 34th meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Croatia (see section C below). 
610. The outcome of the review on Croatia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/13), the views of Croatia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/16/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>611. Croatia indicated that it had actively participated in the universal periodic review 
process and attached great importance to the ongoing review of the Human Rights Council. 
Croatia had passed through a dynamic democracy transition, with the establishment of an 
advanced and comprehensive human rights protection system, including through its 
Constitution, its legislative and institutional framework, the ratification of a significant 
number of international human rights treaties and the extension of a standing invitation to 
the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>612. The national report of Croatia had attracted interest among the public and civil 
society; consultations with civil society organizations would continue after the final 
adoption of the outcome. The Working Group report had been sent to the Government in 
January 2011, which mandated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration to 
take further steps, including the presentation of the report to the Parliamentary Committee 
for Human Rights and National Minorities. 
</p>
<p>613. The universal periodic review recommendations were an effective tool for reviewing 
and improving legislation and practice and for identifying existing protection gaps. Croatia 
thanked the 46 countries that had taken part in the interactive dialogue, which showed that 
Croatia had achieved an advanced level in key areas relating to human rights protection and 
promotion, such as the justice reform and suppression of all forms of discrimination. The 
commitment to resolve all outstanding war issues had also been confirmed. Croatia had </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>193 
</b></p>
<p>participated actively in the interactive dialogue and was willing to maintain cooperation 
with all interested countries, civil society organizations and human rights mechanisms. In 
this regard, Croatia would soon be reviewed by three United Nations treaty bodies. Croatia 
stated that it was crucial to maintain interdependence and constant interaction between the 
universal periodic review and the treaty body system in order to improve both mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>614. Croatia was pleased to inform the Human Rights Council that it had accepted the 
great majority of proposed recommendations, among them 94 in November 2010. Croatia 
was unable to accept only two recommendations: the recommendation concerning the 
access to citizenship, as it was incompatible with domestic legislation since it had set 
requirements going beyond the international standards; and the recommendation on free 
legal aid, which remained open to interpretation owing to its drafting. 
</p>
<p>615. Croatia partially accepted several recommendations, namely those concerning 
ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On the former instrument, Croatia was 
of the view that an effective system for migrants&#8217; rights should be seen as an integral part of 
the wider European human rights framework. While Croatia had not yet reached a final 
decision on whether to sign or ratify the Convention, the broad legislative framework for 
migrant protection had already been enacted. Regarding the latter instrument, the inter-
agency working group was in the process of formulating recommendations with regard to 
its signature and possible ratification. 
</p>
<p>616. All other postponed recommendations were accepted without any objection. Croatia 
had provided basic information to clarify its responses on various issues, namely national 
minorities, return of refugees, war crimes, anti-discrimination, persons with disabilities and 
human trafficking. Croatia had decided to accept the recommendation that it establish an 
adequate mechanism for the follow-up to universal periodic review recommendations, 
which would include the participation and cooperation of all relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>617. Croatia expressed its commitment to make all recommendations more visible and to 
the comprehensive universal periodic review exercise, although it could certainly be 
improved. 
</p>
<p>618. Lastly, Croatia clarified its position relating to recommendations 98.1 to 98.3 on the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. Croatia had not accepted these recommendations and recalled 
what it had said earlier on this specific instrument. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>619. Algeria noted with appreciation the large number of recommendations that Croatia 
considered it had already implemented or was in the process of implementing. It welcomed 
the fact that two of its three recommendations had enjoyed the support of Croatia, and took 
note of what Croatia had stated about follow-up to its third recommendation on the 
possibility of acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, in accordance with recommendation 
1737 of 17 March 2006, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 
of which Croatia was a member. 
</p>
<p>620. Morocco noted with interest the efforts made by Croatia, in particular in the 
framework of the three-year national programme to strengthen the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It welcomed Croatia&#8217;s efforts to enhance the implementation of 
the normative and institutional framework, strengthen administrative and institutional 
capacities and combat discrimination. Morocco was satisfied that two of its </p>


<p><b>194</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>recommendations enjoyed the support of Croatia, namely, the recommendation relating to 
the incorporation of human rights education and training into school curricula and training 
for civil servants, and the recommendation on the establishment of a system aimed at 
monitoring and systematically repressing hate crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>621. The Ombudsman of Croatia noted with regret that the Government had not engaged 
in public consultations with national stakeholders during the review process. While 
welcoming the acceptance by Croatia of most recommendations, the Ombudsman noted 
that Croatia should accept recommendation 98.11 to amend the strict eligibility 
requirements of the Free Legal Aid Act so that people in need could benefit from its 
provisions. The Ombudsman positively echoed the acceptance by Croatia of all 
recommendations aimed at strengthening the status of the Ombudsman and specialized 
ombudspersons. The Ombudsman urged the Government to translate and make publically 
available the assessments and recommendations made by international human rights bodies, 
including that of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>622. Be Active, Be Emancipated noted with regret that the human rights situation in 
Croatia had deteriorated since the beginning of the review process, and citizens were 
deprived of basic rights such as the right to work and to just and favourable working 
conditions. It also noted with regret that Croatia had rejected the recommendations related 
to the Free Legal Aid Act, as the procedures for receiving free legal aid were bureaucratic 
and complicated. A number of cases of repossession of property of members of minorities 
had been pending for more than 11 years and the independence of media had been reduced. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>623. Croatia expressed its gratitude to the civil society organizations that had raised some 
issues that deserved its utmost attention. As it had done during the universal periodic 
review process, Croatia would continue its consultations with civil society organizations in 
an open and constructive manner to review all remarks raised during the current plenary 
session. 
</p>
<p>624. Croatia also welcomed the side event, organized by Human Rights House 
Foundation on 17 March 2011, focusing on the process of participation by Croatian civil 
society organizations in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. Croatia remained 
open to further its partnership through dialogue and complementarities. 
</p>
<p>625. The follow-up to the recommendations would be carried out in a constructive spirit 
with all stakeholders, and all recommendations would be considered equally important 
contributions to its national plans and programmes. Croatia would soon initiate broad 
consultations with civil society organizations concerning a possible follow-up mechanism. 
</p>
<p>626. In conclusion, Croatia extended its gratitude to all the participants in the interactive 
dialogue, as well as to Morocco and Algeria, who extended their support for the adoption of 
the universal periodic review outcome of Croatia. 
</p>
<p><b>  Jamaica 
</b>627. The review of Jamaica was held on 8 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Jamaica in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/JAM/1 and

</p><p>628. At its 34th meeting, on 17 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Jamaica (see section C below). 
629. The outcome of the review on Jamaica comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/14), the views of Jamaica concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/16/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>630. Jamaica stated that recognition of the universality of human rights principles was 
embedded in its national policy and outlook, and that this approach was evident in the frank 
and open manner in which the universal periodic review had been addressed.  
</p>
<p>631. Jamaica expressed its appreciation for the constructive comments received during 
the review. It accepted many of the recommendations made, and had implemented or was 
in the process of implementing many of them, particularly with regard to social and 
humanitarian issues. It noted the importance of building on these achievements, and made 
particular mention of the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals relating to the 
reduction of poverty, malnutrition and hunger, universal primary education, universal 
access to reproductive health and access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. 
</p>
<p>632. Jamaica had carefully considered the recommendations that were to be reported on 
at the outcome, with a view to protecting the interests of all Jamaicans. 
</p>
<p>633. On the ratification of treaties, Jamaica underscored the fact that being a non-party to 
international human rights treaties did not diminish the importance of the country&#8217;s 
commitment to promote and protect human rights.  
</p>
<p>634. Regarding recommendations pertaining to voluntary commitments present in Human 
Rights Council resolution 9/12, Jamaica considered these to be in keeping with its 
commitments to human rights and recalled that it was party to seven of the nine core 
instruments. Regarding instruments to which it was not a party, appropriate legislation 
grounded in the Constitution provided for the protection of the rights of all citizens. 
Nevertheless, Jamaica would continue to consider those instruments to which it was not yet 
a party.  
</p>
<p>635. Jamaica provided information on the ongoing review, with a view to ratifying the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, 
the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Rome Statute, to 
which it is a signatory.  
</p>
<p>636. Regarding the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, Jamaica explained that, at present, it was not in a position to sign and 
ratify this instrument although it recognized its aspirations and goals. </p>


<p><b>196</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>637. Regarding the issue of refugees and asylum, Jamaica reiterated its commitment to 
fulfil its obligations, which was reflected in the adoption of a refugee policy in 2008, and 
noted that efforts were now under way to implement enabling legislation. The policy and 
enabling legislation were intended to ensure the implementation of Jamaica&#8217;s obligations 
under relevant treaties. 
</p>
<p>638. Jamaica recognized the importance of timely compliance with reporting obligations 
to United Nations treaty bodies, and it had accepted the recommendation on this issue. It 
provided detailed information on efforts already made to comply with this obligation, 
which had resulted in the submission, since 2009, of reports under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. Jamaica also provided information on efforts made to present outstanding 
reports under other treaties.  
</p>
<p>639. With regard to the constitutional amendment to provide for a charter of rights and 
freedoms, the Government remained committed to the implementation of this instrument; 
the matter was to be taken to Parliament on 29 March 2011.  
</p>
<p>640. While there was no single institution dealing with human rights in the country, 
several similar entities existed and steps to strengthen these mechanisms had been taken. 
Jamaica referred in particular to the Bureau of Women&#8217;s Affairs and the Child 
Development Agency, and provided detailed information on their mandates and 
functioning.  
</p>
<p>641. With regard to the events in West Kingston in May 2010, and in particular 
recommendations to create a commission of inquiry, Jamaica explained that the Public 
Defender was currently carrying out an investigation of the events and a decision on 
whether to establish such a commission would be taken once he had completed and 
presented his report.  
</p>
<p>642. Jamaica recognized the urgent need to address conditions in prisons and lockups. 
Various efforts were being made in this regard, including the construction of new prison 
facilities, the retrofitting of existing prison facilities and the privatization of prisons. 
However, Jamaica&#8217;s ability to carry out such initiatives risked being affected in the short 
term by the severe economic and financial constraints facing the country. Jamaica added 
that a new regime for the management of juveniles was being developed and the existing 
facility was being renovated.  
</p>
<p>643. In conclusion, the measures taken underscored Jamaica&#8217;s commitment to ensure that 
the necessary normative and institutional framework was in place for the protection of 
human rights. Jamaica expressed its satisfaction that the importance of technical assistance 
and external cooperation had been recognized in recommendations made during the review.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>644. Algeria expressed satisfaction that Jamaica had supported the three 
recommendations it had made, namely, to reactivate the hospital project concerning the ill-
treatment of children with the assistance from relevant United Nations institutions, to 
protect children in juvenile correctional facilities, and to establish a human rights 
institution. Algeria congratulated Jamaica on having met the Millennium Development 
Goals relating to the reduction of poverty and malnutrition, and on access to primary 
education. Algeria had paid tribute to the people of Jamaica during the current International 
Year for People of African Descent and sent a strong message of solidarity and 
encouragement to the authorities to continue their efforts to promote human rights. </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>197 
</b></p>
<p>645. Morocco congratulated Jamaica on the impressive progress made towards meeting 
the Millennium Development Goals. It acknowledged the efforts made to protect children 
and women against exploitation and ill-treatment and to ensure the respect of the rights of 
the elderly and persons with disabilities. Morocco expressed satisfaction that Jamaica had 
supported two of its recommendations, namely, to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and to reflect on ways and means to address the problems relating to the high 
rate of violent crime, worsening security, the country&#8217;s vulnerability to natural disasters and 
global economic instability. 
</p>
<p>646. Cuba congratulated Jamaica on its efforts and action undertaken to implement the 
recommendations it had received. It expressed particular appreciation for Jamaica&#8217;s 
acceptance of the recommendations made by Cuba aimed at the continuation of its 
strategies and plans for socio-economic development and to ensure public health and 
quality education for its people. Despite the challenges faced by Jamaica as a developing 
country in its socio-economic advancement, it had made important achievements, such as 
meeting the Millennium Development Goals relating to extreme poverty reduction, 
malnutrition and hunger. Cuba also acknowledged Jamaica&#8217;s progress in the areas of 
universal primary education and access to public health, including reproductive health. 
Cuba assured Jamaica of its continuing support and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>647. The United States of America appreciated Jamaica&#8217;s support for recommendations 
on the implementation of the recommendations made by the Jamaican Justice System 
Reform Task Force and looked forward to continued progress on justice reform, especially 
on increasing respect for the rule of law and human rights in the police. It appreciated 
Jamaica&#8217;s commitment to start a public information campaign to combat discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and strongly supported recommendations made to repeal the 
sections of the Offences against the Person Act, which criminalized same-sex intercourse. It 
urged Jamaica to reconsider the recommendations to investigate incidents or acts of 
violence with suspected motivations on the grounds of sexual orientation, and to take 
measures to ensure that lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual persons may participate fully 
in society without fear of attack or discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>648. COC Netherlands and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays were 
encouraged by Jamaica&#8217;s adoption of the recommendations to train law enforcement 
officials and to conduct public campaigns to combat discrimination on the grounds of 
sexual orientation. Citing the recent incident in Montego Bay in February 2011, they stated 
that LGBT people continued to be the victims of human rights violations by both non-State 
actors and State actors, such as the police. It was hoped that Jamaica would demonstrate 
leadership in the fight against intolerance for lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual 
Jamaicans. They encouraged the Government to take bold steps towards the 
decriminalization of consensual same-sex activities. They asked that, within the current 
review of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, a more inclusive clause on 
non-discrimination be considered for adoption.  
</p>
<p>649. Amnesty International welcomed Jamaica&#8217;s commitment to carry out independent 
investigations into the deaths that occurred during police operations in Tivoli Garden in 
2010, and encouraged it to support the establishment of an independent commission of 
inquiry into the incident. Amnesty International expressed its belief that the ratification of 
the Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto would enhance Jamaica&#8217;s 
commitment to prevent and punish violations by the security forces. It expressed 
disappointment with Jamaica&#8217;s rejection of the recommendations regarding the death 
penalty. While encouraged that there had been no executions since 1988, Amnesty </p>


<p><b>198</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>International was concerned that death sentences continued to be handed down and that the 
authorities justified the retention of the death penalty as the will of the people. It urged 
Jamaica to reconsider a number of recommendations, namely, to repeal legislation that 
criminalized consensual same-sex activities and to include a specific prohibition of 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the Charter of Rights bill. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review  
</b></p>
<p>650. Jamaica thanked the delegations and stakeholders for their remarks, in particular 
those that had recommended the adoption of the report. Jamaica reiterated that there was no 
legal discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation in the country, 
nor did the Government condone discrimination or violence against such persons. Where 
such actions were brought to the attention of the authorities, they were dealt with in 
accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>651. Jamaica provided additional information on the issues of justice and law 
enforcement reform. Efforts in this regard had recently been made, such as the 
promulgation by the Jamaican Constabulary of enhanced guidelines for the use of force by 
its members and the adoption by the Jamaican Defence Force of updated guidelines for its 
members operating in support of law enforcement operations. Jamaica also provided 
information on efforts made to improve the conditions of detention at various institutions 
and places of detention. It underscored the fact that the Government had established a 
commission of Parliament to undertake investigations concerning action by State agents 
that resulted in the death or injury to person.  
</p><p>652. Jamaica thanked the members of the Human Rights Council for the attention paid to 
the review of Jamaica, which it considered to be an extremely valuable contribution to its 
efforts to develop and reinforce the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>653. The President thanked Jamaica for its comprehensive presentation and its very 
fruitful participation in the universal periodic review process. He observed that, according 
to Council resolution 5/1, States under review should either support or note 
recommendations. In keeping with existing practice, it was noted that Jamaica was not able 
to pronounce itself in a definitive manner on recommendations 100.2-8, 100.11-15, 100.17 
and 100.20-23. The President asked if these recommendations had been noted.  
</p>
<p>654. Jamaica stated that these may be regarded as noted. Jamaica observed, however, that 
the list of recommendations mentioned numerically may be misleading, as many of the 
recommendations were repeated. Its response had sought to cluster recommendations 
thematically and, in this regard, Jamaica supported the proposal before the 
intergovernmental working group on the review of the Human Rights Council that 
recommendations be clustered in a thematic way.  
</p>
<p>655. On the matter of recommendations that had been noted, Jamaica emphasized that, in 
the cases of recommendations where it had indicated that certain proposals were being 
examined, it did not consider that these recommendations had been rejected. Jamaica had 
only sought to ensure that due respect was given to the decision-making process that had to 
be followed in order to give effect to some of these recommendations, including action by 
Parliament. Jamaica added that it had been forthright at all stages of the universal periodic 
review process, and had clearly indicated its rejection or acceptance of recommendations 
received.

<p>GE.11-17059 <b>199 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Federated States of Micronesia 
</b></p>
<p>657. The review of the Federated States of Micronesia was held on 9 November 2010 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Federated States of Micronesia in 
accordance with the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/FSM/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/FSM/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/FSM/3). 
</p><p>658. At its 35th meeting, on 18 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Federated States of Micronesia (see section C 
below). 
659. The outcome of the review of the Federated States of Micronesia comprises the 
report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/16), the views 
of the Federated States of Micronesia concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, 
and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by 
the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/16/16/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>660. The Federated States of Micronesia stated that the universal periodic review had 
been a welcome exercise and that the Government was pleased to have played its part 
throughout the review. 
</p>
<p>661. The delegation referred to the natural disaster that had greatly affected Japan the 
week before and stated that, for a country like Micronesia, a small island developing State 
in the Pacific, the disaster in Japan was yet another grim reminder of its own vulnerability 
to natural disasters and the impact of climate change. The challenges that Micronesia faced 
in addressing human rights were often exacerbated by the challenges posed by the negative 
impact of climate change, which threatened Micronesia&#8217;s right to be secure, to live and to 
exist.  
</p>
<p>662. The delegation emphasized that remoteness and isolation were realities of small 
island nations in the Pacific. For a country such as Micronesia, with many scattered islands, 
it added yet another set of impediments to its efforts to provide the necessary services to its 
citizens, who were scattered on these tiny atolls. The Government would, however, always 
endeavour to do what was right, necessary and appropriate in order to promote and 
safeguard the dignity and human rights of its people. 
</p>
<p>663. The Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia was the supreme law of the 
land. It guaranteed the right to life, liberty, equal protection and due process of law. Many 
of the challenges that Micronesia faced in addressing human rights issues were due not to 
the lack of regard for law and human dignity, but to limited capacity and resources. The 
Federated States of Micronesia overwhelmingly supported many of the recommendations 
made by countries, but was mindful of its limited capacity and resources to implement 
necessary laws or to carry out recommended activities.  
</p>
<p>664. Micronesia supported the recommendations made by countries to ratify and accede 
to the core human rights treaties. Since the universal periodic review held in November </p>


<p><b>200</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>2010, the Government had embarked on activities relating to some of the treaties and 
protocols. The Government had put in place a task force to lead the ratification and 
accession process of the Palermo Protocol. Drafting of necessary domestic laws would also 
follow. Micronesia was collaborating with its partners, such as the United States of 
America, in advancing the Protocol and putting in place the necessary laws. It would be 
working on ratifying and acceding to other core treaties.  
</p>
<p>655. Micronesia supported the recommendations to establish a national human rights 
institution, to pass laws to address domestic violence, to continue to develop advocacy 
campaigns to raise awareness of the rights of women, and to adopt laws against child 
exploitation and sexual abuse. It also supported the recommendations to protect women and 
children.  
</p>
<p>666. A number of countries had recommended that the Federated States of Micronesia 
remove its reservations made to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. Micronesia&#8217;s effort in this area would be towards removing 
the reservations while taking into account the unique customs, culture and traditions of the 
Micronesian people. Its people were guardians of these small islands; for generations, they 
had lived in peace and harmony. Their culture, customs and tradition had sustained them as 
a people over the years.  
</p>
<p>667. Micronesians lived in a traditional society where families and extended families 
were part of the solution to problems. When a child experienced problems, it became the 
responsibility of the extended family to assist and ensure the child&#8217;s welfare and well-
being. In the Micronesian context, that meant involving an entire village. For this reason, 
the delegation explained that the recommendations for the establishment of separate homes 
for children did not enjoy its support.  
</p><p>668. The right to education and to access to health care would continue to be priority 
areas in Micronesia&#8217;s national development efforts. Central to those were the rights of the 
most vulnerable, such as women, children and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>669. Environmental protection was an essential and important area. The people of the 
Federated States of Micronesia relied heavily on the fragile ecosystem for food and 
sustenance. Any adverse impact on the terrestrial and marine resources would be 
detrimental to the livelihood of the Micronesians and deprive them of their human rights. 
The Government would continue its efforts to protect the environment through the 
Micronesian Challenge initiative of effectively conserving 20 per cent of terrestrial and 30 
per cent of marine resources areas.  
</p>
<p>670. In order for Micronesia to implement the recommendations, it would need the 
support of its development partners. Over the next four years, Micronesia would be calling 
on the international community for support, without which its efforts would be 
compromised.  
</p>
<p>671. The Government recognized the complexity arising from the uniqueness of its 
federation. The Government would continue to work with the four States within the 
federation that had constitutional responsibility for many of the recommendations made.  
</p>
<p>672. While the universal periodic review had been a welcome exercise, Micronesia 
acknowledged that it had not been one without its own difficulties and challenges. Capacity 
constraints and limited financial resources continued to affect its ability to complete 
effectively the necessary reports or to send delegates to attend the review. 
</p>
<p>673. In closing, the delegation thanked all of those who had made its review a meaningful 
and worthwhile undertaking, and the Member States for their honest and constructive 
views. Micronesia would continue to play its role in advancing the human rights and 
dignity of all its people.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>674. Cuba welcomed the delegation of Micronesia and praised the country&#8217;s 
commitments to human rights and its efforts and actions in the implementation of the 
recommendations. It appreciated the fact that Micronesia had accepted Cuba&#8217;s 
recommendations, in particular, to continue programmes and measures undertaken to 
ensure the right to education and health. Micronesia faced particular circumstances that 
affected its socio-economic development; nevertheless, it showed progress in the sphere of 
human rights. Cuba encouraged Micronesia to continue its work in favour of all human 
rights of its people and appealed to the international community to fully support 
Micronesia. 
</p>
<p>675. Algeria noted that Micronesia had accepted 70 of 73 recommendations made, and 
noted with appreciation the acceptance of the three recommendations submitted by Algeria, 
on the ratification of the core human rights instruments, women&#8217;s participation in public 
life, and reducing violence against women. Algeria commended the significant progress 
made by Micronesia in the promotion of human rights, particularly the efforts to ensure 
access to education and health, despite the challenges of limited financial and human 
resources and its vulnerability to climate change. It called on the international community 
and relevant United Nations agencies to provide Micronesia with the assistance necessary 
for the implementation of the accepted recommendations.  
</p>
<p>676. New Zealand referred to the recommendations it had made on combating domestic 
violence and the sexual abuse of women, and on improving children&#8217;s rights. It praised 
Micronesia&#8217;s active engagement in the process and commitments in areas of interest to New 
Zealand, which included a statement made by Micronesia that the strategic development 
plan had indentified gender as one of its priority areas. New Zealand noted that there was 
also the possibility of legislation to allocate seats reserved for women in the national 
congress. New Zealand welcomed Micronesia&#8217;s decision to seek assistance from donor 
partners in developing legislation on gender-based violence, acknowledging the limited 
resources at the disposal of Micronesia as a small island State. 
</p>
<p>677. Morocco noted Micronesia&#8217;s commitments to human rights despite the challenges it 
faced as a small island State dealing with climate change and extreme meteorological 
phenomena. Morocco recommended that the international community should extend 
assistance to Micronesia through a partnership. Recalling the importance of human rights 
and the environment and the upcoming resolution thereon of the Human Rights Council, 
Morocco praised Micronesia&#8217;s prioritization of these issues through ambitious strategic 
planning detailed in its national report. Morocco thanked Micronesia for having accepted its 
recommendations in the fields of health, education and training on human rights and the 
environment.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>678. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace welcomed 
Micronesia&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review process and encouraged 
Micronesia to ratify the core human rights conventions and to implement immediately the 
articles to guarantee human rights in Oceania. It enquired about developments in relation to 
Hungary&#8217;s recommendation to initiate a structured public debate to accelerate accession to 
all core international treaties. It also suggested that Micronesia issue an open invitation to 
United Nations special rapporteurs, and enquired about the establishment of a national 
human rights commission in conformity with the Paris Principles. The Association stressed 
that human rights education must be incorporated into the curriculum and offered its 
assistance in this area. It indicated the interest of non-governmental organizations in 
creating a regional human rights body for the Pacific, and hoped for Micronesia&#8217;s </p>


<p><b>202</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>participation. It referred to the historical significance of women&#8217;s rights in Micronesia and 
the importance of the right to self-determination in relation to the growing threats of 
climate change. It also noted the issue of housing and health care for Micronesians living in 
Hawaii. The Association supported the United Kingdom&#8217;s recommendation to provide 
technical assistance in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>679. UN Watch welcomed and encouraged Micronesia&#8217;s commitment to work on 70 of 
73 recommendations. It enumerated the most important ones in relation to the assurance of 
full human rights and legal protection throughout Micronesia, the elimination of all laws 
and practices discriminating against women and girls, the ban on child labour and the 
minimum age for criminal responsibility, the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender 
identity as prohibited grounds for discrimination, the prevention of mistreatment in 
detention centres and prisons, and the adequate protection against sexual and gender 
violence. UN Watch commended Micronesia for its courage, conviction and resolve to 
uphold the principles of General Assembly resolution 60/251, which created the Human 
Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>680. Micronesia thanked all the delegations and non-governmental organizations that had 
taken the floor, and stated that it would accept their comments and do whatever it could. It 
once again thanked them for any assistance that they could provide. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mauritania 
</b></p>
<p>681. The review of Mauritania was held on 10 November 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Mauritania in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/1/Corr.1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/3). 
</p><p>682. At its 35th meeting, on 18 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Mauritania (see section C below). 
683. The outcome of the review of Mauritania comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/17), the views of Mauritania 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/16/17/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>684. The head of delegation reaffirmed Mauritania&#8217;s continuing work to protect and 
promote human rights, and emphasized that Mauritania had immediately accepted 88 of 
139 recommendations. Upon return to the capital, recommendations were disseminated and 
consultations held to elaborate a plan of action, including through several workshops 
together with OHCHR and all relevant stakeholders, including the judiciary, the National 
Human Rights Commission and civil society.  </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>203

<p>685. Remaining recommendations related to Mauritania&#8217;s accession to international 
human rights instruments, withdrawal of reservations, combating trafficking in persons and 
discrimination against women, the rights of children and the disabled, and the abolition of 
capital punishment. Mauritania reviewed all pending recommendations and indicated its 
position in the addendum to its report to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>686. Mauritania reiterated its continuous work to abide by all ratified international 
instruments and its readiness to continue positive interaction and to respond to any 
questions on the remaining recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>687. Algeria welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations it had made 
regarding the national human rights institution, the possibility of looking into the abolition 
of capital punishment, all recommendations concerning women&#8217;s rights and raising 
awareness of the role of women in society, as well as alleviating poverty. It noted the 
comprehensive work done at the political level and commended Mauritania for several 
elections that had been held in a fair and transparent manner.  
</p>
<p>688. Saudi Arabia highlighted Mauritania&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations. It 
noted Mauritania&#8217;s cooperation with human rights mechanisms and the international 
community, and welcomed the fact that it strove to ensure the realization of human rights 
for its people despite many difficulties. Saudi Arabia commended the efforts made to 
spread a human rights culture through human rights education and the integration of human 
rights into development strategies, particularly those concerning women and children. It 
supported Mauritania&#8217;s efforts to develop relevant laws and institutions. 
</p>
<p>689. Oman appreciated Mauritania&#8217;s firm cooperation during the universal periodic 
review, as demonstrated by the transparent discussion of the national report during the 
interactive dialogue. It also noted that acceptance of a large number of recommendations 
and their implementation showed Mauritania&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic 
review. 
</p>
<p>690. Senegal noted that Mauritania had accepted many recommendations regarding the 
promotion of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, including three recommendations made by 
Senegal. It welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations concerning the 
eradication of slavery and the fight against trafficking in persons. Senegal highlighted the 
opening of the OHCHR office in Mauritania as reflecting the authorities&#8217; commitment to 
work for human rights. 
</p>
<p>691. Sri Lanka noted that the people of Mauritania had chosen the Islamic, indivisible, 
democratic and social republic as system of government. It welcomed the steps aimed at 
withdrawing Mauritania&#8217;s general reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, and its cooperation with special procedures. It 
commended the 2003 accession to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and welcomed the fact that 
education had been made compulsory for children aged between 6 and 14. Sri Lanka noted 
Mauritania&#8217;s constructive engagement with the universal periodic review and commended 
it for having implemented or for implementing 24 recommendations. 
</p>
<p>692. Bahrain stated that the number of recommendations that Mauritania had accepted 
reflected its readiness to give new impetus to human rights development and cooperation 
with human rights mechanisms. It appreciated Mauritania&#8217;s acceptance and implementation 
of a number of recommendations, including Bahrain&#8217;s recommendation on pursuing efforts 
to advance the situation of women and mainstreaming women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s needs into </p>

</p>
<p>the development process. It welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s political will and its efforts to combat 
unemployment and poverty. 
</p>
<p>693. The United Arab Emirates commended Mauritania for the positive measures, 
implementation of recommendations and for moving to consolidating the rule of law and 
governance. It hoped that Human Rights Council members and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights would assist Mauritania in capacity-building and 
promoting human rights, and requested the international community to provide necessary 
support with regard to the human rights challenges that Mauritania faces as well as in 
realizing the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>694. Qatar welcomed the serious way in which Mauritania had dealt with the universal 
periodic review and its acceptance of a large number of recommendations, including those 
made by Qatar. It noted that Mauritania had accepted all requests for visits from special 
procedures and commended the work undertaken by the Qatari OHCHR office in 
Nouakchott since December 2010. It noted that the High Commissioner would be visiting 
Mauritania, further reflecting Mauritania&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations. It called on 
human rights mechanisms to provide Mauritania with all necessary assistance. 
</p>
<p>695. Morocco commended Mauritania&#8217;s efforts in human development and refugees. It 
congratulated Mauritania on its acceptance of many recommendations despite the 
constraints it faced, including the impact of the international food and financial crisis, and 
noted Mauritania&#8217;s exemplary political determination to improve the human rights 
situation, strengthening democracy and establishing a sound foundation for the rule of law. 
Morocco recalled the importance of assistance from the international community. It 
highlighted the global strategies for good governance and the struggle for financial 
transparency with the creation of a national commission and a high court to charge senior 
officials. It welcomed the efforts made with regard to slavery and the voluntary return of 
refugees and their economic and social integration into society. 
</p>
<p>696. The Sudan appreciated the fact that Mauritania had accepted a number of 
recommendations, as well as Mauritania&#8217;s cooperation with OHCHR and human rights 
mechanisms. It looked positively at the democratic process taking place in Mauritania, its 
multiparty system and the importance given to human rights and their promotion. 
</p>
<p>697. Burkina Faso encouraged Mauritania in its efforts to implement the 
recommendations, especially to ensure children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rights despite the many 
constraints faced. Burkina Faso made an appeal to the international community to provide 
Mauritania with all the assistance necessary to implement its recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>698. Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik was concerned at the persistent violations of 
women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, including gender discriminatory laws, violence against 
women, corporal punishment of children, domestic slavery and rape. Expressing dismay at 
prevailing harmful traditional practices, including early marriage, female genital mutilation 
and force-feeding, it called for a holistic, multisectoral approach. The promotion of gender 
equality and the enhancement of women&#8217;s participation were highlighted, as well as the 
need to make resources available to ensure women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; access to education and 
protection from exclusion and violence. It urged Mauritania to withdraw its reservation to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
criminalize female genital mutilation and force-feeding, and prohibit all forms of violence 
against women. 
</p>
<p>699. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands 
Lacs noted the important measures taken by Mauritania to fight impunity and abuse of 
authority and to strengthen good governance. It welcomed the concrete measures to </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>205 
</b></p>
<p>eradicate slavery and the plan of action to combat human trafficking. It noted the serious 
efforts made at the 2009 presidential elections to ensure political, social, economic and 
cultural rights, and the significant progress made in implementing a rationalized 
institutional framework. It asked the Human Rights Council and the international 
community to continue to support Mauritania through a partnership aiming at implementing 
the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>700. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte africaine des droits 
de l&#8217;homme et des peuples had recently visited Mauritania and commended its 
determination to ensure that human rights and democratic principles were respected. It 
noted the conformity of its legal framework with international principles and the concrete 
measures to ensure the enjoyment of human rights despite the challenges faced by, inter 
alia, eradicating slavery, establishing mandatory primary education, promoting women&#8217;s 
rights and combating violence and discrimination. It also noted Mauritania&#8217;s fight against 
corruption and impunity, the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and the 
attention paid to economic and social rights, the fight against poverty and its commitment 
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>701. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme commended Mauritania 
for its commitment to building a State that respects human rights, while expressing concern 
at rising religious fundamentalism as a threat to stability, democracy and security. It called 
for continuous cooperation with special procedures, and noted that Mauritanian society 
continued to suffer from the psychological legacy of slavery, despite its criminalization. It 
stated that foreign domestic work was a contemporary form of slavery, and encouraged 
Mauritania to update its treaty body reports and increase efforts to eliminate discrimination 
against women, child labour, and forced marriage. It stressed the need for a reliable strategy 
to combat food insecurity, malnutrition and extreme poverty, particularly in Congal, 
Guidimakha and Brakma.  
</p>
<p>702. Amnesty International welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s support for the recommendations to 
end slavery. It expressed concern at the imprisonment of three anti-slavery activists after 
exposing the case of two girls allegedly working as slave servants for a Government 
official; it considered them prisoners of conscience and called for their immediate release. 
It welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s support for the recommendation to conduct independent and 
effective investigations into allegations of torture, and noted the evidence collected on the 
regular use of torture and ill-treatment by security forces. It urged Mauritania to ensure that 
detainees are promptly brought before a judicial authority and to shorten the period of 
police custody, and encouraged Mauritania to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>703. The International Humanist and Ethical Union welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s claim that 24 
recommendations had been or were being implemented. It however noted little progress 
with regard to slavery and slavery-like practices, as many people still faced daily beatings 
and rape. Changing the law or redefining it as a post-slavery phenomenon would not help 
these people without a serious attempt to implement the law and introduce compensation 
for victims. It urged Mauritania to reconsider its refusal to modify penal code provisions on 
the death penalty for homosexuality, and to ensure that capital punishment was not applied 
to consensual same-sex relations between adults. It urged Mauritania to be more proactive 
in educating its society in human rights and its responsibilities under international law.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>704. Mauritania noted that, further to the addendum, which summarized and fully 
explained its position on the remaining recommendations, it had recently transmitted a 
document to OHCHR with further explanation of their acceptance or rejection. Answers 
were grouped. Of the 47 recommendations, the Government had accepted the following:  </p>


<p><b>206</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Withdrawal of the general reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women

(the general reservations regarding these two conventions will be replaced by 
specific reservations) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adoption and implementation of preventive strategies against traditional practices 
harmful to the health of mother and child 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Continuation of efforts regarding education and universal school enrolment for girls 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Future adoption of legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation 
</p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Reforming the status of the Ombudsman by simplifying its invocation and ensuring

</p>
<p>&#8226; Future adoption of specific criminal legislation criminalizing torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Implementation of a national plan of action against human trafficking 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accession in 2010 to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
in 2002, to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On the media, Mauritania adopted a law liberalizing the press and the audio-visual 
industry, and granted a fund to support the press 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mauritania passed a law criminalizing slavery and repressing slavery-like practices 
and proceeded to execute a programme of eradication of the legacy of slavery 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mauritania is prepared to prevent any act of discrimination and stigmatization of 
women and girls victims of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>705. Mauritania rejected the recommendation to abolish the death penalty, but reaffirmed 
its de facto abolitionist position, pointing out that, in 17 years, no death sentence had been 
executed. Mauritania had not yet acceded to the optional protocols relating to the 
Convention against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Government was stepping 
up its efforts primarily to implement the provisions of the three international conventions it 
had already ratified. Furthermore, Mauritania would not withdraw its reservation to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the freedom of belief. 
Mauritania had agreed in the past to all requests for visits by special procedures and 
reaffirmed its readiness to consider any request. 
</p>
<p>706. These additional responses were an integral part of the addendum to its report. 
</p>
<p>707. The delegation stressed the ongoing, considerable efforts to bring legislation into 
line with the international norms that Mauritania had accepted and ratified, as reflected by 
Mauritania&#8217;s determination to incorporate international provisions into national legislation 
to promote the rights and freedoms of Mauritanian citizens. A programme to eradicate 
slavery and mechanisms for the integration of refugees had been established, the latter 
being welcomed by the international community. Moreover, Mauritania agreed to the 
opening of an OHCHR office in Nouakchott, which would play a subregional role and </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>207 
</b></p>
<p>facilitate consolidating case law and the rule of law. It thanked all speakers requesting 
United Nations support for the country. 
</p>
<p>708. On the comments by non-governmental organizations questioning Mauritania&#8217;s 
efforts to combat slavery, reference was being made to a well-known common criminal 
case that had been politicized for obvious reasons. The case that had originated as a 
provocation to the authorities had ended with appropriate measures being taken. On the 
organization&#8217;s claim that the necessary pressure had not been put on the judge to render the 
decision, Mauritania stated that, in an independent justice system, the State cannot force the 
justice system to act in a particular way. 
</p><p>709. With regard to the issue of associations, the law was very clear; it sufficed to comply 
with provisions of the law on associations to be accorded the right to form an association 
and to express freely one&#8217;s opinion in this context.  
</p>
<p>710. The delegation stated that the independent national human rights commission had 
testified at the plenary session that it had visited police stations and detention centres and 
unequivocally established that no practice of torture existed and that considerable efforts 
were being made to end such a practice. The delegation recalled that Mauritania had ratified 
the Convention against Torture in 2004 and was preparing its reports for the Committee. 
</p>
<p>711. Slavery was a structural issue that could not be entirely resolved by the Government, 
which could merely accelerate the social transformation process under way. The delegation 
welcomed the comments by Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme on 
the psychological legacy of slavery, which included poverty, ignorance and other 
psychological dimensions. The issue was not confined to freeing slaves, but concerned their 
living conditions, resources, education and access to health services. Mauritania had 
initiated a programme to address all consequences of slavery.  
</p>
<p>712. On the issues of forced marriage, rape and the status of women, Mauritania had 
ratified all of the human rights instruments on the rights of women and children.  
</p>
<p>713. Concerning three imprisoned anti-slavery activists, on the basis of information 
provided by them, the prefect had instructed police to investigate the alleged case of 
slavery, demonstrating the authorities&#8217; preparedness to implement existing legislation. 
Nonetheless, the activists attacked a police station, injuring a policeman, thereby turning 
this into a case between law enforcement and individuals. The activists had been tried and 
convicted to six months of imprisonment, but were released by presidential amnesty.  
</p>
<p>714. Mauritania recalled that issues pertaining to homosexuality needed to be considered 
in the light of the society concerned. Being an Islamic country and a Muslim society, 
considering its religious and moral values, Mauritania preferred to remain silent on these 
matters. As Muslims and a society subscribing to a number of universally recognized 
values, even raising such questions was deemed an offence. 
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p>715. The review of the United States of America was held on 5 November 2010 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the United States of America in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/1/Corr.1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/2); </p>


<p><b>208</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/USA/3/Rev.1). 
</p><p>716. At its 36th meeting, on 18 March 2011, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the United States of America (see section C below). 
717. The outcome of the review of the United States of America comprises the report of 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/16/11), the views of the 
United States of America concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/16/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>718. The delegation of the United States of America thanked the President of the Human 
Rights Council, the States that had participated in the Working Group, the troika (France, 
Japan and Cameroon), and in particular American civil society. The universal periodic 
review had been a useful tool to assess how the United States could continue to improve in 
achieving its own human rights goals. Civil society was involved in each and every step of 
the universal periodic review, with the participation of representatives of local and national 
organizations as well as hundreds of citizens from communities across the country. Since 
then, federal agencies had held numerous meetings with civil society to discuss the 
response to the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>719. Of the more than 12 federal agencies that had made essential contributions to the 
universal periodic review submission on the United States, the presence of the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice was particularly significant. Reflecting its historic 
role, the Division had played a critical role in all universal periodic review consultations 
and presentations. At the Working Group session, the United States had received a large 
number of recommendations, 228 in all, which have been the object of careful review. 
While the written submission (A/HRC/16/11/Add.1) provided a specific response to each 
recommendation, the delegation wished to discuss 10 broad areas covered by the 
recommendations, and review significant changes that had occurred since the review. 
</p>
<p>720. Firstly, the United States of America supported the recommendations concerning 
civil rights and discrimination, including those made by Ghana, Morocco, Costa Rica, 
Qatar and Indonesia. Members of civil society, and such States as Uruguay, Australia and 
Israel, had asked the United States to do more to address discrimination against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. The Government had taken important recent 
steps in that regard, most notably including the enactment on 22 December 2010 of the 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; repeal act, which would allow gay men and women to serve openly 
in the United States military. In response to the mortgage crisis, the Civil Rights Division 
had established a new fair lending unit, which was addressing a wide range of allegations of 
discriminatory conduct. The Department of Justice had also stepped up its enforcement of 
laws prohibiting discrimination in areas including voting, employment, public 
accommodations and education. The United States also continued to prosecute violations of 
the federal hate crimes law.  
</p>
<p>721. In a second area, criminal justice, as recommended by Sweden, France, Haiti, 
Thailand, Belgium, Algeria and others, the United States continued to work to ensure 
protection of the rights of those accused of committing crimes and held in prisons or jails. 
About 25 countries had made recommendations concerning the administration of capital 
punishment by those Governments within the federal system that still applied it. Domestic 
civil society had also raised capital punishment as an issue of concern. The delegation noted </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>209 
</b></p>
<p>the decision made by the Government of Illinois of 9 March 2011 to abolish that State&#8217;s 
death penalty.  
</p>
<p>722. In a third area, the rights of indigenous peoples, the United States committed itself to 
working with tribal governments to address many issues, including two particular 
recommendations. The first, the importance of tribal consultation, was repeatedly stressed 
during the universal periodic review with tribes and civil society. The second, reflected in 
recommendations from civil society and tribes and echoed by a number of countries, 
including Finland and New Zealand, was that the United States supported the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. At his second White House 
Tribal Nations Conference with tribal leaders from across the United States, held on 16 
December 2010, President Obama had made a statement announcing the support of the 
United States for the Declaration and detailed ongoing work on native American issues.  
</p>
<p>723. Civil society and several countries, including Malaysia, Mexico and Norway, had 
made recommendations concerning national security. In this area, the United States abided 
by all applicable laws, including those laws respecting humane treatment, detention and the 
use of force. The United States did not, and would not, tolerate torture or inhumane 
treatment of detainees in its custody, wherever they are held. Ireland, Switzerland and 
others made recommendations about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. As the White 
House had indicated on 14 March 2011, the President remained committed to closing that 
facility. As this effort continued, the United States was committed to ensuring that all 
practices on Guantanamo fully accorded with international law. On 7 March 2011, the 
President had reaffirmed the basic approach to ensure a lawful, sustainable, and principled 
regime for the handling of detainees at Guantanamo, consistent with the national security 
interests and national values of the United States. The United States would, inter alia, seek 
advice and consent to Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions and would also 
adhere to the humane treatment and fair trial safeguards in article 75 of Additional Protocol 
I, in international armed conflicts, and expected all other nations to adhere to these 
principles as well. Particularly in the context of counter-terrorism, a number of United 
States civil society groups and countries, including Egypt and Algeria, had raised concerns 
regarding discrimination against Muslims. The United States did not support attempts to 
treat entire communities as a threat to national security, based solely on their race, religion 
or ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>724. Regarding immigration, the United States had accepted many recommendations 
from civil society and countries, including Guatemala, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Viet Nam, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The 
contributions of immigrants have been an important element of every chapter of American 
history. In keeping with commitments relating to their status as a party to the Protocol 
relating to the Status of Refugees, the Government was reviewing its handling of emergent 
refugee cases. The Department of Homeland Security had provided 10,000 victims of crime 
and over 9,000 of their immediate family members with the opportunity to work and live 
permanently in the country. Recently, the Department had improved accessibility of care 
for immigration detainees and its procedures for handling, investigating and correcting 
complaints regarding all kinds of civil rights issues.  
</p>
<p>725. In a sixth area, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, civil society and 
countries, including Thailand, Norway, Morocco and Brazil, had recommended that the 
local, State and federal Governments continue to protect the environment. Recent actions 
included the Department of Education&#8217;s announcement in February 2011 of an equity and 
excellence commission to examine disparities in educational opportunities and to address 
the needs of children in distressed communities; grants from the Department of Health and 
Human Services to support health centres and to improve access to health care for the </p>


<p><b>210</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>uninsured; and two recent settlements from the Environmental Protection Agency 
concerning greenhouse gas emissions. 
</p>
<p>726. The delegation stated that the United States had long been a leader in a seventh area 
addressed by the recommendations, namely, workplace protections and the fight against 
human trafficking. In the latter area, the United States supported several recommendations, 
including one made by the Republic of Moldova. The United States Customs and Border 
Protection Agency had launched a media campaign in Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico 
that offered information on the dangers of human trafficking and how to avoid becoming a 
victim. The United States continued to address worker protection in countless ways, 
including through the President&#8217;s Equal Pay Task Force to strengthen responses to wage 
differences between men and women, the Justice and Equality in the Workplace Program, 
and an education campaign focusing on the civil rights of immigrant workers.  
</p>
<p>727. The United States was committed to an eighth goal as well, robust domestic 
implementation of its international human rights obligations, and supported 
recommendations by Egypt, Norway, Austria and Costa Rica. As a party to several human 
rights treaties, the United States was bound to comply with its obligations and to ensure 
effective application at the federal, state and local levels of government.  
</p>
<p>728. The ninth and largest group of recommendations concerned the ratification of 
treaties and other international instruments. Under the United States Constitution, treaty 
ratification required not only Executive Branch approval, but also the advice and consent of 
a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Despite this high threshold, the Administration had 
pushed for positive Senate action on a number of human rights and other treaties that 
afforded humanitarian protection. As noted, on 7 March 2011, the Administration 
announced that the Executive Branch intended to seek, as soon as practicable, Senate 
advice and consent to ratify Additional Protocol II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. This 
responded to the points raised by Germany, the Russian Federation, Cyprus, Austria and 
Hungary.  
</p>
<p>729. As stated in the addendum, the United States did not support recommendations that 
urged particular action in pending judicial cases, which were outside executive branch 
control, nor did it support other inappropriate or politically motivated recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>730. Cuba was concerned that a large number of recommendations had been rejected by 
the United States. The substance of these recommendations was also a source of concern. 
Cuba was disappointed that only one of its 13 recommendations had been accepted. The 
United States had rejected the call to end the blockade against Cuba, which constituted a 
human rights violation against a people. The United States had also rejected the liberation 
of five Cuban political prisoners and the extradition of terrorists under its jurisdiction. Cuba 
called on the United States to review its position.  
</p>
<p>731. The Islamic Republic of Iran regretted that a large number of recommendations, 
including those on the ratification of human rights instruments, had been rejected, and that 
some recommendations had been categorized as &#8220;partially accepted&#8221;. It expressed its 
disappointment at the rejection of the recommendation to refrain from the application of 
unilateral measures against other countries, and stated that the United States should, inter 
alia, close its secret prisons, the Guantanamo Bay prison and stop human rights violations 
by its military forces abroad. 
</p>
<p>732. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) was disappointed by the unwillingness shown 
by the United States to amend the human rights violations reported during the universal 
periodic review. It detailed the rejected recommendations that it had put forward. Of 228 </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>211 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations received, only 40 per cent had been accepted, while the United States had 
presented a yearly report assessing the human rights situation in the world without any 
mandate to do so. It called on the Government of the United States to accept the 
recommendations made by progressive Governments and offered Venezuelan assistance to 
do so.  
</p>
<p>733. Algeria appreciated the review and clarifications of the recommendations received 
provided by the Government of the United States. It detailed the five recommendations it 
had made and was pleased that three of them had been accepted. It regretted that 
recommendation 92.84 had been rejected, and since no position on recommendation 92.129 
had been provided, it invited the delegation to clarify its position in this regard.  
</p>
<p>734. China regretted the fact that the United States had rejected a number of 
recommendations, including those relating to the ratification of core human rights treaties. 
It noted that no thorough investigations of the killing of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan 
had been conducted; Guantanamo Bay prison had not been closed; no measures had been 
taken to curb the extensive use of force by law enforcement agencies; and discrimination 
against minorities persisted. The United States should take effective measures to promote 
and protect human rights, and hold constructive dialogue and cooperate with other countries 
to jointly advance human rights.  
</p><p>735. The Russian Federation noted with appreciation the acceptance of a large number of 
recommendations. It enquired about consideration of the ratification of a number of human 
rights treaties. The Russian Federation regretted the fact that some recommendations 
relating to the ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the introduction of a moratorium on the death penalty and the establishment of an 
independent national human rights institution had been rejected. It urged the United States 
to review its decision and to reintroduce the moratorium on the functioning of special 
tribunals with jurisdiction over the cases of individuals suspected of terrorism and detained 
in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre. 
</p>
<p>736. Egypt welcomed the acceptance by the United States of the recommendations to 
continue to create an enabling environment for religious and cultural tolerance and to adopt 
effective measures to combat racial discrimination and ban racial profiling by police and 
migration officers. It noted that the United States had partially accepted the 
recommendation made by Egypt to, inter alia, address discrimination in law and practice 
against Americans of African, Arab and Muslim origin in the administration of justice. 
Egypt called for the commitment of the United States to investigate and prosecute 
allegations of human rights violations by its military forces in accordance with international 
law and that the results of such an investigation be made public.  
</p>
<p>737. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) regretted the fact that its recommendation on non-
discrimination had only been partially accepted. It was concerned that the United States 
considered that the recommendation to reduce greenhouse emissions to mitigate threats 
against human rights resulting from climate change contained an invalid supposition. It 
referred to the substance of other rejected recommendations, and expressed its belief that 
the position was inconsistent with the international discourse of the United States on human 
rights. It acknowledged the recognition by the United States of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>738. Morocco thanked the delegation of the United States for providing further 
information on the recommendations received and the efforts to comply with the promotion 
and protection of human rights. Morocco appreciated the fact that the United States had 
accepted its recommendations and commended the constructive approach during its 
participation in the universal periodic review. It highlighted the importance of the </p>


<p><b>212</b> GE.11-17059 
</p>
<p>democratic American tradition that had given positive examples in the area of human rights 
protection at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>739. Botswana welcomed the acceptance of a large number of recommendations. It was 
encouraged by the decision of the United States to accept recommendations on the 
possibility of becoming a party to a number of human rights treaties, including the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Botswana also welcomed the decision to engage in 
the Human Rights Council and expected the leadership of the United States in addressing 
key human rights issues, including the fight against racism and the right to development.

<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>740. Human Rights Watch stated that the invitation to the special procedures mandate 
holders to visit Guantanamo Bay should include full access to all detainees in private and in 
all locations within the facilities. It regretted the fact that the United States had rejected the 
recommendations relating to the abolition of the death penalty and on parole for youths 
under the age of 18 who commit murder. Human Rights Watch welcomed the fact that the 
United States had accepted a number of recommendations to improve detention conditions 
and treatment of migrants and combat racial profiling, and its engagement with civil society 
throughout the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>741. The Indian Council of South America referred to its shadow report of the universal 
periodic review of the United States, which noted violations of the American Constitution 
and international obligations with regard to the right to self-determination of Alaska and 
Hawaii and recalled, in this regard, recommendations 92.199 and 92.215. It regretted the 
decision by the United States to accept recommendation 92.96, on the prevention of racial 
bias in the criminal justice system, while rejecting recommendations 92.154 and 92.178, on 
the unjust incarceration of political prisoners and the right to vote of persons deprived of 
their liberty. 
</p>
<p>742. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace acknowledged the 
unprecedented level of civil society engagement throughout the universal periodic review 
of the United States. It referred to several human rights issues and challenges that the 
country faced, including unemployment, the lack of adequate housing, affordable health 
care and education, the high percentage of Afro-American, Latino and Native Americans in 
the prison population, and the inhumane conditions that some prisoners endured in special 
prisons. 
</p>
<p>743. Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples joined others who 
recommended that the United States ratify the international and regional human rights 
instruments to which it was not yet a party. It was concerned by the fact that poverty was 
more prevalent among Afro-American, Latin American and Amerindian populations. These 
same groups made up the majority of the penitentiary population and those sentenced to the 
death penalty. It invited the United States to declare a moratorium on capital punishment. It 
regretted the rejection of the recommendation calling for an end of the blockade against 
Cuba.  
</p>
<p>744. The Iranian Elite Research Center stated that the Government of the United States 
aimed to punish the Islamic Republic of Iran by different means affecting the interests of 
the Iranian people and economy. It stated that civilians, not Governments, always paid the 
price of war and sanctions. It condemned all enemies of human development and all 
Governments that violated the rights of peoples in the name of the war against terrorism.  
</p>
<p>745. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims noted the inequalities in 
minorities&#8217; access to housing, employment, education, health care and the criminal justice 
system. It also noted the high percentage of African American inmates in prisons and the </p>


<p>GE.11-17059 <b>213 
</b></p>
<p>high rate of rape and sexual abuse among native American women. It added that the United 
States had not accepted the right to development as a human right and had not ratified a 
number of core human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>746. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence reiterated its concern at the 
way the United States acted in Guantanamo and with regard to torture allegations. 
Regrettably, the United States had resumed military commissions for detainees at 
Guantanamo, ending a two-year ban. The functions of military tribunals were contrary to 
international norms and standards. It also expressed concern at the American self-
interpretation regarding the meaning and scope of torture. Moreover, the United States had 
rejected recommendations regarding compensation for victims of torture. It requested the 
United States to comply with its obligations under the few international instruments it had 
ratified.  
</p>
<p>747. Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik (S&#252;dwind) stated that, despite the commitment 
expressed to ban the practice of torture and some actions undertaken in this regard, no 
senior State official has been charged. With regard to the Guantanamo detention facility, it 
expressed concern about the institutionalization of indefinite detention and the resumption 
of unfair military commissions. S&#252;dwind recommended that the United States should 
transform the Commission on Civil Rights into a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. It regretted the Government&#8217;s rejection of 
recommendations to end the sentencing of juveniles to life without parole. 
</p><p>748. The Network of Women&#8217;s Non-Governmental Organizations in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran regretted that the Government of the United States had declined some 60 
recommendations; with reference to recommendation 92.141, it condemned war crimes 
against unarmed civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. It demanded that the instigators of these 
crimes be brought to justice. It demanded that the Government put an end to the occupation 
of Iraq and Afghanistan and the violation of human rights in these two countries.  
</p>
<p>749. Action Canada for Population and Development welcomed the acceptance of 
recommendation 92.86 as the first instance of affirmation of sex workers&#8217; rights, and 
expected that the United States would take concrete actions to ensure that no one faced 
discrimination in access to public services based on sexual orientation or their status as a 
person in prostitution. In this respect, it stressed that the Government should involve sex 
workers in policy decisions that affect them. Action Canada for Population and 
Development noted with appreciation the Government&#8217;s engagement and openness with 
civil society throughout the review process.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>750. The delegation stated that the United States had studied each and every one of the 
228 recommendations and tried to give honest and good-faith answers to each. Progress in 
areas of civil rights, criminal justice, indigenous issues, immigration and the environment 
was continuing. The universal periodic review process was an opportunity to shape an 
agenda for future work. Human rights were American core values and interests: without 
engaging in false rhetoric, the United States focused on the substance of a process of 
continuing self-examination and dialogue.
