<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, submits this report to the Human Rights 
Council in accordance with Council resolution 7/22. The report focuses on the human rights 
obligations related to sanitation. After reviewing the inextricable links between sanitation and a 
range of human rights, the independent expert concludes that an analysis of sanitation in a 
human rights context must go beyond linking it to other human rights, because this would fail to 
fully capture all of the dimensions of sanitation. She suggests that, although there is an ongoing 
discussion on whether sanitation should be recognized as a distinct right, recent developments at 
the international, regional and national levels demonstrate a trend towards recognition; 
specifically, considering the right to sanitation as an explicit component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living.  
</p>
<p> While opinions may differ on whether to recognize sanitation as a distinct right, the 
independent expert asserts that there are clear human rights obligations related to sanitation 
because it is inextricably linked to, and indispensable for, the realization of many other human 
rights. She outlines a definition of sanitation in human rights terms, and explains the human 
rights obligations related to sanitation, as well as the content of those obligations. The report 
ends with conclusions and recommendations. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is presented by the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/22, which tasks her with further clarifying &#8220;the content of human rights obligations, 
including non-discrimination obligations, in relation to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation&#8221;. She decided to focus the first year of her mandate on clarifying the human rights 
obligations related to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. From 27 to 28 April 2009, the independent expert organized an expert consultation on the 
human rights obligations related to sanitation, with experts in human rights law and in the area of 
sanitation from all regions of the world. On 29 April, she held a public consultation on the same 
topic which was attended by numerous States, civil society organizations and other actors. The 
perspectives and expertise offered during these meetings were extremely helpful to the 
independent expert in drafting the present report.  
</p>
<p>3. The report examines sanitation in the context of human rights and identifies human rights 
obligations related to sanitation. It begins by highlighting the enormity of the sanitation crisis, 
then briefly examines existing definitions of sanitation, and goes on to explain the 
inextricable links between sanitation and a wide variety of human rights. The report 
subsequently offers a definition of sanitation in human rights terms, explores the scope and 
content of human rights obligations related to sanitation, and finishes with conclusions and 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE SANITATION CRISIS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The current sanitation crisis has dire implications for the lives and livelihoods of billions of 
people around the world, yet it remains one of the most neglected issues at the international and 
national levels. The United Nations estimates that about 2.5 billion people still lack access to 
improved sanitation and 1.2 billion practice open defecation.<b>1</b> An estimated 1.6 million people, 
mostly children under the age of 5, die each year from water and sanitation-related diseases;<b>2</b> 
research suggests that poor sanitation may be linked to as much as a quarter of all under-five 
deaths.<b>3</b>  
</p>
<p>5. Recognizing the fundamental importance of sanitation for human development, the 
Millennium Development Goals aim to halve the proportion of people without access to basic

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sanitation by 2015, but progress even towards this limited target is slow. The Joint Monitoring 
Programme, run by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), estimates that, unless efforts are greatly accelerated, the target on sanitation 
will be missed by over 700 million people.<b>4</b> Even if this target was met, 1.8 billion people would 
still not have access to improved sanitation,<b>5</b> which is an intolerable situation. 2008 was declared 
the International Year of Sanitation, which helped to put sanitation in the spotlight and led to the 
launch of several initiatives to more vigorously address the current crisis. However, despite 
commendable efforts by United Nations agencies and other actors, sanitation remains severely 
underfunded and neglected at all levels.  
</p>
<p>6. In her report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council, the independent expert 
briefly explained that lack of access to sanitation has disastrous consequences for people&#8217;s 
health, education, the economy, gender equality, and overall development.<b>6</b> Lack of access to 
sanitation is overwhelmingly a problem of the poor, with women and children suffering the 
most. In fact, for industrialized nations, ensuring access to sanitation was a turning point in their 
development, having a profound effect on reducing child mortality and improving overall public 
health. In this regard, there is a strong correlation between lack of access to sanitation and a low 
rating on the human development index. Investing in sanitation has a remarkable impact on 
overall poverty reduction, particularly helping to reduce the number of work and school days lost 
due to illness. Recent research estimates that, for every dollar invested in sanitation, there is 
about a nine-dollar benefit in costs averted and productivity gained.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p>7. With such a positive impact, why does the sanitation sector still suffer from such a lack of 
attention? The taboo surrounding sanitation is one of the biggest obstacles it faces. For most 
people, sanitation is a highly private matter and an uncomfortable topic for public discussion. As 
a result of the failure to prioritize sanitation, there is also a lack of effective national policies, 
diverse and fragmented responsibilities for sanitation across government ministries, and a 
general lack of understanding of the positive effects of investing in sanitation. It is important to 
bring this issue to the fore and tackle the taboo that surrounds it. Speaking honestly and openly 
about faeces and defecating may indeed change the lives, and restore a sense of dignity, of 
millions of people.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DEFINITIONS OF SANITATION 
</b></p>
<p>8. Existing definitions of sanitation are an important starting point for understanding the 
human rights aspects of sanitation. Having said this, one of the challenges of examining 
sanitation is its numerous definitions. For example, an English dictionary defines sanitation as 
follows:  
</p>
<p> (a) Formulation and application of measure designed to protect public health;  
</p>
<p> (b) Disposal of sewage.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>9. Other definitions have focused on the process of making something sanitary. For example, 
during the International Year of Sanitation, a definition of sanitation was developed, which 
stated that &#8220;sanitation is the collection, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human 
excreta, domestic waste water and solid waste and associated hygiene promotion&#8221;.<b>9</b> The term 
&#8220;basic sanitation&#8221; is also used, which is defined as the disposal of human excreta to prevent 
disease and safeguard privacy and dignity. <b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>10. Definitions have also been developed for the purpose of monitoring access to sanitation, 
particularly in the context of the Millennium Development Goals. For example, the Joint 
Monitoring Programme uses the term &#8220;improved sanitation&#8221;, referring to types of technology and 
levels of services that are more likely to be sanitary than unimproved technologies.<b>11</b> It considers 
excreta disposal systems as &#8220;adequate&#8221; as long as they are private and separate human excreta 
from human contact.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>11. There are many other technical definitions of sanitation, some of which include a much 
larger concept of a sanitary environment. The wide variety of definitions of sanitation, depending 
on the context in which one is working, is one of the challenges attached to this issue. People and 
institutions often use the same word to mean very different things, sometimes creating 
considerable confusion.  
</p>
<p>12. Understanding sanitation in a human rights context poses an added challenge because 
human rights bring certain principles to the fore and have specific requirements. The following 
sections examine sanitation in the context of human rights and, based on this analysis, a 
definition of sanitation in human rights terms is offered in section VI.

</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS:  SANITATION 
</b></p>
<p>13. Sanitation is an integral part of numerous human rights and has been identified under these 
rights in various treaties, political declarations, national constitutions and legislation, 
international and domestic case law, and expert work. These include the rights to an adequate 
standard of living, adequate housing, health, education, water, work, life, physical security, the 
prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, gender equality, and the prohibition against 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The right to an adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>14. Considering the profound impact that the lack of sanitation has on an individual&#8217;s quality 
of life, sanitation has frequently been understood to be indispensable for achieving an adequate 
standard of living.  
</p>
<p>15. For example, article 14, paragraph 2 (h), of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, addressing the specific situation of rural women, 
provides that States parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure to women &#8220;the right &#8230; 
to enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to &#8230; sanitation &#8230;&#8221;  
16. Article 11, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights provides for &#8220;the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his 
family, including<b> </b> adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of 
living conditions&#8221;. While this article does not include sanitation explicitly, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights clarifies that &#8220;the use of the word &#8216;including&#8217; indicates that 
this catalogue of rights was not intended to be exhaustive&#8221;.<b>13</b> Under this interpretation, other 
essential components of an adequate standard of living, including sanitation, could be understood 
under article 11, paragraph 1. The Committee recently included sanitation in an extended list of 
elements of the right to an adequate standard of living in its general comment No. 19 (2008) on 
the right to social security.<b>14</b> Additionally, in its concluding observations, the Committee has 
addressed the issue of sanitation under the right to an adequate standard of living on numerous 
occasions.<b>15</b> The Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination have also referred to sanitation under the right to an adequate standard of 
living.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>  See E/C.12/GC/19, para. 18. 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  See E/C.12/1/Add.83 (Georgia), para. 31; E/C.12/1/Add.107 (China), para. 59; 
E/C.12/1/Add.104 (Azerbaijan), para. 52; and E/C.12/1/Add.90 (Israel), para. 27.

 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. In political declarations, States have included sanitation in the list of elements of the right 
to an adequate standard of living. For example, the Programme of Action adopted in 1994 at the 
Cairo International Conference on Population and Development provides, in principle 2, as 
follows: &#8220;Human beings &#8230; have the right to an adequate standard of living for themselves and 
their families, including &#8230; sanitation.&#8221;<b>17 </b> 
</p>
<p>18. Principle 11 of the 1996 Habitat Agenda adopted by the Second United Nations 
Conference on Human Settlements contains similar wording.  
</p>
<p>19. United Nations human rights special procedures have also interpreted sanitation as part of 
the right to an adequate standard of living. For example, the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement (1998), drafted by the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons, provide, under principle 18, paragraph 1, that &#8220;all internally 
displaced persons have the right to an adequate standard of living&#8221;, and goes on to state in 
paragraph 2 that &#8220;competent authorities shall provide internally displaced persons with and 
ensure safe access to &#8230; [e]ssential medical services and sanitation&#8221;.<b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  The right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>20. The right to adequate housing has generally been understood to include access to sanitation 
facilities. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine characterizing a habitation as adequate if sanitation 
facilities are not available within the vicinity or are inadequate or unsafe to use. The Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8217; general comment No. 4 (1991) on the right to adequate 
housing stipulates that an &#8220;adequate house must contain certain facilities essential for health, 
security, comfort and nutrition. All beneficiaries of the right to adequate housing should have 
sustainable access to ... sanitation and washing facilities ...&#8221;<b>19</b>. The Committee has also referred 
to sanitation under the right to adequate housing in its recently adopted reporting guidelines.<b>20</b> 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has similarly referred to sanitation under the right to 
housing.<b>21</b>

<p>  See, e.g. CRC/C/MHL/CO/2 (Marshall Islands), para. 59; and CRC/C/KAZ/CO/3 
(Kazakhstan), paras. 55-56. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing has emphasized that &#8220;full 
realization of the right to adequate housing is closely interlinked with and contingent 
upon fulfilment of other rights and services, including access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation&#8221;.<b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>22. At the regional level, the European Committee of Social Rights has consistently held in its 
conclusions on State reports<b>23</b> that, for the purpose of article 31 of the European Social Charter 
guaranteeing the right to housing, &#8220;adequate housing&#8221; is a dwelling which, inter alia, is safe from 
a sanitary and health point of view. The Committee has further explained that this is the case &#8220;if 
it possesses all basic amenities, such as water, heating, waste disposal; sanitation 
facilities; electricity etc.&#8221;. The Committee has also dealt with lack of sanitation under social, 
economic and legal protection for vulnerable families. For instance, in its conclusions 
concerning one State, the Committee noted that &#8220;the housing situation of many Roma 
communities remains serious, since numerous dwellings lack basic facilities, e.g. water, 
sanitation and electricity&#8221;.<b>24</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>23. The links between access to sanitation and health are well documented. WHO estimates 
that 88 per cent of diarrhoeal disease is caused by unsafe water and sanitation,<b>25</b> leading to the 
death of about 1.8 million people annually. Where people have no or limited access to sanitation, 
they can also develop kidney and liver problems, and constipation, as well as 
psychological trauma. Furthermore, if hospitals do not have sex-segregated toilets, women will 
not seek treatment there, both because of the lack of toilets, and the lack of women doctors 
working there. 
</p>
<p>24. International treaties also specifically recognize the link between sanitation and the right 
to health. For example, article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, recognizing the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, provides that States should take steps for &#8220;the 
improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene&#8221;. In addition, in its 
general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explained that the right to health is &#8220;an 
inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying

<p><b>23
</b>  See conclusions on Lithuania (c-2005-en1, sect. 163/165). The Committee applied the same 
</p>
<p>definition in its conclusions on Norway (c-2005-en2, sect. 76/140); France (c-2003-en1, 
sect. 95/163); and Italy (c-2003-en1, sect. 158/163).

 <p> 
</p>
<p>determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation&#8221;.<b>26</b> The 
recently adopted reporting guidelines of that Committee also include sanitation under the right 
to health.<b>27</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly refers to sanitation, 
stating that States shall take appropriate measures &#8220;to ensure that all segments of society, in 
particular parents and children, are informed, have access to education and are supported in the 
use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition ... hygiene and environmental sanitation ...&#8221; 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child further includes sanitation under the right to health in 
its general comment No. 11 (2009) on indigenous children and their rights under the 
Convention,<b>28</b> and general comment No. 7/Rev.1 (2005) on implementing child rights in early 
childhood,<b>29</b> and has also regularly linked sanitation to the right to health in its dialogues with 
States parties.<b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health affirmed that water and sanitation are underlying determinants of health, and 
provided detailed guidance on the implications for the realization of the right to health.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>27. At the regional level, article 39 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004)<b>32</b> recognizes 
&#8220;the right of every member of society to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health &#8230;&#8221; Paragraph 2, outlining measures for implementation of the right, 
provides in subparagraph (f) that this includes &#8220;providing proper sanitation systems&#8221;. The 
Organization of American States has also referred to sanitation in the context of health and 
human rights.<b>33</b>

<p>28. In the European region, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Protocol on 
Water and Health (1999) provides for the protection of human health and well-being, and calls 
upon States parties to &#8220;pursue the aims of &#8230; sanitation for everyone within a framework of 
integrated water-management systems aimed at sustainable use of water resources, ambient 
water quality which does not endanger human health, and protection of water ecosystems&#8221;. <b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>29. At the national level, sanitation has also been linked to the right to health. For example, the 
Constitution of Ecuador links sanitation and the right to health. In Costa Rica, the Constitutional 
Chamber recently held that the inundation of dwellings, due to the overcharge and lack of 
maintenance of the sewerage system, and the discharge of wastewater directly in rivers 
amounted to violations of the constitutional rights to health and to a safe and ecologically 
balanced environment.<b>35</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  The right to education 
</b></p>
<p>30. Lack of access to sanitation can also have serious negative impacts on the enjoyment of the 
right to education. Each year, 443 million school days are lost due to sickness caused by poor 
water and sanitation conditions.<b>36</b> Diseases caused by lack of access to sanitation and drinking 
water also affect students&#8217; ability to learn. Furthermore, where schools do not have sanitation 
facilities, children&#8217;s exposure to disease is exacerbated, and they may not attend school; where 
toilets are not sex-segregated, girls often drop out of school, notably at the age of menstruation.  
</p>
<p>31. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has specifically referred to sanitation in 
educational settings in its general comment No. 4 (2003) on adolescent health and development, 
which states that &#8220;considering the importance of appropriate education for the current and future 
health and development of adolescents, as well as for their children, the Committee urges States 
parties &#8230; to &#8230; provide well-functioning school and recreational facilities which do not pose 
health risks to students<i>, </i>including water and sanitation &#8230;&#8221;<b>37</b> That Committee has also regularly 
linked sanitation to education in its concluding observations.<b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>32. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education has recommended, with 
regard to school sanitation for girls, that States allocate resources to school infrastructure,

<p>specifying &#8220;that infrastructure must be sited within communities and include a drinking water 
supply and separate, private, safe sanitation services for girls&#8221;<b> </b>as well as &#8220;establish efficient 
mechanisms for supplying sanitary towels to adolescent girls who so wish, especially in rural 
areas, and ensure they can always have the use of the sanitation facilities they need&#8221;.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The right to water 
</b></p>
<p>33. Sanitation has also been linked with the right to water, with now-common reference to the 
right to water and sanitation. The connection between water and sanitation is clear: without 
proper sanitation, human excreta contaminate drinking water sources, affecting water quality and 
leading to disastrous health consequences. Water is further linked to sanitation because 
waterborne sewerage systems are common in many parts of the world.  
</p>
<p>34. In its general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights states that &#8220;the water supply for each person must be sufficient and 
continuous for personal and domestic uses. These uses ordinarily include drinking, personal 
sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation, personal and household hygiene&#8221;.<b>40</b> The 
Committee specifies that &#8220;personal sanitation&#8221; means disposal of human excreta and &#8220;personal 
and household hygiene&#8221; means personal cleanliness and hygiene of the household environment. 
General comment No. 15 further notes that &#8220;ensuring that everyone has access to adequate 
sanitation is not only fundamental for human dignity and privacy, but is one of the principal 
mechanisms for protecting the quality of drinking water supplies and resources &#8230; States parties 
have an obligation to progressively extend safe sanitation services, particularly to rural and 
deprived urban areas, taking into account the needs of women and children&#8221;.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>35. While both the Special Rapporteurs on the right to health and on the right to adequate 
housing refer to sanitation in the context of the rights falling under their mandates, they both also 
specifically refer to a &#8220;right to water and sanitation&#8221;.<b>42</b> The Sub-Commission on the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights adopted in 2006 guidelines on the realization of the right to 
drinking water and sanitation, also treating the two issues together. Regarding sanitation, they 
specifically provide that &#8220;everyone has the right to have access to adequate and safe sanitation 
that is conducive to the protection of public health and the environment&#8221;.<b>43 </b>The guidelines 
further specify that sanitation must be physically accessible, culturally acceptable, safe, and 
affordable.

<p>36. At the regional level, the Abuja Declaration, adopted by 45 African and 12 South 
American States at the 1st Africa-South America Summit in 2006, commits to promoting &#8220;the 
right of our citizens to have access to clean and safe water and sanitation within our respective 
jurisdictions&#8221;.<b>44 </b>The &#8220;Message from Beppu&#8221; adopted by 37 States from the wider Asia-Pacific 
region at the 1st Asia-Pacific Water Summit held in Beppu, Japan, in December 2007 recognizes 
&#8220;the people&#8217;s right to safe drinking water and basic sanitation as a basic human right and a 
fundamental aspect of human security&#8221;.<b>45</b> Similarly, the Delhi Declaration, adopted by eight 
South Asian States at the 3rd South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN III) held in 
Delhi, in November 2008 recognizes &#8220;that access to sanitation and safe drinking water is a basic 
right, and according national priority to sanitation is imperative&#8221;.<b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>37. At the national level, the Constitutions of Bolivia and Uruguay recognize the right to water 
and sanitation, as does legislation in Algeria, Paraguay, and South Africa. In Argentina, a court 
ordered a municipality to adopt all necessary measures to improve the functioning of the sewage 
treatment plant and minimize the effects on the environment where untreated wastewater was 
contaminating the drinking water of the community of Chacras de la Merced.<b>47</b>  
</p>
<p><b>F.  The right to work and the right to just and favourable working conditions 
</b>38. The right to work can also be negatively affected by lack of access to sanitation. 
Workplaces which do not provide sanitation facilities, which have prohibitively long waiting 
times for the use of facilities, or where employees are pressured not to interrupt work for toilet 
breaks, may prevent employees from keeping their jobs, or raise serious concerns about their 
right to work in safe and healthy working conditions. Women are particularly affected, especially 
during menstruation and pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>39. In its general comment No. 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights specifies that, with regard to the right to 
healthy natural and workplace environments, &#8220;&#8216;the improvement of all aspects of environmental 
and industrial hygiene&#8217; (art. 12.2 (b)) comprises, inter alia &#8230; the requirement to ensure an 
adequate supply of safe and potable water and basic sanitation &#8230; [and it embraces] safe and 
hygienic working conditions&#8221;.<b>48</b>

</p>
<p>40. The International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Hygiene in 
Commerce and Offices provides in article 13 that &#8220;sufficient and suitable washing facilities and 
sanitary conveniences shall be provided and properly maintained&#8221;.<b>49</b> The ILO Recommendation 
concerning Hygiene in Commerce and Offices provides further detailed guidance on sanitation 
in the workplace,<b>50</b> and the ILO Recommendation concerning the Protection of the Health of 
Workers in Places of Employment specifically refers to sanitation, explaining that &#8220;measures 
should be taken by the employer to ensure that the general conditions prevailing in places of 
employment are such as to provide adequate protection of the health of the workers concerned 
[including] sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences and washing facilities &#8230; provided in 
suitable places and properly maintained&#8221;.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  The right to life 
</b></p>
<p>41. Considering the potentially fatal impact of poor sanitation on people&#8217;s health, some assert 
that it is integrally linked to the right to life. In its general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to 
life, the Human Rights Committee stated that the right to life should not be interpreted in a 
restrictive manner. In this context, it said that &#8220;the Committee considers that it would be 
desirable for States parties to take all possible measures to reduce infant mortality and to increase 
life expectancy, especially in adopting measures to eliminate malnutrition and epidemics&#8221;.<b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>42. At the regional level, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has interpreted the 
meaning of article 4 (the right to life) and article 5 (the right to humane treatment) of the 
American Convention on Human Rights<b>53 </b>to encompass the right to harbour a project of life, 
addressing essential elements of, inter alia, the rights to education, food, adequate housing, 
health and sanitation.<b>54</b> The Indian judicial system has taken a similarly broad approach to 
interpreting the right to life, and has made specific links with sanitation in this regard.<b>55</b> <b>

</p>
<p><b>H.  The right to physical security 
</b></p>
<p>43. For many people, the simple act of &#8220;relieving oneself&#8221; is a risky affair. Women and girls 
especially are vulnerable to attack when they must walk a long way to access sanitation facilities 
or when they are forced to defecate in the open. In addition, women without access to sanitation 
often defecate under the cover of darkness in order to ensure a minimum of privacy, but at 
considerable risk to their physical security.  
</p>
<p>44. Protection of physical integrity is at the core of human rights, and must also be taken into 
account when considering sanitation. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
protects the right to security of person,<b>56</b> and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination Against Women argues that violence against women, in the absence of due 
diligence on the part of the State, is a form of discrimination based on sex and is thus a violation 
of human rights, including violence committed by private actors.<b>57</b> The Convention on the Rights 
of the Child also provides that States must protect children from all forms of violence.<b>58</b> In the 
World Report on Violence against Children, it was specified that &#8220;in locations such as shanty 
towns and refugee camps, particular emphasis [must be] placed on creating safe routes to 
communal water collection, and to bathing and toilet facilities&#8221;.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p>45. The lack of access to sanitation can also be tantamount to inhuman or degrading treatment 
in certain circumstances, especially in the context of detention. In a 2005 report focused on 
water, sanitation, hygiene and habitat in prisons, the International Committee of the Red Cross 
highlighted that &#8220;waste water and refuse disposal is often the most intractable sanitation problem 
in places of detention. A large proportion of the diseases observed among the inmates of such 
establishments is transmitted by the faecal-oral route&#8221;.<b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>46. The Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have regularly 
expressed concern about unsatisfactory conditions of detention, including poor sanitation, in 
their concluding observations.<b>61</b> The Special Rapporteur on torture has expressed concern about 
sanitation in his country missions,<b>62</b> as has the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.<b>63</b>

<p>47. Furthermore, paragraph 15 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners 
of 1955<b>64</b> provides that &#8220;prisoners shall be required to keep their persons clean, and to this end 
they shall be provided with water and with such toilet articles as are necessary for health and 
cleanliness&#8221;. The United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty 
of 1990 also refer to &#8220;sanitary installations&#8221;, specifying that they &#8220;should be so located and of a 
sufficient standard to enable every juvenile to comply, as required, with their physical needs in 
privacy and in a clean and decent manner&#8221;.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>48. At the regional level, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has heard several 
cases involving the State duty to ensure general conditions of health, hygiene and sanitation in 
prison or custodial facilities.<b>66</b> In Europe, in the case of <i>Melnik v. Ukraine</i>,<b>67</b> the European Court 
of Human Rights found that the overcrowding of prison cells, inadequate medical care and 
unsatisfactory conditions of hygiene and sanitation, taken together with the duration of detention, 
amounted to degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p>49. At the national level, a court in Fiji found lack of access to adequate sanitation in prisons to 
amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, finding a breach not only of the Fijian 
Constitution, but also of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.<b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>50. International humanitarian law also particularly refers to access to sanitation for 
detainees.<b>69</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Equality of women and men 
</b></p>
<p>51. The disproportionate impact of lack of access to sanitation on girls and women has been 
well researched. Girls often drop out of school when their menstruation begins since schools 
frequently lack &#8220;girls only&#8221; or otherwise appropriate sanitation facilities. When relatives become 
sick from sanitation-related diseases, women and girls often stay home to care for them, missing 
work and school. Furthermore, women and girls face security risks when they are forced to 
relieve themselves or to defecate in the open, or walk to toilets in the dark. Because of 
widespread discrimination against women, they are not included in the formulation of relevant 
policies and, therefore, their needs tend to be neglected.  
</p>
<p>52. Most core human rights articles prohibit discrimination based on sex. Thus, all rights 
related to sanitation must be guaranteed without discrimination based on sex. As already 
mentioned above, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women specifically refers to sanitation with regard to rural women and the Committee 
overseeing that treaty has regularly addressed the issue of sanitation in its concluding 
observations.<b>70 </b>The Special Rapporteurs on torture and on the right to education have also 
specifically referred to the sanitary needs of menstruating women.<b>71</b>  
</p>
<p><b>K.  Prohibition of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>53. More broadly, discrimination and exclusion play a significant role with regard to access to 
sanitation. It is often the poorest and the most marginalized groups who lack access to sanitation. 
According to UNDP, the majority of people without access to sanitation live on less 
than 2 United States dollars a day.<b>72</b> Minority groups, migrants, indigenous peoples, refugees and 
internally displaced persons (IDPs), prisoners and detainees, and persons with disabilities also 
suffer discrimination which may affect their access to sanitation. Sanitation workers face 
particular stigmatization for having a job which is perceived as &#8220;unclean&#8221; or lowly. Such groups 
often have little influence on policy formulation and resource allocation at the national and local 
levels, making it difficult for them to improve their access to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>54. The International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in their articles 2, both provide that the rights contained in those Covenants 
should be enjoyed without discrimination. Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
     
</p>
<p><b>69 
</b> See for example, article 85 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
</p>
<p>Persons in Time of War, 1949, 75 UNTS 287. Adopted on 12 August 1949 and entered into 
force on 21 October 1950.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Political Rights further provides for equal protection under the law, including &#8220;effective 
protection against discrimination&#8221;. The treaty bodies have raised the issue of sanitation in the 
context of discussions on discriminatory treatment in their dialogues with States parties. For 
example, they have expressed concern about sanitation for Roma people,<b>73</b> Dalits,<b>74 </b>refugees and 
asylum-seekers,<b>75</b> indigenous peoples,<b>76 </b>religious minorities,<b>77</b> and migrants.<b>78</b> The Special 
Rapporteur on torture has also specifically addressed sanitation with regard to persons with 
disabilities.<b>79 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  SANITATION AS A DISTINCT RIGHT 
</b></p>
<p>55. The above analysis demonstrates that access to sanitation is indispensable, and has been 
recognized as such under international law, both by States and experts, for the enjoyment of 
numerous human rights.<b>80</b> However, it does not provide a complete picture of the human rights 
dimensions of sanitation. Sanitation is not just about health, housing, education, work, gender 
equality, and the ability to survive. Sanitation, more than many other human rights issue, evokes 
the concept of human dignity; consider the vulnerability and shame that so many people 
experience every day when, again, they are forced to defecate in the open, in a bucket or a plastic 
bag. It is the indignity of this situation that causes the embarrassment. The Supreme Court of 
India eloquently described the indignity of lack of access to sanitation where the Court found 
that the failure of the municipality to provide basic public conveniences was driving &#8220;the 
miserable slum-dwellers to ease in the streets, on the sly for a time, and openly thereafter, 
because under Nature&#8217;s pressure, bashfulness becomes a luxury and dignity a difficult art&#8221;.<b>81</b> It is 
such infringements on the very core of human dignity that are not wholly captured by 
considering sanitation only as it relates to other human rights.

<p>56. The notion of dignity permeates all modern human rights instruments. The preambles to 
the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political 
Rights explicitly recognize that all human rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human 
person. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes several references to human 
dignity, including article 22, which states that &#8220;everyone &#8230; is entitled to realization &#8230; of the 
economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity &#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>57. Dignity relates to the intrinsic worth of each human being, which should be recognized and 
respected by others. There are certain fundamental conditions upon which we insist to have a 
&#8220;minimum definition of what it means to be human in any morally tolerable form of society&#8221;.<b>82</b> It 
can be argued that &#8220;degrading living conditions and deprivation of basic needs&#8221; fall below this 
minimum definition.<b>83 </b>Dignity closely relates to self-respect, which is difficult to maintain when 
being forced to squat down in the open, with no respect for privacy, not having the opportunity 
to clean oneself after defecating and facing the constant threat of assault in such a vulnerable 
moment. Therefore, the independent expert believes that lack of access to sanitation constitutes 
demeaning living conditions; it is an affront to the intrinsic worth of the human being and should 
not be tolerated in any society. 
</p>
<p>58. One might argue that, because dignity pervades the issue of sanitation and sanitation 
cannot be entirely subsumed into any other existing human right, it should be considered a 
distinct human right. While it has been warned that a proliferation of rights runs the risk of 
undermining existing human rights, standards must be adapted to address new (or only recently 
recognized) threats to the human person. The General Assembly in its resolution 41/120 stated 
that standard-setting activities in the field of human rights should relate to standards that are, 
inter alia, &#8220;of fundamental character and derive from the inherent dignity and worth of the 
human person&#8221; and &#8220;[are] sufficiently precise to give rise to identifiable and practicable rights 
and obligations&#8221;.<b>84</b> Due to the essential importance of sanitation for maintaining a life with 
human dignity, it could be argued that it is as important as other explicit components of the right 
to an adequate standard of living, such as food, clothing and housing, and could be implied under 
that right. The independent expert has found considerable precedents - both in international 
political declarations as well as in the work of United Nations human rights mechanisms - for 
this position.<b>85</b>

<p>  At the national level, Bolivia and Uruguay have included a right to sanitation in their

 <p> 
</p>
<p>59. After evaluating the current state of international law as well as evolving practice at the 
national and regional levels, the independent expert notes, at this point, that there is an ongoing 
discussion about sanitation as a distinct right. She sees that there is momentum behind this issue, 
and recent developments in human rights law concerning sanitation suggest a trend towards 
recognition of such a distinct right. Convinced that there are unique aspects to sanitation that 
evoke the inherent dignity of all human beings and which make it impossible to address 
satisfactorily through other human rights, the independent expert supports and encourages 
developments in line with this trend. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SANITATION 
</b></p>
<p>60. Whether one accepts arguments that sanitation should be considered as a distinct human 
right, it is indisputable that there are human rights obligations related to access to sanitation, 
because sanitation is inextricably linked to the enjoyment of so many other human rights.<b>86</b> 
61. The human rights obligations related to sanitation described in this section are based on the 
preceding legal analysis of the status of sanitation under international law. The independent 
expert has identified these human rights obligations specifically to highlight how human rights 
obligations apply in the context of sanitation. However, the roots of these obligations lie in 
well-recognized human rights obligations associated with the rights outlined above, which 
cannot be fully realized without specific attention to sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Defining sanitation in human rights terms 
</b></p>
<p>62. Understanding the human rights obligations related to sanitation requires a working 
definition of sanitation in human rights terms. This definition is drawn from elements related to 
sanitation as addressed under international human rights law. The independent expert considers 
that this definition may evolve as the understanding of the human rights obligations related to 
sanitation continues to develop. 
</p>
<p>63. The independent expert is of the view that sanitation can be defined as a system for the 
collection, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta and associated hygiene.<b>87</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>86
</b>  A/HRC/RES/7/22 emphasizes &#8220;that international human rights law instruments, including the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child entail obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation&#8221;. 
<b>87
</b></p>
<p>  The independent expert considers that domestic wastewater, which flows from toilets, sinks 
and showers, is included in this description of sanitation insofar as water regularly contains 
human excreta and the by-products of the associated hygiene. The independent expert further 
recognizes that, in some places, existing solutions for human excreta management make it 
inseparable from solid waste management. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>States must ensure without discrimination that everyone has physical and economic access to 
sanitation, in all spheres of life,<b>88</b> which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally 
acceptable, provides privacy and ensures dignity. 
</p>
<p>64. States are obliged to respect, protect and fulfil human rights as they relate to sanitation. 
More concretely, States must, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Refrain from measures which threaten or deny individuals or communities existing 
access to sanitation. States must also ensure that the management of human excreta does 
not negatively impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that non-State actors<b>89</b> act in accordance with human rights obligations related to 
sanitation, including through the adoption of legislative and other measures to prevent 
the negative impact of non-State actors on the enjoyment of sanitation. When sanitation 
services are operated by a private provider, the State must establish an effective 
regulatory framework. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Take steps, applying the maximum of available resources, to the progressive realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights as they relate to sanitation. States must move as 
expeditiously and effectively as possible towards ensuring access to safe, affordable and 
acceptable sanitation for all, which provides privacy and dignity. This requires 
deliberate, concrete and targeted steps towards full realization, in particular with a view 
to creating an enabling environment for people to realize their rights related to 
sanitation. Hygiene promotion and education is a critical part of this obligation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Carefully consider and justify any retrogressive measures related to the human rights 
obligations regarding sanitation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Take the necessary measures directed towards the full realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights as they relate to sanitation, inter alia, by according sufficient 
recognition of human rights obligations related to sanitation in the national political and 
legal systems, and by immediately developing and adopting a national sanitation 
strategy and plan of action. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide effective judicial or other appropriate remedies at both the national and 
international levels in cases of violations of human rights obligations related to 
sanitation. Victims of violations should be entitled to adequate reparation, including 
restitution, compensation, satisfaction and/or guarantees of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>88
</b>  Including, inter alia, the home, public buildings and places, the workplace, schools, hospitals, 
</p>
<p>refugee and IDP camps, prisons and detention centres. 
<b>89
</b></p>
<p>  Including private individuals, private enterprises, civil society organizations, and any other 
entity which is not an agent of the State. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. States must realize their human rights obligations related to sanitation in a 
non-discriminatory manner. They are obliged to pay special attention to groups particularly 
vulnerable to exclusion and discrimination in relation to sanitation, including people living in 
poverty, sanitation workers, women, children, elderly persons, people with disabilities, people 
affected by health conditions, refugees and IDPs, and minority groups, among others. Priority 
should be given to meeting the needs of these groups and, where necessary, positive measures 
should be adopted to redress existing discrimination and to ensure their access to sanitation. 
States are obliged to eliminate both de jure and de facto discrimination on grounds of race, 
colour, sex, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth, physical or mental disability, health status, or any other civil, political, social or other 
status. 
</p>
<p>66. States are also obliged to ensure that concerned individuals and communities are informed 
and have access to information about sanitation and hygiene and are enabled to participate in all 
processes related to the planning, construction, maintenance and monitoring of sanitation 
services. Full participation, including representatives of all concerned groups is key to ensuring 
that sanitation solutions answer the actual needs of communities and are affordable, technically 
feasible, and culturally acceptable. Participation is also crucial for achieving community 
ownership and dedication in order to bring about the required behavioural changes. All people 
must have full and equal access to information concerning sanitation and its effect on their health 
and environment. Information should be made available through various media and should be 
translated in all relevant languages and dialects to ensure the greatest possible circulation. 
</p>
<p>67. It is important to state clearly what is not required when considering sanitation in human 
rights terms: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States are not obliged to provide everyone with access to a sewerage system. Human 
rights law does not aim to dictate specific technology options, but instead calls for 
context-specific solutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States are not obliged to provide individual facilities in every home. This will also 
depend on the context - sometimes a safe and otherwise adequate facility in the close 
proximity would suffice as an intermediate step towards full realization of related rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States are not obliged to construct toilets, rather they must create an enabling 
environment. In fact, it is often argued that demand-led sanitation projects enjoy 
considerable success. Only in certain conditions, such as extreme poverty or natural 
disasters, when people, for reasons beyond their control, are genuinely unable to access 
sanitation through their own means, is the State obliged to actually provide sanitation 
services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States are not obliged to provide sanitation free of charge - those who are in a position 
to pay must contribute financially or in kind, for example by offering labour for the 
construction of sanitation systems. Only when people are genuinely unable to pay for 
sanitation is the State obliged to provide sanitation services free of charge. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States may decide to privatize sanitation services, but in that case must ensure - through 
adequate regulation, including effective and accessible complaints procedures - that 
private actors do not adopt approaches which result in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States are not required to ensure the full implementation of their human rights 
obligations related to sanitation immediately. Rather, they must show that they are 
taking steps to the maximum of their available resources to ensure at least minimum 
essential levels of sanitation for all people, and they must ensure that they are not 
discriminating against certain groups in providing access. 
</p>
<p>68. Among professionals working on sanitation, it is commonly said that &#8220;with rights come 
responsibilities&#8221;, which alludes to the importance of individual behavioural change in ensuring 
the success of sanitation interventions. The State bears the primary human rights obligations 
related to sanitation and is under an obligation to ensure that non-State actors, including 
individuals, do not jeopardize the enjoyment of any human rights. Where the State is complying 
with its duties to ensure access to sanitation facilities which are safe, hygienic, secure, socially 
and culturally acceptable, provide privacy and ensure dignity in a non-discriminatory manner, 
individuals have a responsibility to use such facilities. The State has a crucial role to play, and is 
obliged under human rights law, to sensitize the population about the benefits of good sanitation 
and hygiene. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Content of human rights obligations related to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>69. In considering the content of human rights obligations, it is important to approach this 
framework with a degree of flexibility, recognizing that some elements may be understood under 
multiple categories depending on the perspective of the reader. In practice, the classification is of 
little importance. For example, whether we understand prohibitive waiting times for use of 
sanitation facilities as an issue of accessibility, or one of availability, does not change the fact 
that States must ensure that excessive waiting times are avoided. Furthermore, this elaboration of 
the content of human rights obligations related to sanitation is intended to offer some examples, 
not an exhaustive list.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Availability 
</b></p>
<p>70. There must be a sufficient number of sanitation facilities (with associated services) within, 
or in the immediate vicinity, of each household, health or educational institution, public 
institutions and places, and the workplace. There must be a sufficient number of sanitation 
facilities to ensure that waiting times are not unreasonably long. 
</p>
<p>71. Although it is tempting to determine a specific minimum number of toilets needed to meet 
the requirement of availability, such determinations can be counterproductive in human rights 
terms. It is crucial that the assessment of the sanitation requirements of any community is 
informed by the context, as well as the characteristics of particular groups which may have 
different sanitation needs. In this regard, participation is a vital aspect of meeting human rights 
obligations related to sanitation, as referred to above. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Quality 
</b>72. Sanitation facilities must be hygienically safe to use, which means that they must 
effectively prevent human, animal and insect contact with human excreta. Sanitation facilities 
must further ensure access to safe water for hand washing as well as menstrual hygiene, and anal 
and genital cleansing, as well as mechanisms for the hygienic disposal of menstrual products. 
Regular cleaning, emptying of pits or other places that collect human excreta, and maintenance 
are essential for ensuring the sustainability of sanitation facilities and continued access. 
</p>
<p>73. Sanitation facilities must also be technically safe to use, which means that the 
superstructure is stable and the floor is designed in a way that reduces the risk of accidents 
(e.g. by slipping). People must be enabled to use them safely at night, whether through lighted 
paths, flashlights, or other measures. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to the safety 
needs of persons with disabilities, as well as the safety needs of children. Maintenance is crucial 
to guarantee technical safety. 
</p>
<p>74. Ensuring safe sanitation requires adequate hygiene promotion and education to encourage 
individuals to use toilets in a hygienic manner that respects the safety of others. Manual 
emptying of pit latrines is considered to be unsafe (as well as culturally unacceptable in many 
places, leading to stigmatization of those burdened with this task), meaning that mechanized 
alternatives that effectively prevent direct contact with human excreta should be used. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Physical accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>75. Sanitation facilities must be physically accessible for everyone within, or in the immediate 
vicinity of, each household, health or educational institution, public institutions and places, and 
the workplace. Physical accessibility must be reliable, including access at all times of day and 
night. The location of sanitation facilities must ensure minimal risks to the physical security of 
users. This has particular implications for the path leading to the facility, which should be safe 
and convenient for all users, including older people and persons with disabilities and it must be 
maintained in this state. Moreover, sanitation facilities should be constructed in a way that 
minimizes the risk of attack from animals or people, particularly for women and children. 
</p>
<p>76. Sanitation facilities should be designed in a way that enables all users to physically access 
them, including, especially, those with special access needs, such as children, persons with 
disabilities, elderly persons, pregnant women, parents accompanying children, chronically ill 
people and those accompanying them. Considering the needs of these groups would have 
implications for the entrance size, the interior space, hand rails or other support mechanisms, the 
position of defecation, as well as other aspects. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>77. Access to sanitation facilities and services, including construction, emptying and 
maintenance of facilities, as well as treatment and disposal of faecal matter, must be available at 
a price that is affordable for all people without limiting their capacity to acquire other basic 
goods and services, including water, food, housing, health and education guaranteed by other 
human rights. Water disconnections resulting from an inability to pay also impact on waterborne 
sanitation, and this must be taken into consideration before disconnecting the water supply. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>78. Various systems and structures can be put in place to ensure affordability, including 
income support measures, and measures that aim to reduce the cost of sanitation services. One 
option might be subsidy schemes to ensure affordability. Governments could also consider 
setting targets which represent a percentage of the household income. Experience suggests that 
in-kind contributions (such as labour) are also effective in sanitation projects. Technology choice 
can also have an impact on affordability (as well as sustainability). Human rights do not dictate 
which policy is best, but insist on a context-specific consideration of the situation. 
</p>
<p>79. Concerning the cost of sanitation, there may be differences depending on the area. For 
example, in urban areas, a connection to the sewerage system will almost always be the cheapest 
and most convenient option for the user. However, as with water connections, the price of a 
connection to the sewerage system will often be prohibitive for users living in poverty, and 
governments should develop policies to address this. In remote areas, where sewerage is 
normally not available, on-site sanitation is likely to be the preferable option. This may require 
subsidies for construction, emptying of receptacles for the collection of human waste, and 
associated maintenance. Assistance should also be provided to families who are unable to afford 
soap and cleaning products, or sanitary products for women. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Acceptability 
</b></p>
<p>80. Sanitation facilities and services must be culturally acceptable. Personal sanitation is still a 
highly sensitive issue across regions and cultures and differing perspectives about which 
sanitation solutions are acceptable must be taken into account regarding design, positioning and 
conditions for use of sanitation facilities. In many cultures, to be acceptable, construction of 
toilets will need to ensure privacy. In most cultures, acceptability will require separate facilities 
for women and men in public places, and for girls and boys in schools. Women&#8217;s toilets need to 
accommodate menstruation needs. Facilities will need to allow for culturally acceptable hygiene 
practices, such as hand washing and anal and genital cleansing. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>International human rights law entails clear human rights obligations related to 
access to sanitation. The inextricable links between sanitation and so many human rights 
mean that international human rights law requires States to ensure access to sanitation 
that is safe, hygienic, secure, affordable, socially and culturally acceptable, provides 
privacy and ensures dignity in a non-discriminatory manner. However, only looking at 
sanitation through the lens of other human rights does not do justice to its special nature, 
and its importance for living a dignified life. In this regard, although the discussion about 
recognition of a distinct right to sanitation is ongoing, the independent expert supports the 
current trend of recognizing sanitation as a distinct right. In line with these conclusions, 
the independent expert offers the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Legal recognition and respect: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States are encouraged to support legal and political developments at all levels 
towards broader recognition of sanitation as a distinct human right </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States must abide by their human rights obligations related to sanitation at 
all times, including in emergency situations, in disaster response and during 
conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Information gathering: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should collect current, accurate and detailed information about 
sanitation coverage in the country and the characteristics of unserved and 
underserved households. Disaggregated data is necessary to determine which 
groups are particularly disadvantaged. This information should be made 
public and inform the design of policies for the sector and the allocation of 
budgets. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Plans, policies and responsibilities: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States must adopt a national action plan on sanitation, endorsed at the 
highest levels, which duly reflects the State&#8217;s human rights obligations 
related to sanitation, ensuring participation of all concerned individuals, 
communities and groups. States should promote the participation 
of national human rights institutions and sanitation experts in these 
endeavours 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should assign clear institutional responsibilities for sanitation at all 
levels and avoid fragmentation. Where responsibilities are assigned to 
different ministries, departments or institutions, all efforts should be made to 
ensure adequate coordination 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should adopt appropriate policies to expand access to unserved and 
underserved areas, taking an integrated approach that addresses the 
underlying structural reasons for discrimination in access to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should include sanitation in their national poverty-reduction strategies 
and development plans 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) National budgets: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The vital importance of sanitation should be reflected in national and 
subnational budgets, as well as in budgets for international assistance and 
cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) International assistance and cooperation: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Development agencies should prioritize interventions in the sanitation sector 
and put the human rights obligations related to sanitation at the core of their 
projects. They should apply a human rights-based approach to sanitation, 
meaning that every intervention in the sanitation sector should comply with 
the human rights principles of non-discrimination, participation, and 
accountability, and should be aimed at the fulfilment of the relevant human </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>rights obligations related to sanitation. They should also empower local 
authorities and communities to comply with human rights obligations related 
to sanitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) International organizations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>United Nations agencies, funds and programmes as well as international 
financial institutions should prioritize interventions on sanitation and put the 
human rights obligations related to sanitation at the centre of their projects 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>At the national level, United Nations country teams should support 
governments in the preparation of national sanitation action plans, the 
revision of legislation, and other activities aimed at the fulfilment of their 
human rights obligations related to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Private sector: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The private sector, including members of the CEO Water Mandate of the 
United Nations Global Compact, should respect and support the realization 
of human rights related to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Non-discrimination and gender equality: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Legislation, policies, plans and programmes should aim to eliminate 
inequalities based on wealth, sex and location as well as other grounds. 
Measures to enhance access to sanitation must give particular attention to 
disadvantaged groups and individuals, such as the poor, as well as those 
living in remote areas and urban informal settlements, irrespective of their 
tenure status. Targeted measures should be taken to ensure affordability of 
sanitation services. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States and non-State actors should adopt a gender-sensitive approach to all 
relevant policymaking given the special sanitation needs of women and the 
key role they often play in managing sanitation and hygiene in communities. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States are encouraged to recognize the crucial role of sanitation workers and 
to take measures to raise the profile of their work and ensure their 
occupational health, safety and dignity. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Awareness-raising and community mobilization: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Large-scale public awareness campaigns should be organized both at the 
national as well as at the international level, aimed at promoting behavioural 
change regarding sanitation and to provide information, in particular on 
hygiene promotion. The independent expert believes that it is high time for 
vigorous and sustained efforts to tackle the persisting taboos around 
sanitation and personal hygiene </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States and other relevant actors should provide funding to support 
community mobilization and organization for actions towards the realization 
of the human rights obligations related to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Monitoring and accountability: 
</b>&#8226; <b>States and other relevant actors should monitor changes over time to gauge 
</b></p>
<p><b>the effectiveness of interventions and the impact of policy reforms and 
investments at the national and subnational levels 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should establish effective, transparent and accessible monitoring and 
accountability mechanisms, with power to monitor and hold accountable all 
relevant public and private actors 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should include information on the fulfilment of their human rights 
obligations related to sanitation in their national reports to relevant treaty 
monitoring bodies 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Relevant treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures should address the 
human rights obligations related to sanitation where relevant in their 
activities
