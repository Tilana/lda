<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 20 to 28 July 2010, the independent expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation conducted an official 
mission to Japan in order to assess the manner in which the Government was ensuring the 
enjoyment of the rights to water and to sanitation. She had meetings with representatives of 
Government ministries responsible for topics falling within her mandate, including the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Health, Labour and Welfare; Land, Infrastructure, Transport 
and Tourism; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; the Environment; and Justice. She was 
honoured to meet with the Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. The 
independent expert also met with representatives of the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA), as well as prefectural and city authorities in Osaka. Visits were made to the 
Misono Water Purification Plant and the Ochiai Water Reclamation Center in Tokyo. She 
held numerous meetings with civil society groups in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, and visited 
homeless communities in Osaka and Tokyo, as well as the Utoro community outside 
Kyoto. The special procedures mandate holder expresses her appreciation to the 
Government for organizing and facilitating the visit. She is also particularly grateful to the 
civil society organizations and individuals who helped to prepare the mission and who 
assisted during it. Through all of the meetings, she gained a more complete picture of the 
status of access to water and sanitation in Japan, and of the role Japan plays in ensuring 
access to water and sanitation in other countries through its international development aid.  
</p>
<p>2. Overall, the independent expert was impressed at the levels of access to water and 
sanitation. She was pleased to observe that the large majority of people in Japan enjoy the 
rights to water and to sanitation. However, the mandate holder expresses concern about the 
lack of access for certain groups, as well as in certain spheres of life. Furthermore, she 
examines the extent to which Japan, the largest bilateral donor in the sectors of water and 
sanitation, has integrated the human rights to water and to sanitation into its development 
cooperation policy. As further detailed in this report, she considers that a more explicit 
focus on the human rights to water and to sanitation would require special attention to 
excluded groups in Japan, and a shift in policy regarding official development cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights legal framework and institutional structure 
</b></p>
<p>3. Japan has ratified most of the core international human rights treaties, with the 
exception of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. Japan has not recognized the competence of the treaty bodies to receive 
individual complaints of human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>4. Concerning the direct application of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, two recent decisions from the Osaka District Court and Osaka High 
Court respectively found that article 2 of the Covenant, concerning non-discrimination, is 
directly applicable in a case concerning the exclusion of Korean residents in Japan from the 
National Pension Law.1 The direct applicability of the Covenant in national law is a 
positive development which could be further promoted. However, courts have also 
questioned the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights.2 For instance, a

</p>
<p>the 18th International Congress on Comparative Law, Washington D.C., 2010, p. 13 (citing Hanrei 
Jiho, vol. 1898, p. 75).

</p>
<p>decision of the Tokyo District Court in 1996 found that going to the courts to claim one&#8217;s 
right to social security &#8220;is an unexpected course of action, or even an option excluded from 
the outset by the Covenant itself&#8221;.3 The rights enshrined in the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights can be guaranteed through direct application of the 
Covenant or by adopting legislation and policies that result in the same levels of protection. 
In either case, ensuring full respect for economic, social and cultural rights must include 
effective accountability mechanisms that, while not exclusively restricted to the judicial 
system, should not exclude the possibility of seeking redress in court.<footnote name="4">8 Basic systems include: handpumps, spring catchment, gravity-fed systems, rainwater collection, 
storage tanks, small distribution systems; latrines, small-bore sewers, on-site disposal (septic tanks). 
Large systems include: water desalination plants; intakes, storage, treatment, pumping stations, 
conveyance and distribution systems; sewerage; domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants. 
OECD figures indicate that in 2009, Japan spent about US$ 1.09 billion on large systems, and 
US$ 57.<footnote name="4">8. The official position of the Government of Japan is that issues related to the future 
status of the community are a civil dispute between residents and real-estate developers and 
that the Government thus limits its involvement to monitoring negotiations between the 
groups (E/C.12/JPN/3, para. 24). Additionally, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, 
Transport and Tourism, the Kinki Regional Development Bureau, the Kyoto Prefecture, 
and the City of Uji established a committee to investigate ways of improving the living 
environment in the community. In 2008, the living conditions of residents of Utoro were </footnote> million on basic systems. stats.oecd.org.  </footnote>  
</p>
<p>5. The Government of Japan continued to express its commitment to setting up an 
independent national human rights institution, including in meetings with the independent 
expert. The special procedures mandate holder encourages the Government to move 
forward with those plans without further delay. In this regard, it will be fundamental that 
economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to water and to sanitation, are fully 
and explicitly part of the mandate of the future national human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>6. Japan does not explicitly recognize the rights to water and to sanitation in its 
domestic law, but considers that they are protected through other rights, such as the 
protection of fundamental human rights (art. 11 of the Constitution), equality before the law 
(art. 14), and the &#8220;right to maintain minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living&#8221; 
(art. 25). Article 25 of the Constitution goes on to provide for the State responsibility to 
&#8220;use its endeavors for the promotion and extension of social welfare and security, and of 
public health&#8221;.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Water and sanitation in Japan 
</b></p>
<p>7. The central piece of legislation governing water and sanitation in Japan is the 
Waterworks Act of 1957, which provides for licensing of water utilities and sets standards 
for water quality and water-treatment facilities. The Act was amended in 2001 to allow for 
the delegation of water utility management to third actors. Importantly, the Waterworks Act 
explicitly references article 25 of the Constitution of Japan concerning the State obligation 
to promote and extend &#8220;social welfare and security, and public health in all spheres of life&#8221;. 
With regard to sanitation, the Sewerage Act of 1970 provides the relevant framework, 
delegating responsibility for the management of sewerage systems to the municipal 
governments. The Water Pollution Control Act of 1970, the Act concerning Special 
Measures for Water Quality Conservation at Water Resources Areas in order to Prevent the 
Specified Difficulties in Water Utilization of 1994, and the Waste Management and Public 
Cleansing Act of 1970 also provide important standards related to water and sanitation 
services. Some interlocutors raised concern that without a comprehensive act on water and 
sanitation some aspects of the rights to water and to sanitation might not be adequately 
protected, with each municipality taking the primary responsibility for assuring access to 
safe water and sanitation.   
</p>
<p>8. Japan is guided by the Waterworks Vision, which was first developed in 2004 and 
revised in 2008. The Vision identifies several priority areas for action in the sector, 
including safety, stability, sustainability, environmental conservation, and globalization. It 
provides important guidance on ensuring that everyone has access to safe drinking water at 
all times, including during emergency situations, on renewing and updating systems that are 
reaching the end of their lifecycle, and on the importance of transparency in setting prices

</b></p>
<p>for water. While these elements are also central to understanding water as a human right, 
the Vision could include explicit attention to human rights. For instance, specific measures 
could be envisioned to reach excluded groups, to ensure meaningful participation not only 
in order to achieve agreement of customers but because it is the inherent right of all people, 
and accountability mechanisms could be more clearly defined. Furthermore, specific 
measures could be outlined to take account of people living in poverty and their potential 
inability to afford water services. Timelines could be identified for achieving particular 
objectives, which could be defined according to the human rights framework. Such a vision 
paper could set the course for Japan to outline the steps it intends to take towards the 
progressive realization of the rights to water and to sanitation for all.  
</p>
<p>9. Responsibility for implementing these laws and the Waterworks Vision involves 
different entities, including the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the Ministry of 
Environment, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and municipal authorities. The current situation of 
responsibilities being divided among ministries and municipal authorities means that access 
to water and sanitation varies considerably between municipalities. The central Government 
is however responsible for ensuring that all people in Japan enjoy their rights to water and 
to sanitation. In this regard, the special procedures mandate holder considers that the 
Government could play a more active role in regulation, setting minimum standards (for 
instance, regarding affordability), requiring the availability of redress mechanisms in 
instances where there are allegations of violations of the rights, and monitoring the extent to 
which people enjoy the rights to water and to sanitation in different municipalities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Water 
</b></p>
<p>10. Japan uses approximately 83.<footnote name="5">0  Doha Declaration on Financing for Development: outcome document of the Follow-up International 
Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey 
Consensus (2008), para. 46. </footnote> billion cubic metres of water annually out of about 
420 billion cubic metres that are available for human use.<footnote name="5">3. International cooperation is a fundamental principle of human rights law. In its 
general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations, the Committee 
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights affirmed that &#8220;international cooperation for 
development and thus for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights is an </footnote> Average water consumption per 
capita per day is roughly 314 litres and access to water for personal and domestic uses is 
nearly universal in Japan. Domestic use of water accounts for about 19 per cent of all water 
use (16.2 billion cubic metres). While some urban areas, such as Tokyo, are experiencing 
increased demand for water - as a result of population growth but also due to the presence 
of industries - other areas are experiencing a decreasing population and thus less demand 
for water and sanitation. With the fourth highest population density in the world and 
roughly 50 per cent of that population living on or near the country&#8217;s seven principal river 
systems, the strain on existing water resources may nevertheless increase despite the 
shrinking population.6 Some studies indicate that, while domestic consumption of water is 
high compared to most of the developed world, it is on a downward trend.7 Interestingly, 
despite the fact that only about 12 per cent of land in Japan is arable and only 4 per cent of 
the workforce is engaged in farming, 66 per cent of total water usage (55.2 billion cubic 
metres) is devoted to agriculture. This is due primarily to the fact that paddy field 
agriculture and rice production, which are quite water-intensive, comprise the vast majority 
of Japanese agriculture. The remaining 15 per cent (12.1 billion cubic metres) of water goes 
to industrial use.

</p>
<p>11. Water availability in Japan is very seasonal. The rivers in Japan are not very long 
and they have steep inclines, making it difficult to depend on these sources in their natural 
state. For this reason, Japan has built numerous facilities for storing water. About 46.1 
per cent of water supply in Japan comes from dams, while 25.7 per cent comes from rivers. 
Only 25 per cent comes from groundwater.8 Important steps have been taken in Japan to 
combat over-extraction of groundwater, which had caused problems of land subsidence in 
the past. The Government also monitors groundwater levels and whether the ground itself is 
sinking.9 Even with these necessary measures though, the problem of land subsidence, 
which is very difficult to reverse, is still an acknowledged concern in Japan.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Quality 
</b></p>
<p>12. There is a thorough system of water-quality testing in Japan and waterborne diseases 
are no longer a major concern. Some water-quality problems reportedly persist because of 
poor quality pipes delivering the water to homes. People in Japan are increasingly drinking 
bottled water, or installing water purifiers. In a survey conducted by the National Land 
Agency in 1998, reasons offered for why people do not drink tap water include &#8220;tap water 
cannot be drunk with peace of mind&#8221;, &#8220;tap water does not taste good&#8221; and &#8220;tap water has 
some smell&#8221;.10 In its <i>Human Development Report 2010</i>, the United Nations Development 
Programme indicates that nearly 20 per cent of the population in Japan is not satisfied with 
the water quality.11 The authorities in Japan have recognized this lack of satisfaction and are 
taking measures to address the perception of unsafe water and to support continual 
improvements to water quality.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Financing and affordability 
</b></p>
<p>13. In terms of financing the water and wastewater systems, the independent expert 
learned that while water utilities in populous areas are able to rely almost exclusively on 
user fees, in areas with less people, there is more reliance on tax money and subsidies from 
the Government. There is an upper limit of 50 per cent allowed for Government subsidies 
to any operator, and overall subsidies account for about 7 per cent of investment. With 
respect to user fees, human rights require that water and sanitation be affordable to all 
people. This means they must be able to access water and sanitation at prices that do not 
force them to compromise on their enjoyment of other basic human rights (such as food, 
health or education). The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reported that the water 
tariff comprises less than 1 per cent of household spending on average, which is very low. 
Nevertheless, as will be discussed below, special initiatives to assist those living in 
extremely difficult situations are still important.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>14. In Japan, 73.7 per cent of the population has access to sewerage, and the country is 
focused on extending access to the about 20 million people who still do not have access.

<p>Counting those with access to a decentralized system of domestic wastewater treatment 
tank projects (<i>johkasou</i>) in the calculations, 84.8 per cent of the population has access to 
sanitation. Japan implements three main types of sewerage systems based on plans drawn 
up by local governments: public sewerage systems, rural sewerage projects and johkasou. 
Public sewerage systems are managed by local governments and exist mainly in urban 
areas. In essence, public sewerage systems collect domestic wastewater through sewer 
pipes and convey it either to local or regional treatment plants. Wastewater from factories 
and other industrial sites is collected and treated in a similar fashion, but is generally 
carried and treated in separate, independent systems. Often, municipal public sewerage 
systems are linked to larger regional systems that serve multiple urban areas and are 
governed by the prefecture. Rural sewerage systems operate in a similar manner, but on a 
smaller, more localized scale.  
</p>
<p>15. Johkasous, which provide advanced on-site treatment of wastewater, are now 
mandatory in areas without access to a sewage system, such as mountainous regions. The 
Johkasou Act, adopted in 1985 and revised in 2001 and 2005, provides that municipalities 
are responsible for the licensing and inspection of johkasous; they also advise on 
installation and maintenance. The Act sets out regulations on the construction, installation, 
operation and maintenance, desludging and monitoring of johkasou systems. Measuring 
and maintaining water quality standards (set by the Ministry of the Environment) in each 
system is also the responsibility of either the municipal or prefectural government. 
</p>
<p>16. Those without access to sewerage and without a johkasou system (roughly 15 per 
cent of the population) have <i>tandoku-shori </i>johkasous, or night-soil storage tank systems, 
which allow grey water to pass directly into the environment without treatment. These were 
banned in 2001 and thus, all new construction using johkasou technology is obliged to treat 
both night soil and grey water. The aim of the authorities is to move more populous areas 
onto sewerage systems, and less densely populated areas onto the johkasou system. The 
high cost of ensuring safe sanitation, including the proper disposal and treatment of faeces, 
was emphasized to the independent expert in her meetings with authorities.  
</p>
<p>17. It was reported to the independent expert that 100 per cent of black water coming 
from toilets is treated. However, some other water from domestic uses (grey water) may not 
be treated in certain cases, as mentioned above. She also learned about extensive recycling 
and re-use programmes in Japan for sludge and treated wastewater. The independent expert 
was impressed by the achievements of Japan in the area of sanitation and encourages the 
Government to continue to devote priority attention to ensuring safe and sustainable 
sanitation solutions for everyone.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>18. The ageing and decreasing population in Japan has implications for the upkeep and 
sustainability of water and wastewater systems and infrastructure in many parts of the 
country. The percentage of the population over the age of 65 was 22.7 per cent in 2009, 
representing an increase of nearly 18 per cent since 1950. The population growth rate hit 
negative levels in 2005, and stood at -0.6 per cent in 2009.12  
</p>
<p>19. In rural areas, where the dip in population is expected to be most pronounced, a 
lower overall demand for water resources will impact the amount of user fees collected, in 
combination with lower amounts of money collected through taxes, which means that less

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>money will be available for the maintenance of water and wastewater systems. Combined 
with this reality is the fact that the water and sanitation systems in Japan were mostly built 
40 to 50 years ago and are in need of considerable repair. Without adequate funds to engage 
in this important maintenance and repair work, these areas risk facing deteriorating levels 
of water and sanitation service.  
</p>
<p>20. The independent expert learned of interesting technological systems in Japan that 
assist water utilities in predicting demand, forecasting the need for renovations to the 
system, and planning to obtain the funds necessary for such changes. However, the 
software is reportedly based on a presumption of growing demand, and a more complicated 
analysis is needed in cases where the system needs to be downsized. The special procedures 
mandate holder would encourage urgent research into how this system can be used to 
address the parallel realities in Japan of increasing demand in some urban areas and 
shrinking demand in many rural areas. She also highlights the need to continue research 
into small-scale systems and green technologies, which may be more appropriate and 
sustainable in areas facing population decline.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discrimination and exclusion 
</b></p>
<p>21. Although the vast majority of the population in Japan enjoys continuous access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, there are pockets of exclusion which must be addressed. 
Those who do not have regular access, who face obstacles in access in certain spheres of 
their life, or who are otherwise deprived of the same level of access as the general 
population, also face discrimination in society more broadly. These groups include those 
living in poverty, homeless people, people with disabilities, persons of Korean descent and 
prisoners.  
</p>
<p>22. Although article 14 of the Constitution of Japan prohibits discrimination, at present, 
Japan continues to lack national implementing legislation which prohibits discrimination. 
The special procedures mandate holder supports the recommendation of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review calling on Japan to adopt national legislation 
prohibiting all types of discrimination (A/HRC/8/44, para. 60, recommendation 6).   
</p>
<p>23. Article 2 of the Public Assistance Act insists that public assistance programmes 
must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. However, this does little to address 
the distribution of resources among different welfare programmes. Groups such as the 
homeless can generally expect considerably less support than those enrolled in traditional 
pension or disability programmes.13 
</p>
<p>24. There has long been reluctance on the part of many in Japan, including the 
government, to recognize the country&#8217;s diversity in terms of wealth disparities, minority 
groups and other types of heterogeneity.14 While minority groups, such as new immigrants, 
Koreans, the Burakumin, and Ainu and Okinawan indigenous communities, receive greater 
recognition than in the past, they continue to face economic disadvantage and social

<p>long held the notion that Japan had become a largely egalitarian society, where poverty was 
a thing of the past.15 This lack of basic acknowledgement may have been a contributing 
factor in preventing poor families and individuals from getting the assistance they need.  
</p>
<p>26. There is, however, some evidence that attitudes towards poverty in Japan are 
gradually beginning to change. As the effects of increasing poverty rates over the past 
decade begin to touch more people, public debate on how to confront the problem is on the 
rise.16 Furthermore, the emergence of new words in the Japanese language, such as 
<i>waakingu pua</i> (working poor) and <i>neeto</i> (not in education, employment or training) reflect 
an increased recognition of the hardship situations of some people in Japan.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Poverty  
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government of Japan generally defines poverty in terms of the &#8220;relative 
poverty&#8221; standards promulgated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD). That is, households whose annual disposable income is below 50 
per cent of the median income are recognized as living in poverty. In 2007, the Government 
announced that poverty in Japan is about 15.7 per cent,17 amounting to about 20 million 
people. Reportedly, Japan has the fourth highest poverty rate among OECD States, after 
Mexico, Turkey and the United States of America.18 Of course, defining poverty 
exclusively in terms of relative income does not paint the whole picture. A recent study 
measuring poverty in terms of income, but also in terms of access to basic necessities, 
found that 7 per cent of respondents could not afford access to &#8220;lifeline utilities&#8221; such as 
gas, electricity and water.19 Moreover, the study concludes that, in the same way that 
income poverty does not always reflect an individual&#8217;s level of material deprivation, many 
Japanese who are vulnerable to social exclusion in terms of access to a number of material 
needs (including drinking water and sanitation) may not be vulnerable in terms of income 
poverty.20 
</p>
<p>28. Like most industrialized nations, Japan has implemented a variety of social 
programmes to support groups in need of assistance, such as the elderly and people with 
disabilities. However, the vast majority of Japanese social assistance focuses on pension 
and health-care systems, while poverty relief gets short shrift.21 Public assistance continues 
to be viewed as supplemental and as a &#8220;last resort safety net&#8221;.22 Most public assistance in 
Japan is reserved for the sick, disabled or the elderly.23 Older males who do not fit into

</p>
<p>those categories, and are thus considered fit to work, frequently languish in limbo; too old 
to find steady employment, but too young to draw a pension.24 
</p>
<p>29. Unfortunately, the number of people on social assistance is only a fraction of those 
living in poverty, with estimates varying between 20 and 40 per cent of people in need of 
social assistance actually receiving it.25 Of the 15.7 per cent of Japanese who meet the 
relative poverty definition used by the Government, only about 1.2 per cent reportedly 
receive public assistance specifically directed at poverty alleviation.26  
</p>
<p>30. In her discussions with different stakeholders, the independent expert was informed 
that it was difficult to obtain social assistance and that it was viewed as a last-resort option. 
Culturally, people are expected to seek assistance first from their family and community 
before requesting help from the Government. In fact, the role of the family in social 
protection is enshrined in the Civil Code, which specifies that the family is under a duty to 
support its members (art. 877). In this context, there is a certain stigma attached to seeking 
assistance from the Government. Although the help may be available, many people 
reportedly do not request this assistance even if they may be entitled. The shame attached to 
receiving Government aid is so strong, that many would prefer to forgo the help and instead 
maintain their pride.  
</p>
<p>31. Furthermore, the requirements for receiving assistance are reportedly very stringent, 
making it difficult for people who seek social assistance to actually obtain such assistance.27 
Article 4 of the Public Assistance Act provides that &#8220;public assistance shall be provided 
based on a requirement that a person who is living in poverty shall utilize his/her assets, 
abilities and every other thing available to him/her for maintaining a minimum standard of 
living&#8221;. The independent expert was informed that determining whether someone has 
effectively used his or her &#8220;assets, abilities and every other thing available&#8221; can be a 
stringent requirement, which may limit people&#8217;s access to social assistance. This 
requirement has also been understood as &#8220;inability to work&#8221;. It has been noted that the 
ability to work considers only physical ability, as certified by a doctor. Social factors, such 
as whether one has the opportunity to use this ability and whether this ability is demanded 
in the job market of the day are rarely taken into account.28 This corresponds with the 
information which was shared with the independent expert in her meetings with people 
living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>32. In Japan, municipalities are responsible for setting tariffs for water and sanitation 
services, and, as mentioned above, the central Government estimates that the average price 
of water is about 1 per cent of household expenditure. In Tokyo, the price of water is 
approximately 3,300 yen (about US$ 40) per month for a family of four. There are no

<p>national regulations setting maximum tariffs or requiring structures to assist the most 
vulnerable or disadvantaged. Nevertheless, in Tokyo and Osaka, such structures exist. In 
Osaka, reduced rates are made available to single-parent families and households including 
someone with a severe physical or mental disability and elderly households, as well as to 
social-welfare facilities. However, given that many people living in poverty may be single, 
middle-aged men with no known disability, and given the challenges that these people may 
face in obtaining formal social assistance, the special procedures mandate holder is 
concerned that they may face challenges with regard to access to water and sanitation 
because of affordability constraints. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>33. Homeless people face different challenges in accessing water and sanitation since 
they do not have stable housing, the environment in which most people satisfy their water 
and sanitation needs. In January 2010, the homeless population in Japan was estimated at 
13,124 persons, although the number is generally believed to be much higher because of the 
challenges in counting homeless people.   
</p>
<p>34. Day-labourer communities, where many of the country&#8217;s homeless live, have been 
described as &#8220;self-contained ghettoes&#8221;.29 A dearth of shelters means that others must live in 
public parks. The independent expert visited homeless people living in Nagai Park and 
Kamagaseki in Osaka, and people living in Shinjuku Park in Tokyo. Some homeless people 
also live in 24-hour Internet cafes in a slightly less precarious situation. Many of the 
homeless persons with whom the independent expert met worked to some degree or 
another. However, none of them could afford a stable apartment or other housing and very 
few received social welfare support. Many were able to construct a cardboard shelter or 
plastic tent in the park, with materials either collected over time or purchased with the 
money they could earn.  
</p>
<p>35. The special procedures mandate holder acknowledges that the Government has 
devoted considerable resources towards addressing the problem of homelessness in recent 
years. However, she observes that existing Government efforts to address the problem of 
homelessness are largely uncoordinated. Depending on where homeless people are living, 
the municipal parks and construction departments are variously responsible for managing 
the homeless population.30 However, neither department has access to funds for providing 
aid; that money is controlled by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.31  
</p>
<p>36. In terms of practical access to safe drinking water and sanitation, homeless people 
living in parks rely commonly on the public toilet facilities for their access to water and 
sanitation. Access to showers is generally more challenging than access to toilets and water. 
By and large, public facilities in Japan surpass the standards of cleanliness and hygiene in 
many other developed countries. The importance of good hygiene in Japanese culture leads 
homeless people to place a high priority on access to water and sanitation. However, their 
continued access depends largely on the municipal authorities and park wardens. In some 
parks where the independent expert visited homeless communities, she was informed that 
the municipal authorities had stopped maintaining the public toilet facilities when the 
homeless community began living there. The independent expert received information that 
sometimes the authorities would disconnect the water supply to the area where the

</p>
<p>homeless people lived. The toilets also reportedly get blocked frequently and the authorities 
do not repair them. The independent expert was encouraged to receive information from the 
municipality of Osaka that it took full responsibility for the maintenance of public 
restrooms in the parks where homeless people lived. Nevertheless, she remains concerned 
about reports she received from homeless communities in Osaka that the public restrooms 
were not maintained. She urges all municipalities to be vigorous in ensuring that public 
restrooms do not fall into disrepair, and that they are regularly cleaned and replenished with 
soap and toilet paper.  
</p>
<p>37. Despite the refusal of the municipality to maintain the facility in some cases, some 
communities reportedly cleaned and maintained the facilities to the best of their ability 
within their available resources.  
</p>
<p>38. An act to assist homeless people become self-reliant was adopted in 2002. 
Numerous people with whom the independent expert met discussed how the act was 
implemented. To benefit from this governmental assistance, the first step a homeless person 
must take is to present himself or herself to the local welfare office, which will admit him 
or her to an emergency temporary protection centre after a brief interview. To enter the 
centre, homeless people must leave their tent or shanty, and cut ties with fellow homeless 
people. Several people with whom the independent expert met indicated that this was a 
problem for them; they perceived a risk that if they applied for this assistance and it did not 
succeed in pulling them out of their homeless state, they would lose their place in the park 
and in their community. Thus, they would be worse off.  
</p>
<p>39. For those who stay in the centre, an assessment is conducted to determine where the 
resident should be placed. For instance, residents may be sent to the welfare system, they 
may be placed in correctional facilities, or they may be sent to the Centre to Assist Self-
Reliance. Single men who are not yet elderly will often be sent to the Centre to Assist Self-
Reliance. There, they have two months to find a job; the stay can, in certain circumstances, 
be extended to four months if they find a job, allowing them to save money to afford stable 
housing. Only about 50 per cent of the people entering the Centre to Assist Self-Reliance 
manage to leave having found employment and housing. With no guarantees of stable 
work, the risk of people returning to the streets remains high.32 Those who do not find a job 
during this period are categorized as &#8220;difficult to help to become self-reliant&#8221; and asked to 
leave the Centre. When they leave the Centre, there is no guarantee of receiving welfare 
benefits since that determination is made at the ward level. Thus, those people may end up 
back on the streets, where they continue to face challenges with regard to access to water 
and sanitation for their health and hygiene, and where their situation may be even worse 
than it was previously, given that they had to cut ties with their community and, in some 
cases, might have lost their &#8220;place&#8221; in the park.  
</p>
<p>40. Lack of regular access to water and sanitation to maintain hygiene and health is only 
one aspect of a much larger problem. While homeless people in Japan have demonstrated 
an ability to find innovative solutions, the Government obligation to find sustainable 
solutions to assist this population remains. In seeking a more comprehensive response to 
the phenomenon of homelessness in Japan, protecting the human rights of these individuals, 
including their rights to water and to sanitation, should be a paramount concern. In this 
regard, consultation with concerned communities, and ensuring their right to information, is 
critical to devising sustainable solutions that respect their human rights.

<p><b> C. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>41. Japan signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, but 
has not ratified it yet, and it has not signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention. Article 
28 of the Convention specifically provides that States must take measures &#8220;to ensure equal 
access by persons with disabilities to clean water services, and to ensure access to 
appropriate and affordable services, devices and other assistance for disability-related 
needs&#8221;. Discrimination based on disability is prohibited under article 14 of the Constitution 
(pertaining to equality under the law). The Basic Act for Persons with Disabilities (2004) 
was amended to include a call fro the elimination of discrimination based on disability. In 
June 2010, the Cabinet adopted a decision aimed at promoting the rights of persons with 
disabilities, including a commitment to adopt legislation to comply with the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Government has also reported important 
measures to ensure employment of people with disabilities.33 The municipal authorities are 
responsible for ensuring that public facilities for water and sanitation are accessible to the 
population, and the independent expert was pleased to learn that those facilities have been 
designed to be accessible for persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>42. The independent expert received information indicating that persons with disabilities 
faced discrimination in obtaining housing, which had an impact on their access to water and 
sanitation. The housing that is available is frequently not accessible for persons with 
disabilities, particularly in terms of sanitation needs. Furthermore, the independent expert 
was concerned about reports that children with disabilities would be able to attend school 
only if one of their parents stayed with them during the day in order to take care of their 
children&#8217;s toilet needs. While these instances may be exceptional, such problems should be 
fully investigated with a view to ensuring the right to education for all children, as well as 
the right to work for parents.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Underserved persons of Korean descent 
</b></p>
<p>43. Estimated in 2002 to number around 625,<footnote name="4">7. Utoro&#8217;s residents are fiercely committed to the land where they live and are 
currently locked in a bitter and protracted legal battle with landowners, who want to evict 
the residents from the area. In 1998, the Osaka High Court considered the case of Utoro and 
determined that the fact that the Korean community had illegally occupied the land gave the 
landowners the right to demolish their buildings and force them to leave. This decision was 
upheld by the Supreme Court in 1999. Importantly, the High Court reportedly referenced 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 7 (1997) on 
forced evictions, and concluded that evictions carried out in accordance with judicial 
decisions were in conformity with international human rights obligations. The special 
procedure mandate holder notes that judicial decisions alone are not sufficient to justify any 
forced eviction, but that a host of other procedural guarantees must be considered, including 
whether there has been genuine consultation with the community concerned and whether 
evictions could result in homelessness. She notes that some steps have been taken in this 
regard, as detailed below.  
</footnote>22, the majority of Koreans living in 
Japan are former colonial subjects brought to Japan for forced labour during the Second 
World War and their descendents. Koreans in Japan can generally be further classified as 
belonging to one of two groups. The first, often referred to locally as the <i>Zainichi</i>, are those 
who have elected to retain their Korean citizenship and live in the country as foreign 
residents. The second group consists of those who have acquired Japanese citizenship. The 
Zainichi regularly encounter discrimination in access to housing, education, government 
pensions and other benefits.34 Younger generations who attend Korean-language secondary 
schools face a number of administrative obstacles when registering for university entrance 
examinations.35 
</p>
<p>44. While discrimination against Koreans and people of Korean descent persists in all 
facets of Japanese society, it is most pronounced in communities established by the 
Government of Japan to house imported labour during the Second World War. The housing 
was originally intended as temporary shelters; however, following the end of the war many

<p>and related intolerance (E/CN.<footnote name="4">6. The rates of access to water and sanitation in Utoro are strikingly low when 
compared to nearby Uji City. In Uji City, 99 per cent of the population is connected to the 
water utility, and 78 per cent has access to a sewerage system. In Utoro, these rates are 47 
per cent and zero per cent, respectively. The independent expert met with several residents 
in Utoro, some of whom receive only well water. One woman explained that she had to 
take the water once a month to a laboratory to get it tested, and although it did not meet 
water quality standards, she drank it because she could not be connected to the water 
network. She explained that the landowner did not allow the installation of the pipe to her 
house. Furthermore, to connect to the water network costs about 200,000 to 300,000 yen 
(about US$ 2,500 to $3,700). The &#8220;illegal&#8221; status of this community means that no 
household in the community is connected to the sewage network, and the independent 
expert witnessed the open sewers with untreated wastewater running through the town, 
posing a serious public health problem. The independent expert was informed by one 
resident that her latrine needed to be emptied every two months at a cost of 1500 Yen 
(about US$ 20). Another resident reported that when there is heavy rainfall, the latrines 
overflow, resulting in raw sewage in the streets.

<p>of the Koreans stayed. Unfortunately, such communities have since been largely ignored by 
the Government of Japan and have gradually sunk into a state of decrepitude.  
</p>
<p>45. One such community is Utoro, near Kyoto, which the independent expert visited 
during her mission. Established in 1943, Utoro was initially a collection of bunkhouses that 
housed Korean workers during the Second World War. After the end of the war, the 
Koreans who stayed gradually tried to improve the accommodations, for instance by 
building new houses and bringing in electricity. This community is considered to be 
illegally occupying the land, which has a serious impact on community members&#8217; access to 
basic services such as water and sanitation. Although requests for water pipes to the 
community were made at least as far back as 1979, the legal battle over the land delayed 
installation, and the water main was connected to the community only in 1988. Many 
residents continued to use well water, because they could not afford the cost of connecting 
to the network, or because they still needed permission from the landowner, since they were 
considered illegal occupants, in order to lay the pipes to their houses.

<p>surveyed, and based on these surveys, a plan is being developed to offer residents public 
housing. The progress made in addressing the situation in Utoro is important, but the 
urgency to improve the living conditions remains. The special procedures mandate holder 
notes that the &#8220;illegal&#8221; status of this community and the possibility of eventual access to 
public housing are not acceptable reasons to deny them access to water and sanitation. She 
strongly recommends that the Government of Japan take swift action to ensure that all 
residents of Utoro, and similar communities across the country, have access to safe water 
and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>49. The independent expert received information about the enjoyment of the right to 
water and sanitation in prison facilities. She emphasizes at the outset that all people are 
entitled to enjoy the rights to water and sanitation regardless of whether they are deprived 
of their liberty or not. The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are, as 
is evident in their name, the absolute minimum and a country with significant resources, 
such as Japan, has the obligation to go beyond these most basic rules.  
</p>
<p>50. According to article 79 of the Act on Penal Detention Facilities and Treatment of 
Inmates and Detainees, prisoners may be placed in protection cells in cases where they are 
likely to hurt themselves, when they make a loud noise or speak loudly against a prison 
officer&#8217;s instruction to cease, when they are likely to cause injury to others, or when they 
are likely to damage the property of the prison. While an order of the warden is necessary 
to put a prisoner in a protection cell, if there is not enough time to wait for such an order, 
officers may confine prisoners in the cell without the order. In the protection cell, 
reportedly prisoners are not able to flush the toilet by themselves, but instead are required 
to ask the guard to do so. Although the independent expert sought information on why this 
would be required, she did not receive a response to justify the practice. She is concerned 
that this practice is degrading to the prisoner.  
</p>
<p>51. The independent expert was further informed about the continued use of hand 
restraints in the protection cells, which inhibits the prisoners&#8217; ability to access water and 
sanitation, especially when the hands are fastened behind the back.   
</p>
<p>52. More generally, the independent expert was informed that prisoners were permitted 
to bathe two to three times a week. Prisoners are permitted to bathe and wash their hair only 
during specified hours. The independent expert was informed that in some cases breach of 
these rules could result in being placed in solitary confinement. Although the prison rules 
do not specifically detail this punishment, the independent expert was informed that 
deciding which punishment to impose was left largely to the discretion of prison 
authorities. The special procedures mandate holder encourages the Government to take into 
consideration that more frequent or more flexible bathing arrangements may be necessary 
given the high standards of hygiene respected within Japanese society. She is also 
concerned that placing a prisoner in a protection cell because of his or her use of water for 
personal hygiene beyond the strict limits imposed by prison rules may be disproportionate 
punishment.

<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>obligation of all States&#8221; (para. 14). When States elect to provide official development 
assistance (ODA), they must ensure that it is consistent with human rights standards and 
principles.36 
</p>
<p>54. Both the development and the implementation of development cooperation policy 
should incorporate principles of non-discrimination, participation and accountability. This 
is reflected in, inter alia, paragraph 13 (c) of the Accra Agenda for Action, which states that 
&#8220;developing countries and donors will ensure that their respective development practices 
and programmes are designed and implemented in ways consistent with their agreed 
international commitments on gender equality, human rights, disability and environmental 
sustainability&#8221;.37  
</p>
<p>55. First and foremost, donors must not negatively affect the human rights situation in 
their partner countries.38 Moreover, they should ensure that their assistance facilitates each 
developing country&#8217;s ability to comply with its own human rights obligations.39 They 
should take positive action to work with partner Governments in order to identify how 
development assistance can best support that Government&#8217;s own efforts to realize human 
rights.40 Finally, donor States have an obligation to ensure that third parties involved in the 
delivery and implementation of their development assistance (e.g. private contractors and 
technical advisers) do not interfere with the enjoyment and realization of human rights in 
partner countries.41  
</p>
<p><b> A. Institutional set-up and policies for development cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>56. JICA is the fifth largest bilateral donor of ODA in the world.42 In addition to 17 
domestic offices, it maintains 96 overseas bureaus and has managed projects in around 150 
countries.43 While Japanese aid has historically primarily targeted other Asian countries, in 
recent years JICA has expanded its operations to parts of Africa and Latin America.  
</p>
<p>57. Human security is a defining feature of development assistance from Japan. As 
explained to the independent expert, this comprises three elements: (a) cooperation that 
comprehensively targets freedom from fear and want; (b) cooperation that involves 
thorough consideration for the socially vulnerable; and (c) cooperation that establishes 
mechanisms to protect and empower people. In discussions the independent expert had with 
JICA, representatives indicated that the human security approach encompassed human 
rights obligations. The special procedures mandate holder interprets the goals of the human 
security approach as being not only consistent with human rights obligations, but also 
promoting human rights. However, and in the light of the upcoming review of the human

<p>security approach within JICA, she considers that human rights could feature more 
prominently in the official development assistance policy of Japan.  
</p>
<p>58. The JICA environmental and social guidelines are also relevant in understanding 
how human rights are factored into the Agency&#8217;s activities. Under these guidelines, all 
JICA projects are categorized according to the degree of impact on environmental and 
social considerations. An advisory committee monitors the proposal and implementation of 
any green-lit project determined to have significant adverse impacts. The advice of the 
advisory committee is not binding, but its guidance is fully available on the JICA website. 
JICA representatives further reported to the independent expert that the Agency had 
withdrawn proposals for which the projected impacts were too severe. The guidelines 
provide an important framework for ensuring that JICA projects do not contribute to human 
rights violations. However, an explicit focus on human rights would require, inter alia, 
moving beyond avoiding adverse impacts to actively empowering people to claim their 
rights and specifically targeting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged parts of the 
population. 
</p>
<p>59. The ODA policy of Japan makes explicit reference to the importance of working 
with countries that respect, protect and fulfil human rights.44 However, the Government 
should also expressly commit itself to incorporating human rights into its own policies and 
practices. A human rights approach to development assistance requires donor countries not 
only to examine whether a partner country is committed to protecting human rights, but 
also to place human rights at the centre of its own policies. This, in turn, should then be 
reflected in the structures, processes and instruments of key agencies, such as JICA. This 
would have an impact at the assessment, implementation and evaluation stage of 
programmes. It would require, at a minimum: (a) broad-based and meaningful participation 
of all relevant stakeholders at all stages; (b) special attention to addressing the situation of 
those who experience discrimination or are otherwise marginalized, as well as efforts to 
address the root causes of structural inequalities in the country in question; and (c) 
capacity-building for monitoring and establishment of accountability mechanisms to ensure 
that human rights obligations are fully respected.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Development cooperation in the field of water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>60. With specific regard to water and sanitation, Japan has demonstrated a strong 
commitment to providing international assistance in these sectors. Of the members of the 
OECD Development Assistance Committee, it is currently the largest donor in the water 
and sanitation sectors, contributing 33 per cent of all such bilateral aid from members over 
the past few years.45 In 2006 it established the Water and Sanitation Broad Partnership 
Initiative (WASABI), which is aimed at supporting increased coordination among Japan, 
international organizations, other donor countries, NGOs and local partners. WASABI 
emphasizes the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation, among several related 
goals.46

</p>
<p><b> C. Targeting of aid 
</b></p>
<p>61. Despite its substantial financial commitment and increasing international presence, 
there is some concern that JICA assistance does not reach the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups. In 2009, less than 20 per cent of development aid from Japan for 
water and sanitation (roughly US$ 207.4 million) targeted least developed countries and 
other low-income countries, whereas over 50 per cent (or roughly US$ 785.8 million) went 
to lower-middle-income countries.47 Additionally, Japan spends nearly 20 times more on 
large systems for water supply and sanitation than it does on basic systems.48  
</p>
<p>62. The current allocation of development assistance within the water and sanitation 
sectors should be more closely aligned with human rights standards and principles. A 
specific focus on the most marginalized and disadvantaged would warrant greater attention 
to those living in least developed countries. Furthermore, large-scale investments in 
infrastructure and large systems (whether in middle- or low-income countries) are often 
criticized for focusing too much on overall economic growth, while doing little to address 
conditions in slums and rural areas, where even basic water and sanitation are nonexistent, 
and where the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations often live. 
</p>
<p>63. Taking a human rights approach to assistance in the water and sanitation sectors 
would involve a greater emphasis on developing basic water systems in order to reduce 
inequality and ensure that persons living in rural areas or slums get access. In the case of 
large systems, it would require more focus on expanding such systems, rather than simply 
upgrading them. Large infrastructure projects are not contrary to the rights to water and 
sanitation per se, but the crucial question is whether such projects improve access for those 
who already enjoy some degree of access, or whether they take the challenging step of 
extending access to those who continue to be excluded from even basic access. 
Accordingly, it would be useful to analyse the official development assistance of Japan 
from the perspective of beneficiaries, rather than only in terms of money spent. This would 
assist Japan to have a better understanding of whether it is reaching those most in need.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Participation and inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>64. In seeking information on participation and inclusion, the independent expert was 
informed about consultations with communities concerning water and sanitation projects. A 
Japanese project in Senegal was highlighted as a good practice. The Project on Safe Water 
and Support of Community Activities, coordinated with the Ministry responsible for 
hydraulics in Senegal, was implemented between 2003 and 2010 with the objective of 
establishing a sustainable structure of water use within the project site. It was emphasized 
that the project employed a multisectoral approach, which included community 
participation and a special focus on women&#8217;s participation.

</b></p>
<p>65. It appears that Japan has improved its work with communities since 2004. Japan 
emphasizes the need to undertake capacity assessments in order to develop the capacity of 
countries to handle issues at multiple levels. Capacity development can have different 
meanings in the context of development projects. The human rights framework would 
require the following elements in terms of capacity development: (a) fostering a sense of 
responsibility on the part of duty bearers for realizing human rights; (b) ensuring that 
people can take action to claim their rights, including by bringing national laws and policies 
in line with human rights standards; and (c) ensuring that people have the resources, 
including economic and organizational resources, to take action.49 
</p>
<p><b> E. Affordability of service provision 
</b></p>
<p>66. Water-supply projects presented to the independent expert also placed a heavy 
emphasis on user fees. Such fees are essential for the sustainability of water and sanitation 
systems, and people who can afford to should pay for these services. Domestic water 
utilities in Japan have a remarkable record of cost recovery. However, while fully 
acknowledging the importance of user fees, the special procedures mandate holder notes 
that simultaneous efforts must also be made to ensure that those living in extreme poverty 
are not excluded from access simply because they cannot pay. Financial mechanisms such 
as cross subsidies and free lifeline access can be put in place to assist those most in need. 
The mandate holder sees scope for improving attention to issues of affordability in JICA 
projects.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Untying aid 
</b></p>
<p>67. JICA has been criticized for continuing to define empowerment largely in terms of 
generating commerce and building market linkages with Japan. Indeed, contrary to the 
Accra Agenda for Action (para. 18), much of ODA from Japan continues to be tied to the 
procurement of Japanese products and services. For example, the Special Terms for 
Economic Partnership loans programme, which requires receiving countries to procure 
Japanese good and services, has been cited as conflicting with the general principles of 
development aid outlined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee in the Accra 
Agenda for Action.  
</p>
<p>68. Untied aid creates a more amenable climate for the realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights. At a broad level, it helps to promote efficiency, mutual accountability, 
transparency, sustainability, affordability and national ownership of projects.50   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. The special procedures mandate holder commends Japan for its progress in 
ensuring access to safe water and sanitation for the vast majority of the population. 
Looking forward, special attention is needed for those groups who have been 
marginalized or otherwise disadvantaged. Placing the rights to water and sanitation at

<p><b>the centre of policy formulation for both domestic and international aid policies is 
crucial to ensure that all people in Japan, as well as those benefiting from its 
development assistance, have access to sufficient, affordable, accessible, acceptable 
and safe water and sanitation, in order to ensure human health and human dignity. In 
this regard, the mandate holder recommends that the State:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Fully guarantee economic, social and cultural rights in domestic law, 
including by ensuring that these rights are justiciable in national courts. At the 
international level, Japan should consider ratifying the Option Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Adopt a comprehensive law on non-discrimination, including specific 
provisions on economic, social and cultural rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Establish an independent national human rights institution with 
competencies to monitor the enjoyment of all human rights in Japan, including 
economic, social and cultural rights, and to receive individual complaints; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt a comprehensive law on water and sanitation guaranteeing the 
right of all people in Japan to safe water and sanitation and clearly delineating the 
responsibilities of different actors at the national and municipal levels. Such a law 
could incorporate mandatory water-quality standards, set maximum tariff limits, and 
establish an independent regulatory mechanism for the sectors, including complaint 
mechanisms for users who have concerns about their access to water and sanitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Continue to devote priority attention to improving ageing infrastructure 
in order to ensure access to water and sanitation, especially for people living in remote 
areas;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Engage in awareness-raising campaigns about water quality to assure 
people of the safety of drinking tap water; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Evaluate the extent to which people living in poverty face challenges in 
paying for water and sanitation services, and consider nationwide policies, such as 
those in Tokyo and Osaka, to assist those people; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure that all municipalities provide homeless people with access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, including through regular maintenance and 
upkeep of public restrooms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Engage in dialogue with homeless communities to assist these individuals 
to find more secure housing solutions, providing more stable access to water and 
sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities, whether 
public or private, including in the areas of housing and education. The special 
procedures mandate holder especially calls on the Ministry of Education to equip 
schools with the necessary facilities for the inclusive education of children, including 
by ensuring their autonomous access to water and sanitation, so as to eliminate 
requests for parents of children with disabilities to take care of their children&#8217;s 
sanitation needs while at school. Furthermore, the Government must do more to 
ensure that all persons with disabilities have access to housing that is adapted to their 
needs, in particular with regard to sanitation and bathing;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Take immediate measures to ensure that people living in Utoro, and 
similar communities in Japan, have access to safe water and sanitation that meet 
standards equivalent to the neighbouring communities at a price they can afford;  </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Ensure enjoyment of the rights to water and to sanitation in all spheres 
of life, including in prisons;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Fully integrate human rights into development aid policy. The State 
should also consider devoting a larger proportion of aid to ensuring basic water and 
sanitation supply to those who do not yet have access. It should further ensure that 
project beneficiaries, or those otherwise impacted by projects, have opportunities to 
participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of projects, as well as 
access to information about project proposals. The state should also consider untying 
aid in order to assure policy space for Governments to respond to democratic 
processes that should inform the development of policy, including in the areas of 
water and sanitation.</b>
