<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
</p>
<p>of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea from 29 September to 6 October 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur travelled to the capital city, Seoul, as well as Sejong City, 
</p>
<p>Busan, Changwon and Ansan. He met with representatives from the Government at the 
</p>
<p>national level, the judiciary, the prosecution services and the Korea Broadcasting 
</p>
<p>Cooperation. Regrettably, the Special Rapporteur did not meet with any ministers, although 
</p>
<p>he had requested meetings at that level.  
</p>
<p>3. In addition to meeting with representatives of Government and State institutions, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the National Human Rights Commission of 
</p>
<p>Korea (NHRCK), United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, and 
</p>
<p>community members and other groups and individuals working in the field of racism, as 
</p>
<p>well as migrant workers and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Korea for its cooperation in the conduct of the visit. He is grateful to the 
</p>
<p>different State agencies for their cooperation. He is also indebted to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>entities and to his interlocutors from civil society for the excellent cooperation they 
</p>
<p>extended to him throughout the visit. He hopes his conclusions and recommendations will 
</p>
<p>contribute to finding concrete ways and means of addressing the challenges raised in the 
</p>
<p>present report in an effective and human rights-compliant manner.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Republic of Korea was proclaimed in August 1948, after the end of the Second 
</p>
<p>World War, and peace agreements left the country divided from the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea by drawing a line along the thirty-eighth parallel in the Korean 
</p>
<p>peninsula. The country received United Nations support after it was invaded by the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea two years later. The Korean War ended in 1953 
</p>
<p>without a peace agreement, leaving the Republic of Korea technically at war with the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea for more than 50 years.  
</p>
<p>6. After a long period of authoritarian regimes, the country went through a 
</p>
<p>democratization process in the late 1980s. At that time, the political situation was marked 
</p>
<p>by significant, large-scale and occasionally violent pro-democracy protests that opposed the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s long-standing authoritarian rule. As a result of those protests, the authoritarian 
</p>
<p>establishment saw its position weakened, and that weakness was seized upon by opposition 
</p>
<p>leaders demanding democratic reforms. In June 1987, the ruling party&#8217;s presidential 
</p>
<p>candidate proposed a far-reaching democratization plan that accepted all the opposition&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>key demands. The Constitution was approved by popular referendum and formally adopted 
</p>
<p>on 29 October 1987. 
</p>
<p>7. Since then, the Republic of Korea has been a key player in the region. It is a member 
</p>
<p>of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20. 
</p>
<p>However, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the strained relations with the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have played an important role in shaping the legal, 
</p>
<p>political and institutional framework of the country. The Cheonan incident in 2010 and the 
</p>
<p>nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in early 2013 are 
</p>
<p>examples of the latest tensions between the two neighbours. More recently, the tragic 
</p>
<p>accident of the Sewol ferry, which led to the deaths of more than 300 persons, mostly high-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>school students, led to political tensions between the Government and opposition political 
</p>
<p>parties, as attempts to capitalize on the tragedy led to further polarization between the 
</p>
<p>Government and the opposition. 
</p>
<p>8. Over the past 30 years, migration flows into the country have increased 
</p>
<p>significantly. As at 1 January 2014, there were 1,569,470 foreign residents, including 
</p>
<p>naturalized Koreans, who accounted for 3.1 per cent of the total registered population of 
</p>
<p>51,141,463. That means that 1 out of 32 persons is a foreign resident. The growing 
</p>
<p>economic and social problems associated with an ageing population and a low birth rate 
</p>
<p>may also present challenges to society. The birth rate is 1.19 children per woman of 
</p>
<p>childrearing age and is well below the rate of replacement within the population. If those 
</p>
<p>demographic trends continue, by 2060 there could be 80.6 elderly people for every 100 
</p>
<p>workers, which would present an enormous fiscal challenge to the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework for combating racism 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Republic of Korea is party to the following core United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, it has 
</p>
<p>not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families, the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Second Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on a communications procedure or the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>10. Other international instruments ratified by the Republic of Korea include the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Discrimination in Education. The Republic of Korea has also ratified 
</p>
<p>the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Protocol relating to the Status of 
</p>
<p>Refugees and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution of the Republic of Korea was adopted on 17 July 1948 and last 
</p>
<p>revised on 29 October 1987, and is fundamental to the national system for promoting and 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights. The Constitution has been amended nine times and almost fully 
</p>
<p>rewritten five times (in 1960, 1962, 1972, 1980 and 1987).  
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution declares the Republic of Korea a democratic republic, its territory 
</p>
<p>consisting of &#8220;the Korean Peninsula and its adjacent islands&#8221; and that the &#8220;Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea shall seek unification and shall formulate and carry out a policy of peaceful 
</p>
<p>unification based on the principles of freedom and democracy&#8221;. The Constitution of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea guarantees human rights and stipulates the scope of the limitation of 
</p>
<p>human rights and the obligation of the State to reaffirm and guarantee the inviolability of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>human rights. The Constitution stipulates that basic freedoms and rights should not be 
</p>
<p>undervalued simply on the grounds that they are not specified in the Constitution. The Bill 
</p>
<p>of Rights is included in the second chapter of the Constitution. Individuals are not 
</p>
<p>punished, placed under preventive restrictions or subjected to involuntary labour except as 
</p>
<p>provided by law and through lawful procedure. Those detained or arrested must be 
</p>
<p>informed of the reason and of their right to an attorney, and family members must be 
</p>
<p>informed. Warrants must be issued by a judge &#8220;through due procedures&#8221; and accused 
</p>
<p>persons may sue for wrongful arrest in certain cases.  
</p>
<p>13. The relevant provisions on non-discrimination are: 
</p>
<p>(a)<b> </b>Article 10: All citizens shall be assured of human dignity and worth and have 
</p>
<p>the right to pursue happiness. It shall be the duty of the State to confirm and guarantee the 
</p>
<p>fundamental and inviolable human rights of individuals; 
</p>
<p>(b)<b> </b>Article 11 (1): All citizens shall be equal before the law, and there shall be no 
</p>
<p>discrimination in political, economic, social or cultural life on account of sex, religion or 
</p>
<p>social status; 
</p>
<p>(c)<b> </b>Article 14: All citizens shall enjoy freedom of residence and the right to 
</p>
<p>move at will; 
</p>
<p>(d) Article 32 (4): Special protection shall be accorded to working women, and 
</p>
<p>they shall not be subjected to unjust discrimination in terms of employment, wages and 
</p>
<p>working conditions. 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution assigns territorial ownership over the entire Korean peninsula, 
</p>
<p>including the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. That provision, combined with the 
</p>
<p>Nationality Act, grants refugees from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>automatic citizenship in the Republic of Korea upon defecting to the country.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative framework prohibiting racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the Republic of Korea, international human rights treaties duly concluded and 
</p>
<p>promulgated under the Constitution are applicable in the domestic legal system. The entire 
</p>
<p>spectrum of human rights is covered by a range of specific acts and laws. No provision of 
</p>
<p>an individual law can infringe human rights beyond the limitations stipulated in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution and, in the case of an infringement, the matter may be referred to the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court for a review of the constitutionality of the provision.  
</p>
<p>16. In principle, the protection of human rights is ensured through criminal punishment 
</p>
<p>and compensation for damages. Administrative measures that violate human rights can be 
</p>
<p>declared null or cancelled through administrative appeals or administrative litigation. In the 
</p>
<p>case that a violation of fundamental human rights due to the act or omission of public 
</p>
<p>power is not redressed, even after all procedural remedies have been exhausted, a complaint 
</p>
<p>can be filed before the Constitutional Court. Apart from judicial decisions, victims of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations can petition NHRCK and seek remedies through the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of that institution. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there is no legal definition of &#8220;racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination&#8221; under the country&#8217;s law and that there were currently no specific legislative 
</p>
<p>measures, including under the Criminal Code, to prohibit and punish racially motivated 
</p>
<p>criminal offences. In 2012, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Republic of Korea implement reforms in that area (see 
</p>
<p>CERD/C/KOR/CO/15-16, paras. 6&#8211;8). In 2011, a comprehensive draft bill on equal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>treatment and non-discrimination, developed in consultation with non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, was proposed by the previous legislature. The draft law was rejected by the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly, however, in September 2012. Although several interlocutors, including 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians, supported the adoption of such a comprehensive law, the Government 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur that the matter was not a subject for debate in parliament 
</p>
<p>at the time of the visit. It also seems that popular support for such a reform is lacking.  
</p>
<p>18. While there is no general law on the prohibition of discrimination, there are a 
</p>
<p>number of laws that prohibit discrimination in each respective area. Those laws vary in 
</p>
<p>terms of anti-discrimination grounds and scope, and the level of protection and punishment. 
</p>
<p>Such laws include the National Human Rights Commission Act, the Anti-Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against and Remedies for Persons with Disabilities Act, the Act on Age Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Prohibition in Employment and Aged Employment Promotion, the Labour Standards Act, 
</p>
<p>the Equal Employment and Support for Work-Family Reconciliation Act, the Act on the 
</p>
<p>Protection, etc., of Fixed-Term and Part-Time Employees and the Act on the Protection, 
</p>
<p>etc., of Dispatched Workers. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the enactment of the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>Refugee Act in 2012, which he considers a welcome development given the increasing 
</p>
<p>number of requests for refugee status that the Republic of Korea receives. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was able to see first hand the efforts undertaken by the Government to process 
</p>
<p>claims of refugees and asylum seekers in a fair, transparent and timely manner by visiting 
</p>
<p>an immigration reception centre in Incheon. Although the percentage of claims that are 
</p>
<p>accepted remains very low, revision and appeal procedures have been established to ensure 
</p>
<p>a fair hearing and decision by the immigration authorities for those who arrive in the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea and seek asylum. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework for combating racism 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that there are credible institutions 
</p>
<p>engaged in the fight against racism and discrimination in the Republic of Korea. During his 
</p>
<p>visit, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of NHRCK, an independent 
</p>
<p>institution which is mandated to play an important role in combating racism and racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination. NHRCK was set up by an act of parliament in 2001 as a national advocacy 
</p>
<p>institution for human rights protection. The Commission is composed of 11 commissioners: 
</p>
<p>the chairperson, 3 standing commissioners and 7 non-standing commissioners. Of the 11 
</p>
<p>commissioners, 4 are elected by the National Assembly, 4 are nominated by the President 
</p>
<p>of the Republic of Korea and 3 are nominated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>and then approved by the President. 
</p>
<p>21. NHRCK has a mandate to investigate the human rights violations perpetrated by 
</p>
<p>central and local governments and to provide remedies to the victims. The Commission also 
</p>
<p>has jurisdiction over discrimination committed by private entities and organizations on the 
</p>
<p>basis of sex, religion, disability, age, social status, nationality, race, region of origin, 
</p>
<p>appearance, marital status, pregnancy, family status, skin colour, ideas, political orientation, 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation, medical history, etc. At the same time, the Commission has the authority 
</p>
<p>to conduct investigations on its own initiative if there is a reason to believe that human 
</p>
<p>rights violations or discrimination have occurred and that the cases are considered crucial 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights. The Commission has a permanent 
</p>
<p>secretariat that is divided into several branches, which include the Anti-Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Division. The NHRCK vision is to create a society where the dignity and human rights of 
</p>
<p>all persons, including foreigners living in the Republic of Korea, are fully respected and 
</p>
<p>realized. To that end, NHRCK is committed to the full implementation of all human rights 
</p>
<p>set forth in the Constitution, as well as international human rights standards at the domestic </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>level in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was informed that NHRCK only provides recommendations 
</p>
<p>to the Government, which can decide whether to follow up or not. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also notes that the NHRCK personnel was reduced by 21 per cent a few years ago and that 
</p>
<p>some experienced commissioners have resigned in recent years (see CERD/C/KOR/CO/15-
</p>
<p>16, para. 18). 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the Korea Communications 
</p>
<p>Commission, which has a mandate to oversee and evaluate the content of television and 
</p>
<p>radio transmissions of both public and private operators. The Commission was established 
</p>
<p>under the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Korea Communication Commission 
</p>
<p>and is responsible for regulating broadcasting and communication services, protecting users 
</p>
<p>and ensuring the independence of broadcasting services, including monitoring hate and 
</p>
<p>racist speech. The functions of the Commission include the formulation and 
</p>
<p>implementation of policies pertaining to terrestrial, general and reporting programme 
</p>
<p>providers; the investigation of violations by a broadcasting or communication service 
</p>
<p>operator and the imposition of sanctions for such violations; the development and 
</p>
<p>implementation of measures aimed at protecting users and their personal information and at 
</p>
<p>preventing the circulation of illegal or harmful information; the establishment of policies on 
</p>
<p>programming and evaluation; and the diversification of media. 
</p>
<p>24. At the municipal level, the Special Rapporteur was made aware that Seoul city 
</p>
<p>council had established in 2012 a human rights commission by issuing the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Ordinance. The commission is composed of 15 experts who are tasked with reviewing 
</p>
<p>major policies and laws related to the human rights of the citizens of Seoul and three 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; rights guardians appointed to receive reports of human rights violations in Seoul 
</p>
<p>and to investigate them. Upon finding that a violation has occurred, recommendations can 
</p>
<p>be made to the mayor on related policy change. The municipal human rights commission 
</p>
<p>has competence over any alleged infringements by the city government, district offices and 
</p>
<p>city-sponsored welfare facilities, and serves not just registered residents of the city, but 
</p>
<p>anyone who officially has a workplace in Seoul. Petitions to the commission can be filed by 
</p>
<p>victims and people who have knowledge of alleged violations. Because the commission 
</p>
<p>was established only recently, it is as yet unclear what its precise impact will be  and how it 
</p>
<p>will avoid overlapping with the work of NHRCK.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Public policies to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance  
</b></p>
<p>25. The Republic of Korea has had in place the National Action Plan for the Promotion 
</p>
<p>and Protection of Human Rights since 2007, which includes provisions relating to racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The National Action Plan was 
</p>
<p>renewed in 2012 and schedules a variety of tasks, including: the establishment and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the second basic plan, for 2013&#8211;2017, under the Framework Act on 
</p>
<p>Treatment of Foreigners Residing in the Republic of Korea; the provision of language 
</p>
<p>support and counselling to foreign workers; the strengthening of health and safety 
</p>
<p>management for foreign workers; the provision of medical services to irregular foreign 
</p>
<p>workers and their children; the provision of assistance for the social integration of the 
</p>

<p>applicants for refugee recognition; the provision of social security services to recognized

<p>refugees; and education on human rights. The Ministry of Justice directs the establishment 
</p>
<p>and implementation of the National Action Plan, and relevant ministries and organizations 
</p>
<p>carry out the specific tasks laid out. Every year, information on the National Action Plan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>implementation are reported to the National Human Rights Policy Council and made 
</p>
<p>public.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government established the first Basic Plan for Policies on Foreigners (2008&#8211;
</p>
<p>2012) on 17 December 2008. The purpose of the Plan was not only to eliminate direct 
</p>
<p>discrimination against immigrants as members of a social minority, but also to foster a 
</p>
<p>mature multicultural society through support for immigrants&#8217; social adjustment and to 
</p>
<p>promote the multicultural awareness of the public. The Plan sets out to strengthen support 
</p>
<p>for immigrants in order to reduce indirect social discrimination due to their delayed social 
</p>
<p>adjustment, and to standardize a variety of supporting policies through the introduction of a 
</p>
<p>social integration programme. 
</p>
<p>27. The Multicultural Families Support Act was adopted on 21 March 2008 and enacted 
</p>
<p>on 22 September of the same year. According to that law, the term &#8220;multicultural family&#8221; 
</p>
<p>applies to families consisting of nationals of the Republic of Korea and immigrant spouses 
</p>
<p>(including those who are naturalized after their marriage) and their children. The law 
</p>
<p>requires the national and municipal governments to actively support such families in order 
</p>
<p>for them to improve their quality of life and stability. More specifically, the law requires the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Gender Equality and Family to conduct a survey every three years, to stem 
</p>
<p>discrimination and prejudice and to nurture a social background that recognizes the 
</p>
<p>diversity of people, as well as to provide information and education support to such 
</p>
<p>families. Those measures are based on the Framework Act on Treatment of Foreigners 
</p>
<p>Residing in the Republic of Korea of 2007. In that connection, the Centre to Support 
</p>
<p>Immigrant Spouses, established in 2006 by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, 
</p>
<p>changed its name to the Multicultural Family Support Centre. 
</p>
<p>28. The Multicultural Families Support Act is relevant to racism and racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination in relation to the family, as it was adopted to contribute to social integration 
</p>
<p>and improve the stability and quality of life of immigrant spouses. The Act also enables 
</p>
<p>multicultural families to receive the necessary information on and assistance with daily life, 
</p>
<p>education support, protection and support for victims of domestic violence, medical/health-
</p>
<p>care support, childcare and education support for children and multilingual services through 
</p>
<p>the Multicultural Family Support Centres. However, article 2 of the Act limits the definition 
</p>
<p>of a multicultural family to a union between a citizen of the Republic of Korea and a 
</p>
<p>foreigner (including naturalized citizens), thereby excluding a marriage where both partners 
</p>
<p>are foreigners (as is the case with most migrants).  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Migrant workers using the Employment Permit System  
</b></p>
<p>29. The first attempt to regulate migrant workers was made in 1992 in order to respond 
</p>
<p>to labour shortages and to reduce the number of undocumented migrants. The Industrial 
</p>
<p>Trainee System was initially aimed at providing training to foreign workers recruited by 
</p>
<p>domestic companies to improve their skills and enhance their performance. However, most 
</p>
<p>of the jobs covered by the System were considered to be &#8220;dirty&#8221;, &#8220;difficult&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;dangerous&#8221;. Moreover, the number of undocumented migrant workers continued to 
</p>
<p>surpass the number of documented industrial trainees, which led the Government to change </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>the system by adopting the Employment Permit System (EPS). EPS was introduced in July 
</p>
<p>2004 in the manufacturing, construction, agriculture and livestock industries and later 
</p>
<p>expanded to the service and fishing industries in 2005 and 2006, respectively, at first 
</p>
<p>through bilateral memorandums of understanding signed between the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>and sending countries that set out the rights and duties of Governments and the status of 
</p>
<p>and benefits for the workers.  
</p>
<p>30. The number of migrants in the Republic of Korea has since increased steadily and 
</p>
<p>reached over 1.7 million in 2014. This increase is due in part to the introduction of the more 
</p>
<p>flexible EPS. Most beneficiaries of EPS are from South-East Asian countries. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that the System had allowed numerous foreign workers to come 
</p>
<p>to the Republic of Korea and access employment opportunities, and had benefited the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s businesses, which could recruit foreign workers through a flexible permit system 
</p>
<p>for short- and medium-term periods that has contributed to the economic growth witnessed 
</p>
<p>in recent years. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur has nonetheless been made aware that that the Government 
</p>
<p>has introduced recent amendments to EPS, which in some cases require migrants to leave 
</p>
<p>the country in order to be paid their severance settlement after finishing their employment 
</p>
<p>contract in the Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>32. Although EPS recognizes migrant workers as workers under labour law, it places a 
</p>
<p>number of restrictions on them, for example with regard to the number of times they can 
</p>
<p>change workplace and employment and the maximum period of stay, denies them the right 
</p>
<p>to family reunification and places extreme burdens on migrants seeking to change the type 
</p>
<p>of visa. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about several restrictions and 
</p>
<p>requirements within the System that increase the likelihood of migrant workers being 
</p>
<p>subjected to human and labour rights abuses by their employers, who can, for example, 
</p>
<p>terminate a migrant&#8217;s contract without having to justify the decision. Nonetheless, job 
</p>
<p>centres do have direct authority to proceed with a change in the worker&#8217;s employment 
</p>
<p>without the employer&#8217;s consent if the worker applies for a change of employment and if the 
</p>
<p>reason for doing so does not originate with the employee. Such a change in employment 
</p>
<p>would not be included in the total number of workplace changes permitted during the 
</p>
<p>worker&#8217;s employment in the Republic of Korea. Nevertheless, the inability to freely change 
</p>
<p>employment can easily place migrant workers in situations of labour exploitation. In 
</p>
<p>addition, a change in employment can jeopardize a migrant&#8217;s chance of extending his or her 
</p>
<p>initial contract in the Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>33. Further limitations contained in the System make it almost impossible for a migrant 
</p>
<p>worker recruited under the scheme to be granted permanent or long-term residency, or even 
</p>
<p>to convert to another type of visa, as EPS is limited to a maximum of 4 years and 10 
</p>
<p>months. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that the International Labour Organization Committee 
</p>
<p>of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its 2013 
</p>
<p>observation on the Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and 
</p>
<p>Education (No. 111),1 and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/4/24/Add.2) have pointed out the problems of those cases and recommended that 
</p>
<p>the Government take legal measures for rectification of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed that migrant workers in the Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea also experience discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour and country of 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>origin. Migrant workers hired through EPS, some of whom work in poor conditions, are 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to physical violence, verbal abuse, unpaid wages and minimum wage violations. 
</p>
<p>Migrant workers are currently not allowed to join an independent labour union. The case of 
</p>
<p>a trade union formed nine years ago by some migrant workers remains pending before the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea, which has yet to recognize that union as legal.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Workers in the agriculture sector 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the situation of migrant workers in the 
</p>
<p>agriculture industry. Through first-hand meetings with migrant workers in this sector, he 
</p>
<p>was made aware of the difficult working and living conditions they face, which include 
</p>
<p>working in small farms, in isolated areas of the country, in the cold winter and in the hot 
</p>
<p>summer, particularly in greenhouses.  
</p>
<p>37. Migrant workers in the agriculture and livestock industries of the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>face worse conditions than those hired in the manufacturing, construction and service 
</p>
<p>industries. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some of the articles of the Labour 
</p>
<p>Standards Act do not apply to labourers in the agriculture and livestock industries, as 
</p>
<p>article 63 of the Act specifically excludes those workers from protections relating to 
</p>
<p>working hours, paid weekly rest days and daily breaks. Such exclusion is not only 
</p>
<p>discriminatory but also disproportionately affects migrant workers in the agriculture sector. 
</p>
<p>38. Furthermore, these migrant workers are not entitled to receive overtime pay or 
</p>
<p>additional pay for any night or holiday work. Low-wage work and long hours are 
</p>
<p>customary for labourers in the agriculture and livestock industries. In its 2013 fact-finding 
</p>
<p>report on the human rights situation of migrant workers in the agricultural and 
</p>
<p>stockbreeding industries,2 NHRCK states that migrant workers in those industries worked 
</p>
<p>an average of 284 hours, with just two days&#8217; rest every month, and received an average 
</p>
<p>monthly wage of 1,270,000 won, which is below the minimum hourly wage and would 
</p>
<p>equate to a monthly salary of 1,380,000 won. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, such migrant workers are often assigned tasks that are much more 
</p>
<p>difficult and strenuous than those assigned to their counterparts from the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea. Given their isolation, it is particularly difficult for migrant workers to report 
</p>
<p>violations of the Labour Standards Act and to change employment, as they have to go 
</p>
<p>through the job centres and provide justification in order to be allowed to change employer. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was informed that migrant workers in the agriculture and livestock 
</p>
<p>industries could transfer only to the construction, fishing or service industries. 
</p>
<p>40. Furthermore, since most migrant workers work in conservative, rural communities, 
</p>
<p>they are especially vulnerable to discrimination. Migrant workers in the agriculture and 
</p>
<p>livestock industries work and live in closed and isolated rural communities that consist 
</p>
<p>mainly of farm owners and their families. As such, they are vulnerable to various forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination resulting from old-fashioned employment practices, disrespect for foreigners 
</p>
<p>and limited-duration visa status given their short-term contracts as labourers. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was also informed that, in some rural communities, labourers have traditionally 
</p>
<p>been regarded as servants, a perception that can lead to verbal abuse, physical violence, 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse and violation of their privacy, as they live in their employer&#8217;s household.

<p>(Korean only). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>41. With poor communication skills in Korean and the inability to improve their 
</p>
<p>language skills owing to their long working hours and the geographical isolation from 
</p>
<p>urban areas and the prejudice and disrespect shown towards workers in the agriculture and 
</p>
<p>livestock industries, migrant workers in these sectors are particularly vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>exploitation and discrimination. Moreover, with no labour union on their side, they face 
</p>
<p>threats of dismissal and expulsion if they challenge their employer.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Foreign seafarers on the high seas  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the number of migrant workers on fishing 
</p>
<p>vessels registered in the Republic of Korea has been rapidly increasing and that the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s fishing industry is now much more dependent on migrant workers than any other 
</p>
<p>industry. According to government statistics, as of December 2013, about 70 per cent of 
</p>
<p>seafarers in deep-sea fishing vessels and 28 per cent of seafarers in offshore fishing vessels 
</p>
<p>were foreign workers.  
</p>
<p>43. In meetings in Busan, foreign seafarers informed the Special Rapporteur of their 
</p>
<p>difficult working conditions on board the fishing vessels. Foreign seafarers are often 
</p>
<p>assigned the most difficult tasks and paid less than their counterparts from the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea. In addition, they are not entitled to a share of the catch, which is a requisite for 
</p>
<p>seafarers from the Republic of Korea. While the wage of seafarers from the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea is composed of a monthly fixed wage and a share of the catch, which is usually 
</p>
<p>worth much more than the wage, foreign seafarers are paid only a monthly minimum wage 
</p>
<p>without any share of their catch. Since the minimum wage is determined per month 
</p>
<p>regardless of their working hours, foreign seafarers receive only that fixed minimum wage, 
</p>
<p>even though they work 24 hours a day.  
</p>
<p>44. Although seafarers are entitled to a minimum wage under the Seafarers Act, which 
</p>
<p>states that the minimum wage for seafarers should be determined by a collective agreement 
</p>
<p>between the federation of seafarers&#8217; unions and the federation of vessel owners&#8217; 
</p>
<p>associations, those unions do not accept foreign seafarers as members, although they are 
</p>
<p>still authorized to represent them in collective bargaining. The Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that, on average, seafarers from the Republic of Korea were paid three times more 
</p>
<p>than their foreign counterparts. In addition, foreign seafarers working on vessels registered 
</p>
<p>in the Republic of Korea are not regulated by the Labour Standards Acts, nor are they 
</p>
<p>covered under the rules of EPS. Once fishing vessels carrying foreign seafarers set sail, 
</p>
<p>they stay on the high seas for periods of up to one month, which makes it very difficult for 
</p>
<p>those seafarers to report abuse. The Special Rapporteur was informed that no limit is 
</p>
<p>imposed on the number of applications those seafarers could submit to the Immigration 
</p>
<p>Office to change their employer.  
</p>
<p>45. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that foreign seafarers are allegedly 
</p>
<p>often subjected to racist and xenophobic verbal and physical abuse by ship owners and 
</p>
<p>captains, as well as by fellow seafarers from the Republic of Korea. However, they are not 
</p>
<p>able to walk off the vessel because their employer usually holds a deposit, such as a large 
</p>
<p>sum of money or a land certificate, as security supplied by their employment agency in 
</p>
<p>their home country. Although the Immigration Act specifically prohibits the withholding of 
</p>
<p>a foreigner&#8217;s passport or Alien Registration Card as a means to ensure a contract for his or 
</p>
<p>her employment or the payment of the debt, some vessel owners or management agencies 
</p>
<p>appear to confiscate the passports, identification documents or even bankbooks of foreign 
</p>
<p>seafarers in order to prevent them running away.  
</p>
<p>46. Finally, foreign seafarers face difficulty in reporting abuse to the maritime police or 
</p>
<p>visiting a local maritime affairs or port owing to the language barrier or the distance of 
</p>
<p>working location. There have been reports that when foreign seafarers have contacted a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>person in their management agency who can speak their language, this person did not report 
</p>
<p>problems to the authorities but took sides with the vessel owner. In port cities, local 
</p>
<p>authorities often have a close relationship with vessel owners, which results in foreign 
</p>
<p>seafarers who report abuse being penalized by the authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Marriage migrants 
</b></p>
<p>47. Men from the Republic of Korea began to marry foreign women in the 1990s and 
</p>
<p>the phenomenon has rapidly increased since 2000, when commercialized marriage brokers 
</p>
<p>were first allowed to facilitate this new type of marriage. These brokers would recruit men 
</p>
<p>from the Republic of Korea who would visit other Asian countries to meet potential brides. 
</p>
<p>Within two weeks, they would meet women and get married to the woman they chose. The 
</p>
<p>men would be liable for all or the majority of the costs of the process. It is estimated that 
</p>
<p>around 20,000 couples get married every year as part of these arrangements; approximately 
</p>
<p>around 1 out of 10 marriages concluded in the Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the numerous efforts made by the 
</p>
<p>Government to support multicultural families and, in particular, the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>assistance for integrating marriage migrants (persons who migrate to the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>by marrying a national of that country) and their children as full members of society. 
</p>
<p>Numerous services for multicultural families have been made available, such as the 
</p>
<p>multicultural families support centres throughout the country, which offer language classes 
</p>
<p>and counselling to both spouses and help marriage migrants and their children to settle and 
</p>
<p>integrate into society. However, the policy for multicultural families is in the vast majority 
</p>
<p>of cases applied to foreign women who marry men from the Republic of Korea and not vice 
</p>
<p>versa. The legal definition of these marriages does not extend to the marriage of two 
</p>
<p>migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>49. Moreover, the Multicultural Families Support Act narrowly defines the multicultural 
</p>
<p>family as: (a) a family composed of a marriage migrant and a citizen of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea who acquired citizenship at birth; and (b) a family composed of a naturalized citizen 
</p>
<p>and a citizen of the Republic of Korea who acquired citizenship at birth. It does not include 
</p>
<p>in its definition other types of migrant families, such as the families of migrant workers or 
</p>
<p>ethnic Korean families from China, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and Central 
</p>
<p>Asian countries. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed that, since 2011, men from the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea who plan to marry a foreign spouse from certain countries are required 
</p>
<p>to attend an international marriage orientation programme. The Minister of Justice 
</p>
<p>announced the countries concerned as Cambodia, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, 
</p>
<p>Thailand, Uzbekistan and Viet Nam. According to the Ministry of Justice, those countries 
</p>
<p>were targeted because the statistics showed a higher rate of divorce and naturalization in a 
</p>
<p>marriage when one spouse was from one of those countries. Thus, immigrants from those 
</p>
<p>countries are allowed to apply for a marriage visa only when their spouses from the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea take the international marriage orientation programme.  
</p>
<p>51. Similarly, the concept of multicultural families as currently interpreted and applied 
</p>
<p>has some limitations and has been used in the media to convey negative connotations of 
</p>
<p>marriage migrants and foreign workers from South-East Asia.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, on 5 April 2011, the Government had 
</p>
<p>added article 25-2 to the Immigration Act. In accordance with that article, relating to 
</p>
<p>special rules applicable to marriage migrants, marriage migrants who are allegedly abused 
</p>
<p>by their spouses from the Republic of Korea may be granted an extension of stay until a 
</p>
<p>remedy process, including a pending court trial, an investigation by law enforcement </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>agencies or an administrative remedy under applicable laws and regulations, is completed. 
</p>
<p>Even after the previously extended stay, such marriage migrants may be permitted a further 
</p>
<p>extension if deemed necessary for their recovery. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that marriage migrants may be permitted to remain in the Republic of Korea even 
</p>
<p>after separation or divorce, if they are raising an underage child or are not found to be 
</p>
<p>responsible for the termination of marriage (in cases where the spouse from the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea is missing or dead, or at fault for the divorce).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Private acts of racism and xenophobia  
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur, while noting that he had not been informed of or seen any 
</p>
<p>racist or xenophobic discourse or practice at the institutional level, was nevertheless made 
</p>
<p>aware of several incidents of private acts of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>The incidents included a naturalized woman being refused entry to a public bath by the 
</p>
<p>bath&#8217;s management, taxi drivers turning customers who do not look ethnic Korean in to the 
</p>
<p>police and shop attendants expressing derogatory attitudes to foreign customers. Although 
</p>
<p>these may be isolated incidents, it is essential for the Government to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>racism and xenophobia through better education and awareness-raising. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the role that education plays in 
</p>
<p>combating racism and xenophobia and recall his report on the role of education to prevent 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/23/56), in which 
</p>
<p>he stressed the fundamental role of education in the effective enjoyment of all other human 
</p>
<p>rights, as education is known to act as a multiplier in enhancing the other human rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms. The role of teachers and educators is particularly important and they should be 
</p>
<p>given specialized training, including in the prevention of racism, xenophobia and other 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination, with special emphasis on the situation of migrants, refugees and 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers or other vulnerable groups. Similarly, human rights education and anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination training should also be emphasized in schools and universities. Teachers, 
</p>
<p>journalists, state officials, civil servants, judges and law enforcement officials should be 
</p>
<p>given such training, and particular emphasis in the curriculum should be given to 
</p>
<p>international norms prohibiting racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the existence of nationalist groups and 
</p>
<p>movements that openly advocate the abolition of the policy of providing support to 
</p>
<p>multicultural families, claiming that the policy enacted by the Government discriminates 
</p>
<p>against citizens, as they are not entitled to similar social benefits or programmes. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur expresses concerns about the dissemination of inaccurate information 
</p>
<p>by those groups and movements, as he was assured that the same social benefits are offered 
</p>
<p>to citizens under the regular social protection scheme. It is important for the Government to 
</p>
<p>dispel such myths and clarify the situation in order to prevent the proliferation of racist and 
</p>
<p>xenophobic movements, as the country&#8217;s society has become more exposed to foreign 
</p>
<p>nationals and migrant workers.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Racism in the media  
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in the society of the Republic of Korea, the 
</p>
<p>media (written, broadcasted and online) are accessible, independent and offer vibrant 
</p>
<p>coverage of news and issues. He recalls that the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in the report on his visit to the 
</p>
<p>country, commended the existence of media pluralism and praised some of the results 
</p>
<p>achieved, which had resulted in one of the highest rates of broadband Internet penetration in 
</p>
<p>the world (see A/HRC/17/27/Add.2 and Corr.1, paras. 87 and 101). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>57. The accessibility of the mass media in everyday life has had an effect on the 
</p>
<p>awareness and value judgement of the country&#8217;s citizens. In addition, the high levels of 
</p>
<p>Internet penetration and usage mean that media reports, television programmes and films 
</p>
<p>are easily accessible through tablets and smartphones. That can lead to stories covered in 
</p>
<p>the media sometimes being disseminated without their authenticity being verified, and that 
</p>
<p>does irreparable damage and harm, even when corrections are made afterwards.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also recalls that, in its 2012 concluding observations, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted  the following with regard to 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Korea (see CERD/C/KOR/CO/15-16, para. 10): 
</p>
<p>Racist hate speech directed against non-citizens is becoming more widespread and 
</p>
<p>explicit in the media and on the Internet. The Committee notes that the fundamental 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression of the individuals involved does not protect the 
</p>
<p>dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or incitement to racial hatred &#8230; The 
</p>
<p>Committee recommends that the State party monitor the media, Internet and social 
</p>
<p>network to identify those individuals or groups who disseminate ideas based on 
</p>
<p>racial superiority or incite to racial hatred against foreigners [and] that the State 
</p>
<p>party prosecute and adequately punish the authors of such acts. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was made aware during his encounters with relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders of the significance of the term &#8220;multicultural&#8221;, which in the society of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea is now a reference to a specific group of persons and is used to refer 
</p>
<p>sometimes in a derogatory manner by the media to migrant men from Asia (originally 
</p>
<p>migrant workers) and marriage migrant women (generally having married through religious 
</p>
<p>groups or marriage brokers), and is quite different from its legal definition in the 
</p>
<p>Multicultural Families Support Act, where it refers to families whose members are migrants 
</p>
<p>married to citizens and children who were born to them or adopted.  
</p>
<p>60. The broadcasting industry has begun showing &#8220;multicultural&#8221; programmes in 
</p>
<p>response to the increase in the number of multicultural families, such as the television 
</p>
<p>programme &#8220;Love in Asia&#8221; (from KBS), the longest-running multicultural programme, and 
</p>
<p>the Multicultural Hope Project (from MBC). Although those programmes show model 
</p>
<p>multicultural families and how well they have adapted to the country&#8217;s society, other 
</p>
<p>television programmes display multiculturalism in a derogatory and condescending manner 
</p>
<p>and contribute to reinforcing stereotypes of and prejudice against multicultural families. As 
</p>
<p>the perception of foreigners and migrants is largely derived from the media, these 
</p>
<p>messages, either positive or negative, have a powerful impact on the collective 
</p>
<p>consciousness. Similarly, advertisements broadcast on television have, on occasion, 
</p>
<p>reinforced negative perceptions of foreigners, migrants and families with a multicultural 
</p>
<p>background. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in 2013, NHRCK made 
</p>
<p>recommendations to four public television broadcasting companies, including public 
</p>
<p>channels, and four general programming cable channels to ensure that discriminatory 
</p>
<p>expressions towards migrants and foreigners were not broadcast on television and that 
</p>
<p>specific measures to prevent further occurrences were taken. NHRCK also called on the 
</p>
<p>Korea Communication Standards Commission, when reviewing television programmes, to 
</p>
<p>check for such content, in particular racial stereotypes, manifestations of prejudice and the 
</p>
<p>use of discriminatory language towards migrants and foreigners, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>article 6 of the Broadcasting Act and articles 29 and 312 of the broadcasting deliberation 
</p>
<p>regulations, which provide criteria for assessing whether any content can be qualified as 
</p>
<p>racial prejudice or xenophobia, religious prejudice or cultural, religious or ethnic 
</p>
<p>intolerance. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recommendations of NHRCK and hopes that 
</p>
<p>broadcasting companies, in particular television stations, will follow suit by setting out 
</p>
<p>clear guidelines for the prevention of racism and xenophobia in their programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation before and 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the visit, which allowed him to meet interlocutors from all relevant ministries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the judiciary and NHRCK. He is also extremely grateful to the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies present in the country, non-governmental organizations, community 
</b></p>
<p><b>members and other groups and individuals working against racism and xenophobia, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as individual migrant workers and asylum seekers with whom he met and who 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been very helpful in explaining the issues at stake. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Republic of Korea has undergone dramatic changes over the past decades, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including significant positive developments in the area of human rights, reflected in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the well-respected National Human Rights Commission and the vibrant civil society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which play a fundamental role in safeguarding the progress made. Similarly, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Korea has made important progress in addressing the issue of racism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia, considering its long history of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Only 
</b></p>
<p><b>recently, as the country has consolidated its rapid economic development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>industrialization, has it been faced with the progressive arrival of foreigners and 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant workers and started to open up to multiculturalism and cultural diversity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>These developments have provoked an important and essential debate on 
</b></p>
<p><b>multiculturalism, racism and xenophobia in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>It is therefore important that the numerous efforts undertaken by all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, including the Government of the Republic of Korea, to combat racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and other forms of discrimination continue, especially at times of 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic slowdown, when the temptation to divert energy and resources to other 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues is strong.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>In that connection and in a spirit of constructive dialogue with the authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>below to the Government of the Republic of Korea. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Expedite the ratification of United Nations treaties that it has not yet 
</b></p>
<p><b>ratified, particularly the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, recalling the previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination and the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights defenders; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Ratify the following fundamental International Labour Organization 
</b></p>
<p><b>conventions: Forced Labour, 1930 (No. 29), Freedom of Association and Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Right to Organise, 1948 (No. 87), Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining, 
</b></p>
<p><b>1949 (No. 98), Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957 (No. 105), Labour Inspection 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Agriculture), 1969 (No. 129), Migration for Employment (Revised), 1949 (No. 97) and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions), 1975 (No. 143); </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which it signed in 2000; 
</b></p>
<p>(d) <b>Take action on the finalization and adoption of the comprehensive law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibit all forms of discrimination or another such comprehensive law prohibiting 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p>(e) <b>Amend the Criminal Code and other relevant penal laws in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>include racial discrimination as a criminal offence and adopt the legislation necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>to criminalize racial discrimination, provide for adequate sentences to the gravity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the offence and make racial discrimination an aggravating circumstance when 
</b></p>
<p><b>another offence is committed, and provide for appropriate reparations to the victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government strengthen its 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with NHRCK in ensuring its full independence and effectiveness and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>autonomy to manage its resources and select its own staff, in order to allow it to play a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more significant role in receiving complaints from victims of racism and xenophobia, 
</b></p>
<p><b>conduct investigations and issue relevant recommendations to the Government, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be followed up in a similar manner as has been done recently with the adoption 
</b></p>
<p><b>of comprehensive laws prohibiting discrimination against women and persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government make the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendments to EPS, in particular with regard to: the complexity and variety of types 
</b></p>
<p><b>of visa; discrimination based on the country of origin; limitations on </b>migrant workers&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>ability to change employment; and the maximum period of stay allowed. In particular, 
</b></p>
<p><b>he recommends removing the restrictions on the number of job changes allowed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>EPS workers, allowing all EPS workers to change employment without a release form 
</b></p>
<p><b>from their employer and ensuring that the rights covered under the Labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>Standards Act are extended to all workers, including migrant workers, irrespective of 
</b></p>
<p><b>which sector they work in, in particular with respect to work hours, daily breaks and 
</b></p>
<p><b>weekly paid rest days. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>For migrant workers in the agriculture sector, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government: ensure that all are paid the full overtime rate for 
</b></p>
<p><b>any work performed outside the regulated hours, as set out in article 56 of the Labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>Standards Act; clarify what constitutes adequate food and accommodation when those 
</b></p>
<p><b>are inclu</b>ded as part of a migrant worker&#8217;<b>s contract; ensure that the Ministry of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Employment and Labour regularly inspects all farms to ensure the proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Labour Standards Act and EPS contracts; and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate action to remedy the situation, including appropriate sanctions against 
</b></p>
<p><b>employers who are in breach of their obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In relation to foreign seafarers working on vessels registered in the Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Korea, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government sanction the 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory application of minimum wages between seafarers from the Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Korea and foreign seafarers on such vessels on the high seas; enable foreign seafarers 
</b></p>
<p><b>to also benefit from a share of the catch; eradicate the practice of employers 
</b></p>
<p><b>deliberately retaining identification documents and bankbooks of foreign seafarers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>train employers and fishermen of the Republic of Korea on practical measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eradicate verbal and physical abuse towards foreign fishermen; ensure proper </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspection by officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans of vessels on which 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign seafarers are employed; establish a reporting mechanism for foreign seafarers 
</b></p>
<p><b>to register violations and abuse by their employer and co-workers from the Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Korea, accessible in their languages; and take rapid action, including appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctions when such violations are found.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On marriage migrants and multicultural families 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government grant equal rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the case of separation or divorce, to migrant women married to men who are 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationals of the Republic of Korea, including with regard to stability of residency, 
</b></p>
<p><b>notwithstanding the outcome or duration of the marriage and whether or not any 
</b></p>
<p><b>children were born from the union. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government work towards ending the practice of requiring men who are nationals of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Republic of Korea and who wish to marry women from certain countries to 
</b></p>
<p><b>undergo the international marriage orientation programme; ensure that international 
</b></p>
<p><b>marriage agencies whose staff exhibit racism and sexism are properly sanctioned; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>conduct a wide-ranging public awareness campaign to end racism and xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning international marriages, including redefining the concept of multicultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>families and recognizing the benefits they bring to society. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign women who are victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, trafficking or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of violence be informed of their rights and given proper access to justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women victims of violence should be given the right to legally remain in the country if 
</b></p>
<p><b>they so wish. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government broaden the 
</b></p>
<p><b>definition of multicultural families to include unions between foreigners or inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic unions in order to integrate those who are presently excluded from the social 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefits provided for under the Multicultural Families Support Act.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the authorities revise the school 
</b></p>
<p><b>curriculum in order to raise awareness and promote acceptance of multiculturalism 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the contribution of migrants to society from an early age. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recalls that education is fundamental in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance and in promoting the principles of tolerance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect to ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On racism and xenophobic discourse promoted by private actors 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to strengthen mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>for preventing and eliminating xenophobic discourse against foreigners, migrants and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multicultural families, including among politicians and political leaders. That 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon should be tackled at all levels, including at the national, regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>local levels. The Special Rapporteur recalls that leaders have a responsibility to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strongly denounce such discourse, including when it comes from within their own 
</b></p>
<p><b>ranks. In particular, politicians from mainstream political parties should avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobic discourse and the scapegoating of foreigners, migrant workers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multicultural families, and promptly denounce false allegations, especially those 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning social benefits and programmes supporting the integration of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>and multicultural families and children. The Special Rapporteur also recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>collecting disaggregated data and statistics on the number of cases of racism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia reported to the authorities, including the percentage of investigations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutions undertaken following such complaints and their outcome.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  On racism in the media 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls the fundamental role played by the media in 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting diversity and shaping opinions and attitudes. In that regard, the positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>role and influence of the media should be used to promote tolerance and respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity. The Special Rapporteur encourages a diversity of voices in the media, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be done by providing incentives and support to community media and visibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>and voices to victims of racism and xenophobia. He also recommends that the media 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop and implement voluntary ethical codes of conduct and self-regulatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures, policies and practices to combat racism and xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to take stricter 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to prevent and eliminate hate speech and xenophobia on the Internet and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat impunity for such acts. In that regard, he recommends the prompt 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution of perpetrators and appropriate sanctioning where relevant.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the enactment of a comprehensive Refugee 
</b></p>
<p><b>Act in 2012, and recommends that the relevant authorities process asylum claims 
</b></p>
<p><b>within a shorter time frame. He also recommends that the Government ensure free 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal laid to asylum seekers, and adequate training on human rights and asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures for law enforcement agents. The Special Rapporteur also recommends the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of a gender perspective in the treatment of asylum requests filed by women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the implementation of gender-based measures, such as providing same-sex 
</b></p>
<p><b>interviewers and interpreters. The Special Rapporteur proposes facilitation of access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to asylum procedures for women victims or potential victims of trafficking in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>guideline No. 7 of the Guidelines on International Protection of the Office of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the application of Article 1A(2) of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the 1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees to victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>of trafficking and persons at risk of being trafficked.
