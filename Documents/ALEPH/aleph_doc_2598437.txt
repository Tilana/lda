 MIN buys ore from BCI at a price linked to MIN’s FOB price
 Bedded iron deposit with JORC Ore Reserve of ~123Mt at
58.8% Fe1
 Simple DSO operation and ~50% lump production which attracts
a price premium
 MIN evaluating potential expansion and construction of a bulk
ore transport system (BOTS) to Port Hedland
 Low-risk cash flows for BCI (contractual safeguards against
losses)

Nullagine Overview
Mine with access to world-class infrastructure
 Located ~55km north of FMG’s Christmas Creek
 Unincorporated joint venture – 75% BCI, 25% FMG
 Capacity to export up to 6Mtpa on FMG’s rail and port
infrastructure

BCI’s 75% interest (numerous interested parties)
 Restart can occur at low cost and within 8-10 weeks if A$ iron
ore prices reach acceptable levels
 New operating model must provide lower cost base and lower
working capital risk to BCI (e.g. contractor risk sharing)

Buckland Mine-to-Port Project Overview
Strategic 100% owned mine and port infrastructure project
 West Pilbara hosts significant undeveloped deposits including
APIJV’s West Pilbara Iron Ore Project
 100% owned mine-to-port development project, incl. independent
infrastructure solution that could be utilised by other deposits
 Proposed mine at Bungaroo South,  approved private road 
linking the mine with proposed  transhipment port at Cape 
Preston East
 All major permits and approvals secured for mine, road and port1
 JORC Ore Reserve of 134Mt at 57.6% Fe2

Cape Preston East Port Overview
Cape Preston East can become a strategic, low capital cost transhipment port
Existing Cape Preston Port (CITIC Pacific)
 BCI holds port lease agreements with the Pilbara Ports
Authority (“PPA”)
 Right to construct and operate onshore & marine facilities
of 20Mtpa for an initial term of 20 years
 Right to expand leased area and extend term
 Provides for third party tonnages – BCI will actively develop
 Proposed transhipment port with a comparatively low capital
cost per tonne of throughput
 Modern and efficient transhipping operations now
successfully operating globally, with only marginally higher 
operating cost than deepwater ports

Industry Outlook
IRON ORE
OTHER MINERALS
 Large Pilbara deposits depleting at a fast
 A$ gold price at record levels with positive
rate and ore quality is deteriorating 
significantly
outlook
 Base metals prices still lagging but potential
 End-users will continue to support
upside (e.g. nickel and zinc)
smaller good quality projects, which will 
facilitate new mines in the West Pilbara 
(including Buckland)
 At average forecasted prices, BCI’s
current projects can deliver significant 
value
 Countercyclical new opportunities with
low entry cost should offer significant 
value
 New “green” minerals such as lithium and
graphite attracting investor interest and price 
premium – note future oversupply risks
 Agriculture commodities such as potash and
phosphate present solid long term 
fundamentals based on needs of growing world 
population

New Opportunities
BCI is also actively considering new projects and other commodities
Rationale:
Create growth opportunities
Diversify commodity exposure and risk profile
BCI tenement exploration
New project opportunities
 Current BCI tenements in Pilbara are prospective for
 Disciplined approach to assessing Australian
gold and base metals
opportunities and allocating capital
 Conduct low cost greenfields exploration at the most
 Target criteria:
prospective projects ($1-2M/a)
 Low priority tenements being rationalised
 Attractive value proposition with upside
 Low capital requirement relative to value
 Earnings potential within 2 years
 Gold, industrial minerals, agricultural
minerals and iron ore
16 16
BCI Exploration Tenements and Royalties
 Portfolio of exploration projects that are
prospective for iron ore, gold, base 
metals and salt
 Potential iron ore royalty over Rio Tinto-
owned Koodaideri South tenement
 Potential deferred payments / royalties
over AAMC’s iron ore projects
 Low cost greenfields exploration at the
most prospective projects
 Low priority projects being rationalised
 FY17 budget of ~A$1M, staged with
decision points
