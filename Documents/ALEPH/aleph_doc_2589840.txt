NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.    Basis of Presentation
Nature of Business
Natural Resource Partners L.P. (the "Partnership") engages principally in the business of
owning, operating, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the
United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, oil and gas, construction
aggregates, frac sand and other natural resources. As used in these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, the terms "NRP," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Natural Resource Partners
L.P. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.
Principles of Consolidation and Reporting
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts
to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.
As described in Note 2. Segment Information, we reclassified certain prior period amounts to
conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance. In particular, prior
year general and administrative charges that were allocated to operating segments have been
reclassified to Operating and maintenance expenses and Operating and maintenance expenses
—affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The prior period
reclassifications for new segments had no impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial
position, net income (loss) or cash flows.
As described in Note 3. Discontinued Operations, we reclassified the operations of the
Partnership's non-operated oil and gas working interest assets to discontinued operations and
reclassified its related assets and liabilities to assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods
presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
On January 1, 2016, the Partnership adopted a new accounting standard using a retrospective
approach that required the presentation of the Partnership's debt issuance costs as a direct
deduction from the related debt liability, rather than recorded as an asset. The adoption resulted
in a reclassification that reduced other current assets and short-term debt by $0.2 million and
reduced other assets and long-term debt (including affiliate) by $13.8 million on the Partnership’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.
On January 26, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner approved a 1-for-10 reverse
split on our common units, effective following market close on February 17, 2016. Pursuant to the
authorization provided, the Partnership completed the 1-for-10 reverse unit split and its common
units began trading on a reverse unit split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange on
February 18, 2016. As a result of the reverse unit split, every 10 outstanding common units were
combined into one common unit. The reverse unit split reduced the number of common units
outstanding from 122.3 million units to 12.2 million units. All unit and per unit data included in
these consolidated financial statements has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse unit
split.
In the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership determined its net cash provided by operating
activities and net cash used by financing activities were understated by $8.0 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2016. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 has been corrected for this error.
In our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and related notes included in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a
full year.

NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—CONTINUED
(Unaudited)
Management’s Forecast, Strategic Plan and Going Concern Analysis
    
While NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable
operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics continue to
be impacted by demand challenges for coal. As described in Note 8. Debt and Debt—Affiliate,
NRP Operating LLC ("Opco"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, has debt agreements that
contain customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other covenants.
In addition, NRP has issued $425 million of 9.125% Senior Notes due October 2018 that are
governed by an indenture (the "Indenture") containing customary incurrence-based financial
covenants and other covenants, but not maintenance covenants. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, sold all of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets
and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the NRP Oil and Gas reserve based lending facility
(the "RBL Facility") in full. The following discussion presents management’s going concern
analysis in light of management’s outlook and strategic plan to address its debt covenant
compliance and maturities.
As of June 30, 2016, Opco had $260.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving
credit facility (the "Opco Credit Facility") with scheduled commitment reductions of $50.0 million
on December 31, 2016, $30.0 million on June 30, 2017, $30.0 million on December 31, 2017 and
the remaining $150 million on June 30, 2018. In addition, as of June 30, 2016 Opco had $537.6
million outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes with scheduled principal
payments of $80.8 million through June 30, 2017 (the "Opco Private Placement Notes")
(collectively referred to as the "Opco Debt agreements"). The maximum leverage ratio under the
Opco Debt agreements is required not to exceed 4.0x. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements
contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco’s
ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and
engage in business combinations. Opco's leverage ratio was 2.84x at June 30, 2016.
Our going concern analysis includes an evaluation of relevant conditions and events including
the Partnership's ability to meet its obligations and remain in compliance with its debt covenants
over the next twelve months. We currently forecast that we will meet the Partnership's
obligations, that we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the Opco Debt
agreements and that we will continue as a going concern. However, our forecast is sensitive to
commodity pricing and counterparty risk. Breaches of the Opco Debt agreement covenants that
are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would result in an event of default under the Opco
Debt agreements, and if such debt is accelerated by the lenders thereunder, such acceleration
would also result in a cross-default under the Indenture. We are currently pursuing or considering
a number of actions in order to mitigate the effects of adverse market developments which could
otherwise cause us to breach financial covenants under the Opco Debt agreements. These
actions include (i) dispositions of assets, (ii) actively managing our debt capital structure through
a number of potential alternatives, including exchange offers and non-traditional debt and equity
financing, (iii) minimizing our capital expenditures, (iv) obtaining waivers or amendments from
our lenders, (v) effectively managing our working capital, (vi) improving our cash flows from
operations and (vii) engaging legal and financial advisers to assist us in this process.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended its guidance on revenue
recognition. The core principle of this amendment is that an entity should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
 The guidance will also require enhanced disclosures, provide more comprehensive guidance for
transactions such as service revenue and contract modifications, and enhance guidance for
multiple-element arrangements. The Partnership is required to adopt this guidance in the first
quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Partnership is currently
evaluating the provisions of this guidance and has not determined the impact this guidance may
have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure or decided upon the method
of adoption.
The FASB issued guidance on management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. The new guidance will require a formal assessment of going concern by
management based on criteria prescribed in the new guidance, but will not impact the
Partnership's financial position or results of operations. This guidance is effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is
permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not
previously been issued. The Partnership is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements and related disclosure and reviewing its policies and
processes to ensure compliance with this new guidance upon adoption.

NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—CONTINUED
(Unaudited)
The FASB issued authoritative guidance which intended to simplify the measurement of
inventory. This guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net
realizable value, and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The
Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial
statements.
The FASB issued authoritative lease guidance that requires lessees to recognize assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet for the present value of the rights and obligations created by all
leases with terms of more than 12 months. The guidance also requires disclosures designed to
give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after
December 31, 2018. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
The FASB issued authoritative guidance that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology
in the current standard with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss
estimates. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 31,
2019. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements.
2.    Segment Information
Due to acquisitions that diversified our natural resource asset base, effective for the quarter
ended December 31, 2015, management revised the Partnership's operating segments to align
with its management structure and organizational responsibilities and revised the information that
its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance. As a result, effective for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we
reported our financial performance based on the new segments as described below.
The Partnership's segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to
different customer segments in different geographies within the U.S. and that are managed
accordingly. NRP has the following four operating segments:
Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty and Other—consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related
transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and
timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western
United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across
the United States. In February 2016, we sold reserves and related royalty rights at three
aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee.
Soda Ash—consists of the Partnership's 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining
operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our
operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both
domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular
quarterly distributions from this business.
VantaCore—consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that
operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt
plants and marine terminals. VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee,
Kentucky and Louisiana.
Oil and Gas—consists of our royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural
gas properties. We own fee mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests in oil and gas
properties in Oklahoma and Louisiana. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty
interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin. In July 2016, we
completed the sale of all of our Williston Basin non-operated working interest assets in North
Dakota and Montana. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations for additional details about our
discontinued operations. During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership plans to transition the
management responsibilities and reporting of its remaining oil and gas royalty assets into the
Coal and Hard Minerals Royalty and Other operating segment.
Direct segment costs and certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that
benefit the Partnership's segments are allocated to the operating segments. These allocated
costs include costs of: taxes, legal, information technology and shared facilities services and are
included in Operating and maintenance expenses and Operating and maintenance expenses—

administrative charges that are allocated

to the operating segments have been reclassified to operating and maintenance expenses.
Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.
Corporate and Financing includes functional corporate departments that do not earn revenues.
Costs incurred by these departments include corporate headquarters and overhead, financing,
centralized treasury and accounting and other corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to
a segment.

3.    Discontinued Operations
In June 2016, the Partnership determined it met held for sale criteria for its non-operated oil and
gas working interest assets. In June 2016, NRP Oil and Gas signed a definitive agreement to sell
these assets for $116.1 million, subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price
adjustments. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas closed this transaction, which had an effective date
of April 1, 2016.
The Partnership's exit from its non-operated oil and gas working interest business represents a
strategic shift to reduce debt and focus on its aggregates, soda ash and coal and hard minerals
business segments. As a result, we have classified the operating results and cash flows of our
non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated
statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods
presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations
are classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. The assets and liabilities of
our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as of June 30, 2016 are classified as
current in our consolidated balance sheet as we closed on the transaction in July 2016.
Remaining in the Oil and Gas segment is our investments in royalty interests in oil and natural
gas properties that the Partnership plan to transition into the Coal Hard Minerals Royalty and
Other operating segement during the third quarter of 2016.

issuance of NRP Senior Notes were approximately $289.0 million. The NRP Senior Notes call
for semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and will mature on
October 1, 2018.
In October 2014, NRP, together with NRP Finance as co-issuer, issued an additional $125.0
million of the NRP Senior Notes at an offering price of 99.5% of par. The additional issuance
constituted the same series of securities as the existing NRP Senior Notes. Net proceeds of
$122.6 million from the additional issuance of the NRP Senior Notes were used to fund a portion
of the purchase price of NRP’s acquisition of non-operated working interests in oil and gas
assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota.
NRP and NRP Finance have the option to redeem the NRP Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at
any time on or after April 1, 2016, at fixed redemption prices specified in the indenture
governing the NRP Senior Notes (the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains covenants that,
among other things, limit the ability of NRP and certain of its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee
additional indebtedness. Under the Indenture, NRP and certain of its subsidiaries generally are
not permitted to incur additional indebtedness unless, on a consolidated basis, the fixed charge
coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0 for the four preceding full fiscal
quarters. The ability of NRP and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness is
further limited in the event the amount of indebtedness of NRP and certain of its subsidiaries that
is senior to NRP’s unsecured indebtedness exceeds certain thresholds.
Opco Debt
All of Opco’s debt is guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiaries and is secured by certain of the
assets of Opco and its wholly owned subsidiaries other than NRP Trona LLC, as further
described below. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Opco was in compliance with the
terms of the financial covenants contained in its debt agreements.
Opco Credit Facility
•
•
•
In June 2016, Opco entered into an amendment (the "First Amendment") to its $300.0 million
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Opco Credit Facility") that is guaranteed by all of
Opco’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and is secured by liens on certain of the assets of Opco and
its subsidiaries, as further described below. Under the First Amendment:
The maturity date of the Opco Credit Facility was extended from October 1, 2017 to June 30,
2018;
The maximum leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as
defined in the Opco Credit Facility) has been amended to remain at 4.0x for the remaining term
of the Opco Credit Facility, including for the period ending June 30, 2016; and
The asset sale covenant was amended to allow asset sales of up to $300.0 million from and
after the effective date of the First Amendment; provided, however, that 75% of the net cash
proceeds of any such asset sales must be used to repay the Opco Credit Facility (without any
corresponding commitment reduction) and/or NRP Opco’s Senior Notes described below.
  
On the effective date of the First Amendment, the total commitment under the Opco Credit Facility
was reduced from $300.0 million to $260.0 million. In addition, Opco and the lenders agreed to
further reduce commitments under the Opco Credit Facility to (a) $210.0 million on December 31,
2016, (b) $180.0 million on June 30, 2017 and (c) $150.0 million on December 31, 2017. Opco
will have the right to delay any of these commitment reductions by up to 90 days each upon the
agreement of the lenders holding 66.7% of the then-existing commitments. To the extent any
such commitment reduction is extended under the terms of the A&R Revolving Credit Facility,
Opco's ability to make distributions to the Partnership will be limited to amounts necessary for the
Partnership to pay taxes and other general partnership expenses and make interest payments on
its 9.125% Senior Notes due 2018.

(Unaudited)
In addition to the 4.0x leverage ratio described above, the Opco Credit Facility requires Opco to
maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDDA to consolidated fixed charges (consisting of
consolidated interest expense and consolidated lease expense) of not less than 3.5 to 1.0. As of
June 30, 2016, Opco's leverage ratio was 2.84x, and fixed charge coverage ratio was 5.67x.
Effective on the date of the First Amendment, indebtedness under the Opco Credit Facility bears
interest, at Opco's option, at:
the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by the agent bank; (ii) the federal funds rate plus
0.50%; or (iii) LIBOR plus 1%, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to
3.50%; or
•a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.50% to 4.50%.
•
The weighted average interest rates for the borrowings outstanding under the Opco Credit
Facility for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 4.11% and 2.19%,
respectively. The weighted average interest rates for the borrowings outstanding under the Opco
Credit Facility for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 3.95% and 2.07%,
respectively.
Opco will incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate of
0.50% per annum. Opco may prepay all amounts outstanding under the Opco Credit Facility at
any time without penalty.
The Opco Credit Facility contains certain additional customary negative covenants that, among
other items, restrict Opco’s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make
investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations. Included in the investment
covenant are restrictions upon Opco’s ability to acquire assets where Opco does not maintain
certain levels of liquidity. The Opco Credit Facility also contains customary events of default,
including cross-defaults under Opco’s senior notes (as described below).
The Opco Credit Facility is collateralized and secured by liens on certain of Opco’s assets with a
carrying values of $691.2 million and $709.9 million classified as Land, Mineral rights and Plant
and equipment on the Partnership’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The collateral includes (1) the equity interests in all of Opco’s
wholly owned subsidiaries, other than NRP Trona LLC (which owns a 49% non-controlling
equity interest in Ciner Wyoming), (2) the personal property and fixtures owned by Opco’s wholly
owned subsidiaries, other than NRP Trona LLC, (3) Opco’s material coal royalty revenue
producing properties, (4) real property associated with certain of VantaCore’s construction
aggregates mining operations, and (5) certain of Opco’s coal-related infrastructure assets.
Opco Senior Notes
Opco has issued several series of private placement senior notes (the "Opco Senior Notes") with
various interest rates and principal due dates. As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the
Opco Senior Notes had cumulative principal balances of $537.6 million and $585.9 million,
respectively. Opco made principal payments of $48.3 million on the Opco Senior Notes during
each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
•
The Note Purchase Agreements relating to the Opco Senior Notes contain covenants requiring
Opco to: 
maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the note
purchase agreement) of no more than 4.0 to 1.0 for the four most recent quarters;
not permit debt secured by certain liens and debt of subsidiaries to exceed 10% of consolidated
net tangible assets (as defined in the note purchase agreement); and
maintain the ratio of consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the note purchase agreement) to
consolidated fixed charges (consisting of consolidated interest expense and consolidated
operating lease expense) at not less than 3.5 to 1.0.
•
•
The 8.38% and 8.92% Opco Senior Notes also provide that in the event that Opco’s leverage
ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the Note Purchase
Agreements) exceeds 3.75 to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter, then in addition to all other
interest accruing on these notes, additional interest in the amount of 2.00% per annum shall
accrue on the notes for the two succeeding quarters and for as long thereafter as the leverage
ratio remains above 3.75 to 1.00. Opco has not exceeded the 3.75 to 1.00 ratio at the end of any
fiscal quarter through June 30, 2016.

In connection with the entry into an amendment to the Opco Credit Facility in June 2015, Opco
entered into the Third Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreements (the "NPA Amendment")
that provides for the security of the Opco Senior Notes by the same collateral package pledged
by Opco and its subsidiaries to secure the A&R Revolving Credit Facility, as described above. In
addition, the NPA Amendment includes a covenant that provides that, in the event Opco or any of
its subsidiaries is subject to any additional or more restrictive covenants under the agreements
governing its material indebtedness (including the A&R Revolving Credit Facility, and all
renewals, amendments or restatements thereof), such covenants shall be deemed to be
incorporated by reference in the Opco Senior Notes and the holders of the Opco Senior Notes
shall receive the benefit of such additional or more restrictive covenants to the same extent as the
lenders under such material indebtedness agreement. Certain holders of the Opco Senior Notes
have communicated to us that they believe they are entitled to consideration under this provision
in connection with the First Amendment to the Opco Credit Facility. We are evaluating the
noteholders’ assertions and are in active discussions with them. We are unable to estimate the
outcome of these discussions at this time.
NRP Oil and Gas Debt Classified as Liabilities of Discontinued Operations
The RBL Facility
In August 2013, NRP Oil and Gas entered into the RBL Facility, a senior secured, reserve-based
revolving credit facility, in order to fund capital expenditure requirements related to the
development of the oil and gas assets in which it owned non-operated working interests. The
RBL Facility was secured by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the
assets of NRP Oil and Gas. NRP Oil and Gas was the sole obligor under the RBL Facility, and
neither the Partnership nor any of its other subsidiaries was a guarantor of the RBL Facility.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $75.0 million and $85.0 million
respectively, outstanding under the RBL Facility. As described in Note 3. Discontinued
Operations, the Partnership included this debt and its related interest expense in discontinued
operations. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas LLC closed the sale of its Williston Basin non-
operated working interest assets and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the RBL Facility in
full.
In March 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the RBL Facility (the "Fourth
Amendment"). Per the Fourth Amendment, the borrowing base would have been reduced to
$70.0 million on August 1, 2016, and to $50.0 million on October 1, 2016, with any outstanding
amounts under the RBL Facility in excess of the reduced principal amounts due and payable on
their respective day. The next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base under the RBL
Facility would have occured in November 2016.
•
The Fourth Amendment amended the financial covenants contained in the RBL Facility as
follows:
The maximum total leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of the total debt to EBITDAX) was
increased from 3.5x to 4.0x at March 31, 2016 and 4.5x at June 30, 2016. Thereafter, the total
leverage ratio would have decreased to 3.5x for the remainder of the term of the RBL Facility.
The minimum current ratio decreased from 1.0x to 0.75x at March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016
and would have reverted to 1.0x thereafter for the remainder of the term of the RBL Facility.
•
As of June 30, 2016, NRP Oil and Gas' leverage ratio was 3.98x, and current ratio was 2.61x.
NRP Oil and Gas was in compliance with the terms of the covenants contained in the RBL
Facility as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Effective on the date of the Fourth Amendment, indebtedness under the RBL Facility bore
interest, at the Company's option, at:
the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by the agent bank; (ii) the federal funds rate plus
0.50%; or (iii) LIBOR plus 4.0%; or
•a rate equal to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 4.0%.
•
The commitment fee on the unused portion of the borrowing base under the RBL Facility was
also amended to be a flat 0.50% fee.
The Fourth Amendment contained several other amendments, including a requirement for NRP
Oil and Gas to pay down the RBL Facility each month with excess cash flow (which amounts
may not be reborrowed and will result in a corresponding reduction

in the borrowing base) and a requirement to use the net proceeds of any asset sales to repay the
RBL Facility (which amounts may not be reborrowed and will result in a corresponding reduction
in the borrowing base). In addition, the Fourth Amendment waived the delivery of 2015 audited
financial statements containing an audit opinion containing "a "going concern" or like
qualification or exception" as an event of default under the RBL Facility.

Reimbursements to Affiliates of our General Partner
The Partnership’s general partner does not receive any management fee or other compensation
for its management of Natural Resource Partners L.P. However, in accordance with the
partnership agreement, the general partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for services provided
to the Partnership and for expenses incurred on the Partnership’s behalf. Employees of Quintana
Minerals Corporation ("QMC") and Western Pocahontas Properties Limited Partnership
("WPPLP"), affiliates of the Partnership, provide their services to manage the Company's
business. QMC and WPPLP charge the Partnership the portion of their employee salary and
benefits costs related to their employee services provided to NRP. In addition, the Partnership
receives non-cash equity contributions from its general partner related to compensation paid
directly by the general partner and not reimbursed by the Partnership. These amounts are
presented as non-cash equity contributions on the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of
Partners' Capital and were $0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. These QMC
and WPPLP employee management service costs and non-cash equity compensation expenses

Cline Affiliates
Various companies controlled by Chris Cline, including Foresight Energy LP ("Foresight
Energy"), lease coal reserves from the Partnership, and the Partnership also leases coal
transportation assets to these companies for a fee. Mr. Cline, both individually and through
another affiliate, Adena Minerals, LLC, owns a 31% interest in the NRP's general partner, as well
as approximately 0.5 million of NRP's common units at June 30, 2016.
Coal related revenues from Foresight Energy totaled $16.9 million and $31.6 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Coal related revenues from Foresight
Energy totaled $27.0 million and $49.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had Accounts

Partnership had recorded $78.5 million and $82.6 million in minimum royalty payments as
Deferred revenue—affiliates at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The Partnership owns and leases rail load out and associated facilities to Foresight Energy at
Foresight Energy's Sugar Camp mine. The lease agreement is accounted for as a direct
financing lease. Total projected remaining payments under the lease at June 30, 2016 were
$78.9 million with unearned income of $33.6 million, and the net amount receivable was $45.3
million, of which $2.0 million is included in Accounts receivable—affiliates while the remaining is
included in Long-term contracts receivable—affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Total projected remaining payments under the lease at December 31, 2015

30, 2016.
Quintana Capital Group GP, Ltd.
Corbin J. Robertson, Jr. is a principal in Quintana Capital Group GP, Ltd. ("Quintana Capital"),
which controls several private equity funds focused on investments in the energy business. In
connection with the formation of Quintana Capital, the Partnership adopted a formal conflicts
policy that establishes the opportunities that will be pursued by the Partnership and those that
will be pursued by Quintana Capital. The governance documents of Quintana Capital’s affiliated
investment funds reflect the guidelines set forth in the Partnership's conflicts policy.
At June 30, 2016, a fund controlled by Quintana Capital owned a majority interest in Corsa Coal
Corp. ("Corsa"), a coal mining company traded on the TSX Venture Exchange that is one of the
Partnership’s lessees in Tennessee. Corbin J. Robertson III, one of the Partnership’s directors, is
Chairman of the Board of Corsa. Coal related revenues from Corsa totaled $0.6 million and $0.8
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $1.1 million and
$1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Partnership had
recorded $0.3 million in minimum royalty payments as Deferred revenue—affiliates at both June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Partnership also had Accounts receivable—affiliates
totaling $0.2 million from Corsa at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
WPPLP Production Royalty and Overriding Royalty
The Partnership recorded $0.1 million and $0.7 million in operating and maintenance expenses
—affiliates related to a non-participating production royalty payable to WPPLP pursuant to a
conveyance agreement entered into in 2007 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively. These charges were zero for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
The Partnership had Other assets—affiliate from WPPLP of $1.0 million and $1.1 million at June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively related to a non-production royalty receivable
from WPPLP for overriding royalty interest on a mine.
11.    Commitments and Contingencies
Legal
The Partnership is involved, from time to time, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business. While the ultimate results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty, Partnership management believes these claims will not have a material effect on the
Partnership’s financial position, liquidity or operations.
Since 2013, several citizen group lawsuits have been filed against landowners alleging ongoing
discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductivity, from valley fills located at
reclaimed mountaintop removal mining sites in West Virginia. In each case, the mine on the
subject property had been closed, the property had been reclaimed, and the state reclamation
bond had been released. Any determination that a landowner or lessee has liability for
discharges from a previously reclaimed mine site could result in substantial compliance costs or
fines and would result in uncertainty as to continuing liability for completed and reclaimed coal
mine operations. A subsidiary of the Partnership has been named as a defendant in one of these
lawsuits. The Partnership currently cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential loss, if any,
related to this matter.
Foresight Energy Disputes
In November 2015, we filed a lawsuit against Foresight Energy’s subsidiary, Hillsboro Energy
LLC ("Hillsboro"), in the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Montgomery County, Illinois.
The lawsuit alleges, among other items, breach of contract by Hillsboro resulting from a wrongful
declaration of force majeure at Hillsboro’s Deer Run mine in July 2015. In late March 2015,
elevated carbon monoxide readings were detected at the Deer Run mine, and coal production at
the mine was idled. In July 2015, we received the notice declaring a force majeure event at the
mine as a result of the elevated carbon monoxide levels.
20
NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—CONTINUED
(Unaudited)
The effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to
pay us minimum deficiency payments of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year.
Foresight Energy's failure to make the deficiency payment with respect to 2015 and the first half
of 2016 resulted in a cumulative $31.0 million negative cash impact to us. Such amount will
increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. We do not
currently have an estimate as to when the mine will resume coal production. If the mine remains
idled for an extended period or if the mine is permanently closed, our financial condition could be
adversely affected.
In April, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Macoupin Energy, LLC ("Macoupin"), a subsidiary of
Foresight Energy, in Macoupin County, Illinois. The lawsuit alleges that Macoupin has failed to
comply with the terms of its coal mining, rail loadout and rail loop leases by incorrectly recouping
previously paid minimum royalties. Foresight Energy’s failure to properly calculate its recoupable
balance and failure to make payments in accordance with these lease agreements with respect
to the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first half of 2016 resulted in a cumulative $4.7
million negative cash impact to us. While the Partnership plans to pursue its claim, a valuation
allowance for the receivable amount has been recorded. It is possible that the Partnership’s
current estimate of the valuation allowance related to this matter could change, perhaps
materially, in the future.

13.    Unit-Based Compensation
At the time of our initial public offering, GP Natural Resource Partners LLC adopted the Natural
Resource Partners Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Incentive Plan") for directors of
GP Natural Resource Partners LLC and employees of its affiliates who perform services for the
Partnership. The Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee ("CNG Committee") of
GP Natural Resource Partners LLC’s board of directors administers the Long-Term Incentive
Plan and has historically approved annual awards of phantom units that vest four years from the
date of grant. In February 2016, the CNG Committee adopted and the Board approved a new
cash-based long-term incentive plan to the employees of its affiliates who perform services for
the Partnership.
Subject to the rules of the exchange upon which the common units are listed at the time, the
board of directors and the compensation committee of the board of directors have the right to alter
or amend the Long-Term Incentive Plan or any part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan from time to
time. Except upon the occurrence of unusual or nonrecurring events, no change in any
outstanding grant may be made that would materially reduce the benefit intended to be made
available to a participant without the consent of the participant.
Phantom units are incentive based equity awards issued to employees over a vesting period that
entitle the grantee to receive the cash equivalent to the value of a unit of our common units upon
each vesting. The Partnership records compensation cost equal to the fair value of the award at
the measurement date, which is determined to be the earlier of the performance commitment date
or the service completion date. In addition, compensation cost for unvested phantom unit awards
is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the Partnership’s unit price. Under the plan a grantee will
receive the market value of a common unit in cash upon vesting. Market value is defined as the
average closing price over the 20 trading days prior to the vesting date. The compensation
committee may make grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan to employees and directors
containing such terms as it determines, including the vesting period. Outstanding grants vest
upon a change in control of the Partnership, the general partner, or GP Natural Resource
Partners LLC. If a grantee’s employment or membership on the board of directors terminates for
any reason, outstanding grants will be automatically forfeited unless and to the extent the
compensation committee provides otherwise.
In connection with the phantom unit awards, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance
Committee also granted tandem Distribution Equivalent Rights ("DERs"), which entitle the
holders to receive distributions equal to the distributions paid on the

Grants typically vest at the end of a four-year period and are paid in cash upon vesting. The
Partnership recorded expenses related to its Long-Term Incentive Plan of $0.2 million for both
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. The Partnership also recorded a credit to
expenses related to its Long-Term Incentive plan of $1.4 million and $1.5 million for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively due to the decline in the market price of the
Partnership's common units during the period.
In connection with the Long-Term Incentive Plan, payments are typically made during the first
quarter of the year. Payments of $1.5 million and $4.4 million were made during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The unaccrued cost associated with unvested
outstanding grants and related DERs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $0.5 million
and $0.7 million, respectively.

17. Deferred Revenue and Deferred Revenue—Affiliate
Most of the Partnership’s coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly
payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments
are recorded as deferred revenue when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the
minimum payment is recognized as revenue based upon the underlying mineral lease when the
lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following
the expiration of the lessee’s ability to recoup the payments. The Partnership’s deferred revenue
(including affiliate) consist of the following (in thousands):

Lease Modifications, Termination and Forfeitures of Minimum Royalty Balances
In April 2016, the Partnership entered into agreements with certain lessees to either modify or
terminate existing coal related leases that resulted in the Partnership recognizing approximately
$35 million of deferred revenue in April 2016 as follows:
•An agreement that terminated a central Appalachia coal royalty lease and resulted in the lessee
forfeiting the right to recoup $26.2 million of minimum royalties previously paid to the Partnership.
The Partnership agreed to transfer its coal mineral rights that were subject to this former lease to
the lessee. This terminated lease had no current or planned production and the mineral rights
transferred had zero net book value on the Partnership's consolidated Balance Sheets as of
March 31, 2016. As a result of this transaction, in April 2016 the Partnership recognized $26.2
million of revenue.
•Lease modifications of existing coal royalty leases resulted in lessee forfeiture of rights to
recoup previously paid minimum royalties and the reduction in lessee recoupment time. As a
result of these modifications, in April 2016 the Partnership recognized approximately $9 million of
revenue.

The following discussion and analysis presents management’s view of our business, financial
condition and overall performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this filing. Our discussion and analysis
consists of the following subjects:

Executive Overview
We are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning,
managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including
interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates, frac sand, crude oil and natural
gas, and other natural resources. Our business is organized into four operating segments:
Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty and Other—consists primarily of coal royalty, coal related
transportation and processing assets, aggregate and industrial minerals royalty assets and
timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western
United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across
the United States. In February 2016, we sold reserves and related royalty rights at three
aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee.
Soda Ash—consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation
and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating
partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both
domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular
quarterly distributions from this business.
VantaCore—consists of our construction materials business acquired in October 2014 that
operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt
plants and marine terminals. VantaCore operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee,
Kentucky and Louisiana.
Oil and Gas—consists of our royalty interests and overriding royalty interests in oil and natural
gas properties. We own fee mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests in oil and gas
properties in Oklahoma and Louisiana. In February 2016, we sold royalty and overriding royalty
interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin. In July 2016, we
completed the sale of all of our Williston Basin non-operated working interest assets in North
Dakota and Montana. During the third quarter of 2016, we plan to transition the management
responsibilities and reporting of its remaining oil and gas royalty assets into the Coal and Hard
Minerals Royalty and Other operating segment.

Current Liquidity Position
As of June 30, 2016, we had $21.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $2.0 million in
cash related to our discontinued operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
repaid approximately $108.5 million of debt including $48.5 million of the Opco’s senior notes
and utility local improvement obligation, $50.0 million under Opco’s revolving credit facility and
$10.0 million under the NRP Oil and Gas RBL facility, each discussed below. In July 2016, we
repaid the remaining balance of $75.0 million under the NRP Oil and Gas RBL facility in full with
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of all of our non-operated oil and gas working interests
assets.
We have significant debt service requirements, including $80.8 million in principal payments on
Opco's senior notes (the "Opco Senior Notes") due each year through 2018, and scheduled
commitment reductions under Opco’s $260.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Opco Credit
Facility") by $50 million at December 31, 2016, an additional $30 million at June 30, 2017, and
29
an additional $30.0 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, our operating results continue to
be impacted by the adverse conditions in the commodity markets. We continue to implement our
long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity in order to
reposition the Partnership for future growth. As part of this plan, we reduced our cash
distributions during 2015 by over 87%. The cash savings resulting from the distribution
reductions are being used primarily to repay debt. We also reduced general and administrative
and other overhead costs in connection with these efforts.
However, we have determined that the cash savings from the distribution cuts and our cost
reduction efforts will not be sufficient to meet our deleveraging objectives and have determined to
sell certain assets and pursue alternative financing arrangements to help meet these objectives.
In February 2016, we sold the aggregates reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates
operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee for $10.0 million in cash. In February 2016,
we also sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the
Appalachian Basin, including our overriding royalty interests in the Marcellus Shale, for $37.5
million in cash. The sale included royalty and overriding royalty interests in approximately 765
gross producing wells as of December 31, 2015. In July 2016, we completed the sale of NRP Oil
and Gas LLC's non-operated working interest oil and gas assets in the Williston Basin for $116.1
million in cash, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments, and used a portion
of the proceeds to repay the $75.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the NRP Oil and Gas
RBL Facility in full. This sale had an effective date of April 1, 2016.
While we have closed several asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional
asset sales and/or pursue alternative financing transactions and conditions in the commodity
markets do not improve, our liquidity and our ability to comply with the financial and other
restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements will be adversely affected. See "—
Management's Forecast and Strategic Plan" below for further discussion.

Although the thermal and metallurgical coal markets remain challenged in the near term, prices
have improved recently for both commodities.  As of June 30, 2016, coal production in the United
States was down approximately 27% over 2015 production, and warm summer weather has led
to drawdowns from inventories.  However, there are still significant stockpiles at the utilities, and
the strong dollar remains a headwind for exports.  We believe that additional tons will come out of
the market over the remainder of 2016, but that the market is moving towards an equilibrium that
could lead to improved pricing in 2017.
Although the U.S. coal industry is under pressure, we do not know to what extent our properties
will be affected. A number of coal producers have filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and additional producers may file for bankruptcy. Historically,
our leases have generally been assumed and all pre-petition bankruptcy amounts have been
cured in full in our lessees’ bankruptcy processes, but we have no assurance this will continue in
the future. Alpha Natural Resources ("Alpha"), which is our second largest lessee, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Alpha has continued operating and paying
royalties to us following the bankruptcy filing. Alpha’s plan of reorganization was approved in
July 2016, and the majority of our leases were accepted and assumed by either Contura Energy,
which acquired certain core coal assets from Alpha in the bankruptcy, or by the reorganized
Alpha. We expect to receive all pre-petition amounts due to us with respect to the leases
assumed. We believe that each of Contura and the reorganized Alpha will continue to rationalize
coal production until the
30
coal markets stabilize. We do not know to what extent our properties will be affected. Arch Coal,
Inc. ("Arch") and Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in January 2016 and April 2016, respectively. Our overall exposure to both Arch and
Peabody is immaterial; however, we expect our Arch leases to be assumed in the third quarter
and to receive all pre-petition amounts due to us.
While producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal have struggled for an extended period due
to the high cost nature of their operations, production from our Illinois Basin properties also
decreased by 34% in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
Substantially all of the decrease in production from our Illinois Basin properties is attributable to
the idling of Foresight Energy's Deer Run mine (which we also refer to as our Hillsboro property)
as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine beginning in March 2015. In July
2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a resulting force majeure event at
the Deer Run mine. While we have filed a lawsuit disputing Foresight Energy’s claim of force
majeure, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its
obligation to pay us quarterly minimum deficiency payments with respect to the Deer Run mine
until mining resumes. Under the lease for the Deer Run mine, Foresight Energy is required to
make minimum deficiency payments to us of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year.
The amount payable to us as the minimum deficiency payment with respect to any quarter is
reduced by the amount of coal royalties actually paid to us for tonnage sold at the mine with
respect to that quarter. We received royalty payments on tonnage sold from coal stockpiles at the
Deer Run mine during 2015, but these stockpiles have been depleted. Foresight Energy’s failure
to make the deficiency payments with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 and
the first half of 2016 resulted in a cumulative negative cash impact to us of $31.0 million. Such
amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled.
Foresight Energy has temporarily sealed the mine, and is continuing efforts to cure the elevated
carbon monoxide levels, but we do not know when, or if, mining activities at the Deer Run mine
will recommence.
While the metallurgical coal markets continue to remain depressed, the benchmark pricing has
increased over 10% in 2016, and recent spot prices have exceeded $100/ton. We derived
approximately 34% of our coal royalty revenues and 38% of the related production from
metallurgical coal during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The global metallurgical coal
market continues to suffer from oversupply driven in part by reduced demand from China.
Domestic coal producers are also burdened by the effects of the relatively strong U.S. dollar,
which increases the production cost of domestic coal producers relative to foreign producers.

Income from our trona mining and soda ash refinery investment was lower year-over-year for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 due to certain operational and production related issues. We
believe these issues have been resolved, the market remains firm, and that we expect to see
operational improvements from Ciner Wyoming over the remainder of the year. Domestic sales
volumes, which are typically sold at higher prices than soda ash sold internationally, have
remained relatively stable. Ciner Resources LP., our partner that controls and operates Ciner
Wyoming, is a publicly traded master limited partnership that predominantly depends on
distributions from Ciner Wyoming in order to make distributions to its public unitholders.

VantaCore’s construction aggregates mining and production business is largely dependent on
the strength of the local markets that it serves and is also seasonal, with lower production and
sales expected during the first quarter of each year due to winter weather. VantaCore’s Laurel
Aggregates operation in southwestern Pennsylvania serves producers and oilfield service
companies operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and was impacted during the first half of
2016 by the slowing pace of exploration and development of natural gas in those areas due to
low natural gas prices. Increased local construction activity partially offset these declines during
the six months ended June 30, 2016, but we expect that Laurel’s business will continue to be
impacted by decreased natural gas development activities. In June 2015, VantaCore purchased
a hard rock quarry operation located on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, Kentucky from
one of NRP’s aggregates lessees that had previously idled the operation. This operation
continues to lease reserves from NRP and sells its produced limestone aggregates in both the
local market and downstream to river-based markets. While VantaCore's production and
revenues have declined in 2016 compared to 2015, it's effective variable cost management
strategies have enabled the business to maintain its 2016 net income within budget.
Oil and Gas Business Segment
On June 14, 2016, NRP Oil and Gas signed a definitive agreement to sell its non-operated oil
and gas working interest assets in the Williston Basin for $116.1 million, subject to customary
closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas closed this
transaction. The Partnership's exit from its non-operated oil and gas working interest business
represented a strategic shift to reduce debt and focus on its aggregates, soda ash and coal and
hard minerals business segments. As a result, we have classified the operating results and cash
flows of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as discontinued operations in our
consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows for
all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with discontinued
operations are classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. The assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 2016 are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet as we
closed on the transaction in July 2016.
32
Management’s Forecast and Strategic Plan
    
Opco’s revolving credit facility has scheduled commitment reductions as described above and
matures in June 2018 and NRP’s 9.125% Senior Notes mature in October 2018. We believe we
need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the maturity thereof in order to be able to
refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our strategic plan announced in April
2015 to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps
to execute on that plan, including through asset sales and other means. During the first quarter of
2016, we completed asset sales for $46.3 million in gross proceeds. In July 2016 we closed on
the sale of our NRP Oil and Gas non-operated working interest assets in the Williston Basin for
$116.1 million in gross proceeds and repaid the NRP Oil and Gas revolving credit facility in full.
However, we believe deterioration in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative
impact on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage
ratio goals including those in our debt agreement financial covenants. Historically, we have
accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and relied on bank credit
facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price
environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have
the ability to access either the traditional debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility
in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of
companies with coal and/or oil and gas exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking
to reduce or eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be
required over the near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from
operations or asset sales. In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional
sources at unfavorable pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or
restructure our 2018 debt maturities.
While NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable
operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics continue to
be impacted by demand challenges for coal. In particular, as described in Note 8. Debt and Debt
—Affiliate, Opco, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRP, has debt agreements that contain
customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other covenants. In
addition, NRP has issued $425 million of 9.125% Senior Notes that are governed by an
indenture (the "Indenture") containing customary incurrence-based financial covenants and other
covenants, but not maintenance covenants. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary, closed the sale of its Williston Basin non-operated working interest assets and used a
portion of the proceeds to repay the RBL Facility in full. The following discussion presents
management’s going concern analysis in light of management’s outlook and strategic plan to
address its debt covenant compliance and maturities.
As of June 30, 2016, Opco had $260.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Opco
Credit Facility with scheduled commitment reductions of $50.0 million on December 31, 2016,
$30.0 million on June 30, 2017, $30.0 million on December 31, 2017 and the remaining $150
million on June 30, 2018. In addition, as of June 30, 2016 Opco had $537.6 million outstanding
under the Opco Senior Notes with scheduled principal payments of $80.8 million through June
30, 2017 (collectively referred to as the "Opco Debt agreements"). The maximum leverage ratio
under the Opco Debt agreements is required not to exceed 4.0x. In addition, the Opco Debt
agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items,
restrict Opco’s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell
assets and engage in business combinations. Opco's leverage ratio was 2.84x at June 30, 2016.
The agreements governing the Opco Senior Notes also include a covenant that provides that, in
the event Opco or any of its subsidiaries are subject to any additional or more restrictive
covenants under the agreements governing its material indebtedness (including the Opco Credit
Facility), such covenants shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Opco Senior
notes and the holders of the Opco Senior Notes shall receive the benefit of such additional or
more restrictive covenants to the same extent as the lenders under such material indebtedness
agreement. Certain holders of the Opco Senior Notes have communicated to us that they believe
they are entitled to consideration under this provision in connection with the First Amendment to
the Opco Credit Facility.  We are evaluating the noteholders’ assertions and are in active
discussions with them.
Our going concern analysis includes an evaluation of relevant conditions and events including
the Partnership's ability to meet its obligations and remain in compliance with its debt covenants
over the next twelve months. We currently forecast that we will meet the Partnership's
obligations, that we will be in compliance with all of the covenants under the Opco Debt
agreements and that we will continue as a going concern. However, breaches of the Opco Debt
agreement covenants that are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would result in an
event of default under the Opco Debt agreements, and if such debt is accelerated by the lenders
thereunder, such acceleration would also result in a cross-default under the Indenture. We are
currently pursuing or considering a number of actions in order to mitigate the effects of adverse
market developments which could otherwise cause us to breach financial covenants under the
Opco Debt agreements. These actions include (i) dispositions of assets, (ii) actively managing
our debt capital structure through a number of potential alternatives, including exchange offers
and non-traditional debt and equity financing, (iii) minimizing our capital expenditures, (iv)
obtaining waivers or amendments from our lenders, (v)
33
effectively managing our working capital, (vi) improving our cash flows from operations and (vii)
engaging legal and financial advisers to assist us in this process.

2016. Absent this adjustment, production in the Northern Appalachia region was 0.2 million tons,
average revenue per ton was $2.08 and revenue was $0.4 million.

Total coal production decreased 7.5 million tons, or 54%, from 14.0 million tons in the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to 6.5 million tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Total
coal royalty revenues decreased $15.9 million, or 42%, from $38.4 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to $22.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Total production
decreased in all of our regions, with a corresponding decrease in revenue in all regions. Total
revenues and other income within the segment increased as a result of several lease
modifications and terminations in the second quarter of 2016 that more than offset the decrease
in coal royalty revenues.
Soda Ash
Revenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment decreased $1.4 million, or 12%,
from $11.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $10.2 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to lower domestic and international
prices compared to the prior year.
VantaCore
Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment decreased $9.3 million, or 23%,
from $41.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $31.7 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in brokered stone revenue as
well as reduced delivery and fuel income quarter-over-quarter. This decrease was partially offset
by an increase in construction revenue. Tonnage sold by the VantaCore segment decreased 0.2
million tons, or 10% from 2.0 million tons in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 1.8 million
tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Operating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)
Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) decreased $8.1 million, or 20%, from
$40.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $32.2 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the following:
VantaCore
Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) in our VantaCore segment decreased
$8.1 million, or 25% from $32.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $24.5 million
in the three months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to effective variable cost
management and the decline in materials cost as a result of the decrease in brokered stone
volume quarter-over-quarter.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD&A") Expense
DD&A expense decreased $7.9 million, or 41%, from $19.1 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $11.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is
primarily related to the reduction of the cost basis of our coal and aggregate mineral rights due to
the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the decline in
production quarter-over-quarter.
General and Administrative (including affiliates) ("G&A") Expense
Corporate and financing G&A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters,
financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $1.8 million, or 82%,
from $2.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $4.0 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016. This increase is primarily related to increased legal and advisory fees
related to the implementation of our long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt
and enhance liquidity in order to reposition the Partnership for future growth.
36
Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations
Loss from discontinued operations decreased $1.6 million, or 42%, from a loss of $3.8 million in
the three months ended June 30, 2015 to a loss of $2.2 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to less DD&A expense in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the reduction of the cost basis of our oil
and gas mineral rights due to the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of
2015 and the decline in production quarter-over-quarter. This decrease was partially offset by
reduced oil and gas revenue due to decline in production and price quarter-over-quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) from
continuing operations less equity earnings from unconsolidated investment, gain on reserve
swaps and income to non-controlling interest; plus distributions from equity earnings in
unconsolidated investment, interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization and asset
impairments.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net
income or loss, net income or loss attributable to partners, operating income, cash flows from
operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with
GAAP as measures of operating performance, liquidity or ability to service debt obligations.
There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance,
including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring items that materially affect our net
income (loss), the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies and the
different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies.
Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure used by our management and by
external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research
analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing
methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.4 million, or 15%, from $71.2 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $81.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase is
primarily related to an increase in Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty and Other net income, partially
offset by lower depreciation expense within each segment quarter-over-quarter.

Distributable Cash Flow, or "DCF" (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
DCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating
activities of continuing operations, plus returns of unconsolidated equity investments, proceeds

DCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. DCF may not be
calculated the same for us as for other companies.
DCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our
financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to
assess the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general
partner and repay debt.
DCF decreased $19.9 million, or 44%, from $45.2 million in the three months ended June 30,
2015 to $25.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is due primarily to
lower coal royalty production and less minimum payments received from our coal leases.

Total coal production decreased 10.5 million tons, or 42%, from 25.1 million tons in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to 14.6 million tons in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total
coal royalty revenues decreased $31.0 million, or 41%, from $75.6 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to $44.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total production
decreased in all of our regions, with a corresponding decrease in revenue in all but the Northern
Appalachia region. Revenue in the Northern Appalachia region increased as a result of
decreased production on a lease with a lower royalty rate, offset by increased production
41
on leases with a higher per ton rate. The decrease in coal royalty revenues was partially offset by
an increase in minimums recognized as revenues due to several lease modifications and
terminations in the second quarter of 2016.
Soda Ash
Revenues and other income related to our Soda Ash segment decreased $4.1 million, or 17%,
from $24.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $20.0 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to lower domestic and international
prices compared to the prior year.
VantaCore
Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment decreased $11.5 million, or 17%,
from $67.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $56.3 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in brokered stone revenue as
well as reduced delivery and fuel income quarter-over-quarter. This decrease was partially offset
by an increase in construction revenue. Tonnage sold by the VantaCore segment decreased 0.3
million tons, or 9% from 3.5 million tons in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 3.2 million tons
in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Oil and Gas
Revenues and other income related to our Oil and Gas segment increased $18.2 million from
$2.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $20.7 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $19.2 million gain recorded on the sale of
our oil and gas royalty assets, partially offset by lower royalty revenues year-over-year.
Operating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates)
Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) decreased $12.4 million, or 17%, from
$74.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $62.5 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the following:
VantaCore
Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) in our VantaCore segment decreased
$11.4 million, or 20% from $58.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $46.6 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to the decline in materials
cost as a result of the decrease in brokered stone volume year-over-year.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD&A") Expense
DD&A expense decreased $8.9 million, or 29%, from $30.6 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $21.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily
related to the reduction in the cost basis of our coal and aggregate mineral rights due to the asset
impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the decline in production.
General and Administrative (including affiliates) ("G&A") Expense
Corporate and financing G&A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters,
financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs increased $2.6 million, or 46%,
from $5.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $8.2 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2016. This increase is primarily related to increased legal and consulting fees related to
the implementation of our long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and
enhance liquidity in order to reposition the Partnership for future growth.
Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations
Loss from discontinued operations decreased $5.6 million, or 52%, from a loss of $10.7 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015 to a loss of $5.1 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016. This decrease is primarily related to less DD&A expense in the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of the reduction of the cost basis of our oil and gas mineral
rights due to the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the
decline in production year-over-year. This decrease was partially offset by reduced oil and gas
revenue due to decline in production and price year-over-year.

Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.9 million, or 14%, from $127.6 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $145.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase is primarily
related to the $19.2 million gain on the sale of certain oil and gas royalty properties and was
partially offset by lower net income from our Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty and Other segment
due to reduced production. See "—Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended June 30, 2015—Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)" for
explanation of Adjusted EBITDA.

DCF decreased $5.8 million, or 7%, from $88.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to
$82.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is due primarily to lower
cash provided by operations from our coal and hard mineral royalty and other segment as a result
of to lower coal royalty production and less minimum payments received from our coal leases,
partially offset by $44.1 million net cash proceeds received from the sales of our oil and gas and

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current financial needs we have
significant debt service requirements as discussed in "—Executive Overview—Current Liquidity
Position" above. We believe we need to significantly improve our leverage ratios prior to the
maturity of the Opco Senior Notes and Opco's Revolving Credit Facility in order to be able to
refinance or restructure such debt. We remain committed to our long-term strategic plan to
improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage, and intend to take all necessary steps to
execute on that plan, including asset sales and other means. From January 1, 2016 through the
date of this filing, we completed asset sales for $156.3 million in net proceeds. However, we
believe the adverse conditions in the commodity markets will continue to have a negative impact
on our results of operations, which in turn may prevent us from achieving our leverage ratio goals
including those included in our debt agreement financial covenants. Historically, we have
accessed the debt and equity capital markets on a regular basis and have relied on bank credit
facilities to finance our business activities. However, due to the current commodity price
environment and the state of the coal markets in particular, we believe we do not currently have
the ability to access either the traditional debt or equity capital markets. In addition, the volatility
in the energy industry combined with recent bankruptcies and additional perceived credit risks of
companies with coal exposure has resulted in traditional bank lenders seeking to reduce or
eliminate their lending exposure to these companies. Accordingly, we will be required over the
near term to run our business and service our debt through cash from operations or asset sales.
In addition, we may be required to seek financing from non-traditional sources at unfavorable
pricing or with unfavorable terms to run our business or to refinance or restructure our 2018 debt
maturities.
45
While we have closed several asset sale transactions, if we are unable to complete additional
asset sales and conditions in the commodity markets continue to deteriorate, our liquidity and our
ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt
agreements will be adversely affected. See "—Management's Forecast and Strategic Plan"
above.
Generally, we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. Our
current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $81.2 million as of June 30,
2016, primarily due to $161.0 million in principal payments on the Opco Senior Notes and in
scheduled commitment reductions on the Opco Credit Facility. Excluding these payments, net of
their unamortized debt issue costs, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by
approximately $154.8 million as of June 30, 2016.
Capital Expenditures
A portion of the capital expenditures associated with our VantaCore segment are maintenance
capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production
capacity of those businesses. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating

Operating activities of continuing operations provided $38.6 million and $85.0 million in cash for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our cash provided
by operations of continuing operations is generated from our coal royalty leases. Operating cash
flow from continuing operations decreased $53.3 million in our Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty
and Other segment primarily as a result of the reduction in coal royalty revenue and reduction of
coal royalty minimum cash payments received on certain leases year-over-year. Cash flow
provided by continuing operations in the Soda Ash segment increased as a result of increased
distributions from Ciner Wyoming when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Investing activities of continuing operations provided $43.3 million in cash for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the first
half of 2016, our investing activities of continuing operations primarily consisted of $44.1 million
in net proceeds received from the sale of certain hard mineral royalty and oil and gas royalty
properties. These investing cash inflows of continuing operations were partially offset by $3.9
million in plant and equipment acquisitions within our VantaCore segment. During the first half of
2015, our investing activities of continuing operations primarily consisted of proceeds received
from the sale of our cell tower assets within the Coal and Hard Mineral Royalty and Other
segment, partially offset by plant and equipment acquisitions within our VantaCore segment.
Net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $101.7 million and $127.9 million, respectively. During the first half
of 2016 we repaid $108.5 million in debt (including $10.0 million related to discontinued
operations), distributed $11.2 million to our unitholders and paid our final contingent
consideration payment to Anadarko related to the 2015 operating performance of Ciner Wyoming
of $7.2 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by $20.0 million in loan proceeds during
the first half of 2016. During the first half of 2015 our financing outflows primarily consisted of loan
repayments of $68.5 million (including $10.0 million related to discontinued operations) and
unitholder distributions of $54.9 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by $25.0 million
in loan proceeds during the first half of 2015.

Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture separate from NRP’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries for
purposes of the Indenture, see Note 16. Supplementary Unrestricted Subsidiary Information
under the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes. There have been no significant changes to our critical
accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
Recent Accounting Standards
The information set forth under Note 1. Basis of Presentation to the consolidated financial
statements under the caption "Basis of Presentation" is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk, which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and
interest rates as discussed below:
Commodity Price Risk
We are dependent upon the effective marketing of the coal mined by our lessees. Our lessees
sell the coal under various long-term and short-term contracts as well as on the spot market. We
estimate that over 65% of our coal is currently sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts
that have terms of one year or more. Current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult
for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or
more. Our lessees’ failure to negotiate long-term contracts could adversely affect the stability and
profitability of our lessees’ operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues. If more coal
is sold on the spot market, coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in
spot coal prices.
47
We have market risk related to the prices for oil and natural gas, NGLs and condensate.
Management expects energy prices to remain unpredictable and potentially volatile. As energy
prices decline or rise significantly, revenues and cash flows are likewise affected. In addition, a
non-cash write-down of the Partnership’s oil and gas properties may be required if commodity
prices experience a significant decline.
We have market risk related to prices for our aggregates products. Aggregates prices are
primarily driven by economic conditions in the local markets in which the products are sold.
The market price of soda ash directly affects the profitability of Ciner Wyoming’s operations. If the
market price for soda ash declines, Ciner Wyoming’s sales will decrease. Historically, the global
market and, to a lesser extent, the domestic market for soda ash have been volatile, and those
markets are likely to remain volatile in the future.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowings under our revolving credit
facility and term loan, which are subject to variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. At June 30,
2016, we had $335.0 million outstanding in variable interest rate debt. If interest rates were to
increase by 1%, annual interest expense would increase approximately $3.4 million, assuming
the same principal amount remained outstanding during the year.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
NRP carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed
under the supervision and with the participation of NRP management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of the general partner of NRP.
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance
that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (b) such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in the Partnership’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting during the
first six months of 2016 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

operations.
