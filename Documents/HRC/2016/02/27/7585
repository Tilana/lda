<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, Mutuma Ruteere, undertook an official visit to 
Mauritania from 2 to 8 September 2013 at the invitation of the Government. During his 
visit, he held meetings in Nouakchott, Rosso and Kaedi. He met the highest government 
representatives, at the national and local levels, as well as representatives of civil society, 
non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders and victims of human rights 
violations including slavery-like practices and ethnic and descent-based discrimination.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Mauritania for its 
invitation and the cooperation provided before and during this visit. He would also like to 
thank all the authorities he met for the insightful and detailed discussions. He is grateful for 
the fruitful discussions with the civil society organizations and to the victims who 
courageously shared their stories with him. He would also like to thank the United Nations 
country team, and particularly the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, for 
their invaluable support and the exchanges he had with them.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Mauritania to evaluate progress made since his 
predecessor, Doudou Di&#232;ne, first visited the country in 2008, obtain an up-to-date 
understanding of the situation regarding the elimination of ethnic and descent-based 
discrimination and identify the remaining challenges, with a view to providing constructive 
recommendations which it is hoped will assist the Government in advancing its fight 
against racial and ethnic discrimination.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur appreciated this opportunity to assess the compliance of 
Mauritania with its international obligations and the implementation of the 
recommendations made by the various human rights mechanisms. In this regard he would 
like once again to commend the Government for acceding to many international human 
rights instruments. The cooperation between Mauritania and international human rights 
mechanisms, special procedures, treaty bodies and the universal periodic review must also 
be acknowledged. There is no doubt, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, that there has 
been real progress in the implementation of some of the recommendations made by human 
rights mechanisms. Yet he found that a number of challenges still persist and should be 
addressed as a matter of priority. Achievements and challenges identified in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s findings are further described in the sections below. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>5. Mauritania is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country with an estimated population 
of 3,542,000,1 the majority of whom live in rural communities, have very precarious 
livelihoods and are heavily dependent on agriculture and pastoralism. The population can 
be divided into two groups: the Moors, including the black moors (Haratines) and the Afro-
Mauritanians, including the Fulani (Peulh), Soninke, Wolof and Bambara. Most of the non-
governmental stakeholders whom the Special Rapporteur met reported that the Arab-Moors 
dominate participation in political and economic life, whereas the majority of the 
population, mainly represented by the other two groups, have been de facto systematically 
excluded. This situation has kept these groups in a very precarious condition of poverty and

</p>
<p>relegated them to the fringes of society since before the country&#8217;s independence, thus 
fuelling frustrations and anger.2 The Special Rapporteur met with members of some of the 
affected groups, who clearly expressed a high level of frustration related to the 
Government&#8217;s failure to effectively address the conditions which perpetuate discrimination 
and marginalization.  
</p>
<p>6. The Haratine are thought to constitute the largest ethnic group in Mauritania and the 
most politically and economically marginalized in what remains a society deeply stratified 
by ethnicity, descent, castes and class. The word Haratine is derived from the Arabic word 
for freedom, as they are perceived by the rest of society as freed slaves.  
</p>
<p>7. Despite some visible progress, the Haratine are said to be the most disenfranchised 
community and suffer from discrimination, marginalization and exclusion due to their 
descent. Approximately 50 per cent of the Haratine community are in conditions of de facto 
slavery through domestic servitude and bonded or forced labour.3 The Haratine remain 
marginalized and underrepresented in political and public positions. In 2013, it was 
reported that out of 95 seats in the National Assembly, only 5 were held by Haratine; and 
out of the 56 senators only 1 was Haratine. Moreover, only 2 out of 13 regional governors 
and 3 of the 53 regional prefects were Haratine. Haratine are said to account for the largest 
share of the total illiterate population; the majority of Haratine have not completed primary 
education; and they constitute only 5 per cent of those enrolled in higher education. The 
vast majority of dockers, domestic workers and labourers performing unskilled and low-
paid jobs are said to be Haratine, while very few Haratine occupy high-ranking civil service 
or senior executive posts in the public and private sectors. Haratine also claim that they 
have been excluded from the business and banking sectors, as commercial enterprises are 
usually headed by non-Haratine.  
</p>
<p>8. Similar discriminatory practices affect, to varying degrees, the other Afro-
Mauritanian communities, especially the Wolof minority.  
</p>
<p>9. The Moors are divided into many different tribes stratified in castes by profession, 
such as blacksmith, religious leader, and warrior, inter alia. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that relations among the different castes are very hierarchical and give rise to the 
exclusion and marginalization of certain castes, such as that of blacksmiths, in favour of 
others. Access to certain functions, activities and responsibilities is therefore closely linked 
to caste identity and marriages are highly codified according to descent. For example, the 
Special Rapporteur met with members of the blacksmith caste, who reported that 90 per 
cent are involved in business and retailing, that only 5 per cent are primary school teachers 
and that their sons cannot marry girls from other castes. Although some of the Afro-
Mauritanian ethnic groups are not divided into castes, they too are very hierarchically 
organized and relations among the various subgroups are highly influenced by descent.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur noted that Mauritanian society is highly stratified along 
ethnic and caste lines, with de facto slaves and descendants of slaves assigned the lowest 
status, which is passed down through the generations. This stratification, which has 
historical roots, fuels latent tensions and conflicts which at times turn violent. The visit of 
the Special Rapporteur was timely in this regard as it took place a few months after 
ethnically tinged violent incidents erupted in Kaedi, the largest city and administrative

<p>centre of the Gorgol region in the South. The incidents, which occurred on 7 July 2013, 
involved individuals from the Moorish and Peulh communities, and left 21 people injured 
and 15 shops looted, with 29 individuals arrested. Local authorities informed the Special 
Rapporteur that, although this was the fourth incident of the kind, there was a much more 
heightened ethnic dimension than in previous events, reflecting the mounting tensions 
between the Moors and the Afro-Mauritanian communities during the election process. 
According to information received, violence erupted in the city&#8217;s main market after a young 
Moorish man assaulted an older Peulh woman, triggering anger among some Peulh people 
present at the scene, who attempted to retaliate by targeting the Moorish shop holders in the 
area. It was also reported that in the days following the incident members of the <i>Touche pas 
&#224; ma nationalit&#233;</i> movement gathered in front of the police station where the young Moorish 
man had been held to demand that he be duly brought to justice and not released. An added 
complication, as explained by some interlocutors, was the increasing instrumentalization of 
isolated incidents that were then turned into ethnically polarized confrontations. The 
underlying ethnic discrimination, according to some interlocutors, was evident in the 
official response to these events in that the victims from the Moorish communities affected 
by these incidents had already received some form of compensation and support, whereas 
the Afro-Mauritanian economic operators who lost assets and profit as a result of the 
incidents of 1989 had not.4  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>11. Mauritania is a State party to eight of the core international human rights treaties, 
including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and 
international treaties prohibiting slavery and forced labour including child labour. In 
addition Mauritania has been a State Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights since ratifying the Charter in 1986.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the domestic legal system, in 2008, Mr. Di&#232;ne recommended that, in 
order to focus on the central role of social multiculturalism and strengthen the ongoing 
drive towards democracy, the Constitution should be amended to include the affirmation 
that Mauritanian society is built on democratic, egalitarian and participatory 
multiculturalism, and the recognition of the main ethnic groups or communities in society 
and their languages and cultures (A/HRC/11/36/Add.2).  
</p><p>13. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that the Constitution had indeed been 
amended to this effect. In addition to article 1 of the Constitution of 1991, which guarantees 
equality before the law to all citizens without any distinction as to origin, race, sex or social 
condition, article 2, as revised by Law No. 15 of 2012, sets forth that the people of 
Mauritania, united throughout history by shared moral and spiritual values and aspiring to a 
common future, recognize and proclaim their cultural diversity, the basis of national unity 
and social cohesion, and its corollary, the right to be different. 
</p>
<p>14. Given that language policies have contributed to polarizing the various communities, 
Mr. Di&#232;ne also recommended that, in addition to Arabic, Pular, Soninke and Wolof should 
be given constitutional status as official languages (A/HRC/11/36/Add.2). While article 6 
of the Constitution recognizes Arabic, Pular, Soninke and Wolof as national languages, it 
still provides that the official language is Arabic.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/49/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>15. Despite Mr. Di&#232;ne&#8217;s recommendation to insert specific provisions on racial and 
ethnic discrimination in the Criminal Code, and adopt comprehensive legislation against all 
forms of discrimination, incorporating a definition of discrimination that is applicable in all 
areas of social life and that contains all the elements of article 1 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (A/HRC/11/36/Add.2), these reforms remain pending. 
The current Special Rapporteur was told that the above-mentioned constitutional provisions 
have been interpreted so as to prohibit all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>16. Mr. Di&#232;ne recommended the adoption of a law establishing an independent standing 
national commission, in accordance with the Paris Principles, to uphold human rights, 
combat discrimination and promote democratic, egalitarian and participatory 
multiculturalism.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Commission (CNDH), whose mandate and functions are provided for in Law No. 31 of 
2010 and which was accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status in 2011 by the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
(ICC). CNDH is mandated to monitor and issue alerts on all human rights-related issues. 
The Commission is required to formulate consultative recommendations on the existing 
legal framework, raise awareness on human rights among the general population, especially 
while combating racial discrimination, slavery-like practices and gender-based 
discrimination. It is also vested with powers to visit, without prior notice, detention 
facilities to assess whether the fundamental rights of those under custody are being upheld. 
Finally, the Commission has the power to investigate all human rights violations brought to 
its attention and take appropriate measures in coordination with the authorities concerned.5  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur learned about the efforts the Commission has made in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, including on issues related to ethnic 
discrimination, such as the human rights of returnees, the fight against slavery and land 
disputes as well as monitoring and fact-finding with regard to ethnic incidents, including 
the incident in Kaedi in 2013. Despite the establishment of a local Committee of Wise 
Persons to mediate the conflict in Kaedi, the Commission stated that there was a need to 
have an early warning system in place to allow it to be effective in its mission of 
conciliation and mediation before tensions turn into violent confrontations.  
</p>
<p>19. The Commission also played an active role in awareness-raising activities and in 
initiating public debates on issues such as the prohibition of discrimination, and cultural 
diversity and human rights.6  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences recommended the establishment of an independent Government-funded 
mechanism, enshrined in legislation, which would be empowered to carry out investigations 
on its own initiative and would have the standing to bring civil cases of slavery or 
discrimination before the courts (A/HRC/15/20/Add.2). The Special Rapporteur appreciates 
the establishment of the Tadamoun (Agence Nationale de lutte contre les S&#233;quelles de 
l&#8217;Esclavage, de l&#8217;Insertion et de Lutte contre la Pauvret&#233;) &#8211; ANLSESILP) agency, set up in

<p>March 2013 with the aim of identifying programmes to eradicate the consequences of 
slavery, to design, coordinate, and implement reintegration programmes for returnees and 
promote programmes to eradicate poverty as advocated in the World Bank&#8217;s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (CSLP) on Mauritania.7 The agency can lodge complaints against 
alleged perpetrators of slavery-like practices on behalf of the victims, although at the time 
of the visit it was still setting up a legal cell to support cases in court. When meeting with 
agency representatives, the Special Rapporteur was told that the agency had not received 
any complaints of ethnic or descent-based discrimination. It was also engaged in awareness 
and public information activities and was involved in land restitution cases and projects to 
alleviate poverty for those living in very precarious conditions. At the time of the visit it 
was premature for non-governmental interlocutors to comment on the work of the new 
agency but some indicated that it was not perceived as independent and that they were 
waiting to see how it would develop its legal casework.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>21. While commending the achievements in reforming legislation and establishing the 
necessary institutions to combat discrimination and slavery-like practices, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that there are significant challenges related to the pace and effective 
implementation of the law. As a result, many individuals have lost confidence in these 
institutions and the justice system. To date no case of racial discrimination has been 
referred to national courts, and the few cases of slavery-like practices brought before courts 
have led neither to the prosecution nor the punishment of the perpetrators, nor to redress for 
the victims.  
</p>
<p>22. In addition, the justice system was reported to work mainly in Arabic, as bilingual 
judges are rare. This, and the fact that judges appear to be recruited mainly from one caste 
or tribe, represents a barrier to access to justice, leading to de facto exclusion of those who 
do not speak Arabic.8 The practice of prioritizing one language and one caste or tribe also 
makes access to the judiciary profession very limited for the other ethnic communities and 
contributes to fuelling impunity for human rights violations, including cases of ethnic and 
descent-based discrimination, as victims do not trust the justice sector, which they see as 
skewed in favour of certain segments of the population.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur heard that the nature of descent-based slavery in Mauritania 
is such that victims have been indoctrinated over generations into accepting their status as 
possessions of their masters and remain economically tied and dependent on their de-facto 
masters; it is therefore extremely difficult for them to pursue cases against their masters in 
court. The National Human Rights Commission reiterated that victims do not usually lodge 
complaints as they are not educated and are unaware of their rights and that judicial 
proceedings are lengthy, cumbersome and expensive and generally lead to further 
stigmatization. The Commission therefore believes that civil society organizations should 
be granted leave to lodge complaints on behalf of victims. This should also contribute to 
building national jurisprudence on a number of issues, including ethnic and descent-based 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also heard numerous complaints of ethnic profiling, 
particularly by law enforcement agencies patrolling the roads and was informed that

<p>foreigners detained for identity control purposes were disproportionately of sub-Saharan 
African origin. Furthermore, lack of translation of statements and lack of interpreters at 
police stations and during court hearings had already been highlighted by the United 
Nations Working Group on arbitrary detention.9  
</p>
<p><b> V. Policies and practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ethnic discrimination and social cohesion 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the process for developing a national plan of 
action against racial discrimination which was initiated by the Government in 2013 in 
cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Background 
research, including examination of national plans of action adopted by other countries 
within the region, and good practices in this field, as well as the first draft of the plan, were 
developed and discussed at a first stakeholders&#8217; workshop held on 3 September 2013, 
which the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to address. During the workshop the 
Special Rapporteur observed that issues related to ethnicity, the limited representation of 
the various communities in public positions, and the census and land issues gave rise to 
animated discussions, as these deeply touched the hearts and minds of people in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the implementation by the Government, in 
partnership with United Nations agencies, of a national programme aimed at building social 
unity through citizenship training and the equitable distribution of resources to vulnerable 
populations, in particular the returnees and populations affected by slavery-like practices 
and its consequences (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/1). As part of this programme, in 2013 the 
Government also embarked on the process of formulating a national strategy on social 
cohesion (SNCS), a process that is designed to be inclusive and consultative through a 
series of regional workshops and debates. In the lead-up to the strategy, a number of factors 
were identified as working favourably towards social cohesion, including a common 
religion, an active sense of community and generosity, new forms of solidarity 
(associations, clubs, cooperatives), and the existing policies and strategies to eradicate 
poverty.  
</p>
<p>27. Blockages to social cohesion were also identified, such as a complex social fabric, 
the weakening of the traditional mechanisms of solidarity, the weight of traditions in 
mentality and practices, and identification with the ethnic group rather than the nation, 
leading to a sense of citizenship still under construction, problems of national identity, 
tensions around issues stemming from past human rights violations10 and eradication of de 
facto slavery, the inability of the State to address all these blockages and the sensitivity of 
the subject-matter. In addition, attitudes in dominant and victimized communities have also 
developed over a long period. These attitudes are deeply held and may be antagonistic to 
changes that are essential if the victimized community is to progress.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 A/HRC/10/21/Add.2; the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also found that the different 
</p>
<p>attitudes towards persons of different ethnic origins by officials at detention centres and the 
conditions of administrative detention, however short, remain a source of concern..

<p>28. Another manifestation of exclusion felt by some groups, and expressed by several 
interlocutors, is the insufficient diversity in key government and public administration 
posts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. <i>Passif humanitaire</i> 
</b>29. In 2000 the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR) issued 
an omnibus decision addressing a number of communications filed against Mauritania 
concerning human rights violations perpetrated by the Government between 1986 and 
1992. The Commission examined, inter alia, alleged violations based on an array of 
atrocities perpetrated or incited by the Government against its citizens and in particular 
against members of various black ethnic groups. In its decisions the Commission found the 
Government responsible for grave or massive violations of human rights, including ethnic 
discrimination, torture, illegal detention, extrajudicial killings and mass expulsion of Afro-
Mauritanians. The decision included the following six recommendations designed to 
remedy the violations and compensate the victims: the need for an independent enquiry and 
prosecutions; the rehabilitation and reintegration of those expelled; compensation of 
widows and beneficiaries; reinstatement of workers; eradication of slavery; and effective 
enforcement of an anti-slavery statute. Since the decision, progress has been made towards 
achieving both the letter and spirit of the Commission&#8217;s recommendations. Yet more 
remains to be done in order to implement these fully.  
</p>
<p>30. Until now no prosecution has been initiated against the perpetrators of human rights 
violations committed between 1989 and 1991 against the Afro-Mauritanian population. 
Law No. 92 of 1993 granted amnesty to members of the armed and security forces who had 
committed offences during that period. In addition the only copy of the Official Gazette 
promulgating this law was reportedly never made publicly available. This makes 
challenging of the law in court and public discussion on how to seek the truth and 
reparations for past wrongs impossible. Despite prayers for national reconciliation led by 
the President, the truth about what happened during this period is still treated as a national 
taboo and no official report about these events has so far been released. As a result, the 
painful memories of the 1989-1991 events remain vivid in the lives of many women, men, 
girls and boys who lost loved ones, houses and land, and identification papers, as the 
Special Rapporteur heard from many of those he met during the visit.  
</p>
<p>31. The Government reported a number of achievements in relation to the situation of 
those expelled from the country. It listed the return of 34,000 persons as part of the assisted 
repatriation programme (<i>programme special d&#8217;insertion rapide</i>, 1996-1998), the signing of 
a tripartite agreement in November 2007 under which 24,536 persons were repatriated, and 
the establishment in 2008 of an agency in support of and for the reintegration of returnees 
(ANAIR) with an annual budget of two billion MRO (6 million USD), which was then 
subsumed under the Tamadoun agency.11 The Government also reported that it had 
reinstated retirement benefits entitlements for civil servant returnees over 60 years of age. 
</p>
<p>32. Over the years this agency has implemented, exclusively through the national 
budget, a number of projects aimed at the economic and social integration of the returnees, 
including the installation of water-related facilities in the sites where returnees live, support 
for livelihoods, including those of agro-pastoralists, and the construction of schools and 
hiring of teachers, inter alia. The agency has also carried out a number of initiatives aimed 
at strengthening social cohesion between the returnees and other communities including 
through the mediation of land disputes. The agency has developed a programme (2012&#8211;

</p>
<p>2015) with the support of the World Bank, aimed at improving access to health and 
education for returnees and their sustainable integration through the installation of basic 
infrastructure (e.g. schools, health centres), support for agro-pastoralist activities, and 
capacity-building activities.  
</p>
<p>33. The Government reported that a number of returnees who had been removed from 
their jobs have been reinstated following their return, particularly at the local level, such as 
in Rosso, where local authorities stated that 95 per cent of education officers had been 
reinstated. However, victims and their families claim that many still await restoration into 
service or satisfactory compensation. In addition the Special Rapporteur heard from the 
victims he met that some of the children of those killed had been prevented from registering 
in the census as they had been asked to produce a death certificate for their parents. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur was concerned by the absence of data disaggregated by 
ethnicity and descent, which was underscored in all the meetings he held and confirmed in 
the various studies on the status of the population he was able to access, which did not 
include any disaggregation of data. All government interlocutors explained to the Special 
Rapporteur that this was a result of the need to respect people&#8217;s privacy and the difficulty 
individuals have in identifying with only one ethnicity or community. While 
acknowledging the rationale for this policy approach, the Special Rapporteur is of the view 
that the absence of appropriate tools to assess the spread of ethnic and descent-based 
discrimination, such as reliable statistics and data, is among the reasons for the lack of 
awareness as to the extent of these phenomena and understanding thereof. The mandate has 
consistently recalled that collection of ethnically disaggregated data and indicators is a 
prerequisite for identifying the groups affected by racial discrimination, gaining a better 
understanding of the nature and extent of the inequalities faced by these groups and their 
members, and for designing targeted policies and measures to remedy such inequalities.  
</p>
<p>35. While acknowledging the risks that the collection of such data may entail, including 
aggravating tensions between individuals and groups, leading to further prejudice and 
stereotypes, and conflicting with individuals&#8217; right to privacy, the mandate has indicated 
that these problems may be overcome if States abide by some key principles, including self-
identification (A/66/313 and A/65/295).  
</p>
<p><b> D. Census 
</b></p>
<p>36. In May 2011 a nationwide census was launched, aimed at registering the population 
in a biometric database, systematizing national identity cards and finalizing the electoral 
lists. This is a welcome initiative, since in 2004 the Committee on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination had recommended that the State carry out a precise 
population census not limited to linguistic factors, and produce detailed indicators 
disaggregated by descent or ethnic origin. The Committee had also recommended that the 
State party carry out targeted surveys, on the basis of voluntary self-identification, which 
would make it possible to determine the situation of the groups falling within the definition 
of article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(see CERD/C/65/CO/5).  
</p><p>37. The authorities explained that the census was necessary to safeguard the security of 
the country as well as that of its residents and citizens, through the establishment of a 
centralized national biometric database to replace the 13 uncoordinated regional population 
databases, which were dismantled in May 2011. The census process started with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/49/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>opening of a first census centre in Nouakchott on 5 May 2011; in 2013 there were a total of 
216 census centres of which 8 located abroad for the census of Mauritanian expatriates. The 
Government explained that the census had been designed in three successive phases: 
(1) registration of the population in possession of all requested documents; (2) registration 
of those partially fulfilling the documentation requirements; (3) and registration of the 
population not possessing any identification documents. Although the Government reported 
that the current census had allowed for the registration of 2.9 million people, representing 
700,000 additional citizens who did not appear in the 2008 census and subsequent 
complementary census operations conducted up to 2009, the current national exercise has 
brought to the surface not only the deep-seated issues that divided the society along ethnic 
and caste lines, but also unresolved human rights violations perpetrated in the late 1980s. 
Since September 2011, demonstrations have continued against certain practices linked to 
the census exercise and groups which have traditionally been discriminated against have 
expressed concerns with regard to the registration requirements, which have been viewed 
by some as an attempt to strip members of Mauritanian society of their right to nationality.  
</p>
<p>38. According to the conditions set by the National Population Registration Agency 
(Agence Nationale du Registre des Populations et des Titres S&#233;curis&#233;s &#8211; ANRPTS), in 
order to be registered the following must be submitted: 
</p>
<p> (a) A 1998 census birth certificate;  
 (b) A national identification card; 
 (c) Parents&#8217; National Identification Numbers (for persons under 45 years of age, 
their parents must be registered before they can be enrolled); 
 (d) Parent&#8217;s/s&#8217; death certificate(s), for individuals under 45 years of age, if 
applicable; 
</p>
<p> (e) Any other document confirming the applicant&#8217;s identity, such as a passport, 
an old birth certificate, or a certificate of nationality. 
</p>
<p>39. The Government also reported that registration for each individual is carried out in 
two steps: (1)  identification of the individual through the compiling and screening of 
existing identification documents; and (2) subsequent registration of the individual&#8217;s 
biographic and biometric data. 
</p>
<p>40. The requirements of the census have reportedly particularly affected the Haratine 
and Afro-Mauritanian communities. These requirements de facto exclude Haratine whose 
parents and grandparents were never registered for the most part, and whose births were 
never registered, being born of parents who had not contracted civil marriages, and 
therefore could not acquire nationality in their own right. In this regard it is important to 
note that following a civil status reform in 2010, birth certificates can be issued to children 
born on Mauritanian soil only if their parents&#8217; marriage is registered and they can provide a 
marriage certificate in compliance with the Personal Status Code of 2001 (Law 2001-052 of 
19 July 2001), which establishes that traditional marriages must be approved by a civil 
registration office within three months to be legally recognized. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government reported that, for the first two years of the census campaign, the 
parents&#8217; marriage certificate was not required for the registration of children; however 
when the number of registered persons reached 2 million and that of registered children 
increased significantly, the production of a marriage certificate was made mandatory. The 
Government explained that this measure had been enforced to fulfil two objectives: (1) to 
safeguard the interest of the child and the mother and (2) to educate the population on civil 
marriage registration, which is a civil act constituting both a basic right and a legal 
obligation. However, these requirements have also led to the exclusion of a large number of 
Mauritanians from remote rural areas, where access to public services is limited. Moreover, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/49/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>in accordance with Muslim traditions, most marriages in the past were contracted only 
before the religious authorities and not registered as civil acts, which is still the case in 
remote areas, thus leading to potential statelessness for a number of children. 
</p>
<p>42. Although the national census agency is enrolling returnees on the basis of the 
existing lists produced by the ANAIR agency, which registered all returnees within the 
framework of the 2007 Tripartite Agreement, returnees face challenges with the current 
enrolment process. It has been reported that some of the returnees have not had access to 
enrolment and that fewer than half the returnees have been enrolled, although ANAIR 
reports rates above 80 per cent. In order to remedy the situation and allow access to 
enrolment for all returnees, a joint committee, including representatives of the returnee 
community and the national census agency, was established in 2013 and meets weekly. The 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) monitors the 
situation, and cooperates directly with ANRTPS with regard to the enrolment of returnees 
and any related litigation. The national census was also reported to have affected the 
process of obtaining identity cards for the returnees, thereby once again victimizing this 
group. The Government reported that no new identity cards would be issued until the 
census was complete and, at the time of the visit, it was still ongoing. Returnees generally 
do not have identity cards but only receipts proving that their request for an identity card is 
pending. These receipts do not seem to be valid for identification or transactions. Without 
identity cards, individuals cannot travel or engage in administrative procedures to obtain a 
certificate of nationality or a marriage certificate, which are now mandatory for registering 
children born in returnee sites.12 It also affects their ability to register as voters. This 
situation has so far disproportionately affected the most marginalized groups and groups at 
risk of discrimination and has created obstacles for returnees seeking to reintegrate 
harmoniously into one of the least developed areas of the country and enhanced the risk that 
some members of these groups, who were deprived of their nationality prior to expulsion 
from Mauritania, will be unable to prove re-acquisition of nationality and will remain 
stateless. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur learned about the difficulties that some Mauritanians living 
abroad have faced in registering in the census, particularly those who are unable to produce 
a residence permit.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the census recognized four ethnic 
classifications, namely Moorish, Soninke, Fulani (Peulh) and Wolof, thus limiting the 
available choices. It is also not based on self-identification. Certain groups claimed that 
they were asked by census officials to undertake additional tests to prove their nationality, 
involving the ability to cite particular religious verses, to speak the Hassaniya language or 
recognize key political and public figures.13 
</p>
<p>45. In line with general recommendation No. 8 (1990) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, on identification with a particular racial or ethnic 
group, the mandate has consistently indicated that self-identification should constitute a 
pillar for the collection of ethnically disaggregated data, to ensure respect for the right of 
individuals to assert their own identity. While implementing this principle may lead to 
underreporting and inaccurate data, it is based on the important notion that the State should 
not impose an identity on the individual (A/65/295, para. 55).

</b></p>
<p>46. Since the start of the census exercise, members of the <i>Touche pas a ma nationalit&#233;</i> 
movement, which gathers together young people from across the spectrum of society, have 
organized several demonstrations to denounce the alleged discriminatory practices of 
certain census officials, which have led to delays in registration, with certain individuals 
being unable to register. Some of the demonstrations, such as that of 10 September 2011, 
were reportedly dispersed by law enforcement agencies with the use of force and tear gas. 
These incidents occurred in various parts of the country. For example on 26 September 
2011 in Kaedi a member of the movement was allegedly severely beaten by police officers 
during a demonstration by young people to protest irregularities in the census. It is reported 
that the complaint submitted by his family was dismissed. On 27 September 2011 in 
Maghama the police fired against young protestors who were members of the movement, 
killing one young boy and injuring nine others. Despite some disciplinary measures taken 
against the alleged perpetrators and a complaint lodged by the victim&#8217;s father before the 
Kaedi court, it appears that no investigation has been carried out to bring those responsible 
to justice.14 These cases bear witness yet again to the shortcomings of the justice system.15 
47. The composition of ANRPTS, which oversees the census process and employs 
1,200 census agents, reportedly does not reflect the ethnic diversity of the country, as the 
Special Rapporteur learned during his meetings.16 He regrets that despite several requests 
he was not granted the opportunity to meet with representatives of ANRPTS to discuss the 
above issues. 
</p>
<p>48. The National Human Rights Commission also informed the Special Rapporteur that 
it had received information on about 60 cases of irregularities and difficulties related to the 
census registration, including mistakes in the spelling of names and dates of birth, and had 
asked the administration to issue instructions to clarify certain procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Poverty eradication 
</b></p>
<p>49. In 2008, 42 per cent of the Mauritanian population was living below the poverty 
line, estimated at UM 129,600 (US$ 433), which was a reduction of 1.2 per cent as 
compared with 46.7 per cent in 2004. Poverty has remained a rural phenomenon, with rural 
populations living below the poverty line estimated at 59.4 per cent, compared with 20.8 
per cent in urban centres. It was also estimated that in 2008, 25.9 per cent of the population 
lived in situations of extreme poverty, fixed at UM 96,400 (US$ 322), which, not 
surprisingly, affected mostly the rural areas, where 40.8 per cent of the population live in 
extreme poverty, compared with 7.7 per cent in urban centres.17 The poorest areas, with an 
estimated 60 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, were estimated to be 
Tagant, Gorgol and Brakna. As mentioned in section D, population studies do not 
disaggregate data by ethnicity and descent and thus data on regional diversity may be the 
closest proxy indicator, as explained by some interlocutors.  
</p>
<p>50. Poverty is undeniably a big challenge in Mauritania, which cuts across all groups 
and communities. Despite some limited assistance provided by the Government to former 
slaves or descendants of slaves in the form of land, a number of government interlocutors 
claimed that the groups which have been historically marginalized due to slavery continue 
to be economically dependent on their former masters. This situation perpetuates their

</p>
<p>marginalization, even if there is no intent to keep them in slavery-like conditions. Yet 
poverty and discrimination are, everywhere in the world, strictly intertwined in a cycle that 
is unlikely to be broken unless they are both tackled simultaneously. Discrimination is also 
about distribution of resources and, in the globalized market economy, the worst off are 
frequently, if not systematically, members of certain ethnic groups whose particular 
vulnerability results partly from a history of discrimination, oppression and exploitation.18  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes the emphasis placed by the Government 
on eradicating poverty through major development projects. He was pleased to hear that 
these projects have targeted the so called &#8220;triangle of poverty&#8221;, which was re-named the 
&#8220;triangle of hope&#8221;, where some of the most marginalized groups live and where the entire 
population has been living below the poverty line. These projects include rural 
electrification, building of road networks, irrigation projects, and the development of 
income-generating activities run by women. According to the Government, a number of 
individuals have also benefited from access to land schemes and around 12,000 households 
from cash transfers with conditions attached such as sending children to school and visiting 
health centres. The Government stated that the budget devoted to projects targeted at 
improving the living conditions and social status of historically marginalized groups has 
notably increased, reaching more than UM 170 billion (US$ 568 million). However, no 
projects specifically targeting former slaves have apparently been put in place, and 
Haratines have been only indirect end beneficiaries of projects addressing general poverty. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes these developments and this comprehensive approach to 
combating discrimination and exclusion. Nevertheless, he wishes to recall that eradication 
of poverty through an increase in livelihood opportunities and improvement in living 
conditions is not a panacea for fighting discrimination, and should be accompanied by an 
increase in life choices.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Youth and education 
</b></p>
<p>52. Approximately 70 per cent of the population is aged under 30, with those aged 
between 10 and 30 representing 40.8 per cent within this segment of the population.19 In 
2000, those below the age of 30 accounted for 72.4 per cent of the unemployed. Young 
people therefore represent a significant and mostly vulnerable part of the population. A 
large number have been compelled to migrate from rural areas to urban centres because of 
the lack of the necessary infrastructure such as schools, health centres, and youth centres to 
address their needs. The national policy on youth, leisure, sports and its implementation 
strategies (2011-2016) was adopted against this backdrop. The specific objectives of this 
policy are: to create an enabling environment for young people to participate in the process 
of economic and social development; to promote cultural, sport and socio-educational 
activities; to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship and social integration; to develop 
mechanisms to protect young people and prevent juvenile delinquency and to promote a 
culture of peace and democracy among youth. It is important to note that this policy does 
not list among its objectives the promotion of social cohesion and equality. It makes 
reference to the need to strengthen civic education in order to consolidate the legal and 
institutional framework necessary to support the full development of young people, with the 
focus on the promotion of youth associations. In this regard, the Government reported that

</b></p>
<p>it had organized a series of multicultural festivals to enhance social cohesion and reassert 
the complementary nature of the different cultures in the country.  
</p>
<p>53. Young people, particularly in rural areas, appear to be strongly attached to the 
traditional values of their groups of origin: young people identify first and foremost with 
the group to which they belong rather than to the nation. Some young people, for example, 
believe that maintaining the caste system is necessary to preserve the group identity and 
claim that mixed marriages are unacceptable. As a result the ethnic, religious or descent 
based groups compete with and fill the space left by public institutions and services which 
are no longer able to cater for an increasing young urban population, thus undermining 
efforts towards social cohesion.20 
</p>
<p>54. Social and political awareness remain very limited, particularly in rural contexts, 
where the adherence to traditional values and mentality is still strong. In this connection, 
inequalities, hierarchy and stratification are seen as a normal legacy of the past, to the 
detriment of the ideals of equality of all human beings. This situation also translates into the 
political choices of young people, who said they had voted for the candidate chosen by their 
respective communities.  
</p>
<p>55. From the interactions during the visit, the Special Rapporteur sensed that the feeling 
of belonging to one nation had not yet been cemented and that individuals were more likely 
to mobilize along ethnic and caste lines. Hence it was reported that people tended to favour 
members of their families, their castes, ethnic groups or regions,21 which perpetuates 
nepotism in both the political and economic spheres, leading to further discrimination and 
inequalities.  
</p>
<p>56. The education system has not effectively contributed to minimizing these 
sentiments, as over the years the system has been unilingual, alternating exclusively 
between French and Arabic, before becoming a dual education system. This has 
consequently contributed to the formation of two distinct categories of professionals and 
workers, whose access to employment and job opportunities has by default been 
differentiated and, in some sectors such as public administration, greater for one category 
than the other.  
</p>
<p>57. In addition the education system does not effectively play its role in strengthening 
integration and social cohesion, considering the literacy rate for adults, which was 58.6 per 
cent in 2011,22 and the structural limitations linked to the languages of education. The 
Special Rapporteur noted how language is perceived as a means for domination of some 
groups over others. The reform to introduce bilingualism in education, which started in 
1989, is commendable; however the country needs to shift to effective bilingualism, to 
provide equal opportunities for all. In this regard the efforts of the Government to train 
teachers in French are noteworthy but should be stepped up as only 25 per cent of teachers 
appear to be bilingual (in 2013 2,000 teachers were trained in French). In addition to 
bilingualism, it is important that the other languages of the country are promoted and 
taught. In 2004 the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended 
in its concluding observations that the State consider including national languages in the 
education system for children who wish to receive an education in those languages 
(CERD/C/65/CO/5, para. 20).

</p>
<p>58. Another obstacle in the field of education is the difficulty of instituting inclusive 
schools. The Government enacted a law in 2001 establishing compulsory education for 
children up to the age of 14; however, many children of former slaves and children with 
special needs, as well as those whose birth has not been registered, are reportedly not in 
school. For example, the mayor of Nouakchott informed the Special Rapporteur that 80 per 
cent of the children in Haratine communities were not in school, of whom a large number 
were likely to end up in conflict with the law. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
statement of the Minister of Education whereby instructions were given to the effect that 
schools should receive all children at the primary level regardless of whether or not they 
have birth certificates or other papers.23 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>59. <b>As the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Di&#232;ne, noted, although discrimination 
is not to be found in the letter of the law, many individuals de facto do not have equal 
opportunities with regard to education, employment, business opportunities, or access 
to justice and to government services.  
</b>60. <b>The progress achieved thus far by the State towards meeting its human rights 
obligations and the constructive spirit of openness by the Government vis-&#224;-vis the 
international human rights mechanisms is noteworthy. Dialogue, cooperation and 
partnerships remain essential in advancing the protection and promotion of human 
rights.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>However a number of challenges persist. Some are hard to tackle, as they are 
deep-rooted in traditions, history and mentalities. Hence bold measures and zero 
tolerance towards impunity are urgently required to accelerate progress in the 
realization of an equal and diverse society based on respect for all human rights for 
all.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>In light of his findings and those of the other United Nations human rights 
mechanisms which examined issues related to ethnic and descent-based discrimination 
in the country, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer the recommendations which 
follow. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>First, the recommendations previously issued by regional and international 
human rights mechanisms, including Mr. Di&#232;ne, and which have not been 
implemented or only partially so, are still valid and the Government should take 
urgent action to implement these. For ease of reference a link to a table summarizing 
and clustering these recommendations is included in the appendix.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The national plan of action against racial discrimination must be based on a 
thorough analysis/assessment of all the facets of discrimination in the country through 
the conduct of a baseline study on the status, root causes, manifestations and 
consequences of the discrimination which has scarred Mauritanian history, with a 
view to better informing the policies to be implemented. The process for developing 
the plan must be inclusive and participatory so that all those involved can claim 
ownership and monitor its implementation; the result of the process must be 
sufficiently concrete to be measurable. Thus the Government should ensure that all 
the above elements are considered during the development of the plan, and in the 
lead-up to its adoption. 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 According to the Minister, 18,000 children could not access schools because of lack of birth

</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Government and its partners should take the opportunity, through the 
development of the social cohesion strategy, to streamline and focus the various action 
plans and programmes related to ethnic and descent-based discrimination in order to 
avoid fragmentation of efforts which have the common objective of achieving an 
inclusive, diverse society based on human rights and equality. This could also be an 
opportunity to maximize already limited resources.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>While being aware that data have to be used sensibly, the Government has to 
demonstrate its political will to address discrimination by investing in independent 
studies, assessments and surveys to analyse the situation, monitor progress and 
evaluate results. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the National Human 
Rights Commission is well placed to lead such thematic studies. He also strongly 
encourages United Nations agencies and bilateral donors to support the Government 
in this endeavour.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>It is paramount that the Government addresses the issues which the census 
process has highlighted so that individuals, and consequently their children, are not 
unduly deprived of their right to identity and nationality. The Government should 
also take measures to prevent children from becoming stateless: a situation which 
affects mostly children born of non-registered marriages, leading to de facto 
discrimination against the most isolated communities and the groups which have 
historically been discriminated against. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government to ratify the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless 
Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>There is a need to improve the effectiveness of the relevant institutions in 
addressing the problems of discrimination and to win public confidence in their 
effectiveness and commitment to implementing the law. The competent ministries 
should therefore include in their annual budgets adequate resources to tackle issues of 
ethnic-, caste- and descent-based discrimination as well as slavery-like practices 
within their areas of responsibility, particularly to strengthen the capacity and 
expertise of officials, and maintain continued cooperation with relevant United 
Nations agencies, and in particular with the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Mauritania.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>A policy of affirmative action should be implemented in relation to selection 
and recruitment of personnel in key State institutions such as the security and armed 
forces, the justice system, and the civil service. Inclusion of all the groups in all sectors 
of administration and the private economy is key to the promotion of democracy, 
national reconciliation and cohesion. Broader representation of ethnic groups within 
the administration at civil registration centres and law enforcement bodies should be 
vigorously pursued by the Government with a view to reducing instances of real or 
perceived discriminatory behaviour and attitudes. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Government should promote equal access to political life for the 
communities which have historically been discriminated against and their political 
parties, including through the introduction of affirmative action at the national and 
local levels.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In a context where social prejudices and ethnic discrimination persist, the 
Government should strengthen human rights education and civic education, as these 
are all the more necessary, not only to maintaining social cohesion and embedding a 
democratic culture founded on human rights, but also to transforming the social 
fabric.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>A number of concerns related to difficulties in registration, compensation and 
reparation for some of the returnees, continuing land disputes and the lack of </b></p>

<p><b>accountability for the human rights violations committed in 1989 were conveyed to the 
Special Rapporteur. Addressing urgently these concerns must be on the agenda for 
national reconciliation and is a prerequisite for building an inclusive and diverse 
society. First and foremost, the Government should make the 1993 law publicly 
available in Arabic and French, a measure which would not involve costly resources. 
In addition the new national strategy on social cohesion (SNCS) should include a 
transitional justice component to enable public discussion on the events of the late 
1980s which led to the deportation of thousands of Mauritanian citizens and to the 
deprivation of their nationality and economic power. It is important that victims of 
these past violations be granted access to effective remedies with a view to building a 
strong basis for a new social cohesion.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Although slavery has been outlawed in law, slavery-like practices are very 
much alive, together with the social conditions favouring such practices. The 
institutional and legal frameworks have to be given teeth so that perpetrators are held 
to account. Amendments to the 2007 anti-slavery law to provide for the capacity of 
non-governmental organizations to act on behalf of victims of slavery-like practices 
and to provide stronger protection and support to them should be fast-tracked.  </b></p>
