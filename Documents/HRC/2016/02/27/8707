</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. A targeted killing is the intentional, premeditated and deliberate use of lethal force, 
by States or their agents acting under colour of law, or by an organized armed group in 
armed conflict, against a specific individual who is not in the physical custody of the 
perpetrator.  In recent years, a few States have adopted policies, either openly or implicitly, 
of using targeted killings, including in the territories of other States. 
</p>
<p>2. Such policies have been justified both as a legitimate response to &#8220;terrorist&#8221; threats 
and as a necessary response to the challenges of &#8220;asymmetric warfare.&#8221; In the legitimate 
struggle against terrorism, too many criminal acts have been re-characterized so as to 
justify addressing them within the framework of the law of armed conflict. New 
technologies, and especially unarmed combat aerial vehicles or &#8220;drones&#8221;, have been added 
into this mix, by making it easier to kill targets, with fewer risks to the targeting State. 
</p>
<p>3. The result of this mix has been a highly problematic blurring and expansion of the 
boundaries of the applicable legal frameworks &#8211; human rights law, the laws of war, and the 
law applicable to the use of inter-state force. Even where the laws of war are clearly 
applicable, there has been a tendency to expand who may permissibly be targeted and under 
what conditions. Moreover, the States concerned have often failed to specify the legal 
justification for their policies, to disclose the safeguards in place to ensure that targeted 
killings are in fact legal and accurate, or to provide accountability mechanisms for 
violations. Most troublingly, they have refused to disclose who has been killed, for what 
reason, and with what collateral consequences. The result has been the displacement of 
clear legal standards with a vaguely defined licence to kill, and the creation of a major 
accountability vacuum. 
</p>
<p>4. In terms of the legal framework, many of these practices violate straightforward 
applicable legal rules. To the extent that customary law is invoked to justify a particular 
interpretation of an international norm, the starting point must be the policies and practice 
of the vast majority of States and not those of the handful which have conveniently sought 
to create their own personalized normative frameworks. It should be added that many of the 
justifications for targeted killings offered by one or other of the relevant States in particular 
current contexts would in all likelihood not gain their endorsement if they were to be 
asserted by other States in the future. 
</p>
<p>5. This report describes the publicly available information about new targeted killing 
policies and addresses the main legal issues that have arisen. It identifies areas in which 
legal frameworks have been clearly violated or expanded beyond their permissible limits; 
where legal issues are unclear, it suggests approaches which would enable the international 
community to return to a normative framework that is consistent with its deep commitment 
to protection of the right to life, and the minimization of exceptions to that constitutive 
principle. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to Hina Shamsi of the Project on Extrajudicial 
Executions at the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, New York University 
School of Law, for her superb assistance in the preparation of this report.  He is also 
grateful to Sarah Knuckey for her comments, and Nishant Kumar and Anna De Courcy 
Wheeler for research assistance. </p>

</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition of &#8220;targeted killing&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p>7. Despite the frequency with which it is invoked, &#8220;targeted killing&#8221; is not a term 
defined under international law. Nor does it fit neatly into any particular legal framework. It 
came into common usage in 2000, after Israel made public a policy of &#8220;targeted killings&#8221; of 
alleged terrorists in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.1 The term has also been used in 
other situations, such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The April 2002 killing, allegedly by Russian armed forces, of &#8220;rebel warlord&#8221; Omar 
Ibn al Khattab in Chechnya.2 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The November 2002 killing of alleged al Qaeda leader Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harithi 
and five other men in Yemen, reportedly by a CIA-operated Predator drone using a 
Hellfire missile.3  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Killings in 2005 &#8211; 2008 by both Sri Lankan government forces and the opposition 
LTTE group of individuals identified by each side as collaborating with the other.4 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The January 2010 killing, in an operation allegedly carried out by 18 Israeli Mossad 
intelligence agents, of Mahmoud al-Mahbouh, a Hamas leader, at a Dubai hotel.5 
According to Dubai officials, al-Mahbouh was suffocated with a pillow; officials 
released videotapes of those responsible, whom they alleged to be Mossad agents.6 
</p>
<p>8. Targeted killings thus take place in a variety of contexts and may be committed by 
governments and their agents in times of peace as well as armed conflict, or by organized 
armed groups in armed conflict.7 The means and methods of killing vary, and include sniper 
fire, shooting at close range, missiles from helicopters, gunships, drones, the use of car 
bombs, and poison.8

Although this report uses the common terms &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, I agree with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism that the 
continuing lack of a &#8220;universal, comprehensive and precise&#8221; definition of these terms hampers the 
protection of human rights, E/CN.4/2006/98, para. 50, and in particular, the right to life. The work of 
the Ad Hoc Committee established under GA Res. 51/210 to work on a draft convention on 
international terrorism is critical and urgent.

<p>9. The common element in all these contexts is that lethal force is intentionally and 
deliberately used, with a degree of pre-meditation, against an individual or individuals 
specifically identified in advance by the perpetrator.9 In a targeted killing, the specific goal 
of the operation is to use lethal force. This distinguishes targeted killings from 
unintentional, accidental, or reckless killings, or killings made without conscious choice. It 
also distinguishes them from law enforcement operations, e.g., against a suspected suicide 
bomber. Under such circumstances, it may be legal for law enforcement personnel to shoot 
to kill based on the imminence of the threat, but the goal of the operation, from its 
inception, should not be to kill. 
</p>
<p>10. Although in most circumstances targeted killings violate the right to life, in the 
exceptional circumstance of armed conflict, they may be legal.10 This is in contrast to other 
terms with which &#8220;targeted killing&#8221; has sometimes been interchangeably used, such as 
&#8220;extrajudicial execution&#8221;, &#8220;summary execution&#8221;, and &#8220;assassination&#8221;, all of which are, by 
definition, illegal.11 
</p>
<p><b> B. New targeted killing policies 
</b></p>
<p>11. The phenomenon of targeted killing has been present throughout history.12 In 
modern times, targeted killings by States have been very restricted or, to the extent that they 
are not, any <i>de facto</i> policy has been unofficial and usually denied, and both the 
justification and the killings themselves have been cloaked in secrecy.13 When 
responsibility for illegal targeted killings could be credibly assigned, such killings have 
been condemned by the international community &#8211; including by other States alleged to 
practice them.14 
</p>
<p>12. More recently, however, a few States have either openly adopted policies that permit 
targeted killings, or have formally adopted such a policy while refusing to acknowledge its 
existence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Israel 
</b></p>
<p>13. In the 1990s, Israel categorically refused to admit to targeted killings, stating, when 
accused, that &#8220;the [Israeli Defense Force] wholeheartedly rejects this accusation. There is 
no policy and there never will be a policy or a reality of willful killing of suspects . . . the

</p>
<p>principle of the sanctity of life is a fundamental principle of the I.D.F.&#8221;15 In November 
2000, however, the Israeli Government confirmed the existence of a policy pursuant to 
which it justified targeted killings in self-defence and under international humanitarian law 
(IHL) because the Palestinian Authority was failing to prevent, investigate and prosecute 
terrorism and, especially, suicide attacks directed at Israel.16 This was reinforced by the 
issuance, in 2002, of a legal opinion (only part was published) by the Israeli Defense Force 
Judge Advocate General on the conditions under which Israel considered targeted killings 
to be legal.17 
</p>
<p>14. The majority of Israeli targeted killings have reportedly taken place in &#8220;Area A&#8221;, a 
part of the West Bank under the control of the Palestinian Authority.18 The targets have 
included members of various groups, including Fatah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, who, 
Israeli authorities claimed, were involved in planning and carrying out attacks against 
Israeli civilians.19 Means used for targeted killings include drones, snipers, missiles 
shooting from helicopters, killings at close range, and artillery.20 One study by a human 
rights group found that between 2002 and May 2008 at least 387 Palestinians were killed as 
a result of targeted killing operations. Of these, 234 were the targets, while the remainder 
were collateral casualties.21 
</p>
<p>15. The legal underpinnings of these policies were subsequently adjudicated by the 
Israeli Supreme Court in December 2006.22 The court did not as a general matter either 
prohibit or permit targeted killings by Israeli forces, holding instead that the lawfulness of 
each killing must be determined individually. It found without detailed discussion that the 
customary law of international armed conflict was the applicable law, and did not consider 
the application of either human rights law or the IHL of non-international armed conflict. It 
rejected the Government&#8217;s contention that terrorists were &#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221; subject to 
attack at all times. Instead, it held that the applicable law permitted the targeted killing of 
civilians for such time as they &#8220;directly participated in hostilities&#8221;23 as long as four 
cumulative conditions were met: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Targeting forces carried the burden of verifying the identity of the target as well as 
the factual basis for meeting the &#8220;direct participation&#8221; standard. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Even if the target was legally and factually identified by the Government as 
legitimate, State forces could not kill the person if less harmful means were 
available. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; After each targeted killing, there must be a retroactive and independent investigation 
of the &#8220;identification of the target and the circumstances of the attack&#8221;; and

<p>&#8226; Any collateral harm to civilians must meet the IHL requirement of proportionality.24 
</p>
<p>16. Subsequently, it has been reported that Israeli forces have conducted targeted 
killings in violation of the Supreme Court&#8217;s requirements.25 The reports, denied by Israeli 
officials, were allegedly based on classified documents taken by an IDF soldier during her 
military service; the soldier has been charged with espionage.26 
</p>
<p>17. Israel has not disclosed the basis for its legal conclusions, and has not disclosed in 
detail the guidelines it uses to make its targeted killings decisions, the evidentiary or other 
intelligence requirements that would justify any killing, or the results of any after-action 
review of the conformity of the operation with the legal requirements. 
</p>
<p><b>  The USA 
</b></p>
<p>18. The United States has used drones and airstrikes for targeted killings in the armed 
conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the operations are conducted (to the extent 
publicly known) by the armed forces.27 The US also reportedly adopted a secret policy of 
targeted killings soon after the attacks of 11 September 2001,28 pursuant to which the 
Government has credibly been alleged to have engaged in targeted killings in the territory 
of other States.29 The<b> </b>secret targeted killing program is reportedly conducted by the Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) using &#8220;Predator&#8221; or &#8220;Reaper&#8221; drones, although there have been 
reports of involvement by special operations forces, and of the assistance of civilian 
contractors with the implementation of the program.30 
</p>
<p>19. The first credibly reported CIA drone killing occurred on 3 November 2002, when a 
Predator drone fired a missile at a car in Yemen, killing Qaed Senyan al-Harithi, an al-
Qaeda leader allegedly responsible for the <i>USS</i> <i>Cole</i> bombing.31 Since then, there have 
reportedly been over 120 drone strikes, although it is not possible to verify this number.32 
The accuracy of drone strikes is heavily contested and also impossible for outsiders to 
verify. Reports of civilian casualties in Pakistan range from approximately 20 (according to 
anonymous US Government officials quoted in the media) to many hundreds.33 
</p>
<p>20. The CIA reportedly controls its fleet of drones from its headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia, in coordination with pilots near hidden airfields in Afghanistan and Pakistan who 
handle takeoffs and landings.34 The CIA&#8217;s fleet is reportedly flown by civilians, including 
both intelligence officers and private contractors (often retired military personnel).35

</p>
<p>According to media accounts, the head of the CIA&#8217;s clandestine services, or his deputy, 
generally gives the final approval for a strike.36 There is reportedly a list of targets approved 
by senior Government personnel, although the criteria for inclusion and all other aspects of 
the program are unknown.37 The CIA is not required to identify its target by name; rather, 
targeting decisions may be based on surveillance and &#8220;pattern of life&#8221; assessments.38  
</p>
<p>21. The military also has a target list for Afghanistan. A Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee Report released on 10 August 2009 disclosed that the military&#8217;s list included 
drug lords suspected of giving money to help finance the Taliban.39 According to the report, 
&#8220;[t]he military places no restrictions on the use of force with these selected targets, which 
means they can be killed or captured on the battlefield . . . standards for getting on the list 
require two verifiable human sources and substantial additional evidence.&#8221;40 
</p>
<p>22. The Legal Adviser to the Department of State recently outlined the Government&#8217;s 
legal justifications for targeted killings. They were said to be based on its asserted right to 
self-defence, as well as on IHL, on the basis that the US is &#8220;in an armed conflict with Al 
Qaeda, as well as the Taliban and associated forces.&#8221;41 While this statement is an important 
starting point, it does not address some of the most central legal issues including: the scope 
of the armed conflict in which the US asserts it is engaged, the criteria for individuals who 
may be targeted and killed, the existence of any substantive or procedural safeguards to 
ensure the legality and accuracy of killings, and the existence of accountability 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Russia 
</b></p>
<p>23. Russia has described its military operations in Chechnya, launched in 1999, as a 
counter-terrorism operation. During the course of the conflict, Russia has reportedly 
deployed &#8220;seek and destroy&#8221; groups of army commandoes to &#8220;hunt down groups of 
insurgents&#8221;42 and has justified reported targeted killings in Chechnya as necessitated by 
Russia&#8217;s fight against terrorism.43 This justification is especially problematic in so far as 
large parts of the population have been labeled as terrorists.44 Although there are credible 
reports of targeted killings conducted outside of Chechnya, Russia has refused to 
acknowledge responsibility or otherwise justify the killing, and also refused to cooperate 
with any investigation or prosecution.45

</b></p>
<p>24. In summer 2006, the Russian Parliament passed a law permitting the Russian 
security services to kill alleged terrorists overseas, if authorized to do so by the President.46 
The law defines terrorism and terrorist activity extremely broadly, including &#8220;practices of 
influencing the decisions of government, local self-government or international 
organizations by terrorizing the population or through other forms of illegal violent action,&#8221; 
and also any &#8220;ideology of violence.&#8221;47 
</p>
<p>25. Under the law, there appears to be no restriction on the use of military force &#8220;to 
suppress international terrorist activity outside the Russian Federation.&#8221;48 The law requires 
the President to seek the endorsement of the Federation Council to use regular armed forces 
outside Russia, but the President may deploy FSB security forces at his own discretion. 
According to press accounts, at the time of the law&#8217;s passage, &#8220;Russian legislators stressed 
that the law was designed to target terrorists hiding in failed States and that in other 
situations the security services would work with foreign intelligence services to pursue their 
goals.&#8221;49 Legislators also &#8220;insisted that they were emulating Israeli and US actions in 
adopting a law allowing the use of military and special forces outside the country&#8217;s borders 
against external threats.&#8221;50 
</p>
<p>26. There is no publicly available information about any procedural safeguards to ensure 
Russian targeted killings are lawful, the criteria for those who may be targeted, or 
accountability mechanisms for review of targeting operations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. New technology 
</b></p>
<p>27. Drones were originally developed to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance 
and reconnaissance. More than 40 countries now have such technology. Some, including 
Israel, Russia, Turkey, China, India, Iran, the United Kingdom and France either have or 
are seeking drones that also have the capability to shoot laser-guided missiles ranging in 
weight from 35 pounds to more than 100 pounds. The appeal of armed drones is clear: 
especially in hostile terrain, they permit targeted killings at little to no risk to the State 
personnel carrying them out, and they can be operated remotely from the home State. It is 
also conceivable that non-state armed groups could obtain this technology.51 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The applicable legal frameworks and basic rules 
</b></p>
<p>28. Whether or not a specific targeted killing is legal depends on the context in which it 
is conducted: whether in armed conflict, outside armed conflict, or in relation to the inter-
state use of force.52 The basic legal rules applicable to targeted killings in each of these 
contexts are laid out briefly below.

</p>
<p><b>  In the context of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b><i>The legal framework</i></b> : Both IHL and human rights law apply in the context of armed 
conflict; whether a particular killing is legal is determined by the applicable <i>lex specialis</i>.53 
To the extent that IHL does not provide a rule, or the rule is unclear and its meaning cannot 
be ascertained from the guidance offered by IHL principles, it is appropriate to draw 
guidance from human rights law.54 
</p>
<p>30. <b><i>Under the rules of IHL:</i></b>  Targeted killing is only lawful when the target is a 
&#8220;combatant&#8221; or &#8220;fighter&#8221;55 or, in the case of a civilian, only for such time as the person 
&#8220;directly participates in hostilities.&#8221;56 In addition, the killing must be militarily necessary, 
the use of force must be proportionate so that any anticipated military advantage is 
considered in light of the expected harm to civilians in the vicinity,57 and everything 
feasible must be done to prevent mistakes and minimize harm to civilians.58 These 
standards apply regardless of whether the armed conflict is between States (an international 
armed conflict) or between a State and a non-state armed group (non-international armed 
conflict), including alleged terrorists.  Reprisal or punitive attacks on civilians are 
prohibited.59 
</p>
<p><b>  Outside the context of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b><i>The legal framework:</i></b>  The legality of a killing outside the context of armed conflict 
is governed by human rights standards, especially those concerning the use of lethal force. 
Although these standards are sometimes referred to as the &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; model, they 
do not in fact apply only to police forces or in times of peace. The &#8220;law enforcement 
officials&#8221; who may use lethal force include all government officials who exercise police 
</p>
<p>  
 53 Human rights law and IHL apply coextensively and simultaneously unless there is a conflict between 
</p>
<p>them. E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 46-53; A/HRC/4/20, paras. 18-19; A/HRC/11/2/Add.5, paras. 71-73, 83;

In situations that do not involve the conduct of hostilities &#8211; e.g., law enforcement operations during 
non-international armed conflict &#8211; the lex generalis of human rights law would apply.

<p>powers, including a State&#8217;s military and security forces, operating in contexts where 
violence exists, but falls short of the threshold for armed conflict.60 
</p>
<p>32.<i> <b>Under human rights law:</b></i> A State killing is legal only if it is required to protect life 
(making lethal force <i>proportionate</i>) and there is no other means, such as capture or non-
lethal incapacitation, of preventing that threat to life (making lethal force <i>necessary</i>).61 The 
proportionality requirement limits the permissible level of force based on the threat posed 
by the suspect to others.62 The necessity requirement imposes an obligation to minimize the 
level of force used, regardless of the amount that would be proportionate, through, for 
example, the use of warnings, restraint and capture.63  
</p>
<p>33. This means that under human rights law, a targeted killing in the sense of an 
intentional, premeditated and deliberate killing by law enforcement officials cannot be legal 
because, unlike in armed conflict, it is never permissible for killing to be the <i>sole objective</i> 
of an operation. Thus, for example, a &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; policy violates human rights law.64 
This is not to imply, as some erroneously do, that law enforcement is incapable of meeting 
the threats posed by terrorists and, in particular, suicide bombers. Such an argument is 
predicated on a misconception of human rights law, which does not require States to choose 
between letting people be killed and letting their law enforcement officials use lethal force 
to prevent such killings. In fact, under human rights law, States&#8217; duty to respect and to 
ensure the right to life65 entails an obligation to exercise &#8220;due diligence&#8221; to protect the lives 
of individuals from attacks by criminals, including terrorists.66 Lethal force under human 
rights law is legal if it is strictly and directly necessary to save life. 
</p>
<p><b>  The use of inter-state force 
</b></p>
<p>34. <b><i>The legal framework: </i></b> Targeted killings conducted in the territory of other States 
raise sovereignty concerns.67 Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, States are forbidden 
from using force in the territory of another State.68 When a State conducts a targeted killing 
in the territory of another State with which it is not in armed conflict, whether the first State 
violates the sovereignty of the second is determined by the law applicable to the use of 
inter-state force, while the question of whether the specific killing of the particular 
individual(s) is legal is governed by IHL and/or human rights law. 
</p>
<p>35. <b><i>Under the law of inter-state force:</i></b> A targeted killing conducted by one State in the 
territory of a second State does not violate the second State&#8217;s sovereignty if either (a) the 
second State consents, or (b) the first, targeting, State has a right under international law to

<p>use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter,69 because (i) the second State 
is responsible for an armed attack against the first State, or (ii) the second State is unwilling 
or unable to stop armed attacks against the first State launched from its territory. 
International law permits the use of lethal force in self-defence in response to an &#8220;armed 
attack&#8221; as long as that force is necessary and proportionate.70 
</p>
<p>36. While the basic rules are not controversial, the question of which framework applies, 
and the interpretation of aspects of the rules, have been the subject of significant debate. 
Both issues are addressed in greater detail below. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sovereignty issues and States&#8217; invocation of the right to self-defence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Consent 
</b></p>
<p>37. The proposition that a State may consent to the use of force on its territory by 
another State is not legally controversial.71 But while consent may permit the use of force, it 
does not absolve either of the concerned States from their obligations to abide by human 
rights law and IHL with respect to the use of lethal force against a specific person. The 
consenting State&#8217;s responsibility to protect those on its territory from arbitrary deprivation 
of the right to life applies at all times.72 A consenting State may only lawfully authorize a 
killing by the targeting State to the extent that the killing is carried out in accordance with 
applicable IHL or human rights law. 
</p>
<p>38. To meet its legal obligations, therefore, the consenting State should, at a minimum, 
require the targeting State to demonstrate verifiably that the person against whom lethal 
force is to be used can be lawfully targeted and that the targeting State will comply with the 
applicable law.73 After any targeted killing, the consenting State should ensure that it was 
legal. In case of doubt, the consenting State must investigate the killing and, upon a finding 
of wrongdoing, seek prosecution of the offenders and compensation for the victims. 
</p>
<p><b>  The right to self-defence 
</b></p>
<p>39. In the absence of consent, or in addition to it, States may invoke the right to self-
defence as justification for the extraterritorial use of force involving targeted killings.74 As 
noted above, international law permits the use of lethal force in self-defence in response to 
an &#8220;armed attack&#8221; as long as that force is necessary and proportionate.75 Controversy has 
arisen, however, in three main areas: whether the self-defence justification applies to the

<p>use of force against non-state actors and what constitutes an armed attack by such actors; 
the extent to which self-defence alone is a justification for targeted killings; and, the extent 
to which States have a right to &#8220;anticipatory&#8221; or &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; self-defence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Self-defence and non-state actors 
</b></p>
<p>40. It has been a matter of debate whether Article 51 permits States to use force against 
non-state actors. The argument that it does not finds support in judgments of the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) holding that States cannot invoke Article 51 against 
armed attacks by non-state actors that are not imputable to another State.76 On the other 
hand, some States, including the US, argue that Article 51 does not displace the customary 
international law right to act in self-defence, including against non-state actors, and that 
State practice supports that position.77 Commentators find support for that argument in 
Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 issued in the wake of the September 11 
attacks,78 as well as NATO&#8217;s invocation of the North Atlantic Treaty&#8217;s Article 5 collective 
self-defence provision.79 But even if it were to be accepted that Article 51 has not displaced 
customary law, the reality is that it will only be in very rare circumstances that a non-state 
actor whose activities do not engage the responsibility of any State will be able to conduct 
the kind of armed attack that would give rise to the right to use extraterritorial force. In 
such exceptional circumstances, the UN Charter would require that Security Council 
approval should be sought. 
</p>
<p>41. A more difficult question concerns the extent to which persistent but discrete 
attacks, including by a non-state actor, would constitute an &#8220;armed attack&#8221; under Article 51. 
In a series of decisions, the ICJ has established a high threshold for the kinds of attacks that 
would justify the extraterritorial use of force in self-defence.80 In its view, sporadic, low-
intensity attacks do not rise to the level of armed attack that would permit the right to use 
extraterritorial force in self-defence, and the legality of a defensive response must be 
judged in light of each armed attack, rather than by considering occasional, although 
perhaps successive, armed attacks in the aggregate. While this approach has been 
criticized,81 few commentators have supported an approach that would accommodate the 
invocation of the right to self-defence in response to most of the types of attack that have 
been at issue in relation to the extraterritorial targeted killings discussed here. Any such 
approach would diminish hugely the value of the foundational prohibition contained in 
Article 51. 
</p>
<p><b>  The relationship between self-defence and IHL and human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>42. The second area of controversy arises particularly in the context of the use of force 
by the US against alleged terrorists in other countries, especially Pakistan. Some US 
scholars and commentators advocate a &#8220;robust&#8221; form of self-defence in which, once the 
doctrine is invoked, no other legal frameworks or limiting principles &#8211; such as IHL &#8211; would

<p>apply to targeted killings.82 Under this view, once it is justified to use force in self-defence, 
IHL and human rights law would not be applicable to that use of force. This approach 
reflects an unlawful and disturbing tendency in recent times to permit violations of IHL 
based on whether the broader cause in which the right to use force is invoked is &#8220;just,&#8221;83 
and impermissibly conflates jus ad bellum and jus ad bello.84 Proponents of a &#8220;robust&#8221; right 
to self-defence cite to the ICJ&#8217;s Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, in which the court 
found that &#8220;the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally&#8221; violate IHL, but held that 
it could not conclude that such threat or use &#8220;would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme 
circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake.&#8221;85 
While this aspect of the opinion has been criticized as being vague and confusing,86 it seeks 
to address only the most extreme situation involving a State&#8217;s very survival. Invoking such 
an extreme exception to permit the violation of IHL on self-defence grounds in the type of 
situations under consideration here would be tantamount to abandoning IHL. 
</p>
<p>43. The &#8220;robust&#8221; self-defence approach also ignores the very real differences between 
the law of inter-state force and the law applicable to the conduct of hostilities. Whether the 
use of force is legal is a question that usually arises at the start of an armed conflict, while 
the law applicable to the conduct of that armed conflict applies throughout it.87 The 
limitations on each are distinct. Proportionality under self-defence requires States to use 
force only defensively and to the extent necessary to meet defensive objectives,88 whereas 
the test for proportionality under IHL requires States to balance the incidental harm or 
death of civilians caused by an operation to the military advantage that would result. 
Necessity in under self-defence requires a State to assess whether it has means to defend 
itself other than through armed force, while necessity in IHL requires it to evaluate whether 
an operation will achieve the goals of the military operation and is consistent with the other 
rules of IHL. Finally, the &#8220;robust&#8221; self-defence approach fails to take into account the 
existence of two levels of responsibility in the event that a targeted killing for which self-
defence is invoked is found to be unlawful. Violation of the limitations on the right to self-
defence results in State and individual criminal responsibility for aggression. There is also 
liability for the unlawful killing itself &#8211; if it violates IHL, it may be a war crime. The 
Articles on State Responsibility make abundantly clear that States may not invoke self-
defence as justification for their violations of IHL.89

<p>44. In sum, even if the use of inter-state force is offered as justification for a targeted 
killing, it does not dispose of the further question of whether the killing of the particular 
targeted individual or individuals is lawful. The legality of a specific killing depends on 
whether it meets the requirements of IHL and human rights law (in the context of armed 
conflict) or human rights law alone (in all other contexts). 
</p>
<p><b>  Anticipatory and pre-emptive self-defence 
</b></p>
<p>45. The third key area of controversy is the extent to which States seek to invoke the 
right to self-defence not just in response to an armed attack, but in anticipatory self-
defence, or alternatively, as a pre-emptive measure in response to a threat that is persistent 
and may take place in the future, but is not likely to take place imminently.90 Under a 
restrictive view of Article 51, the right to self-defence may only be invoked after an attack 
has taken place.91 In contrast, under a more permissive view that more accurately reflects 
State practice and the weight of scholarship, self-defence also includes the right to use force 
against a real and imminent threat when &#8220;the necessity of that self-defence is instant, 
overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation.&#8221;92 A third 
view, invoked exceptionally by the US Bush administration, but which apparently may still 
reflect US policy, would permit &#8220;pre-emptive self-defence&#8221;, the use of force even when a 
threat is not imminent and &#8220;uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy&#8217;s 
attack.&#8221;93 This view is deeply contested and lacks support under international law.94 
</p>
<p><b> C. The existence and scope of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>46. Whether an armed conflict exists is a question that must be answered with reference 
to objective criteria, which depend on the facts on the ground, and not only on the 
subjective declarations either of States (which can often be influenced by political 
considerations rather than legal ones) or, if applicable, of non-state actors, including alleged 
terrorists (which may also have political reasons for seeking recognition as a belligerent 
party). Traditionally, States have refused to acknowledge the existence of an armed conflict 
with non-state groups. The reasons include not wanting to accord such groups recognition 
as &#8220;belligerents&#8221; or &#8220;warriors&#8221;, and instead being able to insist that they remain common 
criminals subject to domestic law. States also do not want to appear &#8220;weak&#8221; by 
acknowledging that they are unable to stop large scale violence, and/or that rebels or 
insurgent groups have control over State territory. In recent times, for example, the United 
Kingdom (with respect to Northern Ireland) and Russia (with respect to Chechnya) have 
refused to acknowledge the existence of internal armed conflicts.

</p>
<p>47. On the other hand, both the US and Israel have invoked the existence of an armed 
conflict against alleged terrorists (&#8220;non-state armed groups&#8221;).95 The appeal is obvious: the 
IHL applicable in armed conflict arguably has more permissive rules for killing than does 
human rights law or a State&#8217;s domestic law, and generally provides immunity to State 
armed forces.96 Because the law of armed conflict has fewer due process safeguards, States 
also see a benefit to avoiding compliance with the more onerous requirements for capture, 
arrest, detention or extradition of an alleged terrorist in another State. IHL is not, in fact, 
more permissive than human rights law because of the strict IHL requirement that lethal 
force be necessary. But labeling a situation as an armed conflict might also serve to expand 
executive power both as a matter of domestic law and in terms of public support. 
</p>
<p>48. Although the appeal of an armed conflict paradigm to address terrorism is obvious, 
so too is the significant potential for abuse. Internal unrest as a result of insurgency or other 
violence by non-state armed groups, and even terrorism, are common in many parts of the 
world. If States unilaterally extend the law of armed conflict to situations that are 
essentially matters of law enforcement that must, under international law, be dealt with 
under the framework of human rights, they are not only effectively declaring war against a 
particular group, but eviscerating key and necessary distinctions between international law 
frameworks that restricts States&#8217; ability to kill arbitrarily. 
</p>
<p>49. The IHL applicable to non-international armed conflict is not as well-developed as 
that applicable to international armed conflict. Since 11 September 2001, this fact has often 
been cited either to criticize IHL in general or as a justification for innovative 
interpretations which go well beyond generally accepted approaches. It is true that non-
international armed conflict rules would benefit from development, but the rules as they 
currently exist offer more than sufficient guidance to the existence and scope of an armed 
conflict. The key is for States to approach them with good faith intent to apply the rules as 
they exist and have been interpreted by international bodies, rather than to seek ever-
expanding flexibility. 
</p>
<p>50. There are essentially four possibilities under international law for the existence of an 
armed conflict: 
</p>
<p>(i) The conflict is an international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>(ii) The conflict is a non-international armed conflict meeting the threshold of 
Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p>(iii) The conflict is a non-international armed conflict meeting the threshold of 
both Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II to the 
Geneva Conventions 
</p>
<p>(iv) The level of violence does not rise to the level of an armed conflict, but is 
instead isolated and sporadic and human rights law determines the legality of the use 
of lethal force. 
</p>
<p>51. The test for the existence of an <i>international</i> armed conflict is clear under IHL: 
&#8220;Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces&#8221; 
qualifies as armed conflict, regardless of its intensity, duration or scale. 97 The IHL of

<p>international armed conflict applies also to &#8220;all cases of total or partial occupation of the 
territory of a High Contracting Party&#8221; to the Geneva Conventions.98 Following these 
criteria, an international armed conflict cannot exist between a State and a non-state 
group.99 
</p>
<p>52. The tests for the existence of a <i>non-international</i> armed conflict are not as 
categorical as those for international armed conflict. This recognizes the fact that there may 
be various types of non-international armed conflicts. The applicable test may also depend 
on whether a State is party to Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions.100 Under 
treaty and customary international law, the elements which would point to the existence of 
a non-international armed conflict against a non-state armed group are: 
</p>
<p>(i) The non-state armed group must be identifiable as such, based on criteria that 
are objective and verifiable. This is necessary for IHL to apply meaningfully, and so 
that States may comply with their obligation to distinguish between lawful targets 
and civilians.101 The criteria include:102 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Minimal level of organization of the group such that armed forces are able to 
identify an adversary (GC Art. 3; AP II). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capability of the group to apply the Geneva Conventions (i.e., adequate 
command structure, and separation of military and political command) (GC 
Art. 3; AP II). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Engagement of the group in collective, armed, anti-government action (GC 
Art. 3). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For a conflict involving a State, the State uses its regular military forces 
against the group (GC Art. 3). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Admission of the conflict against the group to the agenda of the UN Security 
Council or the General Assembly (GC Art. 3). 
</p>
<p>(ii) There must be a minimal threshold of intensity and duration. The threshold of 
violence is higher than required for the existence of an international armed conflict. 
To meet the minimum threshold, violence must be:103 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  &#8220;Beyond the level of intensity of internal disturbances and tensions, such as 
riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature&#8221; 
(AP II).

</p>
<p>&#8226; If an isolated incident, the incident itself should be of a high degree of 
intensity, with a high level of organization on the part of the non-state armed 
group; 105  
</p>
<p>(iii) The territorial confines can be: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Restricted to the territory of a State and between the State&#8217;s own armed 
forces and the non-state group (AP II); or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A transnational conflict, i.e., one that crosses State borders (GC Art. 3).106 
This does not mean, however, that there is no territorial nexus requirement. 
</p>
<p>53. Taken cumulatively, these factors make it problematic for the US to show that &#8211; 
outside the context of the armed conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq &#8211; it is in a transnational 
non-international armed conflict against &#8220;al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other associated 
forces&#8221;107 without further explanation of how those entities constitute a &#8220;party&#8221; under the 
IHL of non-international armed conflict, and whether and how any violence by any such 
group rises to the level necessary for an armed conflict to exist. 
</p>
<p>54. The focus, instead, appears to be on the &#8220;transnational&#8221; nature of the terrorist threat. 
Al-Qaeda and entities with various degrees of &#8220;association&#8221; with it are indeed known to 
have operated in numerous countries around the world including in Saudi Arabia, 
Indonesia, Pakistan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, among others, where they 
have conducted terrorist attacks. Yet none of these States, with the possible exception of 
Pakistan, recognize themselves as being part of an armed conflict against al-Qaeda or its 
&#8220;associates&#8221; in their territory. Indeed, in each of those States, even when there have been 
terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda or other groups claiming affiliation with it, the duration and 
intensity of such attacks has not risen to the level of an armed conflict. Thus, while it is true 
that non-international armed conflict can exist across State borders, and indeed often does, 
that is only one of a number of cumulative factors that must be considered for the objective 
existence of an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>55. With respect to the existence of a non-state group as a &#8220;party&#8221;, al-Qaeda and other 
alleged &#8220;associated&#8221; groups are often only loosely linked, if at all. Sometimes they appear 
to be not even groups, but a few individuals who take &#8220;inspiration&#8221; from al Qaeda. The idea 
that, instead, they are part of continuing hostilities that spread to new territories as new 
alliances form or are claimed may be superficially appealing but such &#8220;associates&#8217; cannot 
constitute a &#8220;party&#8221; as required by IHL &#8211; although they can be criminals, if their conduct 
violates US law, or the law of the State in which they are located. 
</p>
<p>56. To ignore these minimum requirements, as well as the object and purpose of IHL, 
would be to undermine IHL safeguards against the use of violence against groups that are 
not the equivalent of an organized armed group capable of being a party to a conflict &#8211; 
whether because it lacks organization, the ability to engage in armed attacks, or because it 
does not have a connection or belligerent nexus to actual hostilities. It is also salutary to 
recognize that whatever rules the US seeks to invoke or apply to al Qaeda and any 
&#8220;affiliates&#8221; could be invoked by other States to apply to other non-state armed groups. To 
expand the notion of non-international armed conflict to groups that are essentially drug

framework would be to do deep damage to the IHL and human rights frameworks. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Who may lawfully be targeted, when, and on what basis 
</b></p>
<p>57. The greatest source of the lack of clarity with respected to targeted killings in the 
context of armed conflict is who qualifies as a lawful target, and where and when the 
person may be targeted. 
</p>
<p>58. In international armed conflict, combatants may be targeted at any time and any 
place (subject to the other requirements of IHL).108 Under the IHL applicable to non-
international armed conflict, the rules are less clear. In non-international armed conflict, 
there is no such thing as a &#8220;combatant.&#8221;109 Instead &#8211; as in international armed conflict &#8211; 
States are permitted to directly attack only civilians who &#8220;directly participate in hostilities&#8221; 
(DPH).110 Because there is no commonly accepted definition of DPH, it has been left open 
to States&#8217; own interpretation &#8211; which States have preferred not to make public &#8211; to 
determine what constitutes DPH. 
</p>
<p>59. There are three key controversies over DPH. First, there is dispute over the kind of 
conduct that constitutes &#8220;direct participation&#8221; and makes an individual subject to attack. 
Second, there is disagreement over the extent to which &#8220;membership&#8221; in an organized 
armed group may be used as a factor in determining whether a person is directly 
participating in hostilities. Third, there is controversy over how long direct participation 
lasts. 
</p>
<p>60. It is not easy to arrive at a definition of direct participation that protects civilians and 
at the same time does not &#8220;reward&#8221; an enemy that may fail to distinguish between civilians 
and lawful military targets, that may deliberately hide among civilian populations and put 
them at risk, or that may force civilians to engage in hostilities.111 The key, however, is to 
recognize that regardless of the enemy&#8217;s tactics, in order to protect the vast majority of 
civilians, direct participation may only include conduct close to that of a fighter, or conduct 
that directly supports combat. More attenuated acts, such as providing financial support, 
advocacy, or other non-combat aid, does not constitute direct participation.  
</p>
<p>61. Some types of conduct have long been understood to constitute direct participation, 
such as civilians who shoot at State forces or commit acts of violence in the context of 
hostilities that would cause death or injury to civilians. Other conduct has traditionally been 
excluded from direct participation, even if it supports the general war effort; such conduct 
includes political advocacy, supplying food or shelter, or economic support and propaganda 
(all also protected under other human rights standards). Even if these activities ultimately 
impact hostilities, they are not considered &#8220;direct participation.&#8221; But there is a middle

</p>
<p>ground, such as for the proverbial &#8220;farmer by day, fighter by night&#8221;, that has remained 
unclear and subject to uncertainty. 
</p>
<p>62. In 2009, the ICRC issued its Interpretive Guidance on DPH, which provides a useful 
starting point for discussion. In non-international armed conflict, according to the ICRC 
Guidance, civilians who participate directly in hostilities and are members of an armed 
group who have a &#8220;continuous combat function&#8221; may be targeted at all times and in all 
places.112 With respect to the temporal duration of DPH for all other civilians, the ICRC 
Guidance takes the view that direct participation for civilians is limited to each single act: 
the earliest point of direct participation would be the concrete preparatory measures for that 
specific act (e.g., loading bombs onto a plane), and participation terminates when the 
activity ends.113 
</p>
<p>63. Under the ICRC&#8217;s Guidance, each specific act by the civilian must meet three 
cumulative requirements to constitute DPH:  
</p>
<p>(i) There must be a &#8220;threshold of harm&#8221; that is objectively likely to result from 
the act, either by adversely impacting the military operations or capacity of the 
opposing party, or by causing the loss of life or property of protected civilian 
persons or objects; and 
</p>
<p>(ii) The act must cause the expected harm directly, in one step, for example, as an 
integral part of a specific and coordinated combat operation (as opposed to harm 
caused in unspecified future operations); and  
</p>
<p>(iii) The act must have a &#8220;belligerent nexus&#8221; &#8211; i.e., it must be specifically 
designed to support the military operations of one party to the detriment of another.  
</p>
<p>64. These criteria generally exclude conduct that is clearly indirect, including general 
support for the war effort through preparation or capacity building (such as the production 
of weapons and military equipment).114 They also exclude conduct that is protected by other 
human rights standards, including political support for a belligerent party or an organized 
armed group. Importantly, the ICRC&#8217;s Guidance makes clear that the lawfulness of an act 
under domestic or international law is not at issue, rather, the sole concern of the direct 
participation inquiry is whether the conduct &#8220;constitute[s] an integral part of armed 
confrontations occurring between belligerents.&#8221;115 Thus, although illegal activities, e.g., 
terrorism, may cause harm, if they do not meet the criteria for direct participation <i>in 
hostilities</i>,116 then States&#8217; response must conform to the lethal force standards applicable to 
self-defence and law enforcement.117 In general, the ICRC&#8217;s approach is correct, and 
comports both with human rights law and IHL. 
</p>
<p>65. Nevertheless, the ICRC&#8217;s Guidance raises concern from a human rights perspective 
because of the &#8220;continuous combat function&#8221; (CCF) category of armed group members who 
may be targeted anywhere, at any time.118 In its general approach to DPH, the ICRC is 
correct to focus on function (the kind of act) rather than status (combatant vs. unprivileged 
belligerent), but the creation of CCF category is, <i>de facto</i>, a status determination that is

<p>questionable given the specific treaty language that limits direct participation to &#8220;for such 
time&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;all the time.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>66. Creation of the CCF category also raises the risk of erroneous targeting of someone 
who, for example, may have disengaged from their function. If States are to accept this 
category, the onus will be on them to show that the evidentiary basis is strong. In addition, 
States must adhere to the careful distinction the ICRC draws between continuous 
combatants who may always be subject to direct attack and civilians who (i) engage in 
sporadic or episodic direct participation (and may only be attacked during their 
participation), or (ii) have a general war support function (&#8220;recruiters, trainers, financiers 
and propagandists&#8221;) or form the political wing of an organized armed group (neither of 
which is a basis for attack).119  
</p>
<p>67. Especially given the ICRC&#8217;s membership approach to CCF, it is imperative that the 
other constituent parts of the Guidance (threshold of harm, causation and belligerent nexus) 
not be diluted. It is also critical that DPH not include combat service support functions 
(selling food, providing supplies). While this may, in the view of some, create inequity 
between State forces and non-state actors, that inequity is built into IHL in order to protect 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>68. The failure of States to disclose their criteria for DPH is deeply problematic because 
it gives no transparency or clarity about what conduct could subject a civilian to killing. It 
also leaves open the likelihood that States will unilaterally expand their concept of direct 
participation beyond permissible boundaries. Thus, although the US has not made public its 
definition of DPH, it is clear that it is more expansive than that set out by the ICRC; in 
Afghanistan, the US has said that drug traffickers on the &#8220;battlefield&#8221; who have links to the 
insurgency may be targeted and killed.120 This is not consistent with the traditionally 
understood concepts under IHL &#8211; drug trafficking is understood as criminal conduct, not an 
activity that would subject someone to a targeted killing. And generating profits that might 
be used to fund hostile actions does not constitute DPH. 
</p>
<p>69. Given the ICRC&#8217;s promulgation of its Guidance, and the hesitant or uncertain 
response of some States to date, in order for the issues to be addressed comprehensively, it 
would be very timely for there to be a convening of State representatives, including 
particularly those from key military powers, together with the ICRC and experts in human 
rights and IHL. Such a convening would perhaps be most useful if held under the auspices 
of a neutral body, such as the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The group could 
discuss and revise (if necessary) the ICRC&#8217;s Guidance after a careful review of best 
practices. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Who may conduct a targeted killing 
</b></p>
<p>70. Reported targeted killings by the CIA have given rise to a debate over whether it is a 
violation of IHL for such killings to be committed by State agents who are not members of 
its armed forces. Some commentators have argued that CIA personnel who conduct 
targeted drone killings are committing war crimes because they, unlike the military, are 
&#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221;, and unable to participate in hostilities. This argument is not 
supported by IHL. As a threshold matter, the argument assumes that targeted killings by the 
CIA are committed in the context of armed conflict, which may not be the case. Outside of 
armed conflict, killings by the CIA would constitute extrajudicial executions assuming that

</p>
<p>they do not comply with human rights law. If so, they must be investigated and prosecuted 
both by the US and the State in which the wrongful killing occurred. The following 
discussion assumes, without accepting, that CIA killings are being conducted in the context 
of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>71. Under IHL, civilians, including intelligence agents, are not prohibited from 
participating in hostilities. Rather, the consequence of participation is two-fold. First, 
because they are &#8220;directly participating in hostilities&#8221; by conducting targeted killings, 
intelligence personnel may themselves be targeted and killed. Second, intelligence 
personnel do not have immunity from prosecution under domestic law for their conduct. 
They are thus unlike State armed forces which would generally be immune from 
prosecution for the same conduct (assuming they complied with IHL requirements). Thus, 
CIA personnel could be prosecuted for murder under the domestic law of any country in 
which they conduct targeted drone killings, and could also be prosecuted for violations of 
applicable US law. 
</p>
<p>72. It is important to note that if a targeted killing violates IHL (by, for example, 
targeting civilians who were not &#8220;directly participating in hostilities&#8221;), then regardless of 
who conducts it &#8211; intelligence personnel or State armed forces &#8211; the author, as well as those 
who authorized it, can be prosecuted for war crimes. 
</p>
<p>73. Additionally, unlike a State&#8217;s armed forces, its intelligence agents do not generally 
operate within a framework which places appropriate emphasis upon ensuring compliance 
with IHL, rendering violations more likely and causing a higher risk of prosecution both for 
war crimes and for violations of the laws of the State in which any killing occurs. To the 
extent a State uses intelligence agents for targeted killing to shield its operations from IHL 
and human rights law transparency and accountability requirements, it could also incur 
State responsibility for violating those requirements.121 
</p>
<p><b> F. The use of less-than-lethal measures 
</b></p>
<p>74. As discussed above, the intentional use of lethal force in the context of law 
enforcement is only permitted in defence of life. Thus, outside the context of armed 
conflict, law enforcement officials are required to be trained in, to plan for, and to take, 
less-than-lethal measures &#8211; including restraint, capture, and the graduated use of force &#8211; and 
it is only if these measures are not possible that a law enforcement killing will be legal.122 
States should ensure public disclosure of the measures taken to &#8220;strictly control and limit 
the circumstances&#8221; in which law enforcement officers may resort to lethal force, including 
the level of force used at each stage.123 The legal framework must take into account the 
possibility that the threat is so imminent that graduated use of force is not possible, and 
ensure appropriate safeguards are in place so that the assessment of imminence is reliably 
made.124 
</p>
<p>75. Although IHL does not expressly regulate the kind and degree of force that may be 
used against legitimate targets, it does envisage the use of less-than-lethal measures: in

<p> <b>23

<p>armed conflict, the &#8220;right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not 
unlimited&#8221;125 and States must not inflict &#8220;harm greater that that unavoidable to achieve 
legitimate military objectives.&#8221;126 The limiting principles are not controversial &#8211; States may 
only exercise force that is militarily necessary and consistent with the principle of 
humanity.127 As the ICRC Guidance recognizes &#8220;it would defy basic notions of humanity to 
kill an adversary or to refrain from giving him or her an opportunity to surrender where 
there manifestly is no necessity for the use of lethal force.&#8221;128  
</p>
<p>76. The position taken by the ICRC in its Guidance has been the subject of controversy. 
The Guidance states that, &#8220;the kind and degree of force which is permissible against 
persons not entitled to protection against direct attack must not exceed what is actually 
necessary to accomplish a legitimate military purpose in the prevailing circumstances.&#8221;129 
Some critics interpret this statement as requiring the use of a law enforcement paradigm in 
the context of armed conflict.130 However, as the Guidance makes clear, it states only the 
uncontroversial IHL requirement that the kind and amount of force used in a military 
operation be limited to what is &#8220;actually necessary to accomplish a legitimate military 
purpose in the prevailing circumstances.&#8221;131 Especially in the context of targeted killings of 
civilians who directly participate in hostilities, and given that IHL does not create an 
unrestrained right to kill,132 the better approach is for State forces to minimize the use of 
lethal force to the extent feasible in the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>77. Less-than-lethal measures are especially appropriate when a State has control over 
the area in which a military operation is taking place,133 when &#8220;armed forces operate against 
selected individuals in situations comparable to peacetime policing,&#8221;134 and in the context 
of non-international armed conflict, in which rules are less clear.135 In these situations, 
States should use graduated force and, where possible, capture rather than kill. Thus, rather 
than using drone strikes, US forces should, wherever and whenever possible, conduct 
arrests, or use less-than-lethal force to restrain. As the ICRC&#8217;s Guidance intended to make 
clear, &#8220;the international lawfulness of a particular operation involving the use of force may 
not always depend exclusively on IHL but, depending on the circumstances, may 
potentially be influenced by other applicable legal frameworks, such as human rights law 
and the <i>jus ad bellum</i>.&#8221;136

reduce casualties include:

<p>&#8226; Provide effective advance warning to the civilian population, through leaflets, 
broadcast warnings, etc. in the areas in which targeted killings may take place.137 
The warnings must be as specific as possible.138 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Any such warning does not, however, discharge the obligation to distinguish 
between lawful targets and civilians. &#8220;Warnings are required for the benefit of 
civilians, but civilians are not obligated to comply with them. A decision to stay put 
&#8212; freely taken or due to limited options &#8212; in no way diminishes a civilian&#8217;s legal 
protections.&#8221; 139 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The use of civilians as &#8220;shields&#8221; is strictly prohibited.140 But one side&#8217;s unlawful use 
of civilian shields does not affect the other side&#8217;s obligation to ensure that attacks do 
not kill civilians in excess of the military advantage of killing the targeted fighter.141 
</p>
<p><b> G. The use of drones for targeted killing 
</b></p>
<p>79. The use of drones for targeted killings has generated significant controversy. Some 
have suggested that drones as such are prohibited weapons under IHL because they cause, 
or have the effect of causing, necessarily indiscriminate killings of civilians, such as those 
in the vicinity of a targeted person.142 It is true that IHL places limits on the weapons States 
may use, and weapons that are, for example, inherently indiscriminate (such as biological 
weapons) are prohibited.143 However, a missile fired from a drone is no different from any 
other commonly used weapon, including a gun fired by a soldier or a helicopter or gunship 
that fires missiles. The critical legal question is the same for each weapon: whether its 
specific use complies with IHL. 
</p>
<p>80. The greater concern with drones is that because they make it easier to kill without 
risk to a State&#8217;s forces, policy makers and commanders will be tempted to interpret the 
legal limitations on who can be killed, and under what circumstances, too expansively. 
States must ensure that the criteria they apply to determine who can be targeted and killed &#8211; 
i.e., who is a lawful combatant, or what constitutes &#8220;direct participation in hostilities&#8221; that 
would subject civilians to direct attack &#8211; do not differ based on the choice of weapon. 
</p>
<p>81. Drones&#8217; proponents argue that since drones have greater surveillance capability and 
afford greater precision than other weapons, they can better prevent collateral civilian 
casualties and injuries. This may well be true to an extent, but it presents an incomplete 
picture. The precision, accuracy and legality of a drone strike depend on the human 
intelligence upon which the targeting decision is based. 
</p>
<p>82. Drones may provide the ability to conduct aerial surveillance and to gather &#8220;pattern 
of life&#8221; information that would allow their human operators to distinguish between peaceful 
civilians and those engaged in direct hostilities. Indeed, advanced surveillance capability

<p>enhances the ability of a State&#8217;s forces to undertake precautions in attack.144 But these 
optimal conditions may not exist in every case. More importantly, a drone operation team 
sitting thousands of miles away from the environment in which a potential target is located 
may well be at an even greater human intelligence gathering disadvantage than ground 
forces, who themselves are often unable to collect reliable intelligence. 
</p>
<p>83. It was clear during my mission to Afghanistan how hard it is even for forces on the 
ground to obtain accurate information. Testimony from witnesses and victims&#8217; family 
members, showed that international forces were often too uninformed of local practices, or 
too credulous in interpreting information, to be able to arrive at a reliable understanding of 
a situation.145 International forces all too often based manned airstrikes and raids that 
resulted in killings on faulty intelligence. Multiple other examples show that the legality of 
a targeted killing operation is heavily dependent upon the reliability of the intelligence on 
which it is based.<i>146</i> States must, therefore, ensure that they have in place the procedural 
safeguards necessary to ensure that intelligence on which targeting decisions are made is 
accurate and verifiable. 
</p>
<p>84. Furthermore, because operators are based thousands of miles away from the 
battlefield, and undertake operations entirely through computer screens and remote audio-
feed, there is a risk of developing a &#8220;Playstation&#8221; mentality to killing. States must ensure 
that training programs for drone operators who have never been subjected to the risks and 
rigors of battle instill respect for IHL and adequate safeguards for compliance with it. 
</p>
<p>85. Outside the context of armed conflict, the use of drones for targeted killing is almost 
never likely to be legal. A targeted drone killing in a State&#8217;s own territory, over which the 
State has control, would be very unlikely to meet human rights law limitations on the use of 
lethal force.  
</p>
<p>86. Outside its own territory (or in territory over which it lacked control) and where the 
situation on the ground did not rise to the level of armed conflict in which IHL would 
apply, a State could theoretically seek to justify the use of drones by invoking the right to 
anticipatory self-defence against a non-state actor.147 It could also theoretically claim that 
human rights law&#8217;s requirement of first employing less-than-lethal means would not be 
possible if the State has no means of capturing or causing the other State to capture the 
target. As a practical matter, there are very few situations outside the context of active 
hostilities in which the test for anticipatory self-defence &#8211; necessity that is &#8220;instant, 
overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation&#8221;148 &#8211; would 
be met. This hypothetical presents the same danger as the &#8220;ticking-time bomb&#8221; scenario 
does in the context of the use of torture and coercion during interrogations: a thought 
experiment that posits a rare emergency exception to an absolute prohibition can effectively 
institutionalize that exception. Applying such a scenario to targeted killings threatens to 
eviscerate the human rights law prohibition against the arbitrary deprivation of life. In 
addition, drone killing of anyone other than the target (family members or others in the 
vicinity, for example) would be an arbitrary deprivation of life under human rights law and 
could result in State responsibility and individual criminal liability.

<p><b> H. The requirements of transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>87. The failure of States to comply with their human rights law and IHL obligations to 
provide transparency and accountability for targeted killings is a matter of deep concern. To 
date, no State has disclosed the full legal basis for targeted killings, including its 
interpretation of the legal issues discussed above. Nor has any State disclosed the 
procedural and other safeguards in place to ensure that killings are lawful and justified, and 
the accountability mechanisms that ensure wrongful killings are investigated, prosecuted 
and punished. The refusal by States who conduct targeted killings to provide transparency 
about their policies violates the international legal framework that limits the unlawful use of 
lethal force against individuals.149 
</p>
<p>88. Transparency is required by both IHL150 and human rights law.151 A lack of 
disclosure gives States a virtual and impermissible license to kill. 
</p>
<p>89. Among the procedural safeguards States must take (and disclose) with respect to 
targeted killings in armed conflict are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that forces and agents have access to reliable information to support the 
targeting decision.152 These include an appropriate command and control structure,153 
as well as safeguards against faulty or unverifiable evidence. 154 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure adequate intelligence on &#8220;the effects of the weapons that are to be used &#8230; 
the number of civilians that are likely to be present in the target area at the particular 
time; and whether they have any possibility to take cover before the attack takes 
place.&#8221;155 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The proportionality of an attack must be assessed for each individual strike.156 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that when an error is apparent, those conducting a targeted killing are able to 
abort or suspend the attack. 157 
</p>
<p>90. In order to ensure that accountability is meaningful, States must specifically disclose 
the measures in place to investigate alleged unlawful targeted killings and either to identify

facie case for the unlawfulness of a targeted killing.158 
</p>
<p>91. States have also refused to provide factual information about who has been targeted 
under their policies and with what outcome, including whether innocent civilians have been 
collaterally killed or injured. In some instances, targeted killings take place in easily 
accessible urban areas, and human rights monitors and civil society are able to document 
the outcome. In others, because of remoteness or security concerns, it has been impossible 
for independent observers and the international community to judge whether killings were 
lawful or not. 
</p>
<p>92. Transparency and accountability in the context of armed conflict or other situations 
that raise security concerns may not be easy. States may have tactical or security reasons 
not to disclose criteria for selecting specific targets (e.g. public release of intelligence 
source information could cause harm to the source). But without disclosure of the legal 
rationale as well as the bases for the selection of specific targets (consistent with genuine 
security needs), States are operating in an accountability vacuum. It is not possible for the 
international community to verify the legality of a killing, to confirm the authenticity or 
otherwise of intelligence relied upon, or to ensure that unlawful targeted killings do not 
result in impunity. The fact that there is no one-size-fits-all formula for such disclosure 
does not absolve States of the need to adopt explicit policies. 
</p>

<p><b>  General 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>States should publicly identify the rules of international law they consider to 
provide a basis for any targeted killings they undertake. They should specify the bases 
for decisions to kill rather than capture. They should specify the procedural 
safeguards in place to ensure in advance of targeted killings that they comply with 
international law, and the measures taken after any such killing to ensure that its legal 
and factual analysis was accurate and, if not, the remedial measures they would take. 
If a State commits a targeted killing in the territory of another State, the second State 
should publicly indicate whether it gave consent, and on what basis. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should make public the number of civilians collaterally killed in a 
targeted killing operation, and the measures in place to prevent such casualties. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner for Human Rights should convene a meeting of States, 
including representatives of key military powers, the ICRC and human rights 
and IHL experts to arrive at a broadly accepted definition of &#8220;direct

forces or operators to make legal and accurate targeting decisions. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Targeted killings should never be based solely on &#8220;suspicious&#8221; conduct 
or unverified &#8211; or unverifiable &#8211; information. Intelligence gathering and 
sharing arrangements must include procedures for reliably vetting 
targets, and adequately verifying information.

<p>&#8226; <b>State forces should ensure adequate intelligence on the effects of 
weapons to be used, the presence of civilians in the targeted area, and 
whether civilians have the ability to protect themselves from attack. It 
bears emphasis that State forces violate the IHL requirements of 
proportionality and precaution if they do not do everything feasible to 
determine who else is, or will be, in the vicinity of a target &#8211; and thus 
how many other lives will be lost or people injured &#8211; before conducting a 
targeted killing.

ground and remote pilots may have access to different information (e.g. 
based on human intelligence, or visuals from satellites); it is incumbent </b></p>

<p><b>on pilots, whether remote or not, to ensure that a commander&#8217;s 
assessment of the legality of a proposed strike is borne out by visual 
confirmation that the target is in fact lawful, and that the requirements 
of necessity, proportionality and discrimination are met. If the facts on 
the ground change in substantive respects, those responsible must do 
everything feasible to abort or suspend the attack. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that compliance with the IHL proportionality principle is assessed for 
each attack individually, and not for an overall military operation. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that even after a targeting operation is under way, if it appears that the 
target is not lawful, or that the collateral loss of life or property damage is in 
excess of the original determination, targeting forces have the ability and 
discretion to cancel or postpone an attack. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure procedures are in place to verify that no targeted killing is taken in 
revenge, or primarily to cause terror or to intimidate, or to gain political 
advantage. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Especially in heavily populated urban areas, if it appears that a targeted killing 
will risk harm to civilians, State forces must provide effective advance warning, 
as specifically as possible, to the population. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Warning does not, however, discharge the obligation to distinguish 
between lawful targets and civilians. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Although the use of civilians as &#8220;shields&#8221; is prohibited, one side&#8217;s 
unlawful use of civilian shields does not affect the other side&#8217;s obligation 
to ensure that attacks do not kill civilians in excess of the military 
advantage of killing the targeted fighter.
