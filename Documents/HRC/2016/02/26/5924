<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, other international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law instruments, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
Assembly states that the Human Rights Council shall be responsible for promoting universal 
respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction of any kind and in fair and equal manner, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> resolution 2005/63 of 20 April 2005 of the Commission on Human Rights, and 
taking note of decision 2006/21 of 24 August 2006 adopted by the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights at its final session, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Gravely concerned </i>at violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law 
during armed conflicts, wherever they occur, and their impact on the civilian population, 
especially women, children and vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that effective measures to guarantee and monitor the implementation of human 
rights should be taken in respect of civilian populations in situations of armed conflict, including 
people under foreign occupation, and that effective protection against violations of their human 
rights should be provided, in accordance with international human rights law and applicable 
international humanitarian law, particularly Geneva Convention IV relative to the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and other applicable international 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that States parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have undertaken to 
respect and ensure respect for these Conventions in all circumstances,  </p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that all human rights require protection equally and that the protection 
provided by human rights law continues in armed conflict situations, taking into account when 
international humanitarian law applies as a <i>lex specialis</i>, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in accordance with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, certain rights are recognized as non-derogable in all circumstances and that any 
measures derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with its article 4 
in all cases, and underlining the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that conduct that violates international humanitarian law, including 
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, or of the Protocols Additional 
thereto of 8 June 1977, may also constitute a gross violation of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> its deep concern at the wide gap between the obligations of States under 
international humanitarian law and international human rights law and their implementation, 
which undermines the protection of human rights of civilians in armed conflicts;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect the human rights of civilians in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of combating impunity in order to prevent violations of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law perpetrated against civilians in 
armed conflicts, and urges States, in accordance with their international obligations, to bring 
perpetrators of such crimes to justice; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the international community to support regional efforts aimed at the 
protection of civilians in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Resolves </i>to address, in accordance with its mandate established by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 60/251, systematic and gross violations of the human rights 
of civilians in armed conflicts, and calls upon States involved in such conflicts to facilitate the 
work of any mechanism that the Council may decide to establish, as and where appropriate, in 
response to such violations, including, inter alia, fact-finding missions or commissions of 
enquiry; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> relevant special procedures and the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee, and invites human rights treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, to continue 
to address the relevant aspects of the protection of human rights of civilians in armed conflicts in 
their work;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites </i>the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, within 
</p>
<p>existing resources, an expert consultation, open to the participation of Governments, regional 
organizations, relevant United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, and in consultation 
with the International Committee of the Red Cross, on the issue of protecting the human rights of 
civilians in armed conflict, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to report on the outcome of this consultation, in the form of a summary of discussions on the 
above-mentioned issue, to the Council at its eleventh session; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to elaborate a comprehensive study, drawing upon 
the work previously undertaken by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights, and bearing in mind the outcome of the above-mentioned expert consultation and 
the input received from all relevant stakeholders, with a view to identify mechanisms, 
modalities, procedures and methods for enhancing the protection of human rights of civilians in 
armed conflicts, and to present concrete recommendations thereon for consideration by the 
Council at its thirteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this question at its twelfth session under the 
same agenda item.
