PETROTERRA CORP.
Notes To The Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
PetroTerra Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on
July 25, 2008. The Company is an independent exploration and development company focused
on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such
property) that we believe may contain extractable oil and/or gas. The Company identified,
evaluated and acquired oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily within
the United States. As a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we are now seeking
strategic alternatives. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its
operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.
2. GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting
in an accumulated deficit of $2,707,319 as of June 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in
the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities, which have arisen from normal business operations as they
come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with
existing cash on hand loans from our director and/or private placements of common stock.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.
These statements reflect all adjustments, including of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the
opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It
is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2016 and notes thereto
included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K. The Company follows the same
accounting policies in the preparation of its annual and interim reports.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of three months or less
at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In management’s
opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have
been made and all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional currency and its reporting currency is the United States dollar.
Stock Split
On July 1, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada to effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of
common stock at a ratio of 1 for 2.5 (the “Reverse Stock Split”).
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s authorized shares of common stock were
decreased from 100,000,000 to 40,000,000 shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock
were decreased from 10,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares. Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse
Stock Split, which occurred on July 1, 2015, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of
common stock was decreased from approximately 66,125,000 to 26,450,000 shares, all with a
par value of $0.001. The Company has no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all
share and per share information has been restated to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse
Stock Split.
Stock-based Compensation
In September 2009, the FASB issued ASC-718, “Stock Compensation”. ASC-718 requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. Under
ASC-718, the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing
share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method
to be used at date of adoption.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, “Earnings per Share”
which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock
during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential shares of
common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments
and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are equal.
Fiscal Periods
The Company’s fiscal year end is March 31.

PETROTERRA CORP.
Notes To The Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
Revenue Recognition
The Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ACS - 605, “Revenue recognition”,
ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is
fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3)
and (4) are based on management’s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of
the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and
rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for
in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which
the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and
the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.
Oil and Gas
The Company complies with ASC 932, “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas”. The Company has
capitalized exploratory well costs, and has determined that there are no suspended well costs
that should be impaired. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairments when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.
Website
The Company capitalizes the costs associated with the development of the Company’s website
pursuant to ASC - 350, “Goodwill and Other”. Other costs related to the maintenance of the
website are expensed as incurred. Amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of
three years using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. The Company
commenced amortization upon completion of the Company’s fully operational website.
Amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $3,717 and
$2,192, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments
that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes at rates based on the following estimated useful lives:

Patents and trademarks 15 Years

Advertising
The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expenses incurred. The
Company incurred $0 in advertising costs during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB amended the ASC and created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. This guidance will be effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2017 and must be adopted using either a full retrospective
approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach.
We have not yet determined the effects of this new guidance on our financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued a new U.S. GAAP accounting standard that provides guidance
about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The
new accounting standard requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S.
auditing standards. The new accounting standard is effective for the annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is
permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact
on the consolidated financial statements.
4. ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
On November 18, 2013, the Company entered into an assignment of lease (the “Agreement”)
whereby Ardmore Investments Inc. (“Ardmore”) assigned to the Company its rights under a
certain purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated August 8, 2013, between
Ardmore and Pioneer Oil and Gas (“Pioneer”) involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of oil and gas
leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and
currently owned by Pioneer (the “Leases”). Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to
Ardmore an aggregate of 200,000 shares (100,000 share installments) of our common stock on
November 18, 2013 and April 12, 2014 in order to complete the assignment. Furthermore, on
December 12, 2013, February 12, 2014 and April 12, 2014, the Company made three installment
payments of $100,000 each to Pioneer. Upon completion of the final installment the leases were
conveyed to the Company.
Due to the lack of an active market of the Company’s common stock, the fair value of the common
stock issued to Ardmore was determined based on the price at which the Company’s shares
were most recently being sold in a private placement transaction.
Impairment
The Company determined that there was a material impairment of the land lease agreements
and recorded an impairment of the asset of $737,500 in the year ended March 31, 2016.

5. COMMON STOCK
The Company’s authorized capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock and
4,000,000 shares of preferred stock, both with a par value of $0.001 per share.
On July 1, 2015, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized
shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 2.5. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the
Company’s authorized shares of common stock were decreased from 100,000,000 to 40,000,000
shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock were decreased from 10,000,000 to
4,000,000 shares. Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on July 1,
2015, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock was decreased from
66,124,593 to 26,449,868 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. The Company has no
outstanding shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been
restated in this Report to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.
On April 27, 2016, the Company authorized the issuance of 50,000 shares of common stock to
the Company’s Chief Operating Officer for consulting services. The fair value of the shares of
common stock was $4,000.
On June 3, 2016, the Company issued 1,022,122 shares in exchange for the conversion of
$10,119 of shareholder loans and $71,250 of accrued officer payroll and recorded a loss on
conversion of debt expense of $10,622 during the period ending June 30, 2016 (See Note 5).
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 28,323,588 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding.

6. INCOME TAXES
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately
$2,707,319 that may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income through 2034. Future
tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these
financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur. Accordingly, the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss
carry-forwards.
7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Chief Executive Officer

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATION
GENERAL
We are a development stage company that identified, evaluated and acquired oil and gas
exploration and development opportunities primarily in the United States. As a result of the
decline in the oil and gas markets, we are now seeking other strategic alternatives.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008 as “Loran
Connection Corp.” We were formed to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and
group tourism and business support in Ukraine. We subsequently filed a resale registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2009, which was declared
effective on October 28, 2009. On January 25, 2012, we filed an amendment to our articles of
incorporation to, among other things, change our name to “PetroTerra Corp.” and effect a thirty-
two-for-one reverse split. We changed our name to reflect a proposed change in our business
operations. On October 2, 2013, in connection with a change of control in the management of the
Company, the Company began its current business operations in the oil and gas sector. On
December 18, 2013, we filed a certificate of change to effect a one-for-two reverse stock split of
our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock. On April 12,
2014, we completed our acquisition of certain property leases (the “Leases”) held by Ardmore
Investments Inc. (“Ardmore”) for property owned by Pioneer Oil and Gas (“Pioneer”) covering
5,905.54 acres of land located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier
County, Utah (the “Utah Properties”). Since January 2016, as a result of the decline in the oil and
gas markets, we ceased investing in the Utah Properties and began seeking a strategic
alternative both inside and outside of the oil and gas market.
Our principal executive offices are located at 422 East Vermijo Avenue, Suite 313, Colorado
Springs, CO 80903. The telephone number at our principal executive offices is (719) 219-6404.

Our Business Plan
The Company was an independent exploration and development company focused on the
acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such property) that
we believed may contain extractable oil and/or gas.
On November 18, 2013, we entered into an assignment of lease agreement whereby Ardmore
assigned to us its rights under a certain Purchase Agreement, dated August 8, 2013, between
Ardmore and Pioneer involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of three separate BLM Management oil
and gas Leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County,
Utah and currently owned by Pioneer. Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore
100,000 shares of our common stock on November 18, 2013, and, in order to complete the
assignment contemplated by the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an additional 100,000 shares
of our common stock upon the transfer to us of ownership in the Leases, which occurred on April
12, 2014. Furthermore, the Company made three installment payments of $100,000 each to
Pioneer pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Leases were conveyed to the
Company on April 10, 2014.

In January 2014 we hired a third party independent contractor to provide insight and to assist in
the development of a plan regarding the exploration of any properties that we acquire. In March
2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to provide geologic consulting services to
the Company. In March 2014 we also obtained an MHA Technical Report on the Utah Properties.
In September 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to review and process both
the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased Utah Properties.
In November 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to perform a comprehensive
gravity survey on our Utah Properties which was completed in December 2014 and the results of
such survey were interpreted in February 2015.
On September 28, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson Solutions, LLC (“Thompson”) to
review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our
leased Utah Properties. The purpose of this review was to identify major structures and geologic
trends of interest on the Utah Properties. Based on the results of this analysis, on November 21,
2014, the Company engaged Magee Geophysical Services LLC (“Magee”) to perform a
comprehensive gravity survey on our Utah Properties. The gravity survey was conducted from
November 22, 2014 through December 9, 2014 and cost the Company approximately $55,000.
Pursuant to the survey, a total of 737 new gravity stations were identified on a nominal quarter
mile grid and the data acquired was merged with re-processed public domain data including
about 630 stations located in and around the main grid. Upon completion of Magee’s gravity
survey, on December 8, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson to further process the data
obtained by Magee and to provide custom processing and mapping of such data. On February 6,
2015, Thompson completed their interpretation of the gravity survey. The Company will pay to
Thompson $15,500 for its services.
On February 2, 2015 the Company engaged PRISEM Geoscience Consulting LLC (“PRISEM”)
to provide recommendations on a work plan for creating a geologic model of the Utah Properties.
Due to the volatility of the oil and gas market, the geologic model was never completed.
Our Properties
As described above, the Company holds oil and gas leases for property in Sevier and Beaver
Counties, Utah. On April 10th 2014, we acquired the Leases pursuant to the Agreement. These
three Leases cover 5,950.54 gross acres in Sevier and Beaver counties in southwest Utah. The
two Sevier leases, UTU-89243 and UTU-89244, each have a term through 02/01/2023
(hereinafter, the “Sevier Prospect”). Our Beaver county lease, UTU-86466, has an expiration date
of 02/01/2021 (hereinafter, the “Beaver Prospect” and together with the Sevier Prospect, the
“Sevier and Beaver Oil Project”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement which governs the terms
under which we can use the Utah Properties, we have a 100% Working Interest (WI) and an 80%
Net Revenue Interest (NRI) in the Leases.

Oil and Gas Industry-Specific Disclosures
As described above, the Company had only recently begun its oil and gas business operations
before operations were halted in order to identify other strategic alternatives, not necessarily
limited to the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the disclosure required by Subpart 1200 of
Regulation S-K (Section 229.1200 of this chapter) is not applicable to our Company as of the
date hereof. The Company has obtained Leases in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver
County and Sevier County, Utah consisting of 5,950.54 gross acres of undeveloped acreage.
Current Business Plan
Given the current climate in the oil and gas industry, on or about January 2016, management
determined to cease development of our oil and gas leases and instead seek a strategic
alternative, whether in the oil and gas industry or otherwise.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue
our operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.
Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Month Period Ended June 30,
2015.
Our net loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 was $76,802 compared to a net loss
of $93,803 during the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. We did not generate any
revenue during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
5
This change in net loss was primarily the result of the following:
Lease property and exploration costs
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred lease property and exploration costs
of 0, a decrease of $13,417 compared to the prior year period amount of $13,417 resulting
primarily from a decrease in exploration costs. As a result of the decline in the oil and gas
markets, we ceased investing in the Utah Properties and began seeking a strategic alternative
both inside and outside of the oil and gas market.
General and administrative costs
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative
expenses of $34,764 compared to $37,933 incurred during the three-month period ended June
30, 2015. The general and administrative expense incurred during the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to compensation to our Chief Executive Officer of
$30,000, with differences in corporate overhead and travel costs between periods.
Professional Fees
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred professional fees of $27,416 relating
to our equity financings, operations and public company compliance. The legal and accounting
fees associated with these activities amounted to $12,718 and $10,796, respectively, and the
corporate fees associated with these activities amounted to $3,901. During the three months
ended June 30, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $42,453 relating to our equity financings,
operations and public company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with
these activities amounted to $20,374 and $9,046, respectively, and the corporate and investor
relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $13,033.
Non-Employee Stock Based Compensation
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred expense of $4,000 for stock
issuances for compensation to our Chief Operating Officer. During the three months ended June
30, 2015, we did not incur non-employee stock based compensation charges.
Weighted average number of shares
The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 27,589,348 and 26,361,403 for the
three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We had no cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.
We have experienced losses of $76,802 and $93,803 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $2,707,319 at June 30, 2016. In
addition, we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable recurring source of revenues
sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the
foreseeable future. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of
financing needed for our near term requirements or the long-term development and exploration of
our Leases or any other strategic alternative that we may pursuit. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern”.
Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our
common stock, receiving aggregate net proceeds totaling $1,359,500 from the period beginning
October 1, 2013 through June 30, 2016.
Three months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three months Ended June 30, 2015
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended
June 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $1,577 consisting of a net loss of
$76,802, offset by non-cash stock compensation of $4,000, non-cash conversion of debt of
$40,622, depreciation and amortization of $3,948, an increase of $24,464 in accounts payables
and accrued liabilities, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $1,875. Furthermore, as of June
30, 2016 we had net cash overdraft repayments of $316.
For the three months ended June 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was
$117,678 consisting of a net loss of $93,803, offset by depreciation and amortization of $2,423, a
decrease of $17,738 in accounts payables and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $10,000 for
accrued officer compensation, and an increase in prepaid expenses of $1,875. Furthermore, as
of March 31, 2015 we had a cash overdraft repayment of $435.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We have financed our operations primarily from either cash advances or the issuance of equity
instruments. We generated cash from financing activities of $1,577 from shareholder loans and
$120,000 from the issuance of common stock in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We expect that our working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a
combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital
requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.
Our existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow
are not adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months and the Company is
dependent upon additional equity raises. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing
arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of our
private placement of equity. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates
additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to our pursuit of a
strategic alternative from the development of our oil and gas leases. We believe that we will need
$250,000 in additional capital to operate for the next twelve months. Additional issuances of
equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further,
such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.
Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are
not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of
prospective new business endeavors or opportunities that could significantly and materially
restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months
in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how
we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of
equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain
short-term loans from our director, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been
made. We do not have any agreements with our director concerning these loans. We do not have
any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our March 31, 2016 financial statements
contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
