</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/13, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism 
</p>
<p>to carry out a study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, 
</p>
<p>to present a progress report to the Council at its fifteenth session and a final study at its 
</p>
<p>eighteenth session.  </p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism presented its progress report on the study 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/2) to the Human Rights Council at its fifteenth session, taking into 
</p>
<p>account discussions at the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s third session, held in July 2010. In that 
</p>
<p>report, the Expert Mechanism analysed the relevant international human rights framework, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; internal decision-making processes and institutions and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making mechanisms linked to State and non-State 
</p>
<p>institutions and processes affecting indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 15/7, the Council welcomed the successful completion by the 
</p>
<p>Expert Mechanism of its progress report, encouraged it to finalize the study in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Council resolution 12/13, and requested it to give examples of good practices at 
</p>
<p>different levels of decision-making.  
</p>
<p>4. The present final report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in decision-making complements the progress report by focusing on examples of 
</p>
<p>good practices of indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in different levels of decision-making. 
</p>
<p>5. As in the case of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s first study, the Mechanism includes 
</p>
<p>advice associated with the corresponding study, in this case on indigenous peoples and the 
</p>
<p>right to participate in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>6 The examples of good practices described in the present report are drawn from the 
</p>
<p>Expert Mechanism&#8217;s own research and submissions received, after calling for information 
</p>
<p>from, inter alia, States, and a technical workshop held in March 2011.  
</p>
<p>7. The examples outlined below have the potential to assist States, indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>international organizations, national human rights institutions and others to protect and 
</p>
<p>promote indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making.  
</p>
<p>8. At the third session of the Expert Mechanism, many observers provided comments 
</p>
<p>on the State&#8217;s duty to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent, and were 
</p>
<p>used to inform the present report and, in particular, advice No. 2 (see annex). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Defining good practices 
</b></p>
<p>9. First of all, it is difficult to define what actually constitutes a &#8220;good&#8221; practice 
</p>
<p>involving indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making and, second, to assess 
</p>
<p>whether a practice meets the definition of &#8220;good&#8221;, not least because of the distance 
</p>
<p>separating the Expert Mechanism from the context in which such practices are followed. 
</p>
<p>Third, it has been difficult to acquire comprehensive information from all regions. 
</p>
<p>10. Mechanisms enabling the participation of indigenous peoples in external, non-
</p>
<p>indigenous decision-making processes can be problematic for various reasons; they may 
</p>
<p>operate in environments where indigenous peoples are politically, socially and 
</p>
<p>economically non-dominant and, while they enhance indigenous peoples&#8217; participation, 
</p>
<p>they do not go so far as to level the playing field with non-indigenous individuals and 
</p>
<p>peoples; they do not allow greater indigenous influence over decisions in practice; because 
</p>
<p>they are poorly implemented, or suffer from previously unforeseeable problems; or because 
</p>
<p>they privilege the participation of certain indigenous individuals over that of others, 
</p>
<p>creating concerns about their ability to achieve equality between individuals.  
</p>
<p>11. For the above reasons, the Expert Mechanism cannot verify that all practices 
</p>
<p>mentioned in the present report are uncontroversial or objectively good in every respect. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, the Expert Mechanism can only indicate that elements of certain practices appear to 
</p>
<p>have positive aspects based on its research and on the submissions received.  
</p>
<p>12. To assess whether a practice is good, the Expert Mechanism has based its criteria on 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>13. While not an exhaustive list, the Expert Mechanism regards the factors outlined 
</p>
<p>below as relevant when determining whether a practice is good. The most significant 
</p>
<p>indicator of good practice is likely to be the extent to which indigenous peoples were 
</p>
<p>involved in the design of the practice and their agreement to it. Other indicators include the 
</p>
<p>extent to which the practice:  
</p>
<p>(a)  Allows and enhances indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making; 
</p>
<p>(b) Allows indigenous peoples to influence the outcome of decisions that affect 
</p>
<p>them; 
</p>
<p>(c) Realizes indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination; 
</p>
<p>(d) Includes, as appropriate, robust consultation procedures and/or processes to 
</p>
<p>seek indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent. </p>

<p><b>A/HCR//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Some practices have been included in the report even where they might not be well 
</p>
<p>implemented, in order to highlight the potential that they have to protect and promote 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>15. Good practices may be found in, inter alia, a law, a policy programme, a single 
</p>
<p>project and/or in a component of a project. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Indigenous peoples&#8217; internal decision-making processes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions 
</b></p>
<p>16. In the context of the present report, internal decision-making processes and 
</p>
<p>institutions are indigenous; in other words, they function in accordance with indigenous-
</p>
<p>determined practices and for indigenous peoples. That is not to say that internal decision-
</p>
<p>making processes and institutions need to be traditional in a historical sense; instead, they 
</p>
<p>may include processes and institutions that have evolved over time, which may involve 
</p>
<p>newer practices, sometimes in response to external influences. In some cases, indigenous 
</p>
<p>decision-making processes and institutions may also be established as a result of discussion 
</p>
<p>and dialogue, or even agreement, with the State. Internal decision-making processes are 
</p>
<p>sometimes &#8211; though not always &#8211; recognized by the State and under State law. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous decision-making processes and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>17. Many indigenous institutions have their own decision-making processes, some of 
</p>
<p>which are described in the progress report of the Expert Mechanism.1 Many of these 
</p>
<p>institutions continue to receive support from communities despite, in some cases, limited (if 
</p>
<p>any) recognition by the State. The right to maintain such distinct decision-making processes 
</p>
<p>and institutions is embodied, inter alia,  in articles 5, 20 and 34 of the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>18. Generally, the ongoing functioning of indigenous peoples&#8217; internal decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes and associated institutions are positive in that they facilitate the participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and individuals in public affairs in ways that are philosophically and 
</p>
<p>culturally consistent with indigenous peoples&#8217; understanding of governance. Significantly, 
</p>
<p>indigenous decision-making processes and institutions also express a degree of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; self-determination and autonomy, free from imposed external influence, although 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>the State may still have ultimate authority under State law, including in some of the 
</p>
<p>examples mentioned below.  
</p>
<p>19. Examples of indigenous decision-making can be found in indigenous management 
</p>
<p>of resources in indigenous conservation areas and territories.2 Successful practices include 
</p>
<p>those where indigenous decision-making processes and traditional knowledge are respected 
</p>
<p>by the community and by other authorities. The <i>sasi</i> system used in Haruku, Indonesia, 
</p>
<p>where generations of <i>kewang</i> or indigenous institutions organize the community to remain 
</p>
<p>committed and united in managing fish stocks and other important coastal resources, is 
</p>
<p>exemplary.3 Another example is the Kaimoana customary fishing regulations in New 
</p>
<p>Zealand that permit some Maori control of customary fishing in some areas, including by 
</p>
<p>Maori institutions organized in accordance with their own beliefs, albeit significantly and 
</p>
<p>ultimately controlled by the Government. 
</p>
<p>20. The Kuna Yala <i>Comarca</i> is one of five special territorial units in Panama with 
</p>
<p>administrative autonomy through general, traditional, regional and local councils. The 
</p>
<p><i>Comarca</i> is governed by Kuna traditions and customs, and makes its own decisions within 
</p>
<p>the framework stipulated by the Constitution and legislation. Indigenous peoples make the 
</p>
<p>majority of decisions on cultural, economic and political matters affecting their populations, 
</p>
<p>and monitor indigenous rights. The <i>Comarca</i> is governed by the Kuna General Council, 
</p>
<p>which is the highest authority, comprising local councils of the 49 communities, each one 
</p>
<p>represented by a chief (<i>Saila</i>). The region is run by three general chiefs (<i>Caciques</i>) elected 
</p>
<p>by the Kuna General Council. The Kuna General Council meets for four days every six 
</p>
<p>months. In addition to the 49 <i>Sailas</i> that represent their communities, participation in the 
</p>
<p>Councils is mandatory for National Assembly representatives, the regional Governor, the 
</p>
<p>four district representatives and the regional directors of each institution established in the 
</p>
<p><i>Comarca</i>. Furthermore, each community is required to include one indigenous woman on 
</p>
<p>its delegation.4 
</p>
<p>21. In the United States of America, many American Indian nations retain residual 
</p>
<p>sovereignty over territories, albeit over areas sometimes far smaller than the areas 
</p>
<p>controlled by them historically. In practice, the doctrine permits, as a matter of United

<p>States constitutional law, American Indian nations to make laws in accordance with their 
</p>
<p>own governance structures and to function under their own legal systems. The 
</p>
<p>constitutional doctrine of congressional plenary power means, however, that Congress can 
</p>
<p>legislate to override American Indian law.5  
</p>
<p>22. In Canada, a number of First Nations have entered into agreements with Canadian 
</p>
<p>provincial and federal Governments to exercise greater self-government over their 
</p>
<p>territories, such as the Nisga&#8217;a in British Columbia,6 and in accordance with the Canadian 
</p>
<p>policy to recognize the inherent right First Nations to self-government.7 The Nisga&#8217;a Lisims 
</p>
<p>Government exercises self-government over a broad range of issues, including education 
</p>
<p>and lands and resources.8 On the other side of Canada, the Nunatsiavut peoples of 
</p>
<p>Newfoundland formed a government that self-governs in areas of health, education and 
</p>
<p>culture, in accordance with the 2005 Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement.9 There are 
</p>
<p>some indigenous nations in Canada that are treaty-based governments.  The treaties 
</p>
<p>between these indigenous nations and the Crown provide for a fundamental right to 
</p>
<p>participate in all decision-making processes on matters that affect them on the basis of 
</p>
<p>mutual consent. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous parliaments and organizations 
</b></p>
<p>23. There are a number of examples of indigenous parliaments and organizations that 
</p>
<p>enable indigenous peoples to influence decision-making in matters that potentially concern 
</p>
<p>them.  
</p>
<p>24. The S&#225;mi Parliaments are representative advisory bodies that were established in 
</p>
<p>Norway, Sweden and Finland in 1989, 1992 and 1995 respectively to, among other 
</p>
<p>objectives, facilitate consultation with the S&#225;mi people on matters affecting them. The 
</p>
<p>mandate and regulation of the Parliaments differs from one country to the other. 
</p>
<p>25. In Sweden, the Sami Parliament has been granted special responsibilities relating to 
</p>
<p>participation in decision-making; for example, it decides on the distribution of State grants

<p>Sami schools; manages Sami language projects; is the administrative agency responsible for 
</p>
<p>reindeer husbandry; participates in social planning and monitors compliance with Sami 
</p>
<p>needs, including the interests of the reindeer industry with regard to land and water; and 
</p>
<p>disseminates information on Sami conditions.10 
</p>
<p>26. In Finland, under section 9 of the S&#225;mi Parliament Act of 1995, the authorities are 
</p>
<p>required to negotiate with the S&#225;mi Parliament on all important measures that may directly 
</p>
<p>affect the status of the S&#225;mi as an indigenous people.11 
</p>
<p>27. The Government of Norway and the Sami Parliament agreement on procedures for 
</p>
<p>consultation recognizes that the Sami have the right to be consulted on matters that may 
</p>
<p>affect them directly, and sets out procedures applicable to the Government and its 
</p>
<p>ministries, directorates and other subordinate State agencies or activities in matters that may 
</p>
<p>affect Sami interests directly, including legislation, regulation, specific or individual 
</p>
<p>administrative decisions, guidelines, measures and decisions.12  
</p>
<p>28. In the Philippines, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act 1997 established a 
</p>
<p>consultative body comprising traditional leaders, elders and representatives from the 
</p>
<p>women and the youth sectors of different indigenous peoples, which advises the National 
</p>
<p>Commission on Indigenous Peoples on matters relating to the problems, aspirations and 
</p>
<p>interests of indigenous peoples. In 2003, the Commission adopted a set of guidelines for the 
</p>
<p>constitution and operationalization of the consultative body, which recognize the 
</p>
<p>constitution of consultative bodies at the national, regional and provincial levels, as well as 
</p>
<p>at the community level when the need to hold focused consultations arises. The consultative 
</p>
<p>body evaluates, inter alia, important indigenous peoples&#8217; issues and concerns and provides 
</p>
<p>input to and makes recommendations on policies for adoption by the Commission.13  
</p>
<p>29. In New Caledonia, Congress is legally required to consult with the Customary 
</p>
<p>Senate, consisting of Kanak Senators from each of the New Caledonian customary areas,

</p>
<p>when considering any law or policy affecting Kanak identity. When the Customary Senate 
</p>
<p>disagrees with the law or policy, Congress must reconsider its decision, after which the 
</p>
<p>position of Congress applies.14 While this practice preserves the supremacy of the New 
</p>
<p>Caledonian Congress on matters that are of fundamental importance to the Kanak, it 
</p>
<p>provides the opportunity for Kanak representatives to contribute to congressional 
</p>
<p>deliberations.  
</p>
<p>30. The Inuit Circumpolar Conference is a good example of regional cooperation 
</p>
<p>between indigenous peoples. The Conference holds quadrennial general assemblies at 
</p>
<p>which issues such as resource development and climate change are discussed. The 
</p>
<p>associated Inuit leaders&#8217; summit brings together Inuit leaders of the regional and national 
</p>
<p>Governments of Inuit nations.15 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous legal systems 
</b></p>
<p>31. Under its articles 5, 27, 34 and 40, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples affirms the right of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own legal 
</p>
<p>systems. Articles 8 and 9 of the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) 
</p>
<p>of the International Labour Organization (ILO) also provide further elaboration on these 
</p>
<p>rights. Indigenous legal systems, including legislative, judicial and procedural aspects, can 
</p>
<p>maintain harmony within indigenous society and enhance indigenous peoples&#8217; ability to 
</p>
<p>influence decision-making externally.  
</p>
<p>32. Although Bangladesh has a unitary system of government, the legal and 
</p>
<p>administrative system in the Chittagong Hill Tracts is separate and distinct from those in 
</p>
<p>other parts of the country. Informally, the justice system of  many indigenous communities 
</p>
<p>is still operational and used to settle disputes over both civil and petty criminal matters. The 
</p>
<p>traditional justice institutions, namely of the three Circle Chiefs, the <i>Mouza</i> headmen and 
</p>
<p>the village <i>Karbaris</i>, complement State justice institutions and their jurisdiction over 
</p>

</p>
<p>Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, &#8220;Some examples of good practices for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; participation in decision making: political participation, consultation standards, and 
participation in development projects&#8221; (11 March 2011).

</p>
<p>matters involving custom-based family laws, and some land and natural resource-related 
</p>
<p>rights are recognized by them.16 
</p>
<p>33. Support for the practice of indigenous legal systems in Sabah, Malaysia, to allow 
</p>
<p>such systems to remain autonomous was the result of repeated calls by indigenous leaders 
</p>
<p>and institutions. The financial support of the federal Government to improve the image of 
</p>
<p>native courts in Sabah, which had been neglected for decades, is one such example, to be 
</p>
<p>used for, inter alia<i>, </i>the building of new native courts and a training centre for native court 
</p>
<p>personnel, where knowledge about indigenous legal systems can be handed down to 
</p>
<p>younger leaders.17 
</p>
<p>34. The indigenous legal systems in the Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces of 
</p>
<p>Cambodia constitute a good practice, even if they do not have formal State recognition. The 
</p>
<p>systems are usually consistent with indigenous values, including in relation to the 
</p>
<p>participation of all individuals and families affected by an alleged crime. Some villagers 
</p>
<p>explained that they valued indigenous legal systems because of their inclusion of many &#8211; 
</p>
<p>the community &#8211; and because judgements reflect the views of the majority. Moreover, in 
</p>
<p>some communities, village leaders, responsible for, inter alia, maintaining peace in the 
</p>
<p>community, are selected by consensus and on the basis of criteria that include the extent to 
</p>
<p>which she or he will act in the interests of the collective.18 
</p>
<p>35. The Constitution of Mexico recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to self-
</p>
<p>determination, especially with regard to the election and exercise of their own forms of 
</p>
<p>governance (art. 2). In the same way, the Constitution of Oaxaca (arts. 16 and 25) 
</p>
<p>recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to elect and nominate their authorities and 
</p>
<p>representatives in municipalities in conformity with their legal and political systems.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Indigenous women in decision-making

<p>participate in both internal and external decision-making processes and institutions.  There 
</p>
<p>is still much to be done to address deficiencies. 
</p>
<p>37. Within many indigenous societies, women continue to have important decision-
</p>
<p>making roles, including in cultural and ceremonial events, where interaction, learning and 
</p>
<p>intergenerational transfer of knowledge take place. Through these processes, women have 
</p>
<p>the opportunity to empower themselves and others. Women also make important decisions 
</p>
<p>daily with respect to farming and the choice of crops, as well as about the daily supply of 
</p>
<p>food for the family, thus contributing to the livelihoods of families and communities. 
</p>
<p>38. Among the Naga women in north-east India, where indigenous communities 
</p>
<p>continue to face conflict, indigenous women have been playing an important role as 
</p>
<p>peacekeepers. Decisions made by the Naga women in tense situations have been 
</p>
<p>acknowledged by many to have helped to diffuse conflicts and maintain peace.19 
</p>
<p>39. The Expert Mechanism received information about the Nupi Keithel &#8211; a traditional 
</p>
<p>indigenous women&#8217;s market guild in Manipur, India &#8211; as an example of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s participation in State decision-making, albeit through peaceful protest and 
</p>
<p>agitation rather than through formalized processes to make the voice of indigenous women 
</p>
<p>heard.20 The Nupi Keithel successfully fought for inclusion in governmental processes to 
</p>
<p>consider the construction of a supermarket in the environs of the markets of the Nupi 
</p>
<p>Keithel. As a result, and consistent with the demands of the Nupi Keithel women, a new 
</p>
<p>building was constructed to house &#8220;their&#8221; market.

<p><b> IV. Participation in decision-making mechanisms linked to State

<p><b>  A. Participation in parliamentary processes 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to information received in interviews with indigenous parliamentarians, it 
</p>
<p>is important to refer to international norms on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and to educate and 
</p>
<p>train majority legislators and parliamentary staff about indigenous issues.21

</p>
<p>41. Mechanisms that guarantee the representation of indigenous peoples in State 
</p>
<p>parliaments can provide an important opportunity for indigenous peoples to participate in 
</p>
<p>and influence decision-making on a range of issues. For example, in New Zealand, the 
</p>
<p>Maori have had guaranteed representation in Parliament since 1867. Anyone of Maori 
</p>
<p>descent can choose to be on either the Maori electoral roll or the general electoral roll. 
</p>
<p>Since 1996, the number of Maori seats in the House varies according to the proportion of 
</p>
<p>Maori registered on the Maori electoral roll compared to the general electoral roll. 
</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven Maori seats in the House. The House of Representatives also has 
</p>
<p>a Maori Affairs Select Committee, to which the House may refer any issue with 
</p>
<p>implications for the Maori.22  Similarly, in Burundi, the Batwa have permanent seats in the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly, in both houses, and there has been guaranteed Batwa representation on 
</p>
<p>the National Land Commission.23 
</p>
<p>42. In the Khanty-Mansiysky Autonomous Region of the Russian Federation, an 
</p>
<p>Assembly of Indigenous Peoples is part of the structure of the regional Duma (parliament). 
</p>
<p>The region has a legislated quota of indigenous representation.24 Another positive solution 
</p>
<p>at the provincial level is the additional guarantee of Nenetz direct representation in the 
</p>
<p>relevant autonomous <i>okrug</i> (district).25 
</p>
<p>43. Proportional representation electoral systems can assist in the election of indigenous 
</p>
<p>individuals to State parliaments, as seen under, for example, the interim Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Nepal.26 However, measures may also be needed to ensure that the election of indigenous 
</p>
<p>individuals translates into influence in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>44.  The Greenland branch of the Inuit circumpolar Council, which represents the 
indigenous peoples of Greenland, cooperates closely with the Government of Greenland to 
</p>
<p>establish better hearing and consultation mechanisms with regard to oil and gas exploration 
</p>
<p>projects, mining projects and other mega-industries in Greenland. Moreover, while any

</p>
<p>Greenlander can vote for parliament, not only Inuit, currently all representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Government and the Parliament of Greenland are Inuit.27 
</p>
<p>45. The ability of indigenous peoples to influence parliamentary decision-making is 
</p>
<p>enhanced when parliaments create internal bodies to address matters of central concern to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, such as the Indigenous Affairs Commissions in the Mexican Congress, 
</p>
<p>which can influence the drafting of laws.28 
</p>
<p>46. In South Africa, the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act of 2003 
</p>
<p>provides that any parliamentary bill pertaining to the customary law or customs of 
</p>
<p>traditional communities must, before it is passed by the House of Parliament where it is 
</p>
<p>introduced, be referred by the Secretary of Parliament to the National House of Traditional 
</p>
<p>Leaders for its comments.29 
</p>
<p>47. In Colombia, the Constitution reserves parliamentary seats for indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>chosen directly by indigenous communities, with two (out of 102) seats in the upper Senate 
</p>
<p>elected by indigenous communities, and one (out of 166) in the lower Chamber of 
</p>
<p>Representatives.30 
</p>
<p><b> B. Direct participation in governance 
</b></p>
<p>48. Direct indigenous participation in the implementation of international instruments 
</p>
<p>designed to protect and promote the rights indigenous peoples is to be commended. Nepal

<p>National Foundation for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities and the Nepal 
</p>
<p>Federation for Indigenous Nationalities.31

<p>Convention No. 169.32 The Council set up a bureau for the coordination of representatives 
</p>
<p>at the regional level and a coordinating council, which oversees the National Register of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Communities and identifies problems and establishes priorities for solving 
</p>
<p>them, as well as setting up the programme of activities of the National Institute for 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Affairs for the long and medium term.33 
</p>
<p>50. In Kenya, national consultations on the Constitution included specific meetings of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples leading to the recognition of land rights for hunter-gatherers in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution adopted in 2010.34  
</p>
<p>51. In South Africa, the main focus of the National Khoi-San Consultative Council has 
</p>
<p>been to &#8220;engage the Government on the issue of recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>traditional structures and authority&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p>52. At the local G &#2;overnment level in New Zealand, there is the positive example of the  
Bay of Plenty Regional Council, which allows the Maori to register on a separate Maori roll 
</p>
<p>with the number of councillors determined by the number of people who register on the 
</p>
<p>roll.36 
</p>
<p>53. The Republic of the Congo adopted the Law on the Promotion and Protection on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2010. The Special Rapporteur notes that, by all accounts, 
</p>
<p>the law was developed in a participatory manner, through consultations with indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples themselves, Congolese and international non-governmental organizations, United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies and relevant Congolese public institutions.37 Under the law, consultation 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples is generally mandated when there is &#8220;the consideration, 
</p>
<p>formulation or implementation of any legislative, administrative or programmatic measure 
</p>
<p>that may affect indigenous peoples&#8221; and is required in relation to measures that affect

<p>54. Another example is the establishment in Thailand of the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Council to engage directly with the National Reform Committee in the national reform 
</p>
<p>process. The formation of an independent local indigenous council in areas populated 
</p>
<p>largely by Karen indigenous peoples acted as a mechanism for their participation in the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a district office, later becoming a body representing the voice of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in the development of the district.39 
</p>
<p>55. In Australia, the National Congress of Australia&#8217;s First Peoples is a recently 
</p>
<p>established company with the objective of providing a national voice for Aboriginal and 
</p>
<p>Torres Strait Islanders.40 It has the potential to play an important role as a vehicle for 
</p>
<p>Aboriginal input into formal State governance structures in the interests of the recognition 
</p>
<p>of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.  
</p>
<p>56. The Maya K&#8217;iches of Totonicap&#225;n participate in decision-making through a 
</p>
<p>municipal council. The council is made up of 48 representatives, each from the 48 districts 
</p>
<p>of Totonicap&#225;n, elected according to the Mayan tradition. The council deliberates on 
</p>
<p>matters concerning the administration of Totonicap&#225;n in the areas of education and cultural, 
</p>
<p>environmental and judicial issues.41  
</p>
<p>57. In Guatemala, the Academy for Mayan Languages is an autonomous State entity that 
</p>
<p>promotes the development of Mayan languages in the country. It includes a representative 
</p>
<p>for each of the 22 linguistic groups and has played a key role in promoting the law on 
</p>
<p>national languages and a unitary normative framework on the writing of Mayan 
</p>
<p>languages.42 
</p>
<p>58. The Guatemalan Association of Indigenous Mayors and Authorities is composed of 
</p>
<p>municipal indigenous mayors elected according to indigenous practices and originating in 
</p>
<p>the Agreement on Identity and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Association draws

<p>attention to the interests of indigenous peoples in the local Government context.43

<p>59. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the United States of America, designed to give 
</p>
<p>American Indians a greater voice in national, State and local laws, has facilitated the 
</p>
<p>participation of native Americans in decision-making, especially at the local level.44 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples considers that, in Peru, 
</p>
<p>aspects of the draft law on consultation may be described as positive and mentions, in that 
</p>
<p>regard, the support it has received from national indigenous organizations. In accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it states that consent is an 
</p>
<p>objective of consultations and, secondly, it provides a practice solution in those instances in 
</p>
<p>which agreement is not achieved; that is, the final decision rests with the State, but the State 
</p>
<p>must provide a justification for that decision and still respect the human rights of affected 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities, and that decision is subject to judicial review.45 However, the 
</p>
<p>process leading to the adoption of the law appears to have stalled. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Participation in hybrid systems of governance 
</b></p>
<p>61. In New Zealand, some <i>iwi</i> (tribes) have entered into agreements with the 
</p>
<p>Government to co-manage natural resources, such as lakes, illustrating that indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples can participate directly in decision-making in partnership arrangements with State 
</p>
<p>agencies.46 Similarly, in the United States of America, the federal Government has 
</p>
<p>delegated responsibility for the management and hunting of bowhead whales in Alaska to 
</p>
<p>the relevant Alaskan whaling communities through community membership in the Alaska 
</p>
<p>Eskimo Whaling Commission, which operates to protect indigenous whale hunting and 
</p>
<p>culture within the rules of the International Whaling Commission.47 In Canada, at the centre 
</p>
<p>of the Nunuvut Land Claims Agreement of 1993 are land and resources co-management 
</p>
<p>boards that guarantee the Inuit meaningful involvement and participation in decisions 
</p>
<p>relating to the preservation and future development of lands in the Nunuvut settlement 
</p>

<p><b> D. Free, prior and informed consent  
</b></p>
<p>63. Although a relatively new concept internationally, free, prior and informed consent 
</p>
<p>is one of the most important principles, as a right, that indigenous peoples believe can 
</p>
<p>further protect their right to participation. Effective implementation can be in the form of 
</p>
<p>specific laws and policies. Examples, as mentioned above, include that of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo, which has enacted legislation providing for consultation with a 
</p>
<p>view to obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>64. In 2005, Novatek, the second-largest natural gas company in the Russian Federation 
</p>
<p>working in the autonomous district of Yamal-Nenetz, designed a socio-economic 
</p>
<p>programme for and with the Nenetz peoples affected by its activities, drawing on meetings 
</p>
<p>with community members and leaders. In November 2008, an agreement was signed with 
</p>
<p>the local Nenetz organization, defining the terms of cooperation between the company and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. The company provided support for infrastructure and allowed 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to maintain their traditional livelihoods and economy while benefiting 
</p>
<p>from job opportunities in oil and gas developments.49  
</p>
<p>65. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in 2010, the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and 
</p>
<p>Energy undertook a consultation process on a proposed hydrocarbon exploration project in 
</p>
<p>the indigenous territory of Charagua Norte and Isoso. It resulted in an agreement between 
</p>
<p>the Government and the Guaran&#237; Peoples Assembly of Charagua Norte and Isoso 
</p>
<p>documenting community consent prior to the initiation of exploration activities. The 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy has been commended for respecting traditional 
</p>
<p>Guarani institutions and systems.50  
</p>
<p>66. In Malaysia, notwithstanding issues relating to implementation, domestic laws such 
</p>
<p>as the Sabah Forest Enactment and Sabah Parks Enactment have provisions to ensure 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples are consulted before forest reserves and protected areas are established. 
</p>
<p>These provisions can form the basis on which indigenous peoples can require the 
</p>
<p>Government to obtain their consent before any development project is implemented.51 
</p>

</p>
<p>that they properly understand what is being proposed.  Where there is a serious impact on 
</p>
<p>the rights of indigenous peoples, consent must be obtained.53 
</p>
<p>69. Canadian courts have also ruled that acts interfering with aboriginal and treaty rights

<p>indigenous experts and representatives of United Nations agencies, has been cited as an 
</p>
<p>example of best practice. The meetings are followed up by Asia Caucus meetings during 
</p>
<p>the sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism to 
</p>
<p>formulate common statements and recommendations and to plan activities for advocacy, 
</p>
<p>networking and generating support.55 
</p>
<p>72. Another example of a good practice of indigenous participation at the international 
</p>
<p>level was the role played by the global indigenous peoples&#8217; caucus in the negotiation and 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>73. The Advisory Council of the Andean Community (Plurinational State of Bolivia, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) is a consultative body that provides advice on political, 
</p>
<p>cultural, social and economic aspects of subregional integration as it affects indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. The body comprises one indigenous delegate from each State, chosen from among 
</p>
<p>the highest ranks of indigenous national organizations according to procedures that are 
</p>
<p>established at the national level..56 
</p>
<p>74. In Bangladesh and India, efforts by the ILO regional office to include indigenous 
</p>
<p>representatives in the consultation and implementation of its activities are examples of good 
</p>
<p>practices. In Bangladesh, ILO supported an activity to bring together representatives of 
</p>
<p>indigenous parliamentarians and peoples to draft recommendations and proposals relating 
</p>
<p>to their constitutional recognition, which was subsequently submitted to the Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Reform Committee.57 
</p>
<p>75.  Six indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations participate formally in the Arctic Council, 
which is a high-level intergovernmental forum in which indigenous peoples as Permanent 
</p>
<p>Participants are represented alongside the 8 arctic states and play a major role in the 
</p>
<p>agenda-setting and decision-making processes based on consensus.58 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>76. The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from 
</p>
<p>Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries has been consulting with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples on its programme guidelines for seeking the free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent of indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities,59 although the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes ways in which the draft guidelines could be improved (for

</b></p>
<p>77. Most national human rights institutions established in accordance with the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles have a mandate to advise Governments in formulating legislations and 
</p>
<p>procedures. As such, as independent bodies, they can play an important role in bringing 
</p>
<p>together representatives of Government and indigenous peoples, thus promoting the 
</p>
<p>participation of indigenous peoples in discussions and decisions on issues that concern 
</p>
<p>them. Such institutions can also stress the need for all stakeholders to ensure that 
</p>
<p>indigenous representatives are involved in decision-making.  
</p>
<p>78. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia has adopted cooperative and 
</p>
<p>responsive approaches to developing solutions designed to improve the status and 
</p>
<p>recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to land, through its national inquiry into the land 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples. The methods of the inquiry will include calling for public 
</p>
<p>submissions and holding consultations and public hearings where indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>would be among the key stakeholders. The research, which includes community mapping 
</p>
<p>activities, would ensure the participation of indigenous peoples and organizations in 
</p>
<p>obtaining data for Geographic Information System maps showing indigenous lands 
</p>
<p>claims.60 
</p>
<p>79. The Australian Human Rights Commission&#8217;s &#8220;Close the Gap&#8221; campaign for 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Health Equality brings together all parties in its campaign.  In 2007, parties 
</p>
<p>negotiated an agreed position and strategy to address health inequality. A Steering 
</p>
<p>Committee was established comprising national-level Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
</p>
<p>and non-indigenous professional-health peak bodies. It has resulted in a positive 
</p>
<p>relationship with relevant government representatives to achieve a set of agreed targets.  As 
</p>
<p>an accountability measure, the Prime Minister provides a national statement on those 
</p>
<p>targets during the first annual session of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>80. In Indonesia, <i>Aliansi Masyarakat Nusantara</i>, the national indigenous network, has 
</p>
<p>signed a memorandum of understanding with the national human rights institution to deal 
</p>
<p>with allegations of human rights abuse and to promote the Declaration on the Rights of

<p>peoples that enables indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making are now part of 
</p>
<p>the activities of the Asia Pacific network of national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>81. Academia and United Nations agencies have promoted the principles of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, participation, accountability and empowerment, which have permitted 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged and vulnerable groups to secure more inclusion in governance. In particular, 
</p>
<p>the publication by the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre of the United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme&#8217;s &#8220;Towards inclusive governance: promoting the participation of disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>groups in Asia-Pacific<i>&#8221;</i> offers lessons learned in eight Asia-Pacific countries. The case 
</p>
<p>studies advocate the inclusion of excluded groups, including indigenous peoples, to ensure 
</p>
<p>their effective representation and to create conditions conducive to greater respect, 
</p>
<p>promotion and fulfilment of the human rights of all peoples.61 This example constitutes a 
</p>
<p>good practice by a United Nations agency to encourage and promote indigenous decision-
</p>
<p>making institutions and processes in various situations.

</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Expert Mechanism advice No. 2 (2011): 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making 
</b></p>
<p>1. Indigenous peoples are among the most excluded, marginalized and disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>sectors of society. This has had a negative impact on their ability to determine the direction 
</p>
<p>of their own societies, including in decision-making on matters that affect their rights and 
</p>
<p>interests. This can still be a major factor contributing to their disadvantaged position. 
</p>
<p>Decision-making rights and participation by indigenous peoples in decisions that affect 
</p>
<p>them is necessary to enable them to protect, inter alia<i>,</i> their cultures, including their 
</p>
<p>languages and their lands, territories and resources. In many cases, however, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples practised or continue to practise their own forms of governance. 
</p>
<p>2. The right of indigenous peoples to participation is well established in international 
</p>
<p>law. More recently, the indigenous-rights discourse has seen increased focus on rights not 
</p>
<p>only allowing indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making processes affecting 
</p>
<p>them, but to actually control the outcome of such processes.  
</p>
<p>3. This spectrum of rights is well illustrated by the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, which contains more than 20 general provisions pertaining to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and decision-making. These rights range from the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination encompassing a right to autonomy or self-government to rights to participate 
</p>
<p>and be actively involved in external decision-making processes. Other provisions establish 
</p>
<p>specific duties for States to ensure the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-
</p>
<p>making, inter alia, to obtain their free, prior and informed consent; to consult and cooperate 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples; and to take measures in conjunction with them.62 
</p>
<p>4. As a normative expression of the existing international consensus regarding the 
</p>
<p>individual and collective human rights of indigenous peoples in a way which is coherent 
</p>
<p>with already existing international human rights standards, the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples provides a framework for action aiming at the full protection and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples, including their right to participate in 
</p>
<p>decision-making. </p>

<p><b>A/HCR//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>5. With regard to participatory rights, international human rights law refers to the right 
</p>
<p>to participate in public affairs in both general and specific forms, including as set out in 
</p>
<p>various human rights treaties, such as in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and in the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) 
</p>
<p>of the International Labour Organization (ILO).63 Participation in public affairs in its 
</p>
<p>general form includes involvement in the conduct of public affairs. Electoral participation is 
</p>
<p>only one specific expression of the right to participation. Moreover, the right to take part in 
</p>
<p>public affairs is not limited to participation in formal political institutions, as it also 
</p>
<p>includes participation in civil, cultural and social activities of a public nature. The right to 
</p>
<p>participate in public affairs has conventionally been understood as a civil and political right 
</p>
<p>of the individual. In the context of indigenous peoples, however, the right also takes on a 
</p>
<p>collective aspect, implying a right of the group as a people to exercise decision-making 
</p>
<p>authority. 
</p>
<p>6. The right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making is also affirmed in 
</p>
<p>international jurisprudence more generally, such as in the decision of the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Court of Human Rights in which the Court recognized indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
</p>
<p>organize themselves in ways that are consistent with their customs and traditions under 
</p>
<p>State electoral laws.64 The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the exclusion of indigenous peoples from decision-making about  
</p>
<p>the treatment of their lands.65 
</p>
<p>7. Article 6 of ILO Convention No. 169 requires that consultations with indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples be carried out through institutions that are representative of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples should control the process by which representativeness is determined, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with human rights standards as set out in, inter alia, the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Indigenous Peoples.66 
</p>
<p>8. The requirement that consultations be carried out through appropriate procedures 
</p>
<p>implies that general public hearing processes are not normally regarded as sufficient to 
</p>
<p>meet this procedural standard. Consultation procedures need to allow for the full expression 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples&#8217; views, in a timely manner and based on their full understanding of 
</p>
<p>the issues involved, so that they may be able to affect the outcome and consensus may be 
</p>
<p>achieved.

</p>
<p>9. Moreover, consultations should be undertaken in good faith and in a form 
</p>
<p>appropriate to the relevant context. This requires that consultations be carried out in a 
</p>
<p>climate of mutual trust and transparency. Indigenous peoples must be given sufficient time 
</p>
<p>to engage in their own decision-making process, and participate in decisions taken in a 
</p>
<p>manner consistent with their cultural and social practices. Finally, the objective of 
</p>
<p>consultations should be to achieve agreement or consensus.  
</p>
<p>10. As indicated above, the duty to consult indigenous peoples is further reflected in a 
</p>
<p>number of provisions of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.67 Like ILO 
</p>
<p>Convention No. 169, Declaration articles 19 and 32(2) require States to consult indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples in good faith, through appropriate procedures, with the objective of obtaining their 
</p>
<p>agreement or consent when measures that may affect indigenous peoples are considered.  
</p>
<p>11. Moreover, a number of United Nations human rights treaty bodies have established 
</p>
<p>that States have a duty, within the framework of their treaty obligations, to effectively 
</p>
<p>consult indigenous peoples on matters affecting their interests and rights and, in some 
</p>
<p>cases, to seek to obtain the consent of indigenous peoples.68  
</p>
<p>12. The duty of States to consult with indigenous peoples and to obtain their consent are 
</p>
<p>also expressed in the jurisprudence of, inter alia, the universal periodic review of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council,69 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights,70 the African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights,71 the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples,72 and in

<p><b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>progress report, the Expert Mechanism noted that several treaties between States and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples affirmed the principles of indigenous peoples&#8217; consent as an 
</p>
<p>underpinning of the treaty relationship between States and indigenous peoples.75 
</p>
<p>13. The right to full and effective participation in external decision-making is of 
</p>
<p>fundamental importance to indigenous peoples&#8217; enjoyment of other human rights. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the right of indigenous peoples to identify their own educational priorities and to 
</p>
<p>participate effectively in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of education 
</p>
<p>plans, programmes and services is crucial for their enjoyment of the right to education.76 
</p>
<p>When implemented as a treaty right, the right to education can offer a framework for 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. Truth and reconciliation commissions offer a model for improved relations 
</p>
<p>between States and indigenous peoples as well.77 
</p>
<p>14. The participation of indigenous peoples in external decision-making is of crucial 
</p>
<p>importance to good governance. One of the objectives of international standards on 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; rights is to fill the gap between their rights on the one hand and their 
</p>
<p>implementation on the other hand.  
</p>
<p>15. Many indigenous peoples remain vulnerable to top-down State interventions that 
</p>
<p>take little or no account of their rights and circumstances. In many instances, this is an 
</p>
<p>underlying cause for land dispossession, conflict, human rights violations, displacement and 
</p>
<p>the loss of sustainable livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>16. The duty to consult indigenous peoples applies whenever a measure or decision 
</p>
<p>specifically affecting indigenous peoples is being considered (for example, affecting their 
</p>
<p>lands or livelihood). This duty also applies in situations where the State considers decisions 
</p>
<p>or measures that potentially affect the wider society, but which affect indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>and in particular in instances where decisions may have a disproportionally significant 
</p>
<p>effect on indigenous peoples.78  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the right to self-determination, the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples affirms that indigenous peoples, in exercising their right to self-
</p>
<p>determination, have the right to develop and maintain their own decision-making 
</p>
<p>institutions and authority parallel to their right to participate in external decision-making 
</p>
<p>  
 75 Ibid. In Canada, treaties 6, 7 and 8 contain provisions on indigenous peoples&#8217; consent. For instance, 
</p>
<p>Treaty No. 6, concluded in 1876, provides that &#8220;and whereas the said Indians have been notified and 
informed by Her Majesty&#8217;s said Commissioners that it is the desire of Her Majesty to open up for 
settlement, immigration and such other purposes &#8230; and to obtain the consent thereto of Her Indian 
subjects inhabiting the said tract&#8221; (para. 3).

<p><b>A/HRC//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>processes that affect them. This is crucial to their ability to maintain and develop their 
</p>
<p>identities, languages, cultures and religions within the framework of the State in which they 
</p>
<p>live.  
</p>
<p>18. Article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples mirrors common 
</p>
<p>article 1, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>development and to manage, for their own benefit, their own natural resources. The duties 
</p>
<p>to consult with indigenous peoples and to obtain their free, prior and informed consent are 
</p>
<p>crucial elements of the right to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>19. As affirmed in articles 5, 18, 36 and 37 of the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, and within the ambit of the right to self-determination, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples have the right to make independent decisions in all matters relating to their internal 
</p>
<p>and local affairs, and to effectively influence external decision-making affecting them if 
</p>
<p>they choose to participate in such processes.  
</p>
<p>20. As mentioned above, the right to free, prior and informed consent is embedded in 
</p>
<p>the right to self-determination. The procedural requirements for consultations and free, 
</p>
<p>prior and informed consent respectively are similar. Nevertheless, the right of free, prior 
</p>
<p>and informed consent needs to be understood in the context of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
</p>
<p>self-determination because it is an integral element of that right.  
</p>
<p>21. The duty of the State to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent 
</p>
<p>entitles indigenous peoples to effectively determine the outcome of decision-making that 
</p>
<p>affects them, not merely a right to be involved in such processes. Consent is a significant 
</p>
<p>element of the decision-making process obtained through genuine consultation and 
</p>
<p>participation. Hence, the duty to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples is not only a procedural process but a substantive mechanism to ensure the respect 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>22. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires that the free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent of indigenous peoples be obtained in matters of fundamental importance 
</p>
<p>for their rights, survival, dignity and well-being. In assessing whether a matter is of 
</p>
<p>importance to the indigenous peoples concerned, relevant factors include the perspective 
</p>
<p>and priorities of the indigenous peoples concerned, the nature of the matter or proposed 
</p>
<p>activity and its potential impact on the indigenous peoples concerned, taking into account, 
</p>
<p>  
 78  See A/HRC/12/34, paras. 42-43. </p>

<p><b>A/HCR//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>inter alia, the cumulative effects of previous encroachments or activities and historical 
</p>
<p>inequities faced by the indigenous peoples concerned. Premised on the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination, article 10 of the Declaration prohibits the forcible removal of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples from their lands and territories. In contrast, ILO Convention No. 169, article 16(2), 
</p>
<p>includes procedural elements that permit forced relocation as an exceptional measure, 
</p>
<p>without the consent of the indigenous peoples concerned. The Declaration moreover 
</p>
<p>requires States to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples in 
</p>
<p>certain other situations, as reflected in its articles 11(2), 19, 28(1), 29(2), 32(2) and 37. 
</p>
<p>23. The duty to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>presupposes a mechanism and process whereby indigenous peoples make their own 
</p>
<p>independent and collective decisions on matters that affect them. The process is to be 
</p>
<p>undertaken in good faith to ensure mutual respect. The State&#8217;s duty to obtain free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consent affirms the prerogative of indigenous peoples to withhold consent and to 
</p>
<p>establish terms and conditions for their consent. 
</p>
<p>24. The elements of free, prior and informed consent are interrelated; the elements of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;free&#8221;, &#8220;prior&#8221; and &#8220;informed&#8221; qualify and set the conditions for indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>consent; violation of any of these three elements may invalidate any purported agreement 
</p>
<p>by indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>25. The element of &#8220;free&#8221; implies no coercion, intimidation or manipulation; &#8220;prior&#8221; 
</p>
<p>implies that consent is obtained in advance of the activity associated with the decision 
</p>
<p>being made, and includes the time necessary to allow indigenous peoples to undertake their 
</p>
<p>own decision-making processes; &#8220;informed&#8221; implies that indigenous peoples have been 
</p>
<p>provided all information relating to the activity and that that information is objective, 
</p>
<p>accurate and presented in a manner and form understandable to indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;consent&#8221; implies that indigenous peoples have agreed to the activity that is the subject of 
</p>
<p>the relevant decision, which may also be subject to conditions.79 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures 
</b></p>
<p>26. Reform of international and regional processes involving indigenous peoples should 
</p>
<p>be a major priority and concern.  In particular, multilateral environmental processes and 
</p>
<p>forums should ensure full respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and their effective 
</p>
<p>participation including, for example, in relation to the negotiation of the Nagoya Protocol.  
</p>
<p>  
 79  For an interpretation of free, prior and informed consent, see E/C.19/2005/3. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate in decision making is essential 
</p>
<p>for achieving international solidarity and harmonious and cooperative relations.  Consensus 
</p>
<p>is not a legitimate approach if its intention or effect is to undermine the human rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples.  Where beneficial or necessary, alternative negotiation frameworks 
</p>
<p>should be considered, consistent with States&#8217; obligations in the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and other international human rights law.   
</p>
<p>28. Free, prior and informed consent implies that States have a duty to obtain indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; consent in relation to decisions that are of fundamental importance for their rights, 
</p>
<p>survival, dignity and well-being. States should ensure that consultations and negotiations 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples as required by article 18 of the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples and consistent with other human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>29. States have a duty to respect indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate in all levels of 
</p>
<p>decision-making, including in external decision-making, if the indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>concerned so choose and in the forms of their choosing, including, where appropriate, in 
</p>
<p>co-governance arrangements.  
</p>
<p>30. States should respect and assist both traditional and contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; governance structures, including their collective decision-making 
</p>
<p>practices. 
</p>
<p>31. States should enact and implement constitutional and other legal provisions that 
</p>
<p>ensure indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making consistent with the Declaration 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in particular where that is sought by affected 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>32. Indigenous women often face exceptional impediments to participation in decision-
</p>
<p>making. States, international organizations, indigenous peoples and other decision-making 
</p>
<p>entities should therefore conduct more intensive studies and design appropriate mechanisms 
</p>
<p>to facilitate the participation of indigenous women in their activities and increase their 
</p>
<p>access to address difficulties facing indigenous women seeking to fully participate in 
</p>
<p>decision-making.  Likewise, the inclusion of indigenous youth in decision-making is 
</p>
<p>essential in both internal and external, including legislative, decision-making. 
</p>
<p>33. States and relevant international and domestic organizations should ensure that 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples have the financial and technical capacity to engage in consultation and 
</p>
<p>consent-seeking exercises and to participate in regional and international decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes. 
</p>
<p>34. States should also recognize that the right to self-determination of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples constitutes a duty for States to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed </p>

<p><b>A/HCR//18/42 
</b></p>
<p><b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>consent, not merely to be involved in decision-making processes, but a right to determine 
</p>
<p>their outcomes. Treaties, as evidence of the right to self-determination, and the relationship 
</p>
<p>they represent are the basis for a strengthened partnership, consistent with the Declaration 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>35. States shall respect indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination consistent with 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other international standards. 
</p>
<p>States shall ensure that indigenous peoples have the means to finance their autonomous 
</p>
<p>functions. 
</p>
<p>36. The United Nations should, in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, establish a permanent mechanism or system for consultations with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; governance bodies, including indigenous parliaments, assemblies, 
</p>
<p>councils or other bodies representing the indigenous peoples concerned, to ensure effective 
</p>
<p>participation at all levels of the United Nations.   
</p>
<p>37. ILO should enable effective representation by indigenous peoples in its decision-
</p>
<p>making, and especially with regard to the implementation and supervision of ILO 
</p>
<p>Conventions and policies relevant to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>38. UNESCO should enable and ensure effective representation and participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in its decision-making, especially with regard to the implementation 
</p>
<p>and supervision of UNESCO Conventions and policies relevant to indigenous peoples, such 
</p>
<p>as the 1972 World Heritage Convention.  Robust procedures and mechanisms should be 
</p>
<p>established to ensure indigenous peoples are adequately consulted and involved in the 
</p>
<p>management and protection of World Heritage sites, and that their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent is obtained when their territories are being nominated and inscribed as World 
</p>
<p>Heritage sites. 
</p>
<p>39. National human rights institutions, as independent bodies, should play an important 
</p>
<p>role in bringing together representatives of Government and indigenous peoples, thus 
</p>
<p>promoting indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in discussions and decisions on issues that 
</p>
<p>concern them.  National human rights institutions can also stress the need for all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to ensure indigenous representatives are involved in decision-making.  Such 
</p>
<p>institutions, through their own programmes, could also actively involve indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>in decision-making on related issues.
