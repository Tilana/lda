as the “Meetings”. Shareholders of both Providence and Desert Star will be asked to consider a proposed 
amalgamation  of  Providence  and  Desert  Star  by  way  of  plan  of  arrangement  (the  “Amalgamation”) 
under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”).
The Meetings are to be held on Wednesday, April 8, 2015. The Providence Meeting will commence at 
10:00  a.m.  (Vancouver  time)  at  the  offices  of  Boughton  Law  Corporation  at  Suite  700  –  595  Burrard

DESERT STAR AND PROVIDENCE SHAREHOLDERS
The holders (“Desert Star Shareholders”) of shares (“Desert Star Shares”) of Desert Star will be asked 
to consider and vote upon the Amalgamation under the BCBCA.
The holders (“Providence Shareholders”) of shares (“Providence Shares”) of Providence will be asked 
to consider and vote upon the Amalgamation under the BCBCA.
Under the terms of the Amalgamation, Desert Star and Providence (the “Amalgamating Companies”) 
will amalgamate by way of plan of arrangement  and continue as one  company, Amalco. The name of 
Amalco  is  to  be  “Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.”  or  such  other  name  as  may  be  acceptable  to  regulatory 
authorities.
The Providence Shareholders will receive 0.4 common share of Amalco (an “Amalco Share”) and 0.4 
share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole  warrant,  an  “Amalco  Warrant”)  for  every  one 
Providence Share held (the “Providence Exchange Ratio”). Each Amalco Warrant will entitle the holder 
to acquire an additional Amalco Share for a period of two years at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Share.  
Desert  Star  Shareholders  will  receive  one  Amalco  Share  for  every  one  Desert  Star  Share  held  (the 
“Desert Star Exchange Ratio”).
In order to become effective, the Amalgamation must be approved by at least 66-2/3% of the votes cast 
by the shareholders of each of the Amalgamating Companies at their respective Meetings. The fairness of 
the Amalgamation to the Providence Shareholders and Desert Star Shareholders will also be subject to a 
declaratory order of the British Columbia Supreme Court.
DESERT STAR WARRANTHOLDERS
By virtue of the contractual provisions of such warrants and the Desert Star Exchange Ratio, the holders 
of  warrants  (“Desert  Star  Warrants”)  to  purchase  Desert  Star  Shares  will  be  entitled  to  purchase 
Amalco Shares on the basis of one Amalco Share for every one Desert Star Share for which the Desert 
Star Warrants were granted at an exercise price per Amalco Share equal to the exercise price per Desert 
Star Share and with the same term as specified in the Desert Star Warrants.
PROVIDENCE AND DESERT STAR OPTIONHOLDERS
By virtue of the terms of the Desert Star stock option plan, the contractual provisions of the options and 
the  Desert  Star  Exchange  Ratio,  the  holders  of  options  to  purchase  Desert  Star  Shares  (“Desert  Star 
Options”) will be entitled to purchase Amalco Shares on the basis of one Amalco Share for every one

Desert Star Share for which the Desert Star Options were granted at an exercise price per Amalco Share 
equal to the exercise price per Desert Star Share and with the same term as specified in the Desert Star 
Options.
By virtue of the terms of the Providence stock option plan, the contractual provisions of the options and 
the  Providence  Exchange  Ratio,  the  holders  of  options  to  purchase  Providence  Shares  (“Providence 
Options”) will be entitled to purchase that number of Amalco Shares which is equal to the number of 
Providence Shares which were the subject of such Providence Option multiplied by 0.4 Amalco Share 
(with the holders consenting to waive the Amalco Warrant portion of the Providence Exchange Ratio) at 
an  exercise  price  per  share  equal  to  the  exercise  price  of  such  Providence  Option  divided  by  the 
Providence  Exchange  Ratio  (with  the  holders  consenting  to  waive  the  Amalco  Warrant  portion  of  the 
Providence Exchange Ratio).  At the Providence Meeting, Providence will be seeking certain adjustment 
(reduction) to the exercise price of the former Providence Options, once converted to options in Amalco.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
Based  in  part  on  the  fairness  opinion  provided  by  Bruce  McKnight  Minerals  Advisor  Services  to  the 
Providence Board and the fairness opinion of Ross Glanville & Associates Ltd. to the Desert Star Board, 
the  Amalgamating  Companies  have  each  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  is  in  the  best  interests  of 
Providence  and  Desert  Star  respectively  and  is  fair  to  Providence  Shareholders  and  Desert  Star 
Shareholders respectively. Each of the Providence Board and the Desert Star Board recommends that the 
Providence  Shareholders  and  the  Desert  Star  Shareholders  respectively  vote  IN  FAVOUR  of  the 
Amalgamation.  All  of  the  members  of  the  Providence  Board  and  the  Desert  Star  Board  have  advised 
Providence  and  Desert  Star  respectively  that  they  intend  to  vote  the  Providence  Shares  or  Desert  Star 
Shares respectively held by them in favour of the Amalgamation (except to the extent such shares are 
excluded from voting pursuant to TSX Venture Exchange policies as described herein).

Q:  What are the recommendations of the Directors?

The  Directors  of  Desert  Star  and  Providence  unanimously  recommend  that  Shareholders  vote 
FOR the Amalgamation.
Q:  Why are the Directors making this recommendation?
A:
Q:
A:
Q:
A:
In reaching their conclusion that the Amalgamation is substantively and procedurally fair from a 
financial point of view to the Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders and that the 
Amalgamation is in the best interests of Desert Star and Providence, the Directors of Providence 
and Desert Star considered and relied upon a number of factors, including those described under 
the  headings  “The  Amalgamation  –  Reasons  for  the  Amalgamation”,  “Desert  Star  Fairness 
Opinion” and “Providence Fairness Option” in this Joint Information Circular.
In addition to the approval of Shareholders, are there any other approvals required for the 
Amalgamation?
Yes,  the  Amalgamation  is  subject  to  the  receipt  of  regulatory  approvals  and  approval  of  the 
British  Columbia  Supreme  Court.  See  “The  Amalgamation  -  Conduct  of  Meeting  and  Other 
Approvals” in this Joint Information Circular.
Do any Directors and executive officers of Desert Star or Providence have any interests in 
the Amalgamation that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Shareholders?
The interests of the Desert Star and Providence Directors are aligned with those of the Desert Star 
Shareholders  and  Providence  Shareholders,  except  that  certain  of  the  directors  and  officers  of 
Desert  Star  and  Providence  will  form  the  proposed  board  of  directors  and  management  of 
Amalco.
Q:   Will the Desert Star Shares and Providence Shares continue to be listed on the TSX-V after
the Amalgamation?
A:
Q:
A:
No.  Desert  Star  and  Providence  will  be  delisted  from  the  TSX-V  when  the  Amalgamation  is 
completed  and  Amalco  will  be  listed  on  the  TSX-V.  When  the  Amalgamation  is  completed, 
former Providence Shareholders and Desert Star Shareholders will hold shares of Amalco, which 
will be listed on the TSX-V.
Should I send my share certificates now?
You  are  not  required  to  send  your  certificates  representing  Desert  Star  Shares  or  Providence 
Shares  to  validly  cast  your  vote  in  respect  of  the  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  the 
Providence Amalgamation Resolution. A letter of transmittal containing instructions with respect 
to the deposits of certificates for Providence Shares with the Depositary will be forwarded to the 
former  Registered  Holders  of  Providence  Shares  for  use  in  exchanging  their  Providence  Share 
certificates for certificates representing Amalco Shares promptly after the Effective Date. Upon 
return  of  a  properly  completed  letter  of  transmittal,  together  with  the  certificates  representing 
Providence  Shares  certificates  for  the  appropriate  number  of  Amalco  Shares  (and  Amalco 
Warrants, in the case of Providence Shareholders) will be distributed.
Registered  Holders  of  Desert  Star  Shares  will  not  be  forwarded  a  letter  of  transmittal.  On  the 
Effective Date, any outstanding Desert Star Share certificates will be deemed to represent Amalco 
Shares on a 1:1 basis. Any Registered Holder of Desert Star Shares may, at their option, send
- 4 -
their Desert Star Share certificates to the Depositary, at any time, in exchange for Amalco Share 
certificates.
Q:   When can I expect to receive consideration for my Providence or Desert Star Shares?
A:
Assuming completion of the Amalgamation, if you hold your Desert Star Shares or Providence 
Shares  through  an  intermediary,  then  you  are  not  required  to  take  any  action  and  the  Amalco 
Shares (and Amalco Warrants, in the case of Providence Shareholders) will be delivered to your 
intermediary through the procedures in place for such purposes between CDS or similar entities 
and  such  intermediaries.  If you  hold your  Desert  Star  Shares  or  Providence  Shares  through an 
intermediary, you should contact your intermediary if you have questions regarding this process.
In the case of Registered Shareholders, a letter of transmittal containing instructions with respect 
to the deposits of certificates for Providence Shares with the Depositary will be forwarded to the 
former  Registered  Holders  Providence  Shares  for  use  in  exchanging  their  Providence  Share 
certificates  for  certificates  representing  Amalco  Shares  (and  Amalco  Warrants,  in  the  case  of 
Providence Shareholders) promptly after the Effective Date. Upon return of a properly completed 
letter  of  transmittal,  together  with  certificates  representing  Providence  Shares,  as  applicable, 
certificates for the appropriate number of Amalco Shares (and Amalco Warrants, in the case of 
Providence Shareholders) will be distributed.
Registered  Shareholders  who  do  not  deliver  their  Providence  Share  certificates  and  all  other 
required documents to the Depositary on or before the date which is six years after the Effective 
Date  will  lose  their  right  to  receive  Amalco  Shares  (and  Amalco  Warrants,  in  the  case  of 
Providence  Shareholders)  for  their  Providence  Shares.  See  “Procedure  for  Exchange  of 
Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares”.
Registered  Holders  of  Desert  Star  Shares  will  not  be  forwarded  a  letter  of  transmittal.  On  the 
Effective Date, any outstanding Desert Star Share certificates will be deemed to represent Amalco 
Shares on a 1:1 basis. Any Registered Holder of Desert Star Shares may, at their option, send 
their Desert Star Share certificates to the Depositary, at any time, in exchange for Amalco Share 
certificates.
How will the votes be counted?
Computershare Investor Services Inc., Desert Star and Providence’s Transfer Agent, counts and 
tabulates the proxies. Proxies are counted and tabulated by the Transfer Agent in such a manner 
as to preserve the confidentiality of the voting instructions of Registered Shareholders subject to a 
limited number of exceptions.
How will I know when the Amalgamation will be implemented?
The  Effective  Date  will  occur  upon  satisfaction  or  waiver  of  all  of  the  conditions  to  the 
completion of the Amalgamation. If the requisite level of approval is obtained at the Meeting, the 
Effective Date is expected to occur before April 30, 2015. On the Effective Date, Amalco will 
publicly announce that the conditions are satisfied or waived and that the Amalgamation has been 
implemented.
Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the Amalgamation?
Yes. Some of these risks include: (i) the Arrangement Agreement may be terminated in certain 
circumstances, in which case the market price for Desert Star Shares or Providence Shares may 
be  adversely  affected;  (ii)  there  can  be  no  certainty  that  all  conditions  precedent  to  the

Amalgamation will be satisfied or waived, or as to the timing of their satisfaction or waiver; (iii) 
Amalco may not meet anticipated exploration results following completion of the Amalgamation; 
and (vi) the Amalgamation may give rise to adverse tax consequences to Desert Star Shareholders 
and Providence Shareholders.
See “The Amalgamation – Amalgamation Risk Factors”.
Q:   What are the Canadian income tax consequences of the Amalgamation?
A:
A Canadian resident who holds Desert Star Shares or Providence Shares as capital property will 
generally  not  realize  a  capital  gain  or  capital  loss  for  Canadian  income  tax  purposes  on  the 
exchange of those shares under the Amalgamation for Amalco Shares.
Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders should be aware of the Canadian 
income  tax  consequences  of  the  Amalgamation  summarized  under  “Canadian  Federal 
Income Tax Considerations” in this Joint Information Circular.
For a summary of certain material Canadian income tax consequences of the Amalgamation, see 
“Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations”.  Such  summary  is  not  intended  to  be 
legal or tax advice to any particular Shareholder. Shareholders should consult their own tax and 
investment advisors with respect to their circumstances.
Q:

Q:
A:
Am I entitled to Dissent Rights?
The Amalgamation provides the Registered Shareholders with Dissent Rights in connection with 
the  Amalgamation  that  will  be  available  in  the  event  that  the  Providence  Amalgamation 
Resolution or Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution is approved by the Shareholders. Registered 
Shareholders considering exercising Dissent Rights should seek the advice of their own legal 
counsel and tax and investment advisors and should carefully review the description of such 
Dissent Rights set forth in the Joint Information Circular, and comply with the provisions 
of Sections 237-247 of the BCBCA the full text of which is set out on Schedule “I” to Joint 
Information  the  Joint  Information  Circular.  See  “Dissenting  Registered  Shareholders’ 
Rights” in the Joint Information Circular.
Are there tax consequences to exercising my Dissent Rights?
Holders of Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares who duly exercise their Dissent Rights and 
whose Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares are acquired by Providence or Desert Star will be 
paid the fair value of such shares by Providence, Desert Star or Amalco, as the case may be and 
will  be  considered  to  have  disposed  of  those  shares  for  proceeds  of  disposition  equal  to  the 
amount  paid,  other  than  interest  awarded  by  the  Court.  Such  a  disposition  could  result  in  a 
deemed dividend if the amount is paid by Providence or Desert Star, as the case may be, and a 
gain or loss for Canadian income tax purposes, but will only result in a gain or loss if the amount 
is paid by Amalco. There could be a requirement for the dissenting Shareholder to pay tax even if 
the fair value is less than the value of the consideration offered under the Amalgamation and even 
if the dissenting Shareholder does not ultimately receive fair value for the shares until following 
the completion of the Amalgamation. See “Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
Q:   What will happen to the Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares that I currently own after
completion of the Amalgamation?
A:
Upon completion of the Amalgamation, certificates representing Desert Star Shares will represent 
only the right of the Registered Shareholder to receive consideration of one Amalco Share per
- 6 -
Desert Star Share and certificates representing Providence Shares will represent only the right of 
the  Registered  Shareholder  to  receive  consideration  of  0.4  Amalco  Share  and  0.4  Amalco 
Warrant per Providence Share. Trading in Desert Star Shares and Providence Shares on the TSX-
V will cease and Amalco will be listed on the TSX-V.
Q:   Who can I contact if I have questions?
Shareholders who have additional questions about the Amalgamation, including the procedures 
for voting, should contact Vince Sorace at vsorace@v1.ca or 604-639-9052. Shareholders who 
have questions about deciding how to vote should contact their  financial, legal or professional 
advisors.

SUMMARY
The following is a summary of information relating to Desert Star, Providence, and Amalco (assuming 
completion of the Amalgamation) and should be read together with the more detailed information and 
financial  data  and  statements  contained  elsewhere  in  the  Joint  Information  Circular  including  the 
schedules hereto. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Summary are defined in the Glossary of 
Defined Terms or elsewhere in the Joint Information Circular. This Summary is qualified in its entirety by 
the more detailed information appearing or referred to elsewhere herein.
The Meetings
Date, Time and Place of Meetings
The Providence Meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) at the 
offices of Boughton Law Corporation at Suite 700 – 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, B.C. V7X 1S8. The 
Desert  Star  Meeting  will  be  held  on Wednesday, April  8,  2015  at  10:30  a.m.  (Vancouver  time)  at  the 
offices of Boughton Law Corporation at Suite 700 – 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, B.C. V7X 1S8.
The  Record  Date  for  determining  the  registered  shareholders  for  the  Providence  Meeting  is  March  4, 
2015. The Record Date for determining the registered shareholders for the Desert Star Meeting is March 
4, 2015.
Purposes of the Desert Star Meeting
This Joint Information Circular is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by management 
of Desert Star for use at the Desert Star Meeting.
At the Desert Star Meeting, Desert Star Shareholders will be asked to consider the items set forth in the 
Notice of Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders, and particularly, if thought fit, to approve 
with or without variation:
1.
2.
the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution, a Special Resolution approving the Amalgamation by 
way of plan of arrangement under the BCBCA to form Amalco and thereafter the issuance to the 
former shareholders of Desert Star of one Amalco Share for each Desert Star Share; and
if the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution is approved, an Ordinary Resolution approving the 
stock option plan to be adopted by Amalco pursuant to which the directors of Amalco may, from 
time to time, authorize the issuance of options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of 
Amalco to a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding Amalco Shares at the time of the 
grant, subject to regulatory approvals and such amendments as may be required by the TSX-V, as 
more fully set out in this Joint Information Circular.
In  accordance  with  TSX-V  Policies,  the  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by 
disinterested shareholders as the Amalgamation is a Non-Arm’s Length Transaction because it involves 
certain Non-Arm’s Length Parties. Therefore 1,207,457 Desert Star Shares held by Vince Sorace, Keith 
Henderson,  Gavin  Cooper  and  their  Associates  will  be  excluded  from  voting  on  the  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation  Resolution.  Vince  Sorace,  Keith  Henderson  and  Gavin  Cooper  are  Non-Arm’s  Length 
Parties  to  the  Amalgamation  because  they  are  directors  and/or  officers  of  each  of  the  Amalgamating 
Companies.
The  Desert  Star  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  is  not  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101  for  several  reasons  including  that  no
- 2 -
director  or  officer  of  Desert  Star,  is  entitled  to  receive,  directly  or  indirectly,  as  a  consequence  of  the 
transaction a collateral benefit. As MI 61-101 does not apply to the Amalgamation, Desert Star will not be 
required to obtain a formal valuation in connection with the Amalgamation or have the Amalgamation 
approved by a majority of the minority of the Desert Star Shareholders.
Purposes of the Providence Meeting
This Joint Information Circular is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by management 
of Providence for use at the Providence Meeting.
At the Providence Meeting, Providence Shareholders will be asked to consider the items set forth in the 
Notice of Annual General and Special Meeting, and particularly, if thought fit, to approve with or without 
variation:
1.
2.
the Providence Amalgamation Resolution, a Special Resolution approving the Amalgamation y 
way of plan of arrangement under the BCBCA to form Amalco and thereafter the issuance to the 
former  shareholders  of  Providence  0.4  Amalco  Share  and  0.4  Amalco  Warrant  for  each 
Providence Share; and
if the Providence Amalgamation Resolution is approved, an Ordinary Resolution approving the 
stock option plan to be adopted by Amalco pursuant to which the directors of Amalco may, from 
time to time, authorize the issuance of options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of 
Amalco to a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding Amalco Shares at the time of the 
grant, subject to regulatory approvals and such amendments as may be required by the TSX-V, as 
more fully set out in this Joint Information Circular.
In accordance with TSX-V Policies, the Providence Star Amalgamation Resolution must be approved by 
disinterested shareholders as the Amalgamation is a Related Party Transaction because it involves certain 
Non-Arm’s Length Parties. Therefore 812,000 Providence Shares held by Vince Sorace, Gavin Cooper 
and  their  respective  Associates  will  be  excluded  from  voting  on  the  Providence  Amalgamation 
Resolution. Vince Sorace and Gavin Cooper are Non-Arm’s Length Parties to the Amalgamation because 
Vince Sorace is a director and officer of each of the Amalgamating Companies and Gavin Cooper is an 
officer of each of the Amalgamating Companies.
The  Providence  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  may  be  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101.    Any  previously  granted  Providence 
Options will, by virtue of the Providence stock option plan and the contractual provisions of the options, 
be deemed to be issued under and governed by the Amalco Plan.  At the Providence Meeting, Providence 
will  be  seeking  certain  adjustment  (reduction)  to  the  exercise  price  of  the  former  Providence  Options, 
once converted to Amalco Options.  Therefore, the reduction in exercise price of the Amalco Options may 
be considered a “collateral benefit” as that term is defined in MI 61-101. MI 61-101 expressly excludes 
benefits from being “collateral benefits” if such benefits are received solely in connection with the related 
party’s  services  as  an  employee,  director  or  consultant  under  certain  circumstances,  the  benefits  are 
disclosed  in  the  disclosure  document  for  the  transaction,  and  either:  (a)  at  the  time  the  transaction  is 
agreed  to,  the  related  party  and  its  associated  entities  (as  defined  in  MI  61-  101)  beneficially  own,  or 
exercise control or direction over, less than 1% of the outstanding equity securities (being, in the case of 
Providence, the Providence Shares); or (b) an independent committee of directors determines, acting in 
good faith, that the value of the benefits received by a related  party, net of any offsetting costs to the 
related party, is less than 5% of the value the related party expects to receive pursuant to the transaction, 
provided that the independent committee’s determination is disclosed in this Joint Information Circular.
Although the Amalgamation may be considered a “business combination” under MI 61-101, it does not 
fall under the categories of transactions that require a “formal valuation” under MI 61-101.
See “The Amalgamation” and “Other Matters to be Acted Upon at the Meetings”.

Amalgamation:

The working capital amounts for both Amalgamating Companies exclude the balance of the unsecured, 
non-interest  bearing  loan  of  $250,000  (the  “Loan”)  from  Providence  to  Desert  Star  as  these  amounts

Reasons for the Amalgamation
Desert  Star  and  Providence  believe  the  Amalgamation  is  in  the  best  interests  of  their  respective 
Shareholders for numerous reasons. The business combination between Desert Star and Providence was 
negotiated on the basis that the Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders would benefit from 
combining Desert Star and Providence’s cash and mineral properties. The Amalgamating Companies also 
share  some  overlapping  management  –  Vince  Sorace  is  CEO  and  a  director  of  both  companies,  Keith 
Henderson  is  a  director  of  both  companies  and  Gavin  Cooper  is  CFO  of  both  companies.  The 
Amalgamation will result in certain cost savings as their businesses are joined.
For further information on the reasons for the Amalgamation, see “The Amalgamation – Reasons for the 
Amalgamation” and “The Amalgamation – Recommendations of the Directors” in this Joint Information 
Circular.
Recommendations of the Desert Star and Providence Directors
Each of the Desert Star Board and the Providence Board has determined that the Amalgamation is fair 
and reasonable to the Desert Star Shareholders and the Providence Shareholders, and in the best interests 
of Desert Star and Providence.
Each of the Desert Star Board recommends that the Desert Star Shareholders vote in favour of the Desert 
Star Amalgamation Resolution. See “The Amalgamation – Recommendations of the Directors”.

The Providence Board recommends that the Providence Shareholders vote in favour of the Providence 
Amalgamation Resolution. See “The Amalgamation – Recommendations of the Directors”.

1.
2.
the  approval  or  acceptance  of  the  Amalgamation  by  the  requisite  majority  of  the  Desert  Star 
Shareholders and the Providence Shareholders and the TSX-V; and

Procedural Steps
The Amalgamation will be carried out pursuant to the BCBCA. Aside from the terms of the Interim Order 
which was obtained from the Court on March 5, 2015 and attached hereto as Schedule “L” the following 
procedural steps must be taken in order for the Amalgamation to become effective:
1.
2.
the Amalgamation must be approved by the Shareholders;
if approved by the Shareholders, and assuming all conditions precedent to the Amalgamation, as 
set  forth  in  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  are  satisfied  or  waived  by  the  appropriate  party,  a 
hearing before the Court must be held to approve the Amalgamation; and

Court Approval
The Amalgamation under the BCBCA requires the approval of the Court. Prior to the mailing of this Joint 
Information Circular, the Amalgamating Companies obtained the Interim Order providing for the calling 
and holding of the Meetings and other procedural matters relating to the Amalgamation. A copy of the 
Interim Order is attached hereto as Schedule “L”.
Provided  that  the  Amalgamation  is  approved  by  the  requisite  majority  of  the  Shareholders  of  each  of 
Amalgamating Companies and certain other conditions are met, the Amalgamating Companies will make 
application to the Court for the Final Order at 9:45 a.m. Vancouver time (or so soon thereafter as legal 
counsel  can  be  heard)  on  April  10,  2015  at  the  Court  House,  800  Smithe  Street,  Vancouver,  British 
Columbia. The Final Order is not effective until filed with the Registrar, and the Final Order will only be 
filed when all other conditions to closing have been met. At the hearing for the Final Order any security 
holder or creditor of either of the Amalgamating Companies has the right to appear, be heard and present 
evidence if such person is of the view that his or her interests may be prejudiced by the Amalgamation. 
(See also Schedule “L” Interim Order and “The Amalgamation – Court Approvals”).
Exchange of Certificates and Fractional Shares
Registered Holders of Desert Star Shares will not be forwarded a letter of transmittal. On the Effective 
Date, any outstanding Desert Star Share certificates will be deemed to represent Amalco Shares on a 1:1 
basis.  Any  Registered  Holder  of  Desert  Star  Shares  may,  at  their  option,  send  their  Desert  Star  Share 
certificates to the Depositary, at any time, in exchange for Amalco Share certificates.
On or about the Effective Date, a letter of transmittal containing instructions with respect to the deposits 
of  certificates  for  Providence  Shares  with  the  Depositary  (Computershare  Investor  Services  Inc.)  at  its 
principal office in Vancouver, British Columbia will be forwarded to the former Providence Shareholders 
for  use  in  exchanging  their  Providence  Share  certificates  for  certificates  representing  Amalco  Shares 
promptly after the Effective Date. Upon return of a properly completed letter of transmittal, together with 
certificates representing Providence Shares, certificates for the appropriate number of Amalco Shares will 
be distributed without charge.
No fractional shares will be issued and no cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Any fractions 
resulting will be dealt with as provided for in the Arrangement Agreement.
Amalco  Warrants  will  be  distributed  to  former  Providence  Shareholders  under  the  terms  of  a  warrant 
indenture between Amalco and Computershare Investor Services Inc.
Cancellation of Rights After Six Years
If a former Providence Shareholder fails to deliver and surrender to the Depositary the former certificates 
representing  Providence  Shares  together  with  a  duly  executed  and  completed  letter  of  transmittal  and 
other  required  documents,  the  certificates  representing  the  Amalco  Shares,  to  which  the  Desert  Star 
Shareholder  or  Providence  Shareholder  would  otherwise  have  been  entitled,  will  be  held  by  the 
Depositary for a maximum of six (6) years from the Effective Date.
Upon the expiry of six (6) years from the Effective Date, each such former certificate representing 
Providence Shares, shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of
- 8 -
such former holder of Providence Shares, to receive certificates representing Amalco Shares, and 
the  Amalco  Shares  issued  to  such  former  Providence  Shareholders,  shall  be  deemed  to  be 
surrendered  to  Amalco  together  with  all  dividends  or  distributions  thereon  declared  or  held  for 
such holder.
Rights of Dissent
Providence  Shareholders  and  Desert  Star  Shareholders  have  the  right  to  dissent  to  the  proposed 
Amalgamation and to be paid the fair value of their shares upon strict compliance with the provisions of 
applicable law. See “Dissenting Registered Shareholders’ Rights”.
Income Tax Considerations
Desert Star Securityholders and Providence Securityholders should consult their own tax advisors 
about the applicable Canadian or United States federal, provincial, state and local tax consequences 
of the Amalgamation.
Summary of Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
A  Canadian  resident  who  holds  Providence  Shares  or  Desert  Star  Shares  as  capital  property  and 
exchanges such shares for Amalco Shares under the Amalgamation will generally not recognize a capital 
gain or capital loss under the Tax Act in respect of the exchange unless the resident chooses to recognize a 
capital gain or capital loss at that time.
A  non-resident  who  holds  Providence  Shares  or  Desert  Star  Shares  as  capital  property  and  exchanges 
such shares for Amalco Shares under the Amalgamation will generally not be subject to tax under the Tax 
Act  in  respect  of  any  capital  gain  realized  on  the  exchange  unless  the  shares  are  “taxable  Canadian 
property” to such non-resident holder and not “treaty-protected property” as defined in the Tax Act.
A  summary  of  the  principal  Canadian  federal  income  tax  considerations  in  respect  of  the  proposed 
Amalgamation is included under “The Amalgamation – Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations” 
and the foregoing is qualified in full by the information in such section.
Other Tax Considerations
This Joint Information Circular does not address any tax considerations of the Amalgamation other than 
Canadian income tax considerations discussed herein. Shareholders who are resident in jurisdictions other 
than  Canada  or  whose  tax  considerations  are  not  addressed  in  this  Joint  Information  Circular,  should 
consult  an  independent  tax  advisor  with  respect  to  tax  implications  of  the  Amalgamation  to  them. 
Shareholders  should  also  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  regarding  provincial,  territorial  or  state  tax 
considerations of the Amalgamation or of receiving and holding Amalco Shares.
Canadian Securities Laws Information
The  issuance  under  the  Amalgamation  of  Amalco  Shares  (and  Amalco  Warrants,  in  the  case  of 
Providence  Shareholders)  to  Providence  Shareholders  and  Desert  Star  Shareholders  will  constitute  a 
distribution of shares by Amalco which will be exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements 
of the securities legislation in all Provinces and Territories of Canada in which Registered Shareholders 
are resident.
Amalco  Shares  received  pursuant  to  the  Amalgamation  by  Providence  Shareholders  or  Desert  Star 
Shareholders who are resident in Canada, may be freely sold pursuant to the securities laws of Canada 
provided that: any person, company or combination of persons or companies holding a sufficient number
- 9 -
of Amalco Shares to affect materially the control of Amalco will be restricted in reselling such shares 
pursuant  to  applicable  securities  laws;  no  unusual  effort  is  made  to  prepare  the  market  or  to  create  a 
demand for the Amalco Shares; no extraordinary commission or other consideration is paid to a person or 
company in respect of the trade; and if the selling shareholder is an insider (including a senior officer) of 
Amalco, as the case may be, the selling shareholder has no reasonable grounds to believe that the Amalco 
is in default of securities legislation.
To  the  extent  that  Providence  Shareholders  or  Desert  Star  Shareholders  reside  in  non-Canadian 
jurisdictions,  the  Amalco  Shares  received  by  such  Shareholders  may  be  subject  to  certain  additional 
trading restrictions under applicable securities laws. All such Providence Shareholders or Desert Star 
Shareholders  residing  outside  Canada  are  advised  to  consult  their  own  legal  advisors  regarding 
such resale restrictions.
See “Securities Laws Considerations – Canadian Securities Laws” in this Joint Information Circular.
Risk Factors
The  Amalco  Securities  to  be  issued  to  the  Desert  Star  Shareholders  and  the  Providence  Shareholders 
pursuant  to  the  Amalgamation  are  speculative  and  subject  to  a  number  of  risk  factors.  Desert  Star 
Shareholders and Providence Shareholders should review carefully the risk factors set forth under “The 
Amalgamation – Amalgamation Risk Factors”.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Statements contained in this Joint Information Circular that are not historical facts are forward-looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, 
statements evaluating the market and general economic conditions and discussing future-oriented costs 
and expenditures. In certain cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such 
as  “expects”  or  “does  not  expect”,  “is  expected”,  “budget”,  “scheduled”,  “estimates”,  “intends”, 
“anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that 
certain  actions,  events  or  results  “may”,  “could”, “would”,  “might”  or  “will  be  taken”,  “occur”  or  “be 
achieved”. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors 
which  may  cause  the  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  of  Desert  Star,  Providence,  and 
Amalco,  to  be  materially  different  from  any  future  results,  performance  or  achievements  expressed  or 
implied  by  the  forward-looking  statements.  Such  factors  include,  among  others,  risks  related  to  the 
integration  of  acquisitions;  risks  related  to  international  operations;  the  effects  of  general  economic 
conditions;  changing  foreign  exchange  rates  and  actions  by  government  authorities;  uncertainties 
associated with legal proceedings and negotiations; industry supply levels; competitive pricing pressures; 
and  misjudgments  in  the  course  of  preparing  forward-looking  statements,  as  well  as  those  factors 
discussed  in  the  section  entitled  “The  Amalgamation  –  Amalgamation  Risk  Factors”  in  this  Joint 
Information Circular. Although Desert Star and Providence have attempted to identify important factors 
that  could  cause  actual  actions,  events  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  described  in  forward-
looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, 
estimated  or  intended.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  forward-looking  statements  will  prove  to  be 
accurate,  as  actual  results  and  future  events  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such 
statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Although Providence and Desert Star, where applicable, have attempted to identify important factors that 
could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as 
anticipated,  estimated  or  intended.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  statements  will  prove  to  be 
accurate  as  actual  results  and  future  events  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such 
statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
- 10 -
The  forward-looking  statements  contained  herein  are  expressly  qualified  in  their  entirety  by  this 
cautionary  statement.  The  forward-looking  statements  included  in  this  Joint  Information  Circular  are 
made as of the date of this Joint Information Circular and, except as required under applicable securities 
laws,  neither  Providence  nor  Desert  Star  undertakes  any  obligation  to  publicly  update  such  forward-
looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

NOTE TO UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS
THE  SECURITIES  DISTRIBUTABLE  IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THE  AMALGAMATION 
HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES 
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ANY 
STATE, NOR HAS THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR 
THE  SECURITIES  REGULATORY  AUTHORITIES  OF  ANY  STATE  PASSED  ON  THE 
ADEQUACY  OR  ACCURACY  OF  THIS  JOINT  INFORMATION  CIRCULAR.  ANY 
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
The  Amalco  Shares  and  Amalco  Warrants  to  be  distributed  under  the  Amalgamation  have  not  been 
registered  under  the  U.S.  Securities  Act,  and  are  being  issued  in  reliance  on  the  exemption  from 
registration  set  forth  in  Section  3(a)(10)  thereof  on  the  basis  of  the  approval  of  the  Court,  which  will 
consider,  among  other  things,  the  fairness  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Amalgamation  to 
Shareholders  as  further  described  under  “Securities  Law  Considerations  –  U.S.  Securities  Laws”.  The 
solicitation  of  proxies  hereby  is  not  subject  to  the  proxy  requirements  of  Section  14(a)  of  the  U.S. 
Exchange  Act.  Accordingly,  this  Joint  Information  Circular  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable disclosure requirements in Canada. Residents of the United States should be aware that such 
requirements are different than those of the United States applicable to proxy statements under the U.S. 
Exchange Act.  The securities to be issued to Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders in 
the United States pursuant to the Arrangement will not be listed for trading on any United States stock 
exchange.
Financial statements and information included in this Joint Information Circular have been prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada or IFRS, and are subject to auditing 
and auditor independence standards in Canada, and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of 
United States companies.
Likewise, information concerning the properties and operations of the parties and of Amalco have been 
and will be prepared in accordance with Canadian standards under applicable Canadian securities laws, 
and  are  not  comparable  to  similar  information  for  United  States  companies.  The  terms  “Mineral 
Resource”,  “Measured  Mineral  Resource”,  “Indicated  Mineral  Resource”  and  “Inferred  Mineral 
Resource”  used  pursuant  to  Canadian  reporting  standards  are  Canadian  mining  terms  as  defined  in 
accordance with National Instrument 43-101 under guidelines set out by the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM Standards”).
While the terms “Mineral Resource”, “Measured Mineral Resource”, “Indicated Mineral Resource” and 
“Inferred  Mineral  Resource”  are  recognized  and  required  by  Canadian  regulations,  they  are  not  terms 
recognized  or  permitted  under  standards  of  the  SEC.  As  such,  information  contained  in  Canadian 
disclosure documents concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards 
is not comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting 
and disclosure requirements of the SEC. “Inferred Mineral Resources” has a great amount of uncertainty 
as to its existence and as to its economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of 
an  “Inferred  Mineral  Resource”  will  ever  be  upgraded  to  a  higher  category.  Under  Canadian  rules, 
estimates  of  “Inferred  Mineral  Resources”  may  not  form  the  basis  of  feasibility  or  other  economic 
studies. Readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of Measured or Indicated Resources will 
ever be converted into Mineral Reserves. Readers are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of 
an “Inferred Mineral Resource” exists, or is economically or legally minable.
In addition, the definitions of “Proven Mineral Reserves” and “Probable Mineral Reserves” under CIM 
standards differ in certain respects from the SEC standards.
- 12 -
Shareholders  should  be  aware  that  the  distribution  of  the  securities  described  herein  may  have  tax 
consequences both in the United States and in Canada. Such consequences for investors who are resident 
in, or citizens of, the United States are not described in this Joint Information Circular.  For example, 
Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders who are residents or citizens of the United States 
may be subject to certain United States withholding obligations, including backup withholding.  Certain 
documentation,  including  Form  W-9,  may  be  required  of  such  United  States  residents  and  citizens  in 
order  to  avoid  the  application  of  United  States  withholding  taxes.    United  States  Shareholders  are 
advised to consult their tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the 
Arrangement.
The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the United States federal securities laws may be 
affected adversely by the fact that Desert Star and Providence are incorporated or organized outside the 
United  States,  that  some  or  all  of  their  officers  and  directors  and  the  experts  named  herein  may  be 
residents of a foreign country, and that all or a portion of the assets of Desert Star and Providence and 
said persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. 
shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon Desert Star or Providence, their 
directors or officers, or the experts named herein, or to realize against them upon judgments of courts of 
the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States or 
“blue sky” laws of any state within the United States. In addition, U.S. shareholders should not assume 
that the courts of Canada: (a) would enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against 
such  persons  predicated  upon  civil  liabilities  under  the  federal  securities  laws  of  the  United  States  or 
“blue sky” laws of any state within the United States; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities 
against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States 
or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.
This document does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any 
state in the United States in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful.

Appointment of Proxyholder
The individuals named in the accompanying form of proxy are officers and/or directors of Providence or 
Desert  Star.  A  SHAREHOLDER  WISHING  TO  APPOINT  SOME  OTHER  PERSON  (WHO 
NEED NOT BE A SHAREHOLDER) TO REPRESENT HIM OR HER AT THE MEETING HAS 
THE RIGHT TO DO SO, EITHER BY STRIKING  OUT  THE NAMES OF THOSE PERSONS 
NAMED  IN  THE  ACCOMPANYING  FORM  OF  PROXY  AND  INSERTING  THE  DESIRED 
PERSON’S  NAME  IN  THE  BLANK  SPACE  PROVIDED  IN  THE  FORM  OF  PROXY  OR  BY 
COMPLETING ANOTHER FORM OF PROXY. A proxy will not be valid unless the completed 
form  of  proxy  is  received  by  Computershare  Investor  Services  Inc.,  by  mail  to  100  University 
Avenue,  9TH  Floor,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada  M5J  2Y1  or  by  hand  to  3rd  Floor,  510  Burrard 
Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada  V6C  3B9,  not  less  than  48  hours  (excluding 
Saturdays,  Sundays  and  holidays)  before  the  time  for  holding  the  Meeting  or  any  adjournment 
thereof. Proxies delivered after that time will not be accepted. Internet and telephone voting are 
also available 24 hours a day, using the instructions on the proxy form. If you vote by Internet or 
the telephone, do not mail back the proxy.
To vote using the Internet, go to www.investorvote.com and provide your Control Number, Holder 
Account Number and Access Number listed on the bottom of the proxy form.
- 21 -

The  proxy  form  must  be  executed  by  the  Shareholder  or  his  attorney  authorized  in  writing,  or  if  a 
Shareholder is a corporation, the proxy form should be signed in its corporate name under its corporate 
seal by an authorized officer of such corporation whose title should be indicated. A proxy form signed by

persons proposed by management as proxyholders in the accompanying form of proxy will:
(a)
(b)

ballot that may be taken; and
where  a  choice  with  respect  to  any  matter  to  be  acted  upon  has  been  specified  in  the  form  of 
proxy, be voted in accordance with the specification made in such proxy.

CHOICE HAS BEEN SPECIFIED OR WHERE BOTH CHOICES HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BY THE 
SHAREHOLDER.

discretionary authority upon the person appointed proxy thereunder to vote with respect to amendments or 
variations of matters identified in the Notice of Meeting, and with respect to other matters which may 
properly come before the Meeting. In the event that amendments or variations to matters identified in the 
Notice of Meeting are properly brought before the Meeting or any further or other business is properly 
brought before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons designated in the enclosed form of proxy to 
vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matters or business. At the time of the printing of this 
Joint Information Circular, the management of Providence and Desert Star know of no such amendment, 
variation or other matter which may be presented to the Meeting.
Completion and Return of Proxy
Each proxy must be dated and signed by the Nominee (as defined in “Non-Registered Holders” below)

- 22 -
Completed  forms  of  proxy  for  Providence  must  be  deposited  at  the  office  of  its  registrar  and  transfer 
agent, by mail to 100 University Avenue, 9th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2Y1 or by hand to 3rd 
Floor,  510  Burrard  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada  V6C  not  later  than  forty-eight  (48) 
hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, before the time of the Providence Meeting.
Non-Registered Holders
The  information  set  forth  in  this  section  is  of  significant  importance  to  many  holders  of  Providence 
Shares and Desert Star Shares, as a substantial number of such shareholders do not hold their shares in 
their  own  name.  Only  Registered  Shareholders  or  duly  appointed  proxyholders  are  permitted  to 
vote at the Meeting. Most shareholders are “non-registered” shareholders because the shares they 
own are not registered in their names but are instead registered in the names of a brokerage firm, 
bank or other intermediary or in the name of a clearing agency. Shareholders who do not hold their 
shares in their own name (referred to herein as “Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only 
Registered Shareholders may vote at the Meeting. If common shares are listed in an account statement 
provided to a shareholder by a broker, then in almost all cases those common shares will not be registered 
in such shareholder’s name on the records of Providence or Desert Star. Such common shares will more 
likely be registered under the name of the Shareholder’s broker or an agent of that broker. In Canada, the 
vast majority of such shares are registered under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for The 
Canadian  Depository  for  Securities,  which  company  acts  as  nominee  for  many  Canadian  brokerage 
firms). Common shares held by brokers (or their agents or nominees) on behalf of a broker’s client can 
only be voted (for or against resolutions) at the direction of the Beneficial Shareholder. Without specific 
instructions,  brokers  and  their  agents  and  nominees  are  prohibited  from  voting  shares  for  the  brokers’ 
clients.  Therefore,  each  Beneficial  Shareholder  should  ensure  that  voting  instructions  are 
communicated to the appropriate person well in advance of the Meeting.
Existing  regulatory  policy  requires  brokers  and  other  intermediaries  to  seek  voting  instructions  from 
Beneficial  Shareholders  in  advance  of  shareholders’  meetings.  The  various  brokers  and  other 
intermediaries  have  their  own  mailing  procedures  and  provide  their  own  return  instructions  to  clients, 
which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their Providence 
Share or Desert Star Shares are voted at the Meeting. Often the form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial 
Shareholder by its broker is identical to the form of proxy provided by Providence and Desert Star to the 
registered shareholders. However, its purpose is limited to instructing the registered shareholder (i.e. the 
broker  or  agent  of  the  broker)  how  to  vote  on  behalf  of  the  Beneficial  Shareholder.  The  majority  of 
brokers  now  delegate  responsibility  for  obtaining  instructions  from  clients  to  Broadridge  Investor 
Communication Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically prepares a machine-readable voting 
instruction form,  mails those forms to the Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to 
return the forms to Broadridge, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to Broadridge (by way of 
the internet or telephone, for example). Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received 
and  provides  appropriate  instructions  respecting  the  voting  of  common  shares  to  be  represented  at  the 
Meeting. A Beneficial Shareholder who receives a Broadridge voting instruction form cannot use 
that  form  to  vote  common  shares  directly  at  the  Meeting.  The  voting  instruction  form  must  be 
returned  to  Broadridge  (or  instructions  respecting  the  voting  of  common  shares  must  be 
communicated to Broadridge) well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the common shares 
voted.
All Beneficial Shareholders of Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares can expect to be contacted by 
Broadridge or their brokers or their broker’s agents as set out above.
Although  Beneficial  Shareholders  may  not  be  recognized  directly  at  the  Meeting  for  the  purposes  of 
voting  common  shares  registered  in  the  name  of  his  broker,  a  Beneficial  Shareholder  may  attend  the 
Meeting  as  proxyholder  for  the  registered  shareholder  and  vote  the  common  shares  in  that  capacity.
- 23 -
Beneficial  shareholders  who  wish  to  attend  the  Meeting  and  indirectly  vote  their  common  shares  as 
proxyholder for the registered shareholder should enter their own names in the blank space on the proxy 
provided  to  them  and  return  the  same  to  their  broker  (or  the  broker’s  agent)  in  accordance  with  the 
instructions provided by such broker.
All references to Shareholders in this Joint Information Circular and the accompanying form of Proxy and 
Notice of Meeting are to Shareholders of record unless specifically stated otherwise.
Revocability of Proxy
In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a Registered Shareholder who has given a 
proxy may revoke it as to any matter on which a vote has not already been cast by either executing a 
proxy  bearing  a  later  date  or  by  executing  a  valid  notice  of  revocation,  either  of  the  foregoing  to  be 
executed by the Registered Shareholder or the Registered Shareholder’s authorized attorney in writing, or, 
if the Shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal by an officer or attorney duly authorized, and 
by delivering the proxy bearing a later date or the notice of revocation to the registered and records office 
of Providence or Desert Star located at Boughton Law Corporation at Suite 1000 – 595 Burrard Street, 
Vancouver, B.C. V7X 1S8, at any time up to and including the last business day that precedes the day of 
the Meeting or, if the Meeting is adjourned, the last business day that precedes any reconvening thereof, 
or to the chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or any reconvening thereof. A revocation of a 
proxy will not affect a matter on which a vote is taken before the revocation.
Interest of Certain Persons in Matters to be Acted Upon
None of the directors or executive officers of either Desert Star or Providence, nor any person who has 
held  such  a  position  since  the  beginning  of  the  last  completed  financial  year  of  either  Desert  Star  or 
Providence, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director of Desert Star or Providence, nor any 
associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons, has any substantial or material interest, direct or indirect, 
by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted on at the Meeting 
other than the election of directors, and any interest arising from the ownership of Desert Star Securities 
or Providence Securities where Desert Star Securityholders or Providence Securityholders, respectively, 
will  receive  no  extra  or  special  benefit  or  advantage  not  shared  on  a  pro-rata  basis  by  all  Desert  Star 
Securityholders  or  Providence  Securityholders,  respectively.    All  Providence  Optionholders  who  are 
Insiders will not vote on the ordinary resolution to decrease the exercise price of options as described in 
this Joint Information Circular.
Principal Holders of Voting Securities
To  the  knowledge  of  the  directors  and  the  executive  officers  of  Desert  Star,  as  at  the  date  hereof,  no 
person  or  company  beneficially  owns,  directly  or  indirectly,  or  controls  or  directs,  voting  securities 
carrying 10% or more of the voting rights attached to any class of voting securities of Desert Star.
To  the  knowledge  of  the  directors  and  the  executive  officers  of  Providence,  as  at  the  date  hereof,  no

carrying 10% or more of the voting rights attached to any class of voting securities of Providence.

(a)
(b)
was  subject  to  an  order  that  was  issued  while  the  proposed  director  was  acting  in  the 
capacity as director, CEO or CFO; or
was subject to an order that was issued after the proposed director ceased to be a director, 
CEO  or  CFO  and  which  resulted  from  an  event  that  occurred  while  that  person  was 
acting in the capacity as director, CEO or CFO.
No  proposed  director  of  Providence  has,  within  the  past  10  years,  become  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal 
under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, 
arrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to

agreement with a securities regulatory authority or has been subject to any other penalties or sanctions 
imposed by a court or regulatory body or self-regulating authority.
Other than Mr. Vince Sorace, no director of Providence is or has been, within the past 10 years, a director 
or executive officer of any company that, while that person was acting in that capacity or within a year of 
that  person  ceasing  to  act  in  that  capacity,  became  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any  legislation

through a proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) with the Court on November 19, 
2008  and  thereby  obtained  a  stay  of  proceedings  with  respect  to  claims  by  creditors.  Abakhan  &

proceedings which were completed on April 27, 2009 and the Interim Receiver was discharged, as the 
proposal  trustee  and  interim  receiver,  by  order  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  British  Columbia  on  July  16,
- 27 -

is  currently  a  director  of  “new”  Nevaro  Capital  Corporation  which  is  a  different  legal  entity  than  Old 
Nevaro, and is the entity resulting from a plan of arrangement between Old Nevaro and Canadian Energy 
Services L.P.
Executive Compensation
Set out below are particulars of compensation paid to Providence’s NEOs.
As at September 30, 2014, the end of Providence’s most recently completed financial year, Providence 
had  three  NEOs,  whose  names  and  positions  held  within  Providence  are  set  out  in  the  summary 
compensation table below.
Compensation discussion and analysis
Remuneration plays an important role in attracting, motivating, rewarding and retaining knowledgeable 
and  skilled  individuals  to  Providence’s  management  team.  Providence  does  not  have  a  formal 
compensation policy. The main objectives Providence hopes to achieve through its compensation are:
•
•
•
•
to  attract  and  retain  executives  critical  to  Providence’s  success,  who  will  be  key  in  helping 
Providence achieve its corporate objectives and increase shareholder value;
to motivate Providence’s management team to meet or exceed targets;
to  recognize  the  contribution  of  Providence’s  executive  directors  to  the  overall  success  and 
strategic growth of Providence; and
to align the interests of management and Providence’s shareholders by providing performance-
based compensation in addition to salary.
The Providence Board determines an appropriate amount of compensation for its executives, reflecting 
the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and effort expended by the executives while 
taking  into  account  the  financial  and  other  resources  of  Providence.    The  Providence  Board  did  not 
consider  the  implications  of  the  risks  associated  with  Providence’s  compensation  practices;  however, 
given Providence’s size and nature of compensation provided to its executives in the last financial year, 
the Providence Board does not view significant risk that would be likely to have a material adverse effect 
on Providence.
Providence’s  management  is  not  permitted  to  purchase  financial  instruments,  including,  for  greater 
certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds that are 
designed  to  hedge  or  offset  a  decrease  in  market  value  of  equity  securities  of  Providence  granted  as 
compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by management.
The  Providence  Board  determines  the  allocation  and  terms  of  any  stock  option  grants.  When  granting 
stock options, the Providence Board considers the amount of past options which have been granted.
Option based Awards
The Providence Plan, a 20% fixed plan, was approved by the Providence Board on January 31, 2012.  The 
Providence  Plan  was  approved  by  the  shareholders  at  Providence’s  annual  general  meeting  held  on 
February 2, 2012.
- 28 -
Stock options are granted to provide an incentive to the directors, officers, employees and consultants of 
Providence to achieve the long-term objectives of Providence; to give suitable recognition to the ability 
and industry of such persons who contribute materially to the success of Providence; and to attract and 
retain persons of experience and ability, by providing them with the opportunity to acquire and increase 
proprietary interest in Providence. Providence awards stock options to its executive officers based upon 
the  recommendation  of  the  Providence  Board,  which  recommendation  is  based  upon  the  Providence 
Board’s review of a proposal from the CEO.  Previous grants of incentive stock options are taken into 
account when considering new grants.
The Providence Plan is administered by the Providence Board, which will have full and final authority 
with respect to the granting of all options thereunder. Options may be granted under the Providence Plan 
to such eligible persons as the Providence Board may from time to time designate.
For  more  information  on  the  terms  of  the  Providence  Plan  please  refer  to  Providence’s  Information 
Circular dated December 29, 2011 and filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Compensation Governance
The Providence Board determines an appropriate amount of compensation for its executives, reflecting 
the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and effort expended by the executives while 
taking  into  account  the  financial  and  other  resources  of  Providence.    Providence  does  not  have  a 
Compensation Committee.

Pension Plan Benefits
Providence  does  not  have  in  place  any  deferred  compensation  plan  or  pension  plan  that  provides  for 
payments or benefits at, following or in connection with retirement.
Termination and change of control benefits
Providence  does  not  have  any  plan  or  arrangement  to  pay  or  otherwise  compensate  any  NEO  if  his 
employment  is  terminated  as  a  result  of  resignation,  retirement,  change  of  control,  etc.  or  if  his 
responsibilities change following a change of control.
Compensation of Directors
As at the financial year ended September 30, 2014, Providence had three directors, one of whom (at any 
given time) was also an NEO.  For a description of the compensation paid to the NEO of Providence who

Providence currently does not pay directors who are not employees or officers of Providence for attending 
directors meetings or for serving on committees. Providence has no arrangements, standard for otherwise, 
pursuant to which directors are compensated by Providence for their services as directors, for committee 
participation,  or  for  involvement  in  special  assignments  during  the  most  recently  completed  financial 
year. None of Providence’s directors have received any cash compensation for services provided in their

The  aggregate  fees  unbilled/billed  for  tax  compliance,  tax  advice  and  tax  planning  services  by

All Other Fees
The  aggregate  fees  billed  by  Providence’s  external  auditor  for  the  financial  year  ended  September  30, 
2013  for  review  of  unaudited  interim  financial  statements,  compilation  of  consolidated  financial

As a venture issuer under NI 52-110, Providence is relying on the exemption provided in section 6.1 of 
NI 52-110 which is an exemption from the composition requirements and reporting obligations applicable

Appointment of Auditor
Unless otherwise instructed, the proxies given in this solicitation will be voted for the re-appointment of 
Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton LaBonte LLP, Chartered Accountants, of Vancouver, British  Columbia,  as 
Providence’s auditor to hold office until the next annual general meeting.  Providence proposes that the 
Providence Board be authorized to fix the remuneration to be paid to the auditor.
The Audit Committee recommends the election of Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton LaBonte LLP, Chartered 
Accountants, of Vancouver, British Columbia, as our auditor to hold office until Providence’s next annual 
general  meeting.    The  Audit  Committee  proposes  that  the  Providence  Board  be  authorized  to  fix  the 
remuneration to be paid to the auditor.
Corporate Governance
The  Providence  Board  believes  that  good  corporate  governance  improves  corporate  performance  and 
benefits  all  shareholders.  NP  58-201  provides  non-prescriptive  guidelines  on  corporate  governance 
practices for reporting issuers such as Providence. In addition, NI 58-101 prescribes certain disclosure by 
Providence  of  its  corporate  governance  practices.  The  disclosure  required  by  NI  58-101  is  presented 
below.
1.
Board of Directors
The Providence Board facilitates its independent supervision over management through regular meetings 
of the Providence Board.  The non-management directors of the Providence Board do not hold regularly 
scheduled meetings at which non-independent directors are not in attendance.  However, the size of the 
Providence  Board  and  the  nature  of  Providence’s  operations  ensure  that  open  and  candid  discussion 
among the independent directors is possible.
The independent member of the Providence Board is Keith Henderson.  The non-independent directors of 
the Providence Board are Vince Sorace, the Chairman of the Providence Board, CEO and President of 
Providence and Steve Bajic.  Although Steve Bajic is not currently an employee of Providence, because 
he  has  been  an  executive  officer  of  Providence  within  the  last  three  years,  he  is  not  considered 
independent under NI 58-101 which relies on the independence tests in NI 52-110.
The  mandate  of  the  Providence  Board,  as  prescribed  by  the  BCBCA,  is  to  manage  or  supervise 
management  of  the  business  and  affairs  of  Providence  and  to  act  with  a  view  to  the  best  interests  of 
Providence.  In doing so, the Providence Board oversees the management of Providence’s affairs directly 
and through its committees.

3.
Orientation and Continuing Education
The  Providence  Board  is  responsible  for  providing  orientation  for  all  new  recruits  to  the  Providence 
Board.    Each  new  director  brings  a  different  skill  set  and  professional  background,  and  with  this 
information, the Providence Board is able to determine what orientation to the nature and operations of 
Providence’s  business  will  be  necessary  and  relevant  to  each  new  director.    Providence  provides 
continuing education for its directors as the need arises and encourages open discussion at all meetings, 
which format encourages learning by the directors.
4.
Ethical Business Conduct
The  Providence  Board  relies  on  the  fiduciary  duties  placed  on  individual  directors  by  Providence’s 
governing  corporate  legislation  and  the  common  law  to  ensure  the  Providence  Board  operates 
independently of management and in the best interests of Providence.  The Providence Board has found 
that  these,  combined  with  the  restrictions  placed  by  applicable  corporate  legislation  on  an  individual 
directors’ participation in decisions of the Providence Board in which the director has an interest, have 
been sufficient.
5.
Nomination of Directors
The  Providence  Board  considers  its  size  each  year  when  it  considers  the  number  of  directors  to 
recommend to the shareholders for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. The Providence Board 
takes  into  account  the  number  required  to  carry  out  the  Providence  Board’s  duties  effectively  and  to 
maintain a diversity of views and experience.
The Providence Board does not have a Nominating Committee.  The Providence Board is responsible for 
recruiting new members to the Providence Board and planning for the succession of the Providence Board 
members.
6.
Compensation
The  Providence  Board  is  responsible  for  determining  all  forms  of  compensation,  including  long-term 
incentive in the form of stock options, to be granted to the CEO of Providence and the directors, and for 
reviewing the CEO’s recommendations respecting compensation of the other officers of Providence, to 
ensure  such  arrangements  reflect  the  responsibilities  and  risks  associated  with  each  position.    When 
determining the compensation of its officers, the Providence Board considers:(i) recruiting and retaining 
executives critical to the success of Providence and the enhancement of shareholder value; (ii) providing 
fair  and  competitive  compensation;  (iii)  balancing  the  interests  of  management  and  the  Providence
- 36 -
Shareholders; (iv) rewarding performance, both on an individual basis and with respect to operations in 
general; and (v) permitted compensation under TSX-V rules.
7.
Other Board Committees
The Providence Board has appointed an Audit Committee, the members of which are Steve Bajic, Vince 
Sorace and Keith Henderson.  A description of the function of the Audit Committee can be found in this 
Joint  Information  Circular  under  “Audit  Committee”.    The  Providence  Board  does  not  have  any  other 
committees.
8.
Assessments
The  Providence  Board  annually  reviews  its  own  performance  and  effectiveness  as  well  as  reviews  the 
Audit  Committee  Charter  and  recommends  revisions  as  necessary.    Neither  Providence  nor  the 
Providence  Board  has  adopted  formal  procedures  to  regularly  assess  the  Providence  Board,  the  Audit 
Committee  or  the  individual  directors  as  to  their  effectiveness  and  contribution.    Effectiveness  is 
subjectively measured by comparing actual corporate results with stated objectives.  The contributions of 
individual directors are informally monitored by the other Board members, bearing in mind the business 
strengths  of  the  individual  and  the  purpose  of  originally  nominating  the  individual  to  the  Providence 
Board.
The Providence Board monitors the adequacy of information given to directors, communication between 
the Providence Board and management and the strategic direction and processes of the Providence Board 
and its committees.
The  Providence  Board  believes  its  corporate  governance  practices  are  appropriate  and  effective  for 
Providence, given its size and operations.  Providence’s corporate governance practice allows Providence 
to  operate  efficiently,  with  checks  and  balances  that  control  and  monitor  management  and  corporate 
functions without excessive administrative burden.
Management Contracts
The management functions of Providence are not to any substantial degree performed by any person other 
than the executive officers and directors of Providence.
Confirmation and Approval of Advance Notice Provisions
Background
On  September  25,  2014,  the  Providence  Board  adopted  advance  notice  provisions  (the  “Providence 
Advance Notice Provisions”) with immediate effect, as disclosed by press release dated September 25, 
2014. A copy of the Providence Advance Notice Provisions is available for reviewing at Providence’s 
registered office at Suite 1000 – 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7X 1S8 and head 
office at Suite 717 - 1030 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, V6E 2Y3 during regular business hours 
up  to  the  day  before  the  Providence  Meeting.  If  The  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  is  not 
approved,  in  order  for  the  Providence  Advance  Notice  Provisions  to  remain  in  effect  following 
termination  of  the  Providence  Meeting,  the  Providence  Advance  Notice  Provisions  must  be  ratified, 
confirmed  and  approved  by  the  Providence  Meeting.  Amalco’s  Articles  will  include  advance  notice 
provisions in the same form as the Providence Advance Notice Provisions.
- 37 -
Advance Notice Provisions
Subject to authorization and approval by Providence Shareholders, Providence’s Articles are proposed to 
be amended by adding the following Article 10.11 after Article 10.10 and before Article 11:
“10.11  Advance Notice for Nomination of Directors.
(1)
Subject only to the Business Corporations Act and these Articles, only persons who are 
nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as 
directors of the Company. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at 
any annual meeting of shareholders, or at any special meeting of shareholders called for 
the  purpose  of  electing  directors  as  set  forth  in  the  Company’s  notice  of  such  special 
meeting,  may  be  made  (i)  by  or  at  the  direction  of  the  board  of  directors,  including 
pursuant  to  a  notice  of  meeting,  (ii)  by  or  at  the  direction  or  request  of  one  or  more 
shareholders  pursuant  to  a  proposal  made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
Business Corporations Act, or a requisition of the shareholders made in accordance with 
the  provisions  of  the  Business  Corporations  Act  or,  (iii)  by  any  shareholder  of  the 
Company (a “Nominating Shareholder”) who, at the close of business on the date of the 
giving of the notice provided for below in this Article 10.11 and on the record date for 
notice of such meeting, is entered in the securities  register as a  holder of one or  more 
shares carrying the right to vote at such meeting or who beneficially owns shares that are 
entitled to be voted at such meeting, and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set 
forth in this Article 10.11.
(a)
(b)
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by 
a Nominating Shareholder, such person must have given timely notice thereof in 
proper  written  form  to  the  secretary  at  the  principal  executive  offices  of  the 
Company in accordance with this Article 10.11.
To  be  timely,  a  Nominating  Shareholder’s  notice  must  be  received  by  the 
secretary of the Company (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 30 
days  or  more  than  65  days  prior  to  the  date  of  the  annual  meeting  of 
shareholders;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  event  that  the  annual  meeting  of 
shareholders  is  to  be  held  on  a  date  that  is  less  than  50  days  after  the  date  on 
which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made 
(the  “Meeting  Notice  Date”),  the  Nominating  Shareholder’s  notice  must  be  so 
received  not  later  than  the  close  of  business  on  the  10th  day  following  the 
Meeting  Notice  Date;  and  (ii)  in  the  case  of  a  special  meeting  of  shareholders 
(which is not also an annual meeting) called for the purpose of electing directors 
(whether or not called for other purposes), not later than the close of business on 
the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 
special meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an 
adjournment  of  an  annual  meeting  or  special  meeting  commence  a  new  time 
period for the giving of a Nominating Shareholder’s notice as described in this 
Article 10.11.
(c)
To be in proper written form, a Nominating Shareholder’s notice must set forth: 
(i) as to each person whom the Nominating Shareholder proposes to nominate for 
election as a director (A) the name, age, business address and residence address 
of the person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (C) the 
class or series and number of shares of the Company that are owned beneficially 
or of record by the person and (D) any other information relating to the person
- 38 -
that  would  be  required  to  be  disclosed  in  a  dissident’s  proxy  circular  in 
connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to the 
Business  Corporations  Act  and  Applicable  Securities  Laws;  and  (ii)  as  to  the 
Nominating  Shareholder  giving  the  notice,  any  proxy,  contract,  arrangement, 
understanding  or  relationship  pursuant  to  which  such  Nominating  Shareholder 
has a right to vote any shares of the Company and any other information relating 
to  such  Nominating  Shareholder  that  would  be  required  to  be  made  in  a 
dissident’s proxy circular in connection with solicitations of proxies for election 
of directors pursuant to the Business Corporations Act and Applicable Securities 
Laws.  The  Company  may  require  any  proposed  nominee  to  furnish  such  other 
information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the 
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the 
Company or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder’s understanding 
of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee. The Nominating 
Shareholder’s notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed 
nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
No  person  shall  be  eligible  for  election  as  a  director  of  the  Company  unless 
nominated  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  forth  in  this  Article  10.11; 
provided, however, that nothing in this Article 10.11 shall be deemed to preclude 
a  shareholder  from  discussing  (as  distinct  from  nominating  directors)  at  a 
meeting  of  shareholders  any  matter  in  respect  of  which  the  shareholder  would 
have been entitled to submit a proposal pursuant to the provisions of the Business 
Corporations  Act.  The  chair  of  the  meeting  shall  have  the  power  and  duty  to 
determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the procedures set 
forth  in  the  foregoing  provisions  and,  if  any  proposed  nomination  is  not  in 
compliance  with  such  foregoing  provisions,  to  declare  that  such  defective 
nomination shall be disregarded.
For  purposes  of  this  Article  10.11,  (i)  “public  announcement”  shall  mean 
disclosure  in  a  press  release  disseminated  by  a  nationally  recognized  news 
service  in  Canada,  or  in  a  document  publicly  filed  by  the  Company  under  its 
profile  on  the  System  of  Electronic  Document  Analysis  and  Retrieval  at 
www.sedar.com;  and  (ii)  “Applicable  Securities  Laws”  means  the  applicable 
securities  legislation  in  each  relevant  province  and  territory  of  Canada,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time,  the  rules,  regulations  and  forms  made  or 
promulgated  under  any  such  statute  and  the  published  national  instruments, 
multilateral  instruments,  policies,  bulletins  and  notices  of  the  securities 
commission  and  similar  regulatory  authority  of  each  province  and  territory  of 
Canada.
Notice given to the secretary of the Company pursuant to this Article 10.11 may 
only be given by personal delivery, facsimile transmission or by email (at such 
email address as stipulated from time to time by the secretary of the Company for 
purposes of this notice), and shall be deemed to have been given and made only 
at the time it is served by personal delivery, email (at the address aforesaid) or 
sent  by  facsimile  transmission  (provided  the  receipt  of  confirmation  of  such 
transmission  has  been  received)  to  the secretary  at the  address  of  the  principal 
executive  offices  of  the  Company;  provided  that  if  such  delivery  or  electronic 
communication is made on a day which is not a business day or later than 5:00 
p.m. (Vancouver time) on a day which is a business day, then such delivery or
(d)
(e)
(f)
- 39 -
electronic communication shall be deemed to have been on the subsequent day 
that is a business day.
(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board may, in its sole discretion, waive any 
requirement in this Article 10.11.”.
Purpose of the Providence Advance Notice Provisions
The Providence Board believes it appropriate for the Providence Advance Notice Provisions to be added 
to the current Articles.  Providence’s directors are committed to: (a) facilitating an orderly and efficient 
annual  general  or,  where  the  need  arises,  special  meeting,  process;  (b)  ensuring  that  all  Providence 
Shareholders receive adequate notice of the director nominations and sufficient information with respect 
to  all  nominees;  and  (c)  allowing  Providence  shareholders  to  register  an  informed  vote  having  been 
afforded reasonable time for appropriate deliberation.
The  purpose  of  the  Providence  Advance  Notice  Provisions  is  to  provide  the  Providence  Shareholders, 
directors  and  management  with  a  clear  framework  for  nominating  directors.  The  Providence  Advance 
Notice Provisions fix a deadline by which holders of record of Providence Shares must submit director 
nominations to Providence prior to any annual general or special meeting of Providence Shareholders and 
sets forth the information that a Providence Shareholder must include in the notice to Providence in order 
for  any  director  nominee  to  be  eligible  for  election  at  any  annual  general  or  special  meeting  of  the 
Providence Shareholders.
The Providence Advance Notice Provisions provide that advance notice to Providence must be made in 
circumstances  where  nominations  of  persons  for  election  to  the  Providence  Board  are  made  by 
Providence Shareholders other than pursuant to: (i) a “proposal” made in accordance with Division 7 of 
Part  5  of  the  BCBCA;  or  (ii)  a  requisition  of  the  Providence  Shareholders  made  in  accordance  with 
section 167 of the BCBCA.
Among other things, the Advance Notice Provisions fix a deadline by which holders of Providence Shares 
must  submit  director  nominations  to  Providence  prior  to  any  annual  or  special  meeting  of  Providence 
Shareholders and sets forth the specific information that a Providence Shareholder must include in the 
written  notice  to  the  secretary  of  Providence  for  an  effective  nomination  to  occur.  No  person  will  be 
eligible for election as a director of Providence unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of the 
Providence Advance Notice Provisions.
In the case of an annual meeting of Providence Shareholders, notice to Providence must be made not less 
than 30 days or more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the 
event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the 
first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice may be made not later than 
the close of business on the 10th day following such public announcement.
In the case of a special meeting (which is not also an annual meeting) of Providence Shareholders, notice 
to Providence must be made not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on 
which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made.
The  Providence  Board  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  waive  any  requirement  of  the  Providence  Advance 
Notice Provisions.
As  contemplated  by  Providence’s  current  Articles  and  in  accordance  with  the  BCBCA,  Providence 
Shareholders will be asked to consider and if thought fit, approve the adoption of the Providence Advance 
Notice Provisions by Special Resolution as set forth below:
- 40 -
“IT IS RESOLVED, as a special resolution that:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
the  Advance  Notice  Provisions  (the  “Advance  Notice  Provisions”)  adopted  by 
Providence effective September 25, 2014 be ratified, confirmed and approved;
the Articles of the Company be altered by adding the text substantially as set forth in the 
Joint  Information  Circular  of  Providence  dated  March  4,  2015  to  the  Articles  of 
Providence;
the board of directors (the “Board”) of Providence is authorized in its absolute discretion 
to administer the Advance Notice Provisions and amend or modify the Advance Notice 
Provisions in accordance with their terms and conditions to the extent needed to reflect 
changes  required  by  securities  regulatory  agencies  or  stock  exchanges,  so  as  to  meet 
industry standards;
the Board reserves the right to abandon the Advance Notice Provisions should they deem 
it appropriate and in the best interests of Providence to do so;
Providence  be  authorized  to  revoke  this  resolution  and  abandon  or  terminate  the 
alteration of the Articles of Providence if the Board deems it appropriate and in the best 
interests of Providence to do so without further confirmation, ratification or approval of 
its shareholders; and
any director or officer of Providence be authorized and directed to do all acts and things 
and to execute and deliver all documents required which, in the opinion of such director 
or officer, may be necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to these resolutions.”
Recommendation of Providence’s Directors
The directors have reviewed and considered all facts respecting the approval of the Providence Advance 
Notice  Provisions  to  the  Articles,  and  the  adoption  of  the  Providence  Advance  Notice  Provisions.  
Providence’s  directors  unanimously  recommend  that  the  shareholders  vote  in  favour  of  approving  the 
adoption of the Providence Advance Notice Provisions.
A Special Resolution requires the approval of a special majority (66 2/3% + one vote) of the votes cast at 
the Providence Meeting, in person or by proxy.
It  is  the  intention  of  the  persons  named  in  the  form  of  Proxy,  if  not  expressly  directed  to  the 
contrary in such Proxy, to vote such proxies FOR the Special Resolution approving the adopting of 
the Providence Advance Notice Provisions.
The  Providence  Board  reserves  the  right  to  abandon  the  Providence  Advance  Notice  Provisions 
Resolution should it deem it appropriate and in the best interests of Providence to do so.
Reduction in Exercise Price of Amalco Options issuable on exchange of Providence Options
Background
Currently, there are 1,825,000 Providence Options held by Insiders having exercise prices ranging from 
$0.13 per Providence Share to $0.30 per Providence Share, exercisable from October 5, 2015 to April 22, 
2018.  Consultants of Providence hold a further 875,000 Providence Options at the same exercise prices.
- 41 -
Assuming  completion  of  the  Amalgamation,  by  virtue  of  the  Providence  stock  option  plan  and  the 
contractual  provisions  of  previously  granted  Providence  Options,  such  options  will  be  deemed  to  be 
governed  by  the  Amalco  Plan.    The  Providence  Exchange  Ratio  will  be  applied  to  all  outstanding 
Providence Options such that the number of Amalco Options (held by former Providence Optionholders) 
will  be  reduced  and  the  exercise  price  will  be  increased.      Assuming  application  of  the  Providence 
Exchange Ratio, the insider Providence Options are as set forth in the following table:

The Providence Board believes the (adjusted) exercise price of the Amalco Options resulting from the 
application of the Providence Exchange Ratio, combined with the reduction in the absolute number of 
options,  would  not  provide  the  appropriate  incentive  to  the  Providence  Optionholders.  Therefore, 
Providence is proposing to amend the exercise price of all 2,400,000 Providence Options such that the 
exercise price will be reduced to: (i) the original exercise price of the Providence Options (without giving 
effect to the Providence Exchange Ratio); or (ii), or, if the original exercise price is less than the average 
closing price of the Amalco Shares over the first five trading days the Amalco Shares trade on the TSX-
V, at an exercise price that is equal to such average closing price.
TSX-V policies require that any reduction in the exercise price of stock options granted to Insiders be 
approved  by  a  simple  majority  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  disinterested  shareholders  at  the  Providence 
Meeting being Providence Shareholders who are not Insiders of Providence entitled to be granted options 
under the Providence Plan, or affiliates or Associates of such Insiders.  The reduction in exercise price of 
the options held by consultants does not require Providence Shareholder approval.
The disinterested Providence Shareholders will be asked to consider and if thought fit, approve the re-
pricing  of  the  Providence  Options  by  Ordinary  Resolution  (the  “Providence  Option  Re-Pricing 
Resolution”) of disinterested shareholders, as set forth below:
- 42 -
“IT IS RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution that:
1.
assuming  the  amalgamation  between  the  Company  and  Desert  Star  is  completed, 
resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  new  company  (“Amalco”),  the  outstanding  1,825,000 
stock  options  held  by  insiders  of  Providence,  as  reduced  to  610,000  stock  options  in 
Amalco on application of the amalgamation ratio, will have their exercise prices adjusted 
(reduced)  to:  (i)  the  original  exercise  price  of  the  Providence  Options  without  giving 
effect  to  the  amalgamation  ratio  (the  “Original  Exercise  Price”);  or  (ii)  if  Original 
Exercise Price is less than the average closing price of the Amalco Shares for the five 
trading days from the date of listing of Amalco’s Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange 
(the “Average Closing Price”), at an exercise price that is equal to the Average Closing 
Price; and
2.
any director or officer of Providence be authorized and directed to do all acts and things 
and to execute and deliver all documents required which, in the opinion of such director 
or officer, may be necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to these resolutions.”
Shareholder Approval
An  Ordinary  Resolution  of  disinterested  Providence  Shareholders  requires  the  approval  of  a  majority 
(50%  +  one  vote)  of  the  votes  cast  at  the  Providence  Meeting,  in  person  or  by  proxy,  excluding 
Providence  Shareholders  who  are  not  Insiders  of  Providence  entitled  to  be  granted  options  under  the 
Providence  Plan,  or  affiliates  or  Associates  of  such  Insiders.  Therefore,  the  votes  attached  to  the 
Providence Shares held by Vince Sorace, Keith Henderson, Steve Bajic, Gavin Cooper and Dan MacNeil 
and  their  respective  Associates  will  be  excluded  from  voting  on  the  Providence  Option  Re-Pricing 
Resolution.
It  is  the  intention  of  the  persons  named  in  the  form  of  Proxy,  if  not  expressly  directed  to  the 
contrary  in  such  Proxy,  to  vote  such  proxies  FOR  the  Ordinary  Resolution  approving  the 
Providence Option Re-Pricing Resolution.
DESERT STAR ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING MATTERS AND DISCLOSURE
Election of Directors
Directors of Desert Star are elected at each annual general meeting and hold office until the next annual 
general meeting or until that person sooner ceases to be a director.  The Desert Star Shareholders will be 
asked to pass an Ordinary Resolution to set the number of directors of Desert Star at four for the next 
year, subject to any increases permitted by Desert Star’s Articles.
Unless you provide other instructions, the enclosed proxy will be voted for the nominees listed below.  
Management does not expect that any of the nominees will be unable to serve as a director.  If before the 
Meeting any vacancies occur in the slate of nominees listed below, the person named in the proxy will 
exercise his or her discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by the proxy for the election of 
any other person or persons as directors.

Executive Compensation
Set out below are particulars of compensation paid to Desert Star’s NEOs.
As at April 30, 2014, the end of Desert Star’s most recently completed financial year, it had three NEOs, 
whose names and positions held within Providence are set out in the summary compensation table below.
Compensation discussion and analysis
Remuneration plays an important role in attracting, motivating, rewarding and retaining knowledgeable 
and  skilled  individuals  to  Desert  Star’s  management  team.  Desert  Star  does  not  have  a  formal 
compensation policy. The main objectives Desert Star hopes to achieve through its compensation are:
•
•
•
•
to attract and retain executives critical to Desert Star’s success, who will be key in helping Desert 
Star achieve its corporate objectives and increase shareholder value;
to motivate Desert Star’s management team to meet or exceed targets;
to  recognize  the  contribution  of  Desert  Star’s  executive  directors  to  the  overall  success  and 
strategic growth of Desert Star; and
to align the interests of management and Desert Star’s shareholders by providing performance-
based compensation in addition to salary.
The Desert Star Board determines an appropriate amount of compensation for its executives, reflecting 
the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and effort expended by the executives while 
taking  into  account  the  financial  and  other  resources  of  Desert  Star.    The  Desert  Star  Board  did  not 
consider the implications of the risks associated with Desert Star compensation practices; however, given 
Desert  Star’s  size  and  nature  of  compensation  provided  to  its  executives  in  the  last  financial  year,  the 
Desert Star Board does not view significant risk that would be likely to have a material adverse effect on 
Desert Star.
Desert  Star’s  management  is  not  permitted  to  purchase  financial  instruments,  including,  for  greater 
certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds that are 
designed  to  hedge  or  offset  a  decrease  in  market  value  of  equity  securities  of  Desert  Star  granted  as 
compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by management.
The  Desert  Star  Board  determines  the  allocation  and  terms  of  any  stock  option  grants.  When  granting 
stock options, the Desert Star Board considers the amount of past options which have been granted.
- 45 -
Option based Awards
The Desert Star Plan, a 10% rolling plan, was first approved at the annual general meeting of Desert Star 
Shareholders  held  on  October  29,  2004,  and  the  Desert  Star  Plan  has  been  approved  by  Desert  Star 
Shareholders  at  each  subsequent  annual  general  meeting,  most  recently  on  December  11,  2013.  The 
Desert Star Plan was amended and restated in August 2006 to incorporate terms of a housekeeping nature 
required  by  the  policies  of  the  TSX-V  and  the  Desert  Star  Plan  was  further  amended  and  restated  in 
December 2010 to include provisions related to Desert Star’s tax withholding and remittance obligations 
on exercise of options by optionees, as a result of revisions made to the Income Tax Act.
Stock options are granted to provide an incentive to the directors, officers, employees and consultants of 
Desert Star to achieve the long-term objectives of Desert Star; to give suitable recognition to the ability 
and industry of such persons who contribute materially to the success of Desert Star; and to attract and 
retain persons of experience and ability, by providing them with the opportunity to acquire and increase 
proprietary interest in Desert Star. Desert Star awards stock options to its executive officers based upon 
the  recommendation  of  the  Desert  Star  Board,  which  recommendation  is  based  upon  the  Desert  Star 
Board’s review of a proposal from the CEO.  Previous grants of incentive stock options are taken into 
account when considering new grants.
The Desert Star Plan is administered by the Desert Star Board, which will have full and final authority 
with respect to the granting of all options thereunder. Options may be granted under the Desert Star Plan 
to such eligible persons as the Desert Star Board may from time to time designate.
For  more  information  on  the  terms  of  the  Desert  Star  Plan  see  below  under  “Annual  Approval  of  the 
Desert Star Plan”. The Desert Star Plan will be adopted by Amalco on completion of the Amalgamation.
Compensation Governance
The Desert Star Board determines an appropriate amount of compensation for its executives, reflecting 
the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and effort expended by the executives while 
taking  into  account  the  financial  and  other  resources  of  Desert  Star.    Desert  Star  does  not  have  a 
Compensation Committee.

Corporate Governance
The  Desert  Star  Board  believes  that  good  corporate  governance  improves  corporate  performance  and 
benefits all shareholders. NP Policy 58-201 provides non-prescriptive guidelines on corporate governance 
practices for reporting issuers such as Providence. In addition, NI 58-101prescribes certain disclosure by 
Desert  Star  of  its  corporate  governance  practices.  The  disclosure  required  by  NI  58-101  is  presented 
below.
1.
Board of Directors
The Desert Star Board facilitates its independent supervision over management through regular meetings 
of the Desert Star Board.  The non-management directors of the Desert Star Board do not hold regularly 
scheduled meetings at which non-independent directors are not in attendance.  However, the size of the 
Desert  Star  Board  and  the  nature  of  Desert  Star’s  operations  ensure  that  open  and  candid  discussion 
among the independent directors is possible.
- 52 -
The independent members of the Desert Star Board are Martin Bajic, Chris Taylor and Keith Henderson.  
The non-independent director is Vince Sorace, the CEO and President of Desert Star.
The  mandate  of  the  Desert  Star  Board,  as  prescribed  by  the  BCBCA,  is  to  manage  or  supervise 
management of the business and affairs of Desert Star and to act with a view to the best interests of Desert 
Star.  In doing so, the Desert Star Board oversees the management of Desert Star’s affairs directly and 
through its committees.
2.

Certain  of  the  directors  of  Desert  Star  are  also  directors  and/or  officers  of  other  reporting  issuers  (or 
equivalent) in a jurisdiction or a foreign jurisdiction as follows:

Orientation and Continuing Education
The  Desert  Star  Board  is  responsible  for  providing  orientation  for  all  new  recruits  to  the  Desert  Star 
Board.    Each  new  director  brings  a  different  skill  set  and  professional  background,  and  with  this 
information, the Desert Star Board is able to determine what orientation to the nature and operations of 
Desert  Star’s  business  will  be  necessary  and  relevant  to  each  new  director.    Desert  Star  provides 
continuing education for its directors as the need arises and encourages open discussion at all meetings, 
which format encourages learning by the directors.
4.
Ethical Business Conduct
The  Desert  Star  Board  relies  on  the  fiduciary  duties  placed  on  individual  directors  by  Desert  Star’s 
governing  corporate  legislation  and  the  common  law  to  ensure  the  Desert  Star  Board  operates 
independently of management and in the best interests of Desert Star.  The Desert Star Board has found 
that  these,  combined  with  the  restrictions  placed  by  applicable  corporate  legislation  on  an  individual 
directors’ participation in decisions of the Desert Star Board in which the director has an interest, have 
been sufficient.
5.
Nomination of Directors
The  Desert  Star  Board  considers  its  size  each  year  when  it  considers  the  number  of  directors  to 
recommend to the shareholders for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. The Desert Star Board 
takes  into  account  the  number  required  to  carry  out  the  Desert  Star  Board’s  duties  effectively  and  to 
maintain a diversity of views and experience.
- 53 -
The Desert Star Board does not have a Nominating Committee.  The Desert Star Board is responsible for 
recruiting new members to the Desert Star Board and planning for the succession of the Desert Star Board 
members.
6.
Compensation
The  Desert  Star  Board  is  responsible  for  determining  all  forms  of  compensation,  including  long-term 
incentive in the form of stock options, to be granted to the CEO of Desert Star and the directors, and for 
reviewing the CEO’s recommendations respecting compensation of the other officers of Desert Star, to 
ensure  such  arrangements  reflect  the  responsibilities  and  risks  associated  with  each  position.    When 
determining the compensation of its officers, the Desert Star Board considers:(i) recruiting and retaining 
executives critical to the success of Desert Star and the enhancement of shareholder value; (ii) providing 
fair  and  competitive  compensation;  (iii)  balancing  the  interests  of  management  and  the  Desert  Star 
Shareholders; (iv) rewarding performance, both on an individual basis and with respect to operations in 
general; and (v) permitted compensation under TSX-V rules.
7.
Other Board Committees
The Desert Star Board has appointed an Audit Committee, the members of which are Martin Bajic, Chris 
Taylor and Keith Henderson.  A description of the function of the Audit Committee can be found in this 
Joint Information Circular under “Desert Star Annual General Meeting Matters and Disclosure - Audit 
Committee”.  The Desert Star Board does not have any other committees.
8.
Assessments
The Desert Star Board annually reviews its own performance and effectiveness  as  well  as reviews the 
Audit  Committee  Charter  and  recommends  revisions  as  necessary.    Neither  Desert  Star  nor the  Desert 
Star Board has adopted formal procedures to regularly assess the Desert Star Board, the Audit Committee 
or  the  individual  directors  as  to  their  effectiveness  and  contribution.    Effectiveness  is  subjectively 
measured by comparing actual corporate results with stated objectives.  The contributions of individual 
directors are informally monitored by the other Board members, bearing in mind the business strengths of 
the individual and the purpose of originally nominating the individual to the Desert Star Board.
The Desert Star Board monitors the adequacy of information given to directors, communication between 
the Desert Star Board and management and the strategic direction and processes of the Desert Star Board 
and its committees.
The Desert Star Board believes its corporate governance practices are appropriate and effective for Desert 
Star,  given  its  size  and  operations.    Desert  Star’s  corporate  governance  practice  allows  Desert  Star  to 
operate  efficiently,  with  checks  and  balances  that  control  and  monitor  management  and  corporate 
functions without excessive administrative burden.
Management Contracts
The management functions of Desert Star are not to any substantial degree performed by any person other 
than the executive officers and directors of Desert Star.
Annual Approval of Stock Option Plan
The TSX-V policy requires that rolling stock option plans that set the number of shares issuable under the 
plan at a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding shares from time to time must be approved and 
ratified  by  shareholders  and  submitted  to  the  TSX-V  for  approval  on  an  annual  basis.  Desert  Star 
Shareholders will be asked at the Desert Star Meeting to give annual approval to the Desert Star Plan.
- 54 -
The  Desert  Star  Plan  is  a  rolling  plan  pursuant  to  which  the  aggregate  number  of  Desert  Star  Shares 
reserved for issuance under the Desert Star Plan and Desert Star Shares reserved for issuance under any 
other share compensation arrangement granted or made available by Desert Star from time to time may 
not exceed in aggregate 10% of the Desert Star Shares issued and outstanding at the time of grant. The 
term of any options granted under the Desert Star Plan will be fixed by the Desert Star Board and may not 
exceed five years. The exercise price of options granted under the Desert Star Plan will be determined by 
the Desert Star Board, provided that it is not less than the lowest price permitted by the TSX-V.
Any options granted pursuant to the Desert Star Plan will terminate within 90 days of the option holder 
ceasing  to  be  eligible  under  the  Desert  Star  Plan,  other  than  an  optionee  providing  investor  relations 
services to Desert Star, in which case the options terminate within 30 days of the option holder ceasing to 
act in such capacity, unless such cessation is on account of death.
If such cessation is on account of death, the options terminate on the first anniversary of such cessation. 
The  Desert  Star  Plan  also  provides  for  adjustments  to  outstanding  options  in  the  event  of  any 
consolidation,  subdivision,  conversion  or  exchange  of  Desert  Star’s  shares.  The  Desert  Star  Plan  is 
administered by the Desert Star Board.
As of the date of this Joint Information Circular, options to acquire up to 2,775,000 Desert Star Shares 
were  outstanding  and  held  by  directors  and  officers  of,  and  consultants  to,  Desert  Star.  Based  on  the 
issued  and  outstanding  capital  of  Desert  Star  at  the  date  of  this  Joint  Information  Circular,  options  to 
purchase an additional 1,524,112 common shares are available to be granted pursuant to the Desert Star 
Plan.  See  “Desert  Star  Annual  General  Meeting  Matters  and  Disclosure–  Securities  Authorized  for 
Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans”.
A copy of the Desert Star Plan will be available for viewing by any Desert Star Shareholder so entitled at 
the registered office of Desert Star at Suite 1000 – 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7X 
1S8,  and  the  head  office  at  Suite  717  -  1030  West  Georgia  Street,  Vancouver,  BC,  V6E  2Y3  during 
normal business hours prior to the meeting date, as well as at the meeting to which this Joint Information 
Circular relates.

Confirmation and Approval of Advance Notice Provisions
Background
On  September  25,  2014,  the  Desert  Star  Board  adopted  advance  notice  provisions  (the  “Desert  Star 
Advance Notice Provisions”) with immediate effect, as disclosed by press release dated September 25, 
2014. A copy of the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions is available for reviewing at Desert Star’s 
head office at Suite 717 – 1030 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C. V6E 2Y3, during normal business 
hours.
If the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution is not approved, in order for the Desert Star Advance Notice 
Provisions to remain in effect following termination of the Desert Star Meeting, the Desert Star Advance 
Notice  Provisions  must  be  ratified,  confirmed  and  approved  by  the  Desert  Star  Meeting.  Amalco’s 
Articles  will  include  advance  notice  provisions  in  the  same  form  as  the  Desert  Star  Advance  Notice 
Provisions.
Advance Notice Provisions
Subject to authorization and approval by Desert Star Shareholders, Desert Star’s Articles are proposed to 
be amended by adding the following Article 10.9 after Article 10.8 and before Article 11:
“10.9  Advance Notice for Nomination of Directors.
(1)
Subject only to the Business Corporations Act and these Articles, only persons who are 
nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as 
directors of the Company. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at 
any annual meeting of shareholders, or at any special meeting of shareholders called for 
the  purpose  of  electing  directors  as  set  forth  in  the  Company’s  notice  of  such  special 
meeting,  may  be  made  (i)  by  or  at  the  direction  of  the  board  of  directors,  including 
pursuant  to  a  notice  of  meeting,  (ii)  by  or  at  the  direction  or  request  of  one  or  more 
shareholders  pursuant  to  a  proposal  made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
Business Corporations Act, or a requisition of the shareholders made in accordance with 
the  provisions  of  the  Business  Corporations  Act  or,  (iii)  by  any  shareholder  of  the 
Company (a “Nominating Shareholder”) who, at the close of business on the date of the 
giving of the notice provided for below in this Article 10.9 and on the record date for 
notice of such meeting, is entered in the securities  register as a  holder of one or  more 
shares carrying the right to vote at such meeting or who beneficially owns shares that are
(a)
(b)
(c)
- 56 -
entitled to be voted at such meeting, and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set 
forth in this Article 10.9.
In  addition  to  any  other  applicable  requirements,  for  a  nomination  to  be  made  by  a 
Nominating  Shareholder,  such  person  must  have  given  timely  notice  thereof  in  proper 
written  form  to  the  secretary  at  the  principal  executive  offices  of  the  Company  in 
accordance with this Article 10.9.
To be timely, a Nominating Shareholder’s notice must be received by the secretary of the 
Company (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 30 days or more than 65 days 
prior to the date of the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the 
event that the annual meeting of shareholders is to be held on a date that is less than 50 
days  after  the  date  on  which  the  first  public  announcement  of  the  date  of  the  annual 
meeting  was  made  (the  “Meeting  Notice  Date”),  the  Nominating  Shareholder’s  notice 
must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the 
Meeting Notice Date; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is 
not also an annual meeting) called for the purpose of electing directors (whether or not 
called for other purposes), not later than the close of business on the 15th day following 
the day on which public announcement of the date of the special meeting is first made. In 
no  event  shall  the  public  announcement  of  an  adjournment  of  an  annual  meeting  or 
special  meeting  commence  a  new  time  period  for  the  giving  of  a  Nominating 
Shareholder’s notice as described in this Article 10.9.
To be in proper written form, a Nominating Shareholder’s notice must set forth: (i) as to 
each person whom the Nominating Shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a 
director (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (B) the 
principal occupation or employment of the person, (C) the class or series and number of 
shares of the Company that are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (D) any 
other  information  relating  to  the  person  that  would  be  required  to  be  disclosed  in  a 
dissident’s  proxy  circular  in  connection  with  solicitations  of  proxies  for  election  of 
directors pursuant to the Business Corporations Act and Applicable Securities Laws; and 
(ii) as to the Nominating Shareholder giving the notice, any proxy, contract, arrangement, 
understanding or relationship pursuant to which such Nominating Shareholder has a right 
to vote any shares of the Company and any other information relating to such Nominating 
Shareholder  that  would  be  required  to  be  made  in  a  dissident’s  proxy  circular  in 
connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to the Business 
Corporations  Act  and  Applicable  Securities  Laws.  The  Company  may  require  any 
proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the 
Corporation  to  determine  the  eligibility  of  such  proposed  nominee  to  serve  as  an 
independent  director  of  the  Company  or  that  could  be  material  to  a  reasonable 
shareholder’s  understanding  of  the  independence,  or  lack  thereof,  of  such  proposed 
nominee.  The  Nominating  Shareholder’s  notice  must  be  accompanied  by  a  written 
consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director 
if elected.
(d)
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Company unless nominated in 
accordance  with  the  procedures  set  forth  in  this  Article  10.9;  provided,  however,  that 
nothing in this Article 10.9 shall be deemed to preclude a shareholder from discussing (as 
distinct from nominating directors) at a meeting of shareholders any matter in respect of 
which  the  shareholder  would  have  been  entitled  to  submit  a  proposal  pursuant  to  the 
provisions  of  the  Business  Corporations  Act.  The  chair  of  the  meeting  shall  have  the 
power  and  duty  to  determine  whether  a  nomination  was  made  in  accordance  with  the
- 57 -
(e)
(f)
procedures set forth in the foregoing provisions and, if any proposed nomination is not in 
compliance  with  such  foregoing  provisions,  to  declare  that  such  defective  nomination 
shall be disregarded.
For purposes of this Article 10.9, (i) “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a 
press  release  disseminated  by  a  nationally  recognized  news  service  in  Canada,  or  in  a 
document publicly filed by the Company under its profile on the System of Electronic 
Document  Analysis  and  Retrieval  at  www.sedar.com;  and  (ii)  “Applicable  Securities 
Laws” means the applicable securities legislation in each relevant province and territory 
of  Canada,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  the  rules,  regulations  and  forms  made  or 
promulgated under any such statute and the published national instruments, multilateral 
instruments,  policies,  bulletins  and  notices  of  the  securities  commission  and  similar 
regulatory authority of each province and territory of Canada.
Notice given to the secretary of the Company pursuant to this Article 10.9 may only be 
given by personal delivery, facsimile transmission or by email (at such email address as 
stipulated from time to time by the secretary of the Company for purposes of this notice), 
and shall be deemed to have been given and made only at the time it is served by personal 
delivery, email (at the address aforesaid) or sent by facsimile transmission (provided the 
receipt  of  confirmation  of  such  transmission  has  been  received)  to  the  secretary  at  the 
address of the principal executive offices of the Company; provided that if such delivery 
or electronic communication is made on a day which is not a business day or later than 
5:00  p.m.  (Vancouver  time)  on  a  day  which  is  a  business  day,  then  such  delivery  or 
electronic communication shall be deemed to have been on the subsequent day that is a 
business day.
(g)
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  board  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  waive  any 
requirement in this Article 10.9.”.
Purpose of the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions
The change proposed to Desert Star’s existing Articles is its adoption of advance notice provisions (the 
“Advance Notice Provisions”) for the nomination of directors of Desert Star at a shareholder meeting. 
The Desert Star Board believes it appropriate for the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions to be added 
to the current Articles.  Desert Star’s directors are committed to: (a) facilitating an orderly and efficient 
annual  general  or,  where  the  need  arises,  special  meeting,  process;  (b)  ensuring  that  all  shareholders 
receive  adequate  notice  of  the  director  nominations  and  sufficient  information  with  respect  to  all 
nominees;  and  (c)  allowing  shareholders  to  register an  informed  vote  having been  afforded  reasonable 
time for appropriate deliberation.
The  purpose  of  the  Desert  Star  Advance  Notice  Provisions  is  to provide  the Desert  Star  Shareholders, 
directors  and  management  with  a  clear  framework  for  nominating  directors.  The  Desert  Star  Advance 
Notice Provisions fix a deadline by which holders of Desert Star Shares must submit director nominations 
to  Desert  Star  prior  to  any  annual  general  or  special  meeting  of  shareholders  and  sets  forth  the 
information  that  a  Desert  Star  Shareholder  must  include  in  the  notice  to  Desert  Star  in  order  for  any 
director nominee to be eligible for election at any annual general or special meeting of the Desert Star 
Shareholders.
The Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions provide that advance notice to Desert Star must be made in 
circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the Desert Star Board are made by Desert Star 
Shareholders other than pursuant to: (i) a “proposal” made in accordance with Division 7 of Part 5 of the 
BCBCA; or (ii) a requisition of the shareholders made in accordance with section 167 of the BCBCA.
- 58 -
Among other things, the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions fix a deadline by which holders of Desert 
Star Shares  must submit  director nominations to Desert Star prior to any annual or special  meeting of 
shareholders  and sets forth the specific information that a  Desert Star Shareholder  must include in the 
written  notice  to  the  secretary  of  Desert  Star  for  an  effective  nomination  to  occur.  No  person  will  be 
eligible for election as a director of Desert Star unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of the 
Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions.
In the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, notice to Desert Star must be made not less than 30 days 
or more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the 
annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public 
announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice may be made not later than the close of 
business on the 10th day following such public announcement.
In the case of a special meeting (which is not also an annual meeting) of Desert Star Shareholders, notice 
to Desert Star must be made not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on 
which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made.
The  Desert  Star  Board  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  waive  any  requirement  of  the  Desert  Star  Advance 
Notice Provisions.
As  contemplated  by  Desert  Star’s  current  Articles  and  in  accordance  with  the  BCBCA,  Desert  Star 
Shareholders will be asked to consider and if thought fit, approve the adoption of the Desert Star Advance 
Notice Provisions by Special Resolution as set forth below:
“IT IS RESOLVED, as a special resolution that:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
the  Advance  Notice  Provisions  (the  “Advance  Notice  Provisions”)  adopted  by  Desert 
Star effective September 25, 2014 be ratified, confirmed and approved;
the Articles of the Company be altered by adding the text substantially as set forth in the 
Joint Information Circular of Desert Star dated March 4, 2015 to the Articles of Desert 
Star;
the board of directors (the “Board”) of Desert Star is authorized in its absolute discretion 
to administer the Advance Notice Provisions and amend or modify the Advance Notice 
Provisions in accordance with their terms and conditions to the extent needed to reflect 
changes  required  by  securities  regulatory  agencies  or  stock  exchanges,  so  as  to  meet 
industry standards;
the Board reserves the right to abandon the Advance Notice Provisions should they deem 
it appropriate and in the best interests of Desert Star to do so;
Desert  Star  be  authorized  to  revoke  this  resolution  and  abandon  or  terminate  the 
alteration of the Articles of Desert Star if the Board deems it appropriate and in the best 
interests of Desert Star to do so without further confirmation, ratification or approval of 
its shareholders; and
any director or officer of Desert Star is authorized and directed to do all acts and things 
and to execute and deliver all documents required which, in the opinion of such director 
or officer, may be necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to these resolutions.”
- 59 -
Recommendation of Desert Star’s Directors
The directors have reviewed and considered all facts respecting the approval of the Desert Star Advance 
Notice Provisions to the Articles, and the adoption of the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions.  Desert 
Star’s directors unanimously recommend that the shareholders vote in favour of approving the adoption of 
the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions.
A Special Resolution requires the approval of a special majority (66 2/3% + one vote) of the votes cast at 
the Desert Star Meeting, in person or by proxy.
It  is  the  intention  of  the  persons  named  in  the  form  of  Proxy,  if  not  expressly  directed  to  the 
contrary in such Proxy, to vote such proxies FOR the Special Resolution approving the adopting of 
the Desert Star Advance Notice Provisions.
The  Desert  Star  Board  reserves  the  right  to  abandon  the  Desert  Star  Advance  Notice  Provisions 
Resolution should it deem it appropriate and in the best interests of Desert Star to do so.
THE AMALGAMATION
Approval of Providence Amalgamation Resolution and Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution
At  the  Desert  Star  Meeting,  Desert  Star  Shareholders  will  be  asked  to  approve  the  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation  Resolution,  the  text  of  which  is  set  out  in  Schedule  “J”.  At  the  Providence  Meeting, 
Providence Shareholders will be asked to approve the Providence Amalgamation Resolution, the text of 
which is set out in Schedule “K”.
Background of the Amalgamation
The  Amalgamating  Companies  have  expressed  their  intention  to  amalgamate  and  continue  as  one 
corporation under the provincial jurisdiction of British Columbia. In order to effect the Amalgamation as 
proposed,  the  Desert  Star  Board  and  the  Providence  Board  unanimously  agreed  that,  conditional  upon 
Shareholder and TSX-V approval of the proposed Amalgamation, the Amalgamating Companies would 
take the necessary steps to amalgamate pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA.
Each of the Amalgamating Companies has determined that the Amalgamation is in the best interests of its 
shareholders.
The Amalgamating Companies entered into the Letter Agreement on November 26, 2014.  Pursuant to the 
Letter Agreement, Providence agreed to advance Desert Star the Loan of $250,000, which Loan will be 
fully  refundable  to  Providence  within  30  business  days  if  the  Amalgamation  does  not  complete.  The 
TSX-V approved the Loan and Province advanced $250,000 to Desert Star. The Letter Agreement was 
superceded and replaced by the Arrangement Agreement, which incorporated the terms and conditions 
contemplated in the Letter Agreement as well as other customary terms and conditions for an agreement 
of its nature.
As  Desert  Star  and  Providence  have  directors  and  members  of  management  in  common,  each  of  the 
independent  members  of  the  Desert  Star  Board  and  the  Providence  Board  considered  the  terms  of  the 
proposed Amalgamation. The independent members of the Desert Star Board are Martin Bajic and Chris 
Taylor, as both Martin Bajic and Chris Taylor are not members of the Providence Board. The independent 
member of the Providence Board is Steve Bajic, as Steve Bajic is not a member of the Desert Star Board. 
Each of the Amalgamating Companies engaged a qualified independent financial advisor to assist in its 
deliberations.  The  mandate  of  the  independent  financial  advisors  included  determining  the  appropriate 
ratio for the exchange of Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares for Amalco Shares and providing an
- 60 -
opinion  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  proposed  Amalgamation.  Desert  Star  engaged  the  services  of  Ross 
Glanville  &  Associates  Ltd.  to  prepare  the  Glanville  Fairness  Opinion  and  Providence  engaged  the 
services of Bruce McKnight Minerals Advisor Services to prepare the McKnight Fairness Opinion.
In  addition  to  reviewing  the  Fairness  Opinions,  the  Desert  Star  Board  and  Providence  Board  also  met 
formally and informally on a number of occasions to consider the proposed Amalgamation and certain 
matters related thereto including to discuss the advice provided by legal counsel; to examine the business 
and  financial  condition  of  each  of  the  Amalgamating  Companies;  to  consider  the  proposed  terms  and 
conditions of the Amalgamation; and to review all other documents and information that the Desert Star 
Board and Providence Board, in consultation with legal counsel, considered relevant in order to make a 
recommendation to its Shareholders.
Through  this  deliberation  and  consultation  process,  each  of  the  Desert  Star  Board  and  the  Providence 
Board  unanimously  determined  that  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that:  (i)  each 
Amalgamating  Company  is  and  Amalco  will  be  able to  pay  its  liabilities  as  they  become  due;  (ii)  the 
realizable value of Amalco’s assets will not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and stated capital of 
its  share  capital;  (iii)  no  creditor  will  be  prejudiced  by  the  Amalgamation;  and  (iv)  no  minority 
shareholders will be adversely affected or unfairly prejudiced by the Amalgamation.
Based  on  the  above  considerations  and  the  fact  that  there  will  be  no  change  of  control  following  the 
Amalgamation, each of the Desert Star Board and the Providence Board is unanimously recommending 
that Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders vote in favour of each of the resolutions set 
forth in this Joint Information Circular.
Note that the foregoing list of factors considered by the each of the Desert Star Board and the Providence 
Board is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the number of factors considered in connection with the 
evaluation  of  the  Amalgamation  and  other  related  matters,  each  of  the  Desert  Star  Board  and  the 
Providence  Board  did  not  find  it  practicable  to,  and  did  not,  quantify  or  otherwise  attempt  to  assign 
relative  weight  to  specific  factors  in  reaching  its  determinations.  In  addition, different  members  of  the 
Desert Star Board and the Providence Board may have given different weight to different factors.
Reasons for the Amalgamation
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Desert Star and Providence agreed that:
1.
2.
3.
they would amalgamate to form Amalco;
holders of Desert Star Shares would receive one Amalco Share for each Desert Star Share held; 
and
holders of Providence Shares would each receive 0.4 Amalco Share and 0.4 Amalco Warrant for 
each Providence Share held.
The parties subsequently entered into the Arrangement Agreement. The business combination between 
Desert Star and Providence pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement was negotiated on the basis that the 
shareholders of the respective companies would benefit from the combination of the cash of Desert Star 
and  Providence  and  the  mineral  properties  and  the  reduced  administrative  and  regulatory  costs  of 
operating one rather than two public companies.
The amalgamation of Desert Star and Providence is a good strategic fit as both companies share several 
individuals  who  comprise  their  management  and  exploration  teams.  The  amalgamation  exploits  an 
opportunity to combine the prospective assets of Desert Star with the cash position of Providence.  The 
combined entity will result in a unified strategic focus and will be well-positioned to continue developing
- 61 -

Arrangement Agreement
General
The Amalgamating Companies entered into the Arrangement Agreement, which is dated for reference as 
of  February  27,  2015.  Pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  on  the  effective  date  of  the 
Amalgamation, Providence and Desert Star will amalgamate pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA. 
The Arrangement Agreement includes the following terms and conditions:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
The name of Amalco shall be “Desert Star Resources Ltd.” or such other name as approved by 
the TSX-V and the directors of Amalco;
The  authorized  capital  of  the  Amalco  shall  consist  of  an  unlimited  number  of  common  shares 
without par value;
On  the  Effective  Date  of  the  Amalgamation,  each  Providence  Shareholder  (other  than  an 
Providence Shareholder who exercised Providence Dissent Rights) will receive 0.4 Amalco Share 
and 0.4 Amalco Warrant for every one Providence Share held; and each Desert Star Shareholder 
(other than a Desert Star Shareholder who exercised Desert Star Dissent Rights) will receive one 
(1) Amalco Shares for every one Desert Star Shares held;
The Form 13 – Amalgamation Application and the Articles of Amalco are as set out in Appendix 
“A” and “B” to the plan of arrangement attached to the Arrangement Agreement;
The first directors of Amalco will be Vince Sorace, Keith Henderson, Chris Taylor and Gavin 
Cooper;
The first officers of Amalco will be Vince Sorace (President and CEO), Gavin Cooper (CFO and 
Corporate Secretary) and Dan MacNeil (VP Exploration).
In  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  the  Amalgamating  Companies  also  provide  representations  and 
warranties to one another regarding certain customary commercial matters, including corporate, legal and 
other  matters,  relating  to  their  respective  affairs.  All  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  the 
Amalgamation and the transactions contemplated thereby will be shared equally.
Under  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  Desert  Star  has  agreed  to  seek  the  approval  of  the  Desert  Star 
Shareholders  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated  thereunder.  Under  the
- 62 -
BCBCA, Desert Star must obtain the approval of the Desert Star shareholders to the Amalgamation by 
Special  Resolution.  The  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by  disinterested 
shareholders  in  accordance  with  TSX-V  policies  as  the  Amalgamation  is  a  Non-Arm’s  Length  Party 
Transaction  because  it  involves  Non-Arm’s  Length  Parties.  Therefore,  the  votes  attached  to  1,207,457 
Desert Star Shares will be excluded from voting on the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution because 
they represent shares held by Vince Sorace, Keith Henderson, Gavin Cooper and their Associates.  Vince 
Sorace, Keith Henderson and Gavin Cooper are Non-Arm’s Length parties to the Amalgamation, as they  
are directors and/or officers of each of the Amalgamating Companies.
Desert Star has agreed to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all necessary shareholder and 
regulatory approvals.
The  Desert  Star  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  is  not  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101  for  several  reasons  including  that  no 
director  or  officer  of  Desert  Star,  is  entitled  to  receive,  directly  or  indirectly,  as  a  consequence  of  the 
transaction a collateral benefit. As MI 61-101 does not apply to the Amalgamation, Desert Star will not be 
required to obtain a formal valuation in connection with the Amalgamation or have the Amalgamation 
approved by a majority of the minority of the Desert Star Shareholders.
Under  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  Providence  has  agreed  to  seek  the  approval  of  Providence 
Shareholders  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated  thereunder.  Under  the 
BCBCA, Providence must obtain the approval of the Providence shareholders to the Amalgamation by 
Special  Resolution.  The  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by  disinterested 
shareholders  in  accordance  with  TSX-V  policies  as  the  Amalgamation  is  a  Non-Arm’s  Length  Party 
Transaction  because  it  involves  Non-Arm’s  Length  Parties.  Therefore,  the  votes  attached  to  812,000 
Providence Shares held by Vince Sorace, Gavin Cooper and their Associates will be excluded from voting 
on  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution.  Vince  Sorace  and  Gavin  Cooper  are  Non-Arm’s  Length 
Parties to the Amalgamation because Vince Sorace is a director and officer of each of the Amalgamating 
Companies and Gavin Cooper is an officer of each of the Amalgamating Companies.
Providence has agreed to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all necessary shareholder and 
regulatory approvals.
The  Providence  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  may  be  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101.    Any  previously  granted  Providence 
Options will, by virtue of the Providence stock option plan and the contractual provisions of the options, 
be deemed to be issued under and governed by the Amalco Plan.  At the Providence Meeting, Providence 
will  be  seeking  certain  adjustment  (reduction)  to  the  exercise  price  of  the  former  Providence  Options, 
once converted to Amalco Options.  Therefore, the reduction in exercise price of the Amalco Options may 
be considered a “collateral benefit” as that term is defined in MI 61-101. MI 61-101 expressly excludes 
benefits from being “collateral benefits” if such benefits are received solely in connection with the related 
party’s  services  as  an  employee,  director  or  consultant  under  certain  circumstances,  the  benefits  are 
disclosed  in  the  disclosure  document  for  the  transaction,  and  either:  (a)  at  the  time  the  transaction  is 
agreed  to,  the  related  party  and  its  associated  entities  (as  defined  in  MI  61-  101)  beneficially  own,  or 
exercise control or direction over, less than 1% of the outstanding equity securities (being, in the case of 
Providence, the Providence Shares); or (b) an independent committee of directors determines, acting in 
good faith, that the value of the benefits received by a related  party, net of any offsetting costs to the 
related party, is less than 5% of the value the related party expects to receive pursuant to the transaction, 
provided that the independent committee’s determination is disclosed in this Joint Information Circular.
Steve  Bajic,  the  director  of  Providence  who  is  an  Arm’s  Length  Party  to  the  Amalgamation,  has 
determined that the fair value of the applicable benefits, net of offsetting costs, to be received by each of
- 63 -
Vince Sorace and Keith Henderson, as a result of receiving Amalco Options with a reduced exercise price 
(assuming receipt of the required Providence Shareholder approval and TSX-V approval), is less than 5% 
of the value of consideration to be received by each of them pursuant to the Amalgamation in exchange 
for the Providence Shares beneficially owned by each of them and their associated entities.  Accordingly, 
each of Vince Sorace and Keith Henderson will not be considered to have received a “collateral benefit” 
under MI 61-101 as a result of receiving Amalco Options with a reduced exercise price.
Although the Amalgamation may be considered a “business combination” under MI 61-101, it does not 
fall under the categories of transactions that require a “formal valuation” under MI 61-101.
Until the closing of the Amalgamation, the Companies have each agreed, among other things, to conduct 
their respective businesses in the ordinary course, consistent with existing practice, and not to incur any 
obligation,  expenditures  or  liability,  other  than  those  relating  to  the  maintenance  of  their  corporate 
existence, the Amalgamation and the Meetings, except with the written consent of other parties.
A copy of the Arrangement Agreement including the Plan of Arrangement has been filed on each of 
Desert Star’s and Providence’s company profiles on the System of Electronic Document Analysis 
and Retrieval at www.sedar.com and can be found at www.sedar.com.
Termination
The  Arrangement  Agreement  may  be  terminated  at  any  time  prior  to  the  Effective  Date,  in  the 
circumstances  specified  in  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  including  if  the  conditions  precedent  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement are not fulfilled, performed or waived by the party to whom they are of benefit 
or  if  the  Desert  Star  Shareholders  fail  to  approve  the  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  the 
Providence Shareholders fail to approve the Providence Amalgamation Resolution.
Amendment
Each of the Amalgamating Companies may, by a resolution of their respective directors, assent to any 
alteration  or  modification  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  without  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  the 
respective companies, as the Registrar under the BCBCA may require and all alterations or modifications 
so assented to shall be binding upon the Amalgamating Companies.

resulting from conditions affecting the mineral exploration industry in jurisdictions which Desert

Effect of the Amalgamation Upon Shareholders
As a result of the Amalgamation, Desert Star Shareholders will receive one Amalco Share for each one 
Desert  Star  Share  held  and  Providence  Shareholders  will  receive  0.4  Amalco  Share  and  0.4  Amalco 
Warrant for each one Providence Share held. Each Amalco Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire an 
additional Amalco Share for a period of two years at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Share
Amalco will hold all of the assets of Desert Star and Providence. It is expected that the issued capital of 
Amalco  following  completion  of  the  Amalgamation  will  consist  of  approximately  51,633,317  Amalco 
Shares,  44,229,043 Amalco Warrants and 3,735,000 Amalco Options.
On  such  a  basis,  Desert  Star  Shareholders  will  own  approximately  83%  of  Amalco  and  Providence 
Shareholders will own approximately 17% of Amalco.
An  application  has  been  made  to  have  the  Amalco  Shares  listed  on  the  TSX-V.  See  Schedule  “C” 
Information Concerning Amalco for disclosure about the operations of Amalco.

Recommendations of the Directors
Desert Star
The Desert Star Board has reviewed the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement and 
the transactions contemplated thereunder and has received the Glanville Fairness Opinion and has 
concluded that the Amalgamation is fair to the Desert Star Shareholders from a financial point of 
view and in the best interests of Desert Star. The Desert Star Board therefore recommends that the 
Desert Star Shareholders vote in favour of the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution and any other 
related resolutions proposed by the Desert Star Board as set out in the Notice of Meeting.
Providence
The Providence Board has reviewed the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement and 
the  transactions  contemplated  thereunder  and  has  received  the  McKnight  Fairness  Opinion  and 
has concluded that the Amalgamation is fair to the Providence Shareholders from a financial point 
of view and in the best interests of Providence. The Providence Board therefore recommends that 
the Providence Shareholders vote in favour of the Providence Amalgamation Resolution and any 
related resolutions proposed by the Providence Board as set out in the Notice of Meeting.
In arriving at its conclusion, each of the Desert Star Board and the Providence Board considered, among 
other matters:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)
the benefits of combining the Amalgamating Companies’ cash and assets;
The elimination of duplicate administrative and regulatory costs of operating two public 
companies;
information  with  respect  to  the  financial  condition,  business  and  operations,  on  both  a 
historical and prospective basis, of Desert Star and Providence including information in 
respect of Desert Star and Providence on a pro forma consolidated basis;
the procedures by which the Amalgamation is to be approved;
the  tax  treatment  of  Desert  Star  Shareholders  and  Providence  Shareholders  under  the 
Amalgamation;
the  availability  of  Dissent  Rights  to  Desert  Star  Shareholders  and  Providence 
Shareholders with respect to the Amalgamation;
the management groups and technical teams of Desert Star and Providence;
the Glanville Fairness Opinion and the McKnight Fairness Opinion;
that  after  the  Amalgamation,  Amalco  will  have  a  significant  asset  base,  and  greater 
combined capitalization and liquidity;
that  through  greater  size  and  diversity, Amalco  will  have  greater  exposure  to  potential 
investment opportunities; and
(k)
that Amalco will have enhanced share trading liquidity.
- 69 -
The Desert Star Board also identified disadvantages associated with the Arrangement Agreement and the 
transactions  contemplated  thereunder,  including  the  fact  that  the  Desert  Star  Shareholders  after  the 
Amalgamation will be subject to:
(a)
(b)
the  risk  factors  applicable  to  Amalco.  See  “The  Amalgamation  -  Amalgamation  Risk 
Factors”; and
the possibility that there may be adverse tax consequences to certain holders of securities 
of Desert Star. See “Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
The Providence Board also identified disadvantages associated with the Arrangement Agreement and the 
transactions  contemplated  thereunder,  including  the  fact  that  the  Providence  Shareholders  after  the 
Amalgamation will be subject to:
(a)
(b)
the  risk  factors  applicable  to  Amalco.  See  “The  Amalgamation  -  Amalgamation  Risk 
Factors”; and
the possibility that there may be adverse tax consequences to certain holders of securities 
of Providence. See “Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
Procedure for the Amalgamation to Become Effective
The Amalgamation is proposed to be carried out under Part 9, Division 5 of the BCBCA. The following 
procedural steps must be taken in order for the Amalgamation to become effective:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
the Amalgamation must be approved by the Shareholders in the manner set forth in the 
Interim Order;
all  conditions  precedent  to  the  Amalgamation,  as  set  forth  in  the  Arrangement 
Agreement, must be satisfied or waived;
if  the  Amalgamation  is  approved  by  the  Shareholders  in  the  manner  set  forth  in  the 
Interim  Order,  a  hearing  before  the  Court  must  be  held  to  obtain  the  Final  Order 
approving the Amalgamation; and
if the Final Order is granted by the Court, documents, records and information, including 
a copy of the entered Final Order must be filed with the Registrar as are required under 
the BCBCA in order for the Registrar to give effect to the Amalgamation in conjunction 
with the closing of the Amalgamation.
Amalgamation Risk Factors
There are inherent risks in the business of Amalco. The business of Providence and Desert Star and, upon 
completion of the Amalgamation, the business of Amalco must be considered highly speculative due to 
uncertainty relating to completion of the Amalgamation, the nature of the Arizona Projects, and Amalco’s 
relatively formulative stage of development. Shareholders must rely on the ability, expertise, judgment, 
discretion, integrity and good faith in management of Amalco. There is no guarantee that Amalco will be 
able to secure future financing to meet its future needs on reasonable terms. The business of Amalco will 
be subject to certain operating risks and hazards which are beyond its control.
In  addition  to  the  other  information  in  this  Joint  Information  Circular,  an  investor  should  carefully 
consider each of, and the cumulative effect of, the following risk factors:
- 70 -
Completion of the Amalgamation
The completion of the Amalgamation is subject to several conditions under the Arrangement Agreement. 
See “The Amalgamation – Effective Date and Conditions of Amalgamation”. If any of those conditions 
are not satisfied or waived, the Amalgamation may not be completed which will result in Providence and 
Desert  Star  continuing  operations  as  separate  public  companies  with  significant  duplication  of 
administrative costs.
Limited Liquidity, Need for Additional Financing and Uncertainty of Such Financing
Current  financial  resources  are  able  to  fund  Amalco’s  operations.  However,  Amalco  will  require 
additional financing to conduct exploration programs on its Arizona Projects and other mineral properties 
and  fund  corporate  costs  that  are  beyond  the  current  financial  resources.  There  is  no  assurance  that 
Amalco will be successful in obtaining the required financing either through issuance of common shares, 
divestment  of  properties  or  partnerships.  A  lack  of  financing  would  cause  Amalco  to  postpone  its 
exploration  and  development  plans,  reduce  its  technical  staff,  and  could  necessitate  reducing  mineral 
concessions and/or will cause going concern issues for Amalco.
Political and Economic Changes
The areas in which Amalco will hold mineral interests are located in the United States and Canada and 
Amalco’s mineral exploration activities may be affected by changes in political and economic conditions, 
government regulations relating to the mineral exploration industry and foreign investment therein. Any 
changes  in  regulations  or  shifts  in  political  conditions  are  beyond  the  control  of  Amalco  and  may 
adversely affect its business.
Uninsurable Risks
Amalco may become subject to liability for cave-ins, pollution or other hazards against which it cannot 
insure or against which it may elect not to insure because of high premium costs or for other reasons. The 
payment of any such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration activities. Payment of 
liabilities for which Amalco does not carry insurance may have a material adverse effect on the financial 
position of Amalco.
Foreign Currency
As a result of the Arizona Projects being located in the United States, Amalco’s operations will be located 
principally  in  the  United  States  and  certain  expenses  will  be  incurred  in  U.S.  currency.  This  renders 
Amalco subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may materially change Amalco’s financial position 
and results.
Reliance on Management
Amalco will carry on business in the mineral exploration industry. This industry involves a substantial 
degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be 
able to overcome. Shareholders must rely on the ability, expertise, judgment, direction and integrity of the 
management of Amalco. The success of Amalco is currently largely dependent on the performance of its 
directors and officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect 
on  Amalco’s  business  and  prospects.  There  is  no  assurance  Amalco  can  maintain  the  services  of  its 
directors, officers or other qualified personnel required to operate its business.
- 71 -
Exploration and Development Risks
Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant 
risks including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover 
mineral deposits but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient in quantity 
and quality to return a profit from production. The marketability of minerals acquired or discovered by 
Amalco may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond the control of Amalco and which cannot 
be  accurately  predicted,  such  as  market  fluctuations,  the  proximity  and  capacity  of  milling  facilities, 
mineral markets and processing equipment, and such other factors as government regulations, including 
regulations  relating  to  royalties,  allowable  production,  importing  and  exporting  of  minerals,  and 
environmental  protection,  the  combination  of  which  factors  may  result  in  Amalco  not  receiving  an 
adequate return of investment capital.
There  is  no  assurance  that  Amalco’s  mineral  exploration  and  development  activities  will  result  in  any 
discoveries of commercial bodies of ore. The long-term profitability of Amalco’s operations will in part 
be  directly  related  to  the  costs  and  success  of  its  exploration  programs,  which  may  be  affected  by  a 
number  of  factors.  Substantial  expenditures  are  required  to  establish  reserves  through  drilling  and  to 
develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Although 
substantial benefits may be derived from the discovery of a major mineralized deposit, no assurance can 
be given that minerals will be discovered in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that 
funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis.
If Amalco loses or abandons its interest in the Arizona Projects or any other mineral properties held by 
Amalco, there is no assurance that it will be able to acquire another mineral property of merit.
The Arizona Projects are in the exploration stage only and is without a known body of commercial ore. 
Development of the Arizona Projects would follow only if favourable exploration results are obtained. 
The business of exploration for minerals and mining involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that 
are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.
Permits and Licenses
The future operations of Amalco may require permits from various governmental authorities and will be 
governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, export, taxes, 
labour  standards,  occupational  health, waste  disposal,  land  use,  environmental  protections,  mine  safety 
and other matters. There can be no guarantee that Amalco will be able to obtain all necessary permits and 
approvals that may be required to undertake exploration activity or commence construction or operation 
of mine facilities on Amalco’s properties.
Environmental Legislation
Environmental laws and regulations may affect the operations of Amalco. These laws and regulations set 
various  standards  regulating  certain  aspects  of  health  and  environmental  quality.  They  provide  for 
penalties and other liabilities for the violation of such standards and establish, in certain circumstances, 
obligations  to  rehabilitate  current  and  former  facilities  and  locations  where  operations  are  or  were 
conducted. The permission to operate can be withdrawn temporarily where there is evidence of serious 
breaches of health and safety standards, or even permanently in the case of extreme breaches. Significant 
liabilities could be imposed on Amalco for damages, clean-up costs or penalties in the event of certain 
discharges into the environment, environmental damage caused by previous owners of acquired properties 
or non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In all major developments, Amalco generally 
relies  on  recognized  designers  and  development  contractors,  from  which  Amalco  will,  in  the  first 
instance, seek indemnities. Amalco intends to minimize risks by taking steps to ensure compliance with
- 72 -
environmental,  health  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  and  operating  to  applicable  environmental 
standards.
There  is  a  risk  that  environmental  laws  and  regulations  may  become  more  onerous,  making  Amalco’s 
operations more expensive.
No Assurance of Title to the Properties
The Arizona Projects and other mineral properties held by Amalco could be subject to prior unregistered 
agreements, transfers or claims and title may be affected by undetected defects. Providence and Desert 
Star are satisfied, however, that evidence of title to the Arizona Projects and its other mineral properties is 
adequate and acceptable by prevailing industry standards with respect to the current stage of exploration 
of such properties.
Market Prices
Amalco’s  revenues,  if  any,  are  expected  to  be  in  large  part  derived  from  the  extraction  and  sale  of 
precious  and  base  minerals  and  metals.  Factors  beyond  the  control  of  Amalco  may  affect  the 
marketability  of  metals  discovered,  if  any.  Metal  prices  have  fluctuated  widely,  particularly  in  recent 
years. Consequently, the economic viability of any of Amalco’s exploration projects cannot be accurately 
predicted  and  may  be  adversely  affected  by  fluctuations  in  mineral  prices.  In  addition,  currency 
fluctuations may affect the cash flow which Amalco may realize from its operations, since most mineral 
commodities are sold in a world market in United States dollars.
Competition
The mineral exploration industry is intensely competitive in all its phases. Amalco will compete for the 
proposed transaction of mineral properties, claims, leases and other mineral interests, as well as for the 
recruitment  and  retention  of  qualified  employees  with  many  companies  possessing  greater  financial 
resources  and  technical  facilities  than  Amalco.  The  competition  in  the  mineral  exploration  and 
development business could have an adverse effect on Amalco’s ability to acquire suitable properties or 
prospects for mineral exploration in the future.
No Expected Dividends from Amalco
Providence and Desert Star have not paid dividends to their Shareholders. For the foreseeable future, all 
of Amalco’s available funds will be invested to finance its activities and therefore shareholders cannot 
expect to receive a dividend on Amalco Shares in the foreseeable future.
Conflicts of Interest
Certain of the directors and officers of Amalco will be engaged in, and will continue to engage in, other 
business activities on their own behalf and on behalf of other companies and, as a result of these and other 
activities, such directors and officers of Amalco may become subject to conflicts of interest. The BCBCA 
provides that in the event that a director has an interest in a contract or proposed contract or agreement, 
the director shall disclose his interest in such contract or agreement and shall refrain from voting on any 
matter  in  respect  of  such  contract  or  agreement  unless  otherwise  provided  under  the  BCBCA.  To  the 
extent that conflicts of interest arise, such conflicts will be resolved in accordance with the provisions of 
the BCBCA. To the knowledge of proposed management of Amalco, as at the date hereof there are no 
existing or potential material conflicts of interest between Amalco and a proposed director or officer of 
Amalco except as otherwise disclosed herein.
- 73 -
Volatility of Share Price
As the Amalco Shares will be listed on the TSX-V, factors such as announcements of quarterly variations 
in operating results, or new actions by competitors of Amalco, as well as market conditions in the mining 
industry may have a significant impact on the market price of the Amalco Shares. The stock market has 
from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to 
the  operations  of  particular  companies.  Share  prices  for  several  companies  in  the  mineral  exploration 
industry in particular have experienced wide fluctuations that have been often unrelated to the operations 
of  the  companies  themselves.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  an  active  public  market  will 
develop or be sustained for the Amalco Shares. The market price of the Amalco Shares could be subject 
to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations and operating results of Amalco, changes in 
financial  estimates  by  securities  analysts  or  other  events  or  factors,  many  of  which  will  be  beyond 
Amalco’s control.
Effects of the Amalgamation on Shareholders’ Rights
As a result of the Amalgamation, all Desert Star Shareholders and Providence Shareholders will become 
Amalco Shareholders, unless they exercise Dissent Rights in connection with the Amalgamation. Amalco 
is a British Columbia company governed by the BCBCA and by Amalco’s constating documents.
Conduct of Meeting and Other Approvals
Desert Star Shareholder and Providence Shareholder Approval of the Amalgamation
In order for the Amalgamation to be effected, the BCBCA requires the Arrangement Agreement to be 
approved by the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution and by the Providence Amalgamation Resolution. 
The complete text of the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution to be presented to the Desert Star Meeting 
is  set  forth  in  Schedule  “J”  and  the  complete  text  of  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  to  be 
presented  at  the  Providence  Meeting  is  set  forth  in  Schedule  “K”.  The  Desert  Star  Amalgamation 
Resolution  must  be  approved  by  a  majority  of  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  votes  of  those  Desert  Star 
Shareholders  who  are  present  and  vote  either  in  person  or  by  proxy  at  the  Desert  Star  Meeting.  The 
Providence Amalgamation Resolution must be approved by a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes 
of those disinterested Providence Shareholders who are present and vote either in person or by proxy at 
the Providence Meeting.
The Providence Amalgamation Resolution must be approved by disinterested shareholders in accordance 
with TSX-V policies as the Amalgamation is a Non-Arm’s Length Party Transaction because it involves 
Non-Arm’s Length Parties. Therefore 812,000 Providence Shares held by Vince Sorace, Gavin Cooper 
and their Associates will be excluded from voting on the Providence Amalgamation Resolution. Vince 
Sorace and Gavin Cooper are Non-Arm’s Length Parties to the Amalgamation because Vince Sorace is a 
director and officer of each of the Amalgamating Companies and Gavin Cooper is an officer of each of 
the Amalgamating Companies.
Providence has agreed to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all necessary shareholder and 
regulatory approvals.
The Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution must be approved by disinterested shareholders in accordance 
with TSX-V policies as the Amalgamation is a Non-Arm’s Length Party Transaction because it involves 
Non-Arm’s  Length  Parties.  Therefore  1,207,457  Desert  Star  Shares  held  by  Vince  Sorace,  Keith 
Henderson, Gavin Cooper and their respective Associates will be excluded from voting on the Desert Star 
Amalgamation  Resolution.  Vince  Sorace,  Keith  Henderson  and  Gavin  Cooper  are  Non-Arm’s  Length 
Parties  to  the  Amalgamation  because  they  are  directors  and/or  officers  of  each  of  the  Amalgamating 
Companies.
- 74 -
Desert Star has agreed to use all reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all necessary shareholder and 
regulatory approvals.
The  Desert  Star  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  is  not  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101  for  several  reasons  including  that  no 
director  or  officer  of  Desert  Star,  is  entitled  to  receive,  directly  or  indirectly,  as  a  consequence  of  the 
transaction a collateral benefit. As MI 61-101 does not apply to the Amalgamation, Desert Star will not be 
required to obtain a formal valuation in connection with the Amalgamation or have the Amalgamation 
approved by a majority of the minority of the Desert Star Shareholders.
The  Providence  Board  has  analyzed  MI  61-101  and  has  concluded  that  the  Amalgamation  may  be  a 
“business  combination”  as  that  term  is  defined  under  MI  61-101.    Any  previously  granted  Providence 
Options will, by virtue of the Providence stock option plan and the contractual provisions of the options, 
be deemed to be issued under and governed by the Amalco Plan.  At the Providence Meeting, Providence 
will  be  seeking  certain  adjustment  (reduction)  to  the  exercise  price  of  the  former  Providence  Options, 
once converted to Amalco Options.  Therefore, the reduction in exercise price of the Amalco Options may 
be considered a “collateral benefit” as that term is defined in MI 61-101. MI 61-101 expressly excludes 
benefits from being “collateral benefits” if such benefits are received solely in connection with the related 
party’s  services  as  an  employee,  director  or  consultant  under  certain  circumstances,  the  benefits  are 
disclosed  in  the  disclosure  document  for  the  transaction,  and  either:  (a)  at  the  time  the  transaction  is 
agreed  to,  the  related  party  and  its  associated  entities  (as  defined  in  MI  61-  101)  beneficially  own,  or 
exercise control or direction over, less than 1% of the outstanding equity securities (being, in the case of 
Providence, the Providence Shares); or (b) an independent committee of directors determines, acting in 
good faith, that the value of the benefits received by a related  party, net of any offsetting costs to the 
related party, is less than 5% of the value the related party expects to receive pursuant to the transaction, 
provided that the independent committee’s determination is disclosed in this Joint Information Circular.
Although the Amalgamation may be considered a “business combination” under MI 61-101, it does not 
fall under the categories of transactions that require a “formal valuation” under MI 61-10
Regulatory Approvals
If  the  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  is  approved  by  the  requisite  majority  of  Desert  Star 
Shareholders  and  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  is  approved  by  the  required  majority  of 
Providence Shareholders, final regulatory approval of the TSX-V must be obtained for all the transactions 
contemplated by the Amalgamation before the Amalgamation may proceed.
An application has been made to the TSX-V for the Amalco Shares to trade on the TSX-V, and the listing 
of such shares on the TSX-V is subject to the approval of the TSX-V.
Court Approval
On March 5, 2015, the Amalgamating Companies obtained the Interim Order, which is attached to this 
Joint  Information  Circular  as  Schedule  “L”,  authorizing  the  calling  and  holding  of  the  Meetings  and 
prescribing  the  conduct  of  the  Meetings.  The  Interim  Order  does  not  constitute  approval  of  the 
Amalgamation or the contents of this Joint Information Circular by the Court.
The  Amalgamation  which  is  being  conducted  by  plan  of  arrangement  requires  approval  by  the  Court 
under the provisions of Section 291 and 295 of the BCBCA. Subject to the terms of the Arrangement 
Agreement  and  the  approval  of  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  and  the  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation Resolution at the Meetings, the hearing in respect of the Final Order is currently scheduled 
to take place on or about 9:45 am (Vancouver time) on April 10, 2015 at the Law Courts, 800 Smithe 
Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia.  Any  Providence  Shareholder  or  Desert  Star  Shareholder  or  other
- 75 -
interested party who wishes to participate or to be represented or to present evidence or argument may do 
so, subject to filing with the Court a notice of their intention in accordance with the British Columbia 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  serving  such  notice  setting  out  the  basis  for  opposition  and  a  copy  of  the 
materials to be used to oppose the application upon the solicitors of Providence and Desert Star and upon 
all other parties who have filed a notice of appearance before 4:30 p.m. (Vancouver time)  on April 7, 
2015. A copy of the notice of the hearing for the Final Order is attached as Schedule “M” to this Joint 
Information Circular.
The Court has broad discretion under the BCBCA when making orders with respect to the Amalgamation 
and  the  Court,  in  hearing  the  application  for  the  Final  Order,  will  consider,  among  other  things,  the 
fairness of the Amalgamation to the Providence Shareholders and Desert Star Shareholders and any other 
interested party as the Court determines appropriate. The Court may approve the Amalgamation either as 
proposed or as amended in any manner the Court may direct, subject to compliance with such terms and 
conditions, if any, as the Court may determine appropriate.
The  distribution  of  the  Amalco  Shares  and  Amalco  Warrants  issuable  in  exchange  for  the  Providence 
Shares and Desert Star Shares pursuant to the Amalgamation have not been and will not be registered 
under the United States Act, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the 
registration requirements of the United States Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. The Final Order 
is required for the Amalgamation to become effective and the Court will be advised that if the terms and 
conditions  of  the  Amalgamation  are  approved  by  the  Court  pursuant  to  the  Final  Order,  the  Amalco 
Shares and Amalco Warrants issuable in exchange for Providence Securiti0es and Desert Star Securities 
pursuant  to  the  Amalgamation  will  not  require  registration  under  the  United  States  Act,  pursuant  to 
Section 3(a)(10) thereof.
Shareholders of Desert Star and Providence should be aware that the foregoing approvals have not yet 
been  given  by  the  regulatory  authorities  referred  to  above.  Neither  Desert  Star  nor  Providence  can 
provide any assurances that such approvals will be obtained.
Desert Star Fairness Opinion
Engagement of Ross Glanville & Associates Ltd. by Desert Star
The services of Glanville were retained by the Desert Star Board in connection with the provision of a 
fairness  opinion  related  to  the  proposed  amalgamation  with  Providence.  Glanville’s  services  included 
providing advice and assistance to the management and Directors of Desert Star in connection with the 
preparation  and  delivery  to  Desert  Star  of  the  Glanville  Fairness  Opinion  as  to  the  fairness  of  the 
proposed transaction.
Glanville  was  paid  a  fee  for  his  services  as  financial  advisor  to  Desert  Star,  but  none  of  the  fee  was 
contingent on the determination that the Amalgamation is fair to the Desert Star Shareholders. In addition, 
Glanville was indemnified in respect of certain liabilities that might arise out of the engagement.
Independence of Glanville
Glanville is and independent arm’s-length consultant, and was free from current and/or potential conflicts 
of  interest  in  preparing  the  Glanville  Fairness  Opinion.  He  has  no  direct  or  indirect,  past  or  current 
interests in Providence or Desert Star, or their subsidiary companies, or their securities or properties, nor 
does  he  expect  to  acquire  or  receive  such  interests,  securities  or  benefits  in  future,  other  than  the 
professional services fees from Desert Star for preparing the Glanville Fairness Opinion.

Engineers, and by various Canadian magazines and newspapers.
Summary of Fairness Opinion
Based upon and subject to the limitations in the Glanville Fairness Opinion, and such other matters as 
Glanville has considered relevant, it is his opinion that, as of the date of the Glanville Fairness Opinion, 
the terms of the proposed Amalgamation (pursuant to which Desert Star Shareholders will exchange each 
of  their  shares  for  one  Amalco  Share)  is  fair  from  a  financial  point  of  view  to  the  Desert  Star 
Shareholders. However, Glanville expresses no opinion as to the expected trading price of the shares of 
Desert  Star  if  the  proposed  Amalgamation  is  completed,  or  of  both  Amalgamating  Companies  if  it  is 
terminated.
The Glanville Fairness Opinion is appended to this Joint Information Circular as Schedule “G”.
Providence Fairness Opinion
Engagement of Bruce McKnight Minerals Advisor Services by Providence

fairness  opinion  related  to  the  proposed  amalgamation  with  Desert  Star.  McKnight’s  services  included 
providing advice and assistance to the management and Directors of Providence in connection with the 
preparation and delivery to Providence the McKnight Fairness Opinion as to the fairness of the proposed 
transaction.
McKnight  was  paid  a  fee  for  his  services  as  financial  advisor  to  Providence,  but  none  of  the  fee  was 
contingent on the determination that the Amalgamation is fair to the Providence Shareholders. In addition, 
McKnight was indemnified in respect of certain liabilities that might arise out of the engagement.

Summary of Fairness Opinion
Based upon and subject to the limitations in this McKnight Fairness Opinion, and such other matters as 
McKnight has considered relevant, it is his opinion that, as of the date of the McKnight Fairness Opinion, 
the terms of the proposed Amalgamation (pursuant to which Providence Shareholders will exchange each 
of their shares for 0.4 Amalco Share and 0.4 Amalco Warrant) is fair from a financial point of view to the 
Providence Shareholders. However, McKnight expresses no opinion as to the expected trading price of 
the shares of Amalco if the proposed Amalgamation is completed, or of both Amalgamating Companies if 
it is terminated.
The McKnight Fairness Opinion is appended to this Joint Information Circular as Schedule “H”.
Procedure For Exchange of Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares
On  or  about  the  Effective  Date,  a  letter  of  transmittal  will  be  forwarded  to  the  former  holders  of 
Providence Shares containing instructions as to how to exchange their Providence Share certificates for 
certificates representing Amalco Shares.
Registered Holders of Desert Star Shares will not be forwarded a letter of transmittal. On the Effective 
Date, any outstanding Desert Star Share certificates will be deemed to represent Amalco Shares on a 1:1 
basis.  Any  Registered  Holder  of  Desert  Star  Shares  may,  at  their  option,  send  their  Desert  Star  Share 
certificates to the Depositary, at any time, in exchange for Amalco Share certificates.
1.
Procedure of Exchange for Providence Shareholders and Desert Star Shareholders
(a)
As  soon  as  practicable  after  the  Effective  Date,  the  Depositary  will  forward,  to  each 
registered  holder  of  Providence  Shares,  a  letter  of  transmittal  and  instructions  for 
obtaining delivery of certificates representing Amalco Shares.
- 78 -
(b)
In order to receive share certificates pursuant to the Amalgamation, former Shareholders 
of  Providence  must  deliver  the  following  to  the  Depositary  within  six  (6)  years  of  the 
Effective Date:
(i)
(ii)
their certificates representing Providence Shares;
a duly completed letter of transmittal; and
(iii)
such other documents as the Depositary may require.

appropriate  documentation  described  above,  shall  be  registered  in  such  name  or  names  and  will  be 
delivered to such address or addresses as such holder may direct in the letter of transmittal as soon as 
practicable after the receipt by the Depositary of the required documents.
2.
Cancellation of Rights after Six Years
If a former Providence Shareholder fails to deliver and surrender to the Depositary the former certificates 
for Providence or Desert Star Shares together with a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and 
other  required  documents,  the  certificates  representing  the  Amalco  Shares  to  which  the  Shareholder 
would otherwise have been entitled will be held by the Depositary for a maximum of six (6) years from

indenture between Amalco and Computershare Investor Services Inc.
CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a general summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences to the 
Amalgamation”)  of  Providence  and  Desert  Star  under  the  Amalgamation,  or  the  exercise  of  Dissent 
Rights, to Shareholders who are individuals (other than trusts), residents of Canada for tax purposes, and 
who,  for  purposes  of  the  Income  Tax  Act  (Canada)  (the  “Tax  Act”),  deal  at  arms’  length  with  both 
Providence  and  Desert  Star,  and  hold  the  Shares  as  capital  property.  Generally,  the  Shares  should  be 
considered  to  be  capital  property  to  a  holder  unless  the  holder  is  a  trader  or  dealer  in  securities,  has 
acquired the Shares as part of an adventure in the nature or trade, or holds the Shares in the course of 
carrying on business of buying or selling securities or otherwise than for investment purposes. Certain 
shareholders resident in Canada for taxation purposes who hold Shares that might not otherwise qualify as 
capital property may be entitled to make an irrevocable election in accordance with subsection 39(4) of
- 79 -
the Tax Act to have the Shares and any other “Canadian security” as defined in the Tax Act treated as 
capital property. Shareholders considering such election should consult their own tax advisors.
This  summary  is  also  generally  applicable  to  Shareholders  who  at  all  relevant  times  (i)  deal  at  arm’s 
length (within the meaning of the Tax Act) with and are not affiliated with either Providence or Desert 
Star;  (ii)  following  the  completion  of  the  Amalgamation  will  not,  either  alone  or  together  with  other 
persons with whom they do not deal at arm’s length, either control Amalco or beneficially own shares of 
Amalco which have a fair market value in excess of 50% of the fair market value or all outstanding shares 
of Amalco; and (iii) is and was not a “foreign affiliate” (within the meaning of the Tax Act) of a person 
resident in Canada at any time.
This summary is not applicable to a Shareholder (i) that is a “financial institution” for the purposes of the 
mark-to-market  rules  contained  in  the  Tax  Act;  (ii)  that  is  a  “specified  financial  institution”  for  the 
purposes of the Tax Act; or (iii) an interest in which is a “tax shelter investment” as defined in the Tax 
Act, and does not address other special situations.
This summary is based on the facts as set out in this Joint Information Circular, current provisions of the 
Tax  Act,  the  Regulations  thereunder,  any  current  proposals  to  amend  the  Tax  Act  or  the  Regulations 
publicly announced by the federal Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the “Proposed 
Amendments”),  the  current  published  administrative  practices  of  the  Canada  Revenue  Agency  (the 
“CRA”) and assumes that the Proposed Amendments, if any, will be enacted substantially as proposed. 
Amendments  to  the  Tax  Act  are  frequent  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  as  yet  unknown  future 
amendments  will not adversely affect the Canadian  tax treatment to the Shareholders in respect of the 
Shares or the Warrants.
The summary further assumes that Providence Shares and Desert Star Shares will remain listed on the 
TSX-V until the completion of the Amalgamation, and that Amalco Shares will be listed on the TSX-V 
upon completion of the transaction.
This summary is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax consequences that may affect 
Shareholders  under  the  Amalgamation  or  in  respect  of  an  exercise  of  Dissent  Rights.  Except  for  any 
Proposed Amendments, this summary does not take into account or anticipate any changes in Canadian 
taxation law, whether by legislative, governmental  or judicial decision or action, or changes in CRA’s 
administrative policies and assessing practices. The summary does not take into account any other federal 
or any provincial, territorial, or foreign tax legislation or considerations, which may differ significantly 
from those discussed herein.
The income and other tax consequences of the Amalgamation will vary depending on the Shareholder’s 
particular  individual  circumstances,  including  the  province/territory  or  provinces/territories  in  which  a 
Shareholder resides, caries on business or has a permanent establishment.
THIS SUMMARY IS OF A GENERAL NATURE ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR 
SHOULD  IT  BE  CONSIDERED  TO  BE,  LEGAL  OR  TAX  ADVICE  TO  ANY  PARTICULAR 
SHAREHOLDER.  ACCORDINGLY,  ALL  SHAREHOLDERS  ARE  ADVISED  TO  CONSULT 
THEIR  OWN  INDEPENDENT  TAX  ADVISORS  WITH  REGARD  TO  THEIR  PARTICULAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES  AND  THE  APPLICATION  OF  CANADIAN,  PROVINCIAL,  FOREIGN 
AND OTHER TAX IMPLICATIONS.
Residents of Canada
The following portion of the summary is generally applicable to Shareholders who, at all relevant times, 
for the purposes of the Tax Act, and any applicable income tax treaty or convention are, or are deemed to 
be, resident only in Canada, and is not deemed to be, resident in Canada and does not use or hold, and is
- 80 -
not deemed to use or hold, the Desert Star Shares or Providence Shares in a business carried on in Canada 
and does not carry on an insurance business in Canada or elsewhere.
Shareholders Resident in Canada who Participate in the Amalgamation
Generally, when a Shareholder surrenders upon amalgamation shares of a particular class of the capital 
stock of a taxable Canadian corporation, as defined in the Tax Act, solely for shares from treasury of a 
particular  class  of  capital  stock  of  another  taxable  Canadian  corporation  being  the  amalgamated 
corporation,  the  Shareholder  will  be  deemed  to  dispose  of  the  exchanged  shares  and  warrants,  as 
applicable, for their adjusted cost base and deemed to acquire newly issued shares at the same adjusted 
cost base resulting in neither a capital gain nor a capital loss on the disposition.
As  a  result,  a  Desert  Star  Shareholder  will  be  deemed  to  acquire  the  Amalco  Shares  received  in  the 
exchange  at  the  Desert  Star  Shareholder’s  adjusted  cost  base  of  all  Desert  Star  Shares  held  before  the 
Amalgamation  and  a  Providence  Shareholder  will  be  deemed  to  acquire  the  Amalco  Shares  and  the 
Amalco  Warrants  received  in  the  exchange  at  the  Providence  Shareholder’s  adjusted  cost  base  of  all 
Providence Shares held before the Amalgamation.
Investment Eligibility
Provided that, at the Effective Time, the Amalco Shares are listed on a designated stock exchange (which 
currently includes the TSX-V) or Amalco otherwise qualifies as a “public corporation” for purposes of 
the Tax Act, the Amalco Shares will be “qualified investments” under the Tax Act for a trust governed by 
a registered retirement savings plan (“RRSP”), registered retirement income fund (“RRIF”), registered 
disability  savings  plan,  deferred  profit  sharing  plan,  registered  education  savings  plan  and  a  tax-free 
savings account (“TFSA”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Amalco Shares held in a TFSA, RRSP or RRIF are or at any time 
become  a  “prohibited  investment”  under  the  Tax  Act,  the  holder  of  the  TFSA  or  the  annuitant  of  the 
RRSP or RRIF, as the case may be, will be subject to a penalty tax as set out in section 207.04 of the Tax 
Act. Generally, the Amalco Shares would be considered as a “prohibited investment”  if the holder of a 
TFSA or the annuitant of a RRSP or RRIF, as the case may be: (i) does not deal at arm's length with 
Amalco  for  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act;  or  (ii)  has  a  “significant  interest”,  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act,  in 
Amalco.  Shareholders  who  hold  their Desert  Star  Shares  or  Providence  Shares,  or  who  will  hold  their 
Amalco Shares, in a RRSP, RRIF or TFSA should consult their own tax advisor to assess their individual 
risks.
Holding and Disposing of Amalco Shares
Dividends on Amalco Shares
Dividends on Amalco Shares, if and when declared, will be included in the recipient’s income for the 
purposes  of  the  Tax  Act  in  the  year  in  which  such  dividends  are  received  or  deemed  to  have  been 
received, subject to the comments below applicable only to the recipients which are corporations. Such 
dividends received by a Shareholder who is an individual (other than certain trusts) will be subject to the 
gross-up and dividend tax credit rules in the Tax Act normally applicable to taxable dividends received 
from taxable Canadian corporations. Provided that appropriate designations are  made by Amalco  at or 
prior  to  the  time  the  dividend  is  paid,  such  dividend  should  be  treated  as  an  eligible  dividend  for  the 
purposes of the Tax Act and a Shareholder who is an individual resident in Canada will be entitled to an 
enhanced dividend tax credit in ect of such dividend.
In  the  case  of  a  Shareholder  that  is  a  corporation,  dividends  received  on  the  Amalco  Shares  will  be 
required  to  be  included  in  computing  the  Shareholder’s  income  for  the  taxation  year  in  which  such
- 81 -
dividends are received or deemed to have been received and will generally be deductible in computing the 
Shareholder’s taxable income.
A Shareholder that is a “private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) or any other corporation resident 
in Canada and controlled or deemed to be controlled by or for the benefit of an individual or a related 
group of individuals (other than trusts) may be liable under Part IV of the Tax Act to pay a refundable tax 
of 33 1/3% on dividends received or deemed to have been received on the Amalco Shares to the extent 
that  such  dividends  are  deductible  in  computing  the  holder's  taxable  income.  A  Shareholder  that, 
throughout the relevant taxation year, is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation”(as defined in the Tax 
Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax of 6⅔% on its “aggregate investment income” (as defined in 
the Tax Act), including any dividends that are not deductible in computing taxable income.
Disposition of Amalco Shares
A disposition or deemed disposition of an Amalco Share by a Shareholder (other than a disposition to 
Amalco or in a tax-deferred transaction, where prescribed elections are duly made pursuant to the Tax 
Act), will generally result in a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of disposition, 
net  of  any  reasonable  costs  of  disposition,  exceed  (or  are  less  than)  the  adjusted  cost  base  to  the 
Shareholder immediately before the disposition. Such capital gain (or capital loss) will be subject to the 
tax treatment described below under “Taxation of Capital Gains or Capital Losses” below.
Dissenting Shareholders Resident in Canada
A Shareholder who dissents (a “Dissenter”) will be deemed to receive a dividend equal to the amount by 
which the amount received from Providence exceeds the paid-up capital of the Dissenter’s Providence 
Shares (“Providence Dividend”) plus the amount received from Desert Star exceeds the paid-up capital 
of the Dissenter’s Desert Star Shares (“Desert Star Dividend”).
A deemed dividend received by a Shareholder who is an individual will be included in computing the 
Shareholder’s taxable income, and will be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax credit rules normally 
applicable to taxable dividends paid by a taxable Canadian corporation as explained above.
Subject to the potential application of subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act, dividends received or deemed to be 
received by a corporate Shareholder will be included in computing its taxable income, but normally will 
also be deductible in computing its taxable income. Subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act provides that where a 
corporate  Shareholder  receives  a  dividend,  all  or part  of  the  dividend  may  in  certain  circumstances  be 
treated as proceeds of disposition of its shares and not as a dividend for the purpose of computing the 
Shareholder’s capital gain or loss on a disposition of such shares. Accordingly, corporate Shareholders 
should  consult  their  tax  advisors  for  specific  advice  with  respect  to  the  potential  application  of  this 
provision.
In  addition,  a  Dissenter  will  be  considered  to  have  disposed  of  the  Dissenter’s  Providence  Shares  for 
proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received from Providence less the Providence Dividend. The 
Dissenter will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent the adjusted proceeds of disposition, less 
any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded by) the Dissenter’s adjusted cost base of the 
disposed Providence shares.
Similarly,  a  Dissenter  will  be  considered  to  have  disposed  of  the  Dissenter’s  Desert  Star  Shares  for 
proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received from Desert Star less the Desert Star Dividend. The 
Dissenter will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent the adjusted proceeds of disposition, less 
any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded by) the Dissenter’s adjusted cost base of the 
disposed Desert Star shares.
- 82 -
Any capital gain or loss will be subject to the normal rules under the Tax Act. Generally, a Shareholder 
will  be  required  to  include  in  taxable  income  one  half  (50%)  of  the  amount  of  any  capital  gain  (the 
“taxable capital gain”) realized by the Shareholder in a particular taxation year. A “Canadian controlled 
private corporation”, as defined in the Tax Act, may be liable to pay an additional 6 2/3% of its “aggregate 
investment income” which may include taxable capital gains.
Additionally,  any  interest  paid  to  a  Dissenter  upon  exercise  of  dissent  rights  would  be  required  to  be 
included in the Dissenter’s taxable income in the year received.
Taxation of Capital Gains or Capital Losses
Generally, one half (50%) of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Shareholder in a 
taxation year must be included in the Shareholder’s income for the year, and one half (50%) of any capital 
loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized by a Shareholder in a taxation year must be deducted from 
taxable  capital  gains  realized  by  the  Shareholder  in  that  year  (subject  to  and  in  accordance  with  rules 
contained in the Tax Act). Allowable capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains 
for that year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three (3) preceding taxation years 
or, alternatively,  carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital 
gains realized in such years, to the extent permitted and under the circumstances described in the Tax Act.
A Shareholder that, throughout the relevant taxation year, is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” 
(as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax of 6 2/3% on its “aggregate investment 
income” (as defined in the Tax Act), including any taxable capital gains.
If the Shareholder is a corporation, the amount of any capital loss realized on a disposition or deemed 
disposition of an Amalco Share, may be reduced by the amount of dividends received or deemed to have 
been received by it on the disposition of such share (and in certain circumstances a share exchanged for 
such share) to the extent prescribed pursuant to the Tax Act. Similar rules may apply where a corporation 
is a member of a partnership or a beneficiary of a trust that owns an Amalco Share or where a trust or 
partnership  of  which  a  corporation  is  a  beneficiary  or  a  member  is  a  member  of  a  partnership  or  a 
beneficiary of a trust that owns any such shares. Shareholders to whom these rules may be relevant should 
consult their own tax advisors.
Capital gains realized by individuals and certain trusts may give rise to alternative minimum tax. Such 
Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the alternative minimum tax provisions 
in the Tax Act.
Non-Residents of Canada
The following part of the summary applies, subject to all provisions and assumptions set out above, to a 
Shareholder who, for the purposes of the Tax Act and any relevant taxation treaty or bilateral taxation 
protocol, is not and has never been resident in Canada and does not and will not at any relevant time use 
or hold any shares of either Providence or Desert Star in carrying on, or otherwise in connection with, a 
business in Canada (herein referred to as a “Non-Resident Shareholder”).
NON-RESIDENT  SHAREHOLDERS  ARE  ADVISED  TO  CONSULT  THEIR  OWN 
INDEPENDENT  TAX  ADVISORS  WITH  REGARD  TO  THEIR  PARTICULAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES  AND  THE  RELEVANT  CANADIAN  AND  FOREIGN  TAX 
IMPLICATIONS.
- 83 -
Non-Resident Shareholders who Participate in the Amalgamation
A Non-Resident Shareholder should not be subject to Canadian taxation under the Tax Act in respect of 
the exchange of its Providence Shares or its Desert Star Shares, for Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants, 
as applicable.
Dissenting Non-Resident Shareholders
The  following  portion  of  the  summary  is  applicable  to  a  Non-Resident  Shareholder  who  exercises 
dissenting  rights.  Such  Non-Resident  Shareholder  is  referred  to  in  this  part  of  the  summary  as  a 
“Dissenting Non-Resident”, and this part of the summary only addresses such Dissenting Non-Residents. 
A  Dissenting  Non-Resident  will  be  entitled  to  receive  payment  from  Providence  equal  to  the  value  of 
such Dissenting Non-Resident’s common shares and will be considered to have disposed of such shares 
for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received by the Dissenting Non-Resident. A Dissenting 
Non-Resident will be deemed to receive a dividend equal to the amount by which the amount received 
from Providence exceeds the paid-up capital of such shares.
Similarly, a Dissenting Non-Resident will be entitled to receive payment from Desert Star equal to the 
value of such Dissenting Non-Resident’s common shares and will be considered to have disposed of such 
shares  for  proceeds  of  disposition  equal  to  the  amount  received  by  the  Dissenting  Non-Resident.  A 
Dissenting Non-Resident will be deemed to receive a dividend equal to the amount by which the amount 
received from Desert Star exceeds the paid-up capital of such shares.
A deemed dividend received by a Dissenting Non-Resident will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at 
source at a default rate of 25% of the gross amount of the dividend, unless the rate is reduced under the 
provisions of an applicable taxation treaty or bilateral protocol.
A Dissenting Non-Resident will also realize a capital gain to the extent that the proceeds of disposition 
from Providence (reduced by any deemed dividend as discussed above) exceed the adjusted cost base of 
the  Providence  shares  immediately  before  their  listing  on  the  TSX-V.  Similarly,  a  Dissenting  Non- 
Resident will also realize a capital gain to the extent that the proceeds of disposition from Desert Star 
(reduced by any deemed dividend as discussed above) exceed the adjusted cost base of the Desert Star 
shares immediately before their listing on the TSX-V. A dissenting Non-Resident should not be subject to 
income tax under the Tax Act in respect of any such capital gain.
Generally, any interest paid to a Dissenting Non-Resident upon exercise of dissent rights should not be 
subject to Canadian withholding tax.
SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS
The  following  is  a  brief  summary  of  the  securities  law  considerations  applying  to  the  transactions 
contemplated herein.
Canadian Securities Laws
Status under Canadian Securities Laws
Each of Desert Star and Providence is a “reporting issuer” (i.e. a public company) in the Provinces of 
Alberta and British Columbia. The Desert Star Shares and the Providence Shares are listed on the TSX-V. 
It is anticipated that the Amalco Shares issued in connection with the Amalgamation will be listed on the 
TSX-V.
- 84 -
Issuance and Resale of Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants Under Canadian Securities Laws
The issuance of the Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants pursuant to the Amalgamation will constitute a 
distribution of securities, which is exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements of Canadian 
securities legislation. The Amalco Shares may be resold in each of the provinces and territories of Canada 
provided the holder is not a “control person” as defined in the applicable securities legislation, no unusual 
effort  is  made  to  prepare  the  market  or  create  a  demand  for  those  securities  and  no  extraordinary 
commission or consideration is paid in respect of that sale and if the selling securityholder is an Insider or 
an officer of Amalco, the selling securityholder has no reasonable grounds to believe that Amalco is in 
default of securities legislation.
U.S. Securities Laws
Status under U.S. Securities Laws
Each of the Amalgamating Companies is a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the U.S. 
Exchange Act and is not a “shell company” as defined in Rule 405 under the U.S. Securities Act.
Distribution and resale of Amalco Shares under U.S. Securities Laws
The following discussion is a general overview of certain requirements of U.S. federal securities laws that 
may be applicable to Shareholders in the United States (“U.S. Shareholders”). All U.S. Shareholders are 
urged  to  consult  with  their  own  legal  counsel  to  ensure  that  any  subsequent  resale  of  Amalco  Shares 
distributed  to  them  under  the  Amalgamation  complies  with  applicable  securities  legislation.  Further 
information  applicable  to  U.S.  Shareholders  is  disclosed  under  the  heading  “Note  to  United  States 
Shareholders”.
The following discussion does not address the Canadian securities laws that will apply to the distribution 
of  the  Amalco  Shares  and  Amalco  Warrants  or  the  resale  of  the  Amalco  Shares  by  U.S.  Shareholders 
within Canada. U.S. Shareholders reselling their Amalco Shares in Canada must comply with Canadian 
securities laws, as outlined elsewhere in this Joint Information Circular.
By their terms, the Amalco Warrants are not transferable to U.S. persons and not exercisable within the 
United States or by a U.S. person.
Exemption from the Registration Requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
If the Amalgamation is completed, the Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants to be distributed under the 
Amalgamation  will  be  considered  exempt  securities  under  Section  3(a)(10)  of  the  U.S.  Securities  Act. 
Accordingly, the distribution of the Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants under the Amalgamation will 
not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and will be effected in reliance upon the exemption from 
registration provided under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act.
In addition, such Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants have not been and will not be registered under the 
securities laws of any state of the United States and will be issued only in reliance upon such exemptions 
as may be available under the securities laws of the applicable states of the United States.
Resale of Amalco Shares within the United States after the Completion of the Amalgamation
The following discussion is limited to the resale of Amalco Shares within the United States assuming that 
a  market  for  such  securities  would  exist  in  the  United  States.  U.S.  Shareholders  may  also  resell  their 
Amalco  Shares  in  limited  circumstances  outside  of  the  United  States  in  accordance  with  Regulation  S
- 85 -
under the U.S. Securities Act. The availability of Regulation S for resales outside of the United States is 
discussed below under “Resale of Securities under Regulation S”.
The  ability  of  a  U.S.  Shareholder  to  resell  Amalco  Shares  issued  to  them  on  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation within the United States will depend on their status as an “affiliate” of Amalco before the 
completion  of  the  Amalgamation  and  their  status  as  an  “affiliate”  of  Amalco  after  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation  or  whether  such  holder  has  been  an  “affiliate”  within  90  days  of  the  Amalgamation. 
Amalco Shares received by a holder who will be an “affiliate” of Amalco after the Amalgamation or has 
been  such  an  “affiliate”  within  90  days  of  the  Amalgamation  will  be  subject  to  certain  restrictions  on 
resale imposed by the U.S. Securities Act.
As defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, an “affiliate” of an issuer is a person that directly, 
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control 
with such issuer.  Typically, persons who are executive officers,  directors or major shareholders of an 
issuer are considered to be its “affiliates”. The resale rules applicable to the U.S. Shareholders of Amalco 
Shares are summarized below.
A. Non-Affiliates Before and After the Amalgamation
U.S. Shareholders who are not affiliates of Amalco after the Amalgamation and who have not been such 
affiliates  within  90  days  of  the  Amalgamation  may  resell  the  Amalco  Shares  that  they  receive  in 
connection with the Amalgamation in the United States without restriction under the U.S. Securities Act.
B. Affiliates Before the Amalgamation or After the Amalgamation
U.S.  Shareholders  who  are  affiliates  of  Amalco  after  the  Amalgamation  or  who  have  been  such  an 
affiliate  within  90  days  of  the  Amalgamation  may  not  sell  their  Amalco  Shares  that  they  receive  in 
connection with the Amalgamation in the absence of registration under the U.S. Securities Act, unless an 
applicable exemption from such registration requirements is available, such as the exemptions provided 
by Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or Rule 904 of Regulation S under Rule 144 under the U.S. 
Securities Act, if available, and as further described below.
With  respect  to  a  foreign  private  issuer  organized  under  the  laws  of  Canada  that  was  a  Capital  Pool 
Company at the time that it became a public company, Rule 144 will not be available for resales of its 
restricted  securities  unless  the  issuer  has  (i)  completed  its  qualifying  transaction;  (ii)  has  become  a 
reporting issuer in at least one Canadian province and is required to file reports on SEDAR; (iii) has filed 
on SEDAR all reports and other materials required to be filed by it during the preceding 12 months; (iv) 
has  filed  an  Annual  Information  Form  (under  National  Instrument  51-102)  on  SEDAR  during  the 
preceding 16 months; and (v) has filed on SEDAR at least one year prior to the resale of such restricted 
securities (A) an Annual Information Form, (B) audited financial statements, (C) management discussion 
and  analysis  relating  to  its  audited  financial  statements,  and  (D)  a  management  information  circular 
prepared  in  connection  with  an  annual  or  special  meeting  of  shareholders  of  the  issuer.    All  of  the 
foregoing documents must reflect the issuer’s status as a going concern and not a “shell company”  as that 
term is defined under Rule 405 of the U.S. Securities Act.  As a result, given Providence’s status as a 
former Capital Pool Company, for Rule 144 to be available for resales of Amalco Shares, it would be 
necessary for Amalco (being a TSXV issuer) to begin filing Annual Information Forms on a voluntary 
basis in addition to ensuring compliance with the balance of the foregoing requirements.
Under Rule 144, persons who are affiliates of Amalco after the Amalgamation or who have been such 
affiliates  within  90  days  of  the  Amalgamation  will  be  entitled  to  sell  in  the  United  States,  during  any 
three-month period, after the applicable holding period pursuant to Rule 144(a), the Amalco Shares that 
they receive in connection with the Amalgamation, provided that the number of such shares sold does not 
exceed the greater of one percent of the then outstanding securities of such class or, if such securities are
- 86 -
listed on a United States securities exchange, the average weekly trading volume of such securities during 
the four-week period preceding the date of sale, subject to specified restrictions on manner of sale, notice 
requirements, aggregation rules and the availability of current public information about Amalco. Persons 
who are affiliates of Amalco after the Amalgamation or have been such an affiliate within 90 days of the 
Amalgamation will continue to be subject to the sale restrictions described in this paragraph for so long as 
they continue to be affiliates of Amalco.
C. Resale of Securities under Regulation S
U.S.  Shareholders  receiving  Amalco  Shares  on  completion  of  the  Amalgamation  may,  under  the  U.S. 
Securities Act, resell their Amalco Shares in an “offshore transaction” in accordance with Regulation S 
under the U.S. Securities Act provided the conditions imposed by Rule 904 of Regulation S for offshore 
resales are satisfied. An “offshore transaction” includes a transaction executed using the facilities of the 
TSX or TSX-V, provided the offer of the securities is not made to a person in the United States and, to the 
knowledge  of  the  seller  or  any  person  acting  on  the  seller’s  behalf,  the  transaction  has  not  been  pre-
arranged with a buyer in the United States.:
Non-Affiliates
U.S. Shareholders who are not affiliates of Amalco after completion of the Amalgamation will be entitled 
to resell their Amalco Shares without restriction under the U.S. Securities Act.
Affiliates
A U.S. Shareholder that is an affiliate of Amalco solely by virtue of their status as an officer or director of 
Amalco  may  sell  their  Amalco  Shares  by  complying  with  the  requirements  for  offshore  resales  under 
Rule  904  of  Regulation  S,  subject  to  the  additional  condition  that  no  selling  concession,  fee  or  other 
remuneration is paid in connection with such offer or sale other than the usual and customary broker’s 
commission that would be received by a person executing such transaction as agent. Rule 904 is available 
for the resale of the Amalco Shares in an “offshore transaction” provided neither the U.S. Shareholder nor 
any  person  acting  on  the  U.S.  Shareholder’s  behalf  engages  in  “directed  selling  efforts”  in  the  United 
States. An “offshore transaction” includes a transaction executed using the facilities of the TSX or TSX-
V, provided the offer of the securities is not made to a person in the U.S., and neither the seller nor any 
person acting on the seller’s behalf knows the transaction has been prearranged with a buyer in the U.S. 
“Directed  selling  efforts”  means  any  activity  undertaken  for  the  purpose,  or  that  could  reasonably  be 
expected to have the effect, of, conditioning the market in the United States for any of the securities being 
offered in the resale transaction.
The offshore resale provisions of Rule 904 of Regulation S are not available to U.S. Shareholders who are 
affiliates of Amalco as a consequence of being a major shareholder (a shareholder who beneficially owns 
10 percent or more of an issuer’s shares) of Amalco. Instead, Amalco Shares may be resold in “offshore 
transactions”  under  the  provisions of Rule  903  of Regulation  S,  which  requires  that  the  transaction  be 
made in an offshore transaction without directed selling efforts in the United States and that the seller 
have a reasonable basis to believe that the securities are not being offered to a person in the United States.

EACH  HOLDER  IS  URGED  TO  CONSULT  SUCH  HOLDER’S  PROFESSIONAL  ADVISORS 
TO  DETERMINE  THE  CANADIAN  CONDITIONS  AND  RESTRICTIONS  APPLICABLE  TO 
TRADES  IN  THE  AMALCO  SHARES.  RESALES  OF  ANY  SECURITIES  ACQUIRED  IN 
CONNECTION  WITH  THE  AMALGAMATION  MAY  BE  REQUIRED  TO  BE  MADE 
THROUGH PROPERLY REGISTERED SECURITIES DEALERS.
RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS
Persons  who  are  beneficial  owners  of  Desert  Star  Shares  or  Providence  Shares  registered  in  the 
name of a broker, custodian, nominee or other intermediary who wish to dissent should be aware 
that ONLY A REGISTERED SHAREHOLDER IS ENTITLED TO DISSENT. A shareholder who 
beneficially owns Desert Star Shares or Providence Shares, but is not the registered holder thereof, 
should contact the registered holder for assistance.
As  indicated  in  the  Notice  of  the  Meeting,  and  as  provided  in  the  BCBCA,  any  holder  of  Providence 
Shares or Desert Star Shares is entitled to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with the 
provisions  of  sections  237-247  of  the  BCBCA  if  the  shareholder  duly  dissents  to  the  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  and  the  Amalgamation  becomes 
effective.  A  holder  of  Providence  Shares  or  Desert  Star  Shares  who  dissents  to  the  Providence 
Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  and  is  paid  the  fair  value  of  such 
shares  will  not  be  entitled  to  receive  any  Amalco  Shares.  The  fair  value  of  such  holder’s  Providence 
Shares  or  Desert  Star  Shares  is  their  fair  value  immediately  before  the  adoption  of  the  Providence 
Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution,  excluding  any  appreciation  or 
depreciation in anticipation of the Amalgamation unless exclusion would be inequitable. The payment for 
such fair value of the shares shall be made by Providence or Desert Star or, if Providence or Desert Star 
do not have the funds available to make such payment, then by Amalco, as the case may be.
Shareholders registered as such on the Record Date of the Meeting may exercise rights of dissent pursuant 
to  and  in  the  manner  set  forth  in  Section  237-247  of  the  BCBCA  (as  abstract  of  which  is  attached  at 
Schedule  “I”),  provided  that  a  Dissent  Notice  duly  executed  by  such  Shareholder  is  received  by 
Providence or Desert Star at its offices located at Suite 717 – 1030 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C. 
V6E 2Y3, two days in advance of the date of the Meeting. Dissenting Shareholders are ultimately entitled 
to be paid fair value for their Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have transferred their Dissenting 
Shares to Providence or Desert Star for cancellation immediately on the Effective Date and in no case 
shall Providence or Desert Star be required to recognize such persons as holding Providence Shares or 
Desert Star Shares after the Effective Date.
A  vote  against  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution,  an 
abstention  from  voting  in  respect  of  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation  Resolution,  or  the  execution  or  exercise  of  a  Proxy  to  vote  against  the  Providence 
Amalgamation Resolution or Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution does not constitute a Dissent Notice, 
but  a  Shareholder  need  not  vote  against  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star 
Amalgamation Resolution in order to dissent. However, a Shareholder who consents to or votes in favour 
of  the  Providence  Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution,  other  than  as  a 
proxy for a Shareholder whose Proxy required an affirmative vote, will cease to be entitled to exercise 
any Dissent Rights.
Shareholders who do not duly exercise their Dissent Right are not entitled to be paid fair value for their 
Dissenting  Shares,  shall  be  deemed  to  have  participated  in  the  Amalgamation  on  the  same  basis  as  a 
Shareholder who is not a Dissenting Shareholder and shall receive Amalco Shares on the same basis as 
every other Shareholder.
- 88 -
Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the obligation of Amalco and Providence or Desert 
Star to complete the Amalgamation is subject to Providence or Desert Star not having received Dissent 
Notices in respect of more than 5% of the number of Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares which are 
issued as at the Effective Date, which requirement may be waived by Amalco at its discretion. Should 
Amalco and Providence or Desert Star not complete the Amalgamation, whether as a result of the failure 
of the Shareholders to approve the Providence Amalgamation Resolution or Desert Star Amalgamation 
Resolution  or  Providence  or  Desert  Star  receiving  Dissent  Notices  in  excess  of  5%  of  the  number  of 
Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares which are issued as at the Effective Date or for any other reason, 
Dissenting Shareholders will not be entitled to receive fair value for their Providence Shares or Desert 
Star Shares and will continue to be Providence or Desert Star Shareholders.
Prior to the Effective Date of the Amalgamation, Providence or Desert Star will send a notice of intention 
to act to each Dissenting Shareholder stating that the Providence Amalgamation Resolution or Desert Star 
Amalgamation Resolution has been passed and informing the Dissenting Shareholder of their intention to 
act on such Providence Amalgamation Resolution or Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution. A notice of 
intention  need  not  be  sent  to  any  Shareholder  who  voted  in  favour  of  the  Providence  Amalgamation 
Resolution or Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution or who has withdrawn his Dissent Notice. Within 
one  month  of  the  date  of  the  notice  given  by  Providence  or  Desert  Star  of  its  intention  to  act,  the 
Dissenting Shareholder is required to send written notice to Providence or Desert Star that he requires 
Providence or Desert Star to purchase all of his Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares and at the same 
time to deliver certificates representing those Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares to Providence or 
Desert  Star.  Additionally,  if  the  dissent  is  being  exercised  by  a  Shareholder  on  behalf  of  a  Beneficial 
Shareholder who is not the Dissenting Shareholder, the notice to Providence or Desert Star must include a 
written statement signed by the beneficial owner, confirming whether or not the beneficial owner is the 
beneficial owner of other Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares and if so, the names of the registered 
owners of such Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares, the number of those other Providence Shares or 
Desert Star Shares and that dissent is being exercised in respect of all of such Providence Shares or Desert 
Star Shares. Upon such delivery, a Dissenting Shareholder is deemed to have sold to Providence or Desert 
Star and Providence or Desert Star is  deemed to have purchased the Providence Shares or  Desert Star 
Shares subject to the demand for payment equal to their fair value immediately before the Providence 
Amalgamation  Resolution  or  Desert  Star  Amalgamation  Resolution  was  passed  by  the  Shareholders, 
excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the Amalgamation unless exclusion would 
be inequitable. Every Dissenting Shareholder who has delivered a demand for payment must be paid the 
same price as the other Dissenting Shareholders.
A Dissenting Shareholder who has sent a demand for payment under section 244(1) of the BCBCA, or 
Providence or Desert Star, may apply to the Court which may: (a) set the payout value, or order that the 
payout be established by arbitration or by reference to the registrar, or a referee, of the last; (b) join in the 
application of any other Dissenting Shareholder who has delivered a demand for payment under section 
244(1)  of  the  BCBCA;  and  (c)  make  consequential  orders  and  give  such  directions  as  it  considers 
appropriate. No Dissenting Shareholder who has delivered a demand for payment may vote or exercise or 
assert any rights of a Shareholder in respect of the Providence Shares or Desert Star Shares for which a 
demand for payment has been given, other than the rights to receive payment for those Providence Shares 
or  Desert  Star  Shares.  No  Dissenting  Shareholder  may  withdraw  his  demand  for  payment  unless 
Providence or Desert Star consents.
Strict  adherence  to  the  procedures  set  forth  above  and  in  sections  237-247  of  the  BCBCA  is 
required  and  failure  to  do  so  may  result  in  the  loss  of  all  Dissent  Rights.  Accordingly,  each 
Shareholder who might desire to exercise Dissent Rights should carefully consider and fully comply 
with the provisions set forth above and below and consult his or her legal advisor.
- 89 -
In addition to Dissent Rights, under the BCBCA, a Shareholder or a non-Registered Shareholder has the 
right to apply to Court on the grounds that some act of Providence or Desert Star has been done, or is 
threatened, or that some resolution of the Shareholders has been passed or is proposed that is unfair or 
prejudicial to one or more of the Shareholders, including the applicant. On such an application, the Court 
may make such order as it sees appropriate including an order to prohibit any act proposed by Providence 
or Desert Star or to cancel or vary any transaction or resolution.
OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE AMALGAMATION TO BE ACTED UPON AT
THE MEETINGS
Approval of Amalco Plan
Provided that the Desert Star Amalgamation Resolution and the Providence Amalgamation Resolution are 
each  passed  by  a  Special  Resolution,  Shareholders  at  both  Meetings  will  be  asked  to  consider  the 
implementation by Ordinary Resolution of the Amalco Plan, a draft copy of which will be available for 
review at the offices of Desert Star and Providence in advance of the Meetings.
Under the policies of the TSX-V governing stock options, all listed issuers must implement a stock option 
plan. Annual Shareholder approval is required for “rolling” stock option plans pursuant to which stock 
options are to be granted to certain employees, senior officers and directors of or consultants to an issuer. 
Desert Star and Providence previously adopted the Desert Star Plan and Providence Plan (together, the 
“Old Plans”). Given the proposed Amalgamation, the proposed management of Amalco wishes to adopt 
the  Amalco  Plan  to  replace  the  Old  Plans.  There  are  currently  2,400,000  Providence  Options  and 
2,775,000 Desert Star Options outstanding under the Old Plans.
By  virtue  of  the  contractual  provisions  thereof,  any  previously  granted  Providence  Options  will  be 
deemed  to  be  issued  under  and  governed  by  the  Amalco  Plan  and  will,  upon  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation, entitle the holder to purchase that number of Amalco Shares which is equal to the number 
of  Providence  Shares  which  were  the  subject  of  such  Providence  Option  multiplied  by  the  Providence 
Exchange Ratio (with the Providence Optionholders consenting to waive the Amalco Warrant portion of 
the  Providence  Exchange  Ratio)  at  an  exercise  price,  subject  to  receipt  of  Providence  Shareholder 
approval and TSX-V approval, equal to: (i) the Original Exercise Price; or (ii) if Original Exercise Price is 
less than the Average Closing Price, the Average Closing Price, all as previously disclosed in this Joint 
Information Circular.
By  virtue  of  the  contractual  provisions  thereof,  any  previously  granted  Desert  Star  Options  will  be 
deemed  to  be  issued  under  and  governed  by  the  Amalco  Plan  and  will,  upon  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation, entitle the holder to purchase Amalco Shares on the basis of one Amalco Share for every 
one Providence Share for which the Desert Star Options were granted at an exercise price per Amalco 
Share equal to the exercise price per Desert Star Share and with the same term as specified in the Desert 
Star Options.
The Amalco Plan complies with the requirements of Policy 4.4 of the TSX-V Corporate Finance Manual.
Upon  completion  of  the  Amalgamation,  there  will  be  3,685,000  Amalco  Options  outstanding.  See 
Schedule “C” Information Concerning Amalco for further information concerning the Providence Options 
and Desert Star Options.

amendments  to the Amalco Plan as  may be required by regulatory authorities, without 
further  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  Amalco,  in  order  to  ensure  adoption  of  the 
Amalco Plan;
Amalco file the Amalco Plan with the TSX Venture Exchange for acceptance, if required; 
and
any one director or officer of Amalco is authorized and directed to do all such acts and 
things and to execute and deliver all such deeds, documents, instruments and assurances 
as in his opinion may be necessary or desirable to give effect to this resolution.
Recommendation of Directors of Desert Star and Providence
The directors of each of Desert Star and Providence have reviewed and considered all facts respecting the 
approval of the Amalco Plan.  Desert Star’s and Providence’s directors unanimously recommend that the 
shareholders vote in favour of approving the Stock Option Plan Resolution.

the Desert Star Meeting or Providence Meeting, in person or by proxy.

Greenstone Belt immediately northeast of the border with Burkina Faso and 100 kilometres southwest of 
Niamey, with the vendor retaining a 5% non-participatory interest in the project during the pre-feasibility 
stage.  In  November  2009,  Desert  Star  entered  into  an  option  agreement  with  Cassidy  Gold  Corp. 
(“Cassidy”),  pursuant  to  which,  Cassidy  had  the  right  to  acquire  up  to  70%  interest  in  the  Nassile 
Property.  In  July  2010,  Cassidy  gave  notice  to  Desert  Star  that  it  has  complied  with  its  obligations 
pursuant to the option agreement to earn a 51% interest in the Nassile Property.
In August 2010, Desert Star and Cassidy entered into an amended mining option agreement with Middle 
Island Resources Pty Ltd (“MIR”) of West Perth, Australia pursuant to which Desert Star and Cassidy 
have granted MIR an option to acquire up to a 70% interest in the Nassile Property. In order to earn the 
70%  interest,  MIR  is  required  to  incur  US$2,000,000  in  exploration  expenditures  on  the  property  by 
August 31, 2013. If MIR exercises the option, then, pursuant to the option agreement, MIR, Desert Star
A-4
and  Cassidy  will  be  deemed  to  have  formed  a  joint  venture  for  the  purpose  of  exploring  the  Nassile 
Property  and  will  enter  into  a  formal  joint  venture  agreement  based  on  industry  standards.  If  MIR 
exercises the third option and acquires a 70% interest in the Nassile Property, the optionors must elect 
whether to contribute to further exploration of the Nassile Property. In the event that the optionors do not 
contribute,  their  interest  will  be  diluted  pro  rata.  If  any  party  to  the  agreement  elects  not  to  further 
participate in further exploration and their interest in the Nassile Property is reduced to 10%, that 10% 
shall automatically convert to a 1% NSR. In November 2012 MIR gave notice that it has complied with 
its obligations pursuant to the option agreement to earn a 70% interest in the Nassile Property. MIR has 
claimed  that,  under  the  terms  of  the  option  agreement,  Desert  Star  has  forfeited  its  right  to  further 
participate in exploration of the Nassile Property. Desert Star denies this claim and the matter is set for an 
arbitration hearing in September 2013. Desert Star entered into an agreement with MIR on May 13, 2014 
which provides for a settlement of the arbitrated matter. Under the terms of the agreement, Desert Star 
transferred all of its rights in the Nassile Property to MIR and paid MIR the sum of AUS$50,000. Desert 
Star will retain a 1% NSR interest over the Nassile Property. Consequently, the accumulated costs on the 
Nassile Property were written off at January 31, 2014, resulting in impairment of $665,237.
Year Ended April 30, 2014
Financings
On January 28, 2014, Desert Star closed a non-brokered private placement of 5,843,888 units at a per unit 
price of $0.18 for gross proceeds of $1,051,900. The offering was over-subscribed by 288,332 units (or 
approximately $51,900). Each unit was comprised of one Desert Star Share and one transferable share 
purchase warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional Desert Star Share at a 
per share price of $0.25 per Desert Star Share until July 28, 2015.
In satisfaction of finder’s fees for having introduced Desert Star to certain subscribers under the private 
placement,  Desert  Star  issued  to  an  arm’s  length  party  (the  “Finder”),  548,788  units  (with  a  deemed 
value of $98,781.84 and having the same underlying securities as the units issued to subscribers under the 
offering) and a finder’s warrant entitling the Finder to purchase 548,788 Desert Star Share at a per share 
price of $0.25 per Desert Star Share until July 28, 2015.
Mineral Properties
Henry, Canada
On  May  13,  2013,  Desert  Star  accelerated  payments  under  the  Henry  Property  option  agreement  and 
exercised  its  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Henry  Property  by  issuing  250,000  Desert  Star 
Shares. As of April 30, 2014, Desert Star had made payments totalling $155,000, issued 1,000,000 Desert 
Star Shares and incurred $273,577 in exploration activity, primarily on a geophysical survey of the Henry 
Property.  During  the  year  and  subsequent  to  year  end,  certain  of  the  claims  comprising  of  the  Henry 
Property were allowed to lapse. Consequently, a portion of the accumulated costs of the Henry Property 
were written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in an impairment charge of $390,288.
Anchor, USA
On September 16, 2013, Desert Star signed an option agreement to acquire a 51% interest (the “Primary 
Earn-In”) in the Anchor project located in Nevada, USA (the “Anchor Property”). In order to earn a 
51% interest, Desert Star must issue 1,000,000 Desert Star Shares and incur exploration expenditures of 
not less than US$2,000,000 on the Anchor Property by September 2015. The optionor will retain a 1% 
NSR  on  the  Anchor  Property,  the  parties  will  form  a  limited  liability  company  (LLC),  and  enter  into 
shareholders’ agreement governing the LLC. Upon completion the Primary Earn-In, Desert Star has the 
option to earn an additional 14% interest (the “Secondary Earn-In”) in the Anchor Property by incurring
A-5
additional  exploration  expenditures  of  US$4,000,000  and  issuing  1,000,000  Desert  Star  Shares.  Upon 
completion of the Secondary Earn-In, Desert Star may earn an additional 5% in the Anchor Property if it 
elects to complete a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) and the optionor elects not to participate 
in funding its proportionate cost of the PEA.
As  at  April  30,  2014,  Desert  Star  had  issued  200,000  Desert  Star  Shares  and  incurred  $8,683  in 
exploration activity, primarily on general costs of the Anchor Property.
Callaghan, USA
On  April  22,  2014,  Desert  Star  gave  the  optionor  three  months’  notice,  in  accordance  with  the  option 
agreement,  of  its  intention  to  terminate  the  agreement.  Consequently,  the  accumulated  costs  of  the 
property were written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in impairment of $102,439.
Copper King, USA
On September 3, 2013, Desert Star entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper 
King Property located in Arizona, USA. In order to exercise the option, Desert Star must make a cash 
payment of US$30,000, issue 350,000 Desert Star Shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than 
an  aggregate  US$5,000,000  in  the  first  seven  years  and  make  advance  minimum  royalty  (“AMR”) 
payments based on the value of 380,000 pounds of copper in the first seven years. In addition, various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and 
feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments 
will be based on the value of various quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered 
to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the 
project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000.
As  at  April  30,  2014,  Desert  Star  had  issued  350,000  Desert  Star  Shares  and  incurred  $120,291  in 
exploration activity, primarily on general costs of the Copper King Property.
In  June  2014,  Desert  Star  completed  field  exploration  at  the  Copper  King  Property,  which  greatly 
expanded the Copper King porphyry alteration footprint beyond the area of the previous known footprint 
and  identified  significant  copper  mineralization  at  surface.  A  total  of  5  samples  (out  of  a  total  of  43) 
returned values between 0.5% and 4.55% copper.
The exploration program consisted of 1:5000 scale geological mapping and sampling as well as surface 
alteration  mapping.  Desert  Star  geologists  are  targeting  the  potentially  copper-bearing  down-plunge 
projection of the porphyry system exposed at surface. The objective of the 2014 field program was to map 
the extent and distribution of alteration at surface, and to improve the resolution of the existing geological 
mapping in order to bring the project to the drill-testing phase.
In August 2014, Desert Star completed an Induced Polarization (“IP”) Geophysical survey at the Copper 
King  project.  The  IP  survey  at  Copper  King  produced  two  high  quality  anomalies  consisting  of 
chargeability  highs  coincident  with  resistivity  low  features.  The  combined  anomalies  measure 
approximately 2,700 meters in length when projected to surface and are present beyond the depth of the 
survey (approximately 600 meters). The anomalies identified by the survey are open to the southwest, 
coalesce  at  depth,  appear  to  plunge  toward  the  southwest,  and  are  interpreted  to  be  caused  by 
disseminated sulphides, which is consistent with mineralization associated with porphyry copper systems.
Copper Springs, USA
A-6
On September 3, 2013, Desert Star entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper 
Springs  property  located  in  Arizona,  USA  (the  “Copper  Springs  Property”).  In  order  to  exercise  the 
option,  Desert  Star  must  make  a  cash  payment  of US$30,000, issue  350,000  Desert  Star  Shares,  incur 
exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven years and make 
AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of  380,000  pounds  of  copper  in  the  first  seven  years.  In  addition, 
various payments are to be made upon specified milestones, including completion of a pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments 
will be based on the value of various quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered 
to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the 
project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000.
As at April 30, 2014, Desert Star had issued 350,000 common shares and incurred $74,986 in exploration 
activity, primarily on general costs of the Copper Springs Property.
In June 2014 Desert Star completed a gravity survey at its Copper Springs Property which builds on a 
historic single line survey completed in 2012. The current survey consisted of 120 new stations across the 
property as well as 20 additional regional stations. Gravity is useful in determining depths to bedrock, the 
geometry of the basin and locating geological structures, and takes advantage of density contrasts in the 
subsurface,  such  as  those  between  bedrock  (gravity  high)  and  alluvial  sediments  (gravity  low).  The 
gravity  survey  at  Copper  Springs  is  expected  to  allow  Desert  Star  to  model  the  interface  between  the 
Precambrian  to  Laramide  bedrock  and  the  modern  sedimentary  basin-fill.  Prospective  host  rocks  lie 
beneath the latter. The survey is also expected to identify major faults and lithological contacts which will 
be used to guide exploration drilling.
Oro, USA
On  January  14,  2013,  Desert  Star  entered  into  an  option  agreement  to  earn  an  initial  51%  in  the  Oro 
Property. In order to earn the initial 51% interest, Desert Star must make cash payments of US$225,000, 
issue 1,000,000 shares, and incur expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$3,000,000 over a period 
of forty-two months. The TSX-V accepted this agreement for filing on the effective date of February 5, 
2013. The vendor will retain a 1% or 2% NSR on the Oro Property. In addition, the State Leases included 
in the Oro Property provide for royalties of 5% on specified special minerals and 2% on other minerals 
mined from the Oro Property subject to such State Leases.
On July 8, 2014, Desert Star gave the optionor 30 days’ notice, in accordance with the option agreement, 
of its intention to terminate the agreement. Consequently, the accumulated costs of the Oro Property were 
written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in impairment of $298,557.
Red Top, USA
On September 3, 2013, Desert Star entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Red 
Top Property. In order to exercise the option, Desert Star must make a cash payment of US$30,000, issue 
350,000 Desert Star Shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in 
the first seven years and make AMR payments based on the value of 380,000 pounds of copper in the first 
seven  years.  In  addition,  various  payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including 
completion of a pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of 
commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of various quantities of copper and certain 
of the payments will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall be set off 
against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may 
purchase one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000.
A-7
As  at  April  30,  2014,  Desert  Star  had  issued  350,000  Desert  Star  Shares  and  incurred  $78,750  in 
exploration activity, primarily on general costs of the Red Top Property.
In June 2014 Desert Star completed a 12-day exploration field program on its Red Top Property, which 
included  geological  mapping,  sampling  and  an  alteration  study  utilizing  Terraspec  analysis,  and  has 
delineated  a  1,400  meter  by  1,500  meter  zone  of  intense  illite  ±  pyrophyllite  alteration.  Desert  Star 
interprets this alteration zone to be the upper portion of a porphyry system.
The exploration program consisted of 1:5000 scale geological mapping and sampling as well as a short 
wave infrared alteration study using a Terraspec 4® Mineral Analyzer. The Terraspec is able to identify 
minerals  (often  clays)  that  are  indistinguishable  by  visual  inspection,  and  which  can  provide  vectors 
towards mineralization in distal porphyry to epithermal settings. The objective of the field program was to 
advance Red Top to the drill testing stage.

Mineral Properties
Iron Range Property
Providence entered into an option agreement with Eagle Plains Resources Ltd. (“Eagle Plains”) with an 
effective  date  of  June  3,  2010  to  earn  a  60%  interest  in  the  Iron  Range  property  (the  “Iron  Range 
Property”)  located near Creston, BC by incurring $3,000,000 in exploration expenditures, making cash 
payments of $500,000 and issuing 1,000,000 shares to the optionor. Effective March 1, 2012, Providence 
exercised  its  option  to  acquire  the  60%  interest  in  the  Iron  Range  Property,  having  fulfilled  the 
requirements  of  the  option  agreement  with  Eagle  Plains.  In  accordance  with  the  option  agreement,  a 
formal joint venture agreement was executed between Providence and the Eagle Plains.
Providence undertook various exploration programs during the period from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate the 
potential of the Iron Range Property. These included a drill program in the fall of 2010 to test prominent 
geophysical conductors on the Iron Range Property. The program comprised ten diamond drilling holes 
for a total footage of 10,945 feet. In January 2011, drilling recommenced on the Iron Range Property that 
consisted  of  approximately  16,650  feet  in  sixteen  holes.  Highlights  of  work  completed  consisted  of 
geophysics  ground  and  borehole  surveys,  contour  soil  sampling,  grid  soil  sampling  and  geological
B-2
mapping. Providence executed an exploration program in the spring of 2012, the objective of which was 
to  systematically  evaluate  all  existing  exploration  data,  including  newly-acquired  geophysical  data, 
followed  by  field  evaluation  of  all  resulting  anomalies,  and  ultimately  drill  testing  the  highest  priority 
targets.
After extensive analysis of the results of the programs, Providence concluded that it would not undertake 
any further exploration work on the Iron Range Property. On November 12, 2013, Providence entered 
into  an  asset  purchase  and  sale  agreement  to  sell  its  interest  in  the  Iron  Range  Property  to  its  original 
optionor, Eagle Plains.
The purchase price paid by Eagle Plains consists of the following:
•
•
•
Issuing 500,000 common shares of Eagle Plains to Providence;
Returning 900,000 common shares of Providence, which were issued to Eagle Plains as partial 
consideration for earning in its interest in the joint venture; and
Granting to Providence a royalty equal to 1% on net smelter returns on the Iron Range Property
(the “Iron Range Property Consideration”).
Kokanee Creek Property
Providence and Eagle Plains entered into an option agreement on May 15, 2013 whereby Providence may 
earn an interest in the Kokanee Creek poly-metallic property (the “Kokanee Creek Property”), located 
in  south-eastern  British  Columbia  approximately  20km  NE  of  Nelson.  Under  terms  of  the  agreement, 
Providence has the option to earn a 60% interest in the (the “Kokanee Creek Property”) by completing 
$3,000,000  in  exploration  expenditures  on  the    Kokanee  Creek  Property,  making  $260,000  in  cash 
payments and issuing 1,000,000 Providence Shares to Eagle Plains over 5 years.
Year Ended September 30, 2014
Mineral Properties
On January 16, 2014, in exchange for the Iron Range Property Consideration, Providence sold its interest 
in the Iron Range Property to Eagle Plains after receiving the approval of the TSX-V and an exemption 
order granted by the BCSC.

Narrative Description of the Business
The  business  of  Amalco  following  completion  of  the  Amalgamation  will  be  the  exploration  and 
development  of  mineral  resources.  Specifically,  Amalco  will  focus  on  the  exploration  of  its  Arizona 
Properties located in Arizona, USA. Since entering into option agreements to acquire the properties in 
September 2013, Desert Star has spent approximately $312,000 and $231,000 on exploration work on the 
projects  respectively,  consisting  primarily  of  rock  and  soil  sampling,  geological  mapping,  geophysical 
data  acquisition  (gravity  and  Induced  Polarization)  and  prospecting.  In  addition,  Desert  Star  has  spent 
approximately  $19,000  on  exploration  work  the  Anchor  Property  in  Nevada,  USA  and  is  carrying 
exploration costs of approximately $137,000 on its Henry Property in Saskatchewan, Canada.
Business Objectives, Milestones and Exploration and Development
The immediate business objectives and contemplated exploration activities of Amalco will be to continue 
exploration work on the Arizona Properties, consisting primarily of drill testing the identified targets on 
each property and evaluating additional property acquisitions including identifying ground for acquisition 
through  the  company’s  own  internal  project  generation  program  across  the  southwest  U.S.A.  See 
“Principal  Purposes  of  Available  Funds”  below.  Amalco  also  intends  to  pursue  additional  equity 
financings to continue to raise funds for future work required at the Arizona Properties and future project 
acquisitions. The next Copper King Property work program, planned for the Spring of 2015, will consist 
of approximately 2400 meters of drilling. The estimated budget for Copper King Property work program 
is approximately $660,000. In addition, the Red Top Property work program, to be carried out at the same 
time,  will  consist  of  approximately  1600  meters  of  drilling  at  an  estimated  cost  of  approximately 
$440,000. There is no assurance that any equity financing will be available to Amalco to fund entirely the 
proposed work programs  on the Arizona Properties. At this time Amalco is  not aware of any material 
milestones that Amalco will have to achieve prior to the continuing its work on the Arizona Properties 
following completion of the Amalgamation.
Mineral Properties
Copper King, USA
Option agreement
C- 2
On September 3, 2013, Desert Star entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper 
King Property located in Arizona, USA. In order to exercise the option, Desert Star must make a cash 
payment of US$30,000, issue 350,000 Desert Star Shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than 
an  aggregate  US$5,000,000  in  the  first  seven  years  and  make  advance  minimum  royalty  (“AMR”) 
payments based on the value of 380,000 pounds of copper in the first seven years. In addition, various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and 
feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments 
will be based on the value of various quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered 
to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the 
project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000.
As  at  October  31,  2014,  Desert  Star  has  issued  350,000  Desert  Star  Shares,  incurred  $311,953  in 
exploration activity, primarily on general costs of the Copper King Property, consulting, and geophysical 
survey and paid $23,584 in AMRs. A further $48,232 in AMRs has been paid subsequent to the end of 
the period.
Exploration programs
In  June  2014,  Desert  Star  completed  field  explorations  at  the  Copper  King  Property,  which  greatly 
expanded the Copper King porphyry alteration footprint beyond the area of the previous known footprint 
and identified significant copper  mineralization at  surface.   A total of 5 samples (out of a  total of 43) 
returned  values  between  0.5%  and  4.55%  copper.  The  exploration  program  consisted  of  1:5000  scale 
geological mapping and sampling as well as surface alteration mapping. The objective of the 2014 field 
program was to map the extent and distribution of alteration at surface, and to improve the resolution of 
the existing geological mapping in order to bring the project to the drill-testing phase.
Desert Star completed a single test line Induced Polarization (“IP”) Geophysical survey at the Copper 
King Property on June 19, 2014.  The IP survey at the Copper King Property produced two high quality 
anomalies  consisting  of  chargeability  highs  coincident  with  resistivity  low  features.    The  combined 
anomalies  measure  approximately  2,700  meters  in  length  when  projected  to  surface  and  are  present 
beyond the depth of the survey (approximately 600 meters). The anomalies identified by the survey are 
open to the southwest, coalesce at depth, appear to plunge toward the southwest, and are interpreted to be 
caused  by  disseminated  sulphides,  which  is  consistent  with  mineralization  associated  with  porphyry 
copper systems.
In  September  2014,  Desert  Star  commenced  follow-up  IP  geophysics  at  the  Copper  King  Property  in 
order  to  further  define  the  location,  extent  and  geometry  of  the  IP  anomalies  Desert  Star  identified 
previously.  The  work,  which  was  completed  in  November  2014,  identified  a  large  IP  geophysical 
anomaly resulting from a 3D IP survey.  The IP anomaly, together with the lithological, alteration and 
geochemical data Desert Star previously generated represents a high quality porphyry copper drill target 
for Desert Star.
Desert Star commissioned the 11-day Volterra 3D IP geophysical survey in order to increase confidence 
in the location, geometry and intensity of the geophysical anomaly first identified in August, 2014. The 
parameters  of  the  survey  included  a  112-meter  distributed  diamond  array  with  a  line  spacing  of  300 
meters.   The survey defined a coincident chargeability high (18 to ˃35 msec) and resistivity low (>10 to 
2000 ohm-m) anomaly within the Copper King Property claim block.  The geophysical target features are 
present from 200m to 700m depth (open at depth) and range in plan-view size from 700m x 500m (200m 
depth  slice)  to  1000m  x  1300m  (700m  depth  slice).  The  IP  anomaly  is  characterized  by  a  zoned 
chargeability/resistivity pattern typical of porphyry systems, and has a spatial association with the eastern 
contact  between  pre-mineral  quartz  diorite  and  Pinal  Schist.    The  IP  anomaly  is  consistent  in  size,
geometry and position with a west-southwest plunging porphyry copper target, previously suggested by 
geologic mapping.
C- 3
Red Top, USA
Option agreement
On September 3, 2013, Desert Star entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Red 
Top  Property  located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  Desert  Star  must  make  a  cash 
payment of US$30,000, issue 350,000 Desert Star Shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than 
an  aggregate  US$5,000,000  in  the  first  seven  years  and  make  AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of 
380,000 pounds of copper in the first seven years. In addition, various payments are to be  made upon 
specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  a  decision  to 
develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of 
various quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of 
the  AMR  payments  shall  be  set  off  against  a  2.5%  NSR  payable  upon  the  project  being  brought  into 
commercial production. Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years 
for an amount of US$2,500,000.
As  at  October  31,  2014,  Desert  Star  has  issued  350,000  Desert  Star  Shares,  incurred  $231,389  in 
exploration activities, primarily on general costs of the Red Top Property, consulting, and geophysical 
survey and paid $23,584 in AMRs. A further $48,232 in AMRs has been paid subsequent to the end of 
the period.
Exploration programs
In June 2014 Desert Star completed a 12-day exploration field program on the Red Top Property, which 
included  geological  mapping,  sampling  and  an  alteration  study  utilizing  Terraspec  analysis,  and  has 
delineated  a  1,400  meter  by  1,500  meter  zone  of  intense  illite  ±  pyrophyllite  alteration.    Desert  Star 
interprets this alteration zone to be the upper portion of a porphyry system.
The exploration program consisted of 1:5000 scale geological mapping and sampling as well as a short 
wave infrared alteration study using a Terraspec 4® Mineral Analyzer.  The Terraspec is able to identify 
minerals  (often  clays)  that  are  indistinguishable  by  visual  inspection,  and  which  can  provide  vectors 
towards mineralization in distal porphyry to epithermal settings.  The objective of the field program was 
to advance the Red Top Property to the drill testing stage.
Desert Star completed a single line IP Geophysical survey (completed by Zonge International) June 10, 
2014. The survey identified coincident chargeability and resistivity anomalies measuring approximately 
1,400 meters long, open in all directions.  These anomalies are significant because they are located within 
a zone of intense illite-pyrophyllite-bearing alteration that is consistent with the geology typically seen in 
the upper parts of porphyry copper systems
Two IP surveys were completed at the Red Top Property in October 2014 which consisted of a Volterra 
3D Distributed Diamond Array survey and a Volterra-2D Survey.  The surveys were completed in order 
to increase confidence in the location, geometry and intensity of the geophysical anomaly first identified 
in  June,  2014.    The  surveys  identified  a  large  IP  geophysical  anomaly  which,  together  with  the 
lithological, alteration and geochemical data Desert Star previously generated represents a high quality 
porphyry copper drill target for Desert Star.  The parameters of the Volterra-3D Survey included a 112-
meter distributed diamond array with a line spacing of 300 meters and a station spacing of 100 meters 
(line azimuth 090˚).  The Volterra-2D line with an active array 350 meters in length has an azimuth of 
330˚ and a station spacing of 50 meters.
C- 4
The IP anomaly is characterized by a chargeability/resistivity pattern typical of porphyry systems,  and 
occurs  primarily  within  prospective  Pinal  Schist.    The  IP  anomaly  is  consistent  in  size,  geometry  and 
position  with  a  west-southwest  plunging  porphyry  copper  target,  consistent  with  previous  geologic 
mapping.
Anchor, USA
On September 16, 2013, Desert Star signed an option agreement, as amended on September 23, 2014, to 
acquire  a  51%  interest  (the  “Primary  Earn-In”)  in  the  Anchor  project  located  in  Nevada,  USA  (the 
“Anchor Property”). In order to earn a 51% interest, Desert Star must issue 1,100,000 Desert Star Share 
and  incur  exploration  expenditures  of  not  less  than  US$2,000,000  by  March  2016  on  the  Anchor 
Property.  The  optionor  will  retain  a  1%  NSR  on  the  Anchor  Property,  the  parties  will  form  a  limited 
liability company (“LLC”), and enter into shareholders’ agreement governing the LLC. Upon completion 
the Primary Earn-In, Desert Star has the option to earn an additional 14% interest (the “Secondary Earn-
In”)  in  the  Anchor  Property  by  incurring  additional  exploration  expenditures  of  US$4,000,000  and 
issuing  1,000,000  Desert  Star  Shares  by  September  2017.  Upon  completion  of  the  Secondary  Earn-In, 
Desert  Star  may  earn  an  additional  5%  in  the  Anchor  Property  if  it  elects  to  complete  a  preliminary 
economic assessment (“PEA”) and the optionor elects not to participate in funding its proportionate cost 
of the PEA.
As  at  October  31,  2014  Desert  Star  had  issued  600,000  Desert  Star  Shares  and  incurred  $19,237  in 
exploration activity, primarily on general costs of the Anchor Property.
Henry, Canada
On  April  5,  2012,  Desert  Star  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Henry 
property located in Saskatchewan, Canada (the “Henry Property”).  To acquire a 100% interest, Desert 
Star made cash payments of $155,000 and issued 1,000,000 Desert Star Shares.  The vendors will retain a 
2% NSR on the Henry Property. On May 13, 2013, Desert Star accelerated payments under the Henry 
property option agreement and exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Henry Property by 
issuing 250,000 Desert Star Shares.
To  date,  Desert  Star  has  made  payments  totaling  $155,000,  issued  1,000,000  Desert  Star  Shares  and 
incurred  $273,577  in  exploration  activity,  primarily  on  a  geophysical  survey  of  the  Henry  Property. 
During  2014,  certain  of  the  claims  comprising  of  the  Henry  Property  were  allowed  to  lapse. 
Consequently,  a  portion  of  the  accumulated  costs  of  the  Henry  Property  were  written  off  at  April  30, 
2014.

The following table sets forth the estimated working capital and amounts and sources of other funds of 
the  Amalgamating  Companies  and  Amalco  as  at  the  dates  indicated.  See  the  Financial  Statements  of 
Providence  attached  to  the  Joint  Information  Circular  as  Schedule  “E”  and  Desert  Star  attached  to  the 
Joint Information Circular as Schedule “D”  and the Pro-Forma Financial Statements of Amalco attached 
hereto as Schedule “F”.

The  working  capital  amounts  for  both  Amalgamating  Companies  exclude  the  balance  of  the  Loan  of 
$250,000  from  Providence  to  Desert  Star  as  these  amounts  offset.  The  Desert  Star  working  capital  is 
reflected  net  of  short  term  liabilities  comprising  convertible  debentures  of  $495,000  and  a  loan  of 
$360,000, both of which are repayable in the latter part of 2015.
C- 6
Principal Purposes of Available Funds
The following table sets forth the proposed use of the available funds by Amalco upon completion of the 
Amalgamation:
Use of Available Funds 
General and administrative costs 
Exploration budget for Arizona 
Properties 
Option agreement payments
Amount Assuming Completion of
the Amalgamation
$747,950 
$1,100,000
$300,000
Amalco will spend the funds available to it upon completion of the Amalgamation to further explore and 
develop the Arizona Properties. In the event that exploration of the Arizona Properties is not continued, 
certain of the option agreement payments will not be made. There may be circumstances where, for sound 
business reasons, a reallocation of funds may be necessary in order for Amalco to achieve its business 
objectives.
The  amalgamated  entity  will  be  focussed  on  raising  further  capital  in  the  near  future  to  cover  the 
projected  shortfall  in  working  capital.  The  short  term  loan  and  debentures  liabilities  referred  to  in  the 
“Available Funds” section above are with Insiders of Desert Star or with their close Associates. Current 
management is confident that, in the event of a working capital shortfall, the terms of the liabilities would 
be renegotiated to provide an extension of repayment terms.
Administrative Costs
The following chart sets out the estimated aggregate monthly and total administration costs that will be 
incurred  in  order  for  Amalco  to  operate  its  business  over  the  next  12  months.  It  is  anticipated  that 
approximately  $747,950  for  the  year  will  be  required  to  fund  the  general  and  administrative  costs  of 
Amalco:
Office rent and office expenses 
Management and geological consulting fees 
Accounting, audit and legal 
Transfer agent and regulatory fees 
Travel and investor relations
$193,200 
$309,500 
$213,500 
$19,750 
$12,000
Management  of  Amalco  intends  to  utilize  cash  assets  of  the  Amalgamating  Companies  to  pay  the 
estimated administrative costs of Amalco.
Dividend Policy
No  dividends  have  been  paid  on  any  shares  of  the  Amalgamating  Companies  since  the  date  of 
incorporation and, following completion of the Amalgamation, it is not contemplated that any dividends 
will be paid on the shares of Amalco in the immediate or foreseeable future.
Escrowed Securities
Following  completion  of  the  Amalgamation,  no  securities  of  any  class  of  Amalco  are  expected  to  be 
subject to escrow.
C- 7
Principal Securityholders
To  the  knowledge  of  the  Amalgamating  Companies,  no  persons  will  own,  directly  or  indirectly,  or 
exercise  control  or  direction  over  more  than  10%  of  Amalco  Shares  upon  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation.

Except  as  described  below,  no  proposed  director,  officer,  promoter  of  Amalco,  or  a  security  holder 
anticipated to hold sufficient securities of Amalco to affect materially the control of Amalco, within 10 
years before the date of the Joint Information Circular, has been, a director, officer or promoter of any 
person or company that, while that person was acting in that capacity:
(a)
(b)
was  the  subject  of  a  cease  trade  order  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant

Executive Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation, Philosophy and Objectives
Amalco  will  not  have  a  formal  compensation  program.  The  Amalco  Board  will  meet  to  discuss  and 
determine  management  compensation,  without  reference  to  formal  objectives,  criteria  or  analysis.  The 
general objectives of Amalco’s compensation strategy will be to (a) compensate management in a manner 
that encourages and rewards a high level of performance and outstanding results with a view to increasing 
long-term  shareholder  value;  (b)  align  management’s  interests  with  the  long  term  interests  of 
shareholders;  (c)  provide  a  compensation  package  that  is  commensurate  with  other  junior  mineral 
exploration  companies  to  enable  Amalco  to  attract  and  retain  talent;  and  (d)  ensure  that  the  total 
compensation  package  is  designed  in  a  manner  that  takes  into  account  the  constraints  that  Amalco  is 
under by virtue of the fact that it is a junior mineral exploration company without a history of earnings.
C- 11
The  Amalco  Board,  as  a  whole,  will  ensure  that  total  compensation  paid  to  all  NEOs  is  fair  and 
reasonable. The Amalco Board will rely on the experience of its members as officers and directors with 
other junior mining companies in assessing compensation levels.
Analysis of Elements
Base salary will be used to provide the NEOs a set amount of money during the year with the expectation 
that  each  NEO  will  perform  his  responsibilities  to  the  best  of  his  ability  and  in  the  best  interests  of 
Amalco.
Amalco will consider the granting of incentive stock options to be a significant component of executive 
compensation as it will allow Amalco to reward each NEO’s efforts to increase value for shareholders 
without requiring Amalco to use cash from its treasury. Stock options are generally awarded to executive 
officers at the commencement of employment and periodically thereafter. The terms and conditions of 
Amalco’s stock option grants, including vesting provisions and exercise prices, will be governed by the 
terms of the Amalco Plan. See “Other Matters to be Acted Upon at the Meetings” for more information 
with respect to the Amalco Plan.
Long Term Compensation and Option-Based Awards
Amalco  is  not  expected  to  have  any  long-term  incentive  plans  other  than  the  Amalco  Plan.  Amalco’s 
directors  and  officers  and  certain  consultants  will  be  entitled  to  participate  in  the  Amalco  Plan.  The 
Amalco  Plan  is  designed  to  encourage  share  ownership  and  entrepreneurship  on  the  part  of  the  senior 
management and other employees. The Amalco Board believes that the Amalco Plan aligns the interests 
of the NEOs and the Amalco Board with shareholders by linking a component of executive compensation 
to the longer term performance of Amalco’s Shares.
Options  will  be  granted  by  the  Amalco  Board.  In  monitoring  or  adjusting  the  option  allotments,  the 
Amalco Board will take into account its own observations on individual performance (where possible) 
and  its  assessment  of  individual  contribution  to  shareholder  value,  previous  option  grants  and  the 
objectives set for the NEOs and the Amalco Board. The scale of options is generally commensurate to the 
appropriate level of base compensation for each level of responsibility.
In  addition  to  determining  the  number  of  options  to  be  granted  pursuant  to  the  methodology  outlined 
above, the Amalco Board will also make the following determinations:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
parties who are entitled to participate in the Amalco Plan;
the exercise price for each stock option granted, subject to the provision that the exercise 
price  cannot  be  lower  than  the  prescribed  discount  permitted  by  the  TSX-V  from  the 
market price on the date of grant;
the date on which each option is granted;
the vesting period, if any, for each stock option;
the other material terms and conditions of each stock option grant; and
any re-pricing or amendment to a stock option grant.
The Amalco Board will make these determinations subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Amalco  Plan.  The  Amalco  Board  will  review  and  approves  grants  of  options  on  an  annual  basis  and 
periodically during a financial year.
C- 12
Summary Compensation Table
It is proposed that for the 12 months after giving effect to the Amalgamation, Amalco’s NEO’s will be 
paid the following annual salaries:
Chief Executive Officer
$120,000
Chief Financial Officer
$ 90,000
Incentive Plan Awards
Stock options or other incentive plan awards are proposed to be granted to Amalco’s NEOs for the 12 
months  following  the  completion  of  the  Amalgamation  in  accordance  with  the  Amalco  Plan.  See 
“Options and Other Rights to Purchase Securities” below for a description of the stock options that will 
be outstanding following the completion of the Amalgamation.
A description of the significant terms of the Amalco Plan is found under the heading “Other Matters to be 
Acted Upon at the Meetings” in the Joint Information Circular.
Termination and Change of Control Benefits
Amalco does not have any plan contract, agreement or plan or arrangement that provides for payments to 
a  NEO  at,  following  or  in  connection  with  any  termination  (whether  voluntary,  involuntary  or 
constructive), resignation, a change in control of Amalco or a change in the NEO’s responsibilities.
Director Compensation
Amalco does not propose to grant any Amalco Options to the directors of Amalco immediately following 
the completion of the Amalgamation.
Indebtedness of Directors, Officers and Other Management
No proposed director, senior officer, executive officer, promoter, employee or principal shareholder of the 
Amalgamating Companies, or Amalco or any Associates or Affiliates thereof, will be indebted to Amalco 
immediately after Closing. In addition, none of such persons’ indebtedness to any other entity will be the 
subject of a guarantee, support agreement or letter of credit or similar arrangement or understanding.
Investor Relations Arrangements
No written or oral agreement or understanding has been reached with any person to provide promotional 
or investor relations services for Amalco.
Options and Other Rights to Purchase Securities

The options were originally granted by Providence and, while the number and price of the options have been adjusted 
by the Providence Exchange Ratio, the Providence Board believes the (adjusted) exercise price of the Amalco Options resulting 
from the application of the Providence Exchange Ratio, combined with the reduction in the absolute number of options, would 
not provide the appropriate incentive to the Providence Optionholders. Therefore, Providence is proposing to amend the exercise 
price of all 2,400,000 Providence Options such that the exercise price will be reduced to: (i) the original exercise price of the 
Providence Options (without giving effect to the Providence Exchange Ratio); or (ii), or, if the original exercise price is less than 
the average closing price of the Amalco Shares over the first five trading days the Amalco Shares trade on the TSX-V, at an 
exercise price that is equal to such average closing price.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Desert Star Resources Ltd. 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Desert Star Resources Ltd., which comprise 
the consolidated statements of financial position as at April 30, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
 
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in 
accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management 
determines is  necessary to enable the  preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We 
conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require 
that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the 
consolidated  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and 
fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  entity's  internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated 
financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence that we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion. 
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
Desert Star Resources Ltd. as at April 30, 2014 and 2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the 
years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements which describes 
certain conditions that indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Desert 
Star Resources Ltd.’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Nature and continuance of operations 
Desert Star Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the province of British 
Columbia, Canada, and its principal activity is the acquisition and exploration of resource properties and 
has not yet been able to determine whether any of these properties contain resource reserves that are 
economically  recoverable.    The  Company’s  shares  are  traded  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  (“TSX‐V”) 
under the symbol “DSR”. 
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at 1030 West Georgia 
Street, Suite 717, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will 
continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be 
able  to  realize  assets  and  discharge  liabilities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  operations.    Different  bases  of 
measurement  may  be  appropriate  if  the  Company  is  not  expected  to  continue  operations  for  the 
foreseeable future.  As at April 30, 2014, the Company had not advanced its properties to commercial 
production  and  is  not  able  to  finance  day  to  day  activities  through  operations.    The  Company’s 
continuation  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  the  successful  results  from  its  mineral  property 
exploration activities and its ability to attain profitable operations and generate funds there from and/or 
raise equity capital or borrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations.  These factors indicate 
the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  about  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continue  as  a  going  concern.    Management  intends  to  finance  operating  costs  over  the  next  twelve 
months with loans or private placement of common shares.   
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  and 
interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). The financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual basis, based on historical costs. The financial statements 
are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. 
The financial statements were authorized for issue on August 20, 2014 by the directors of the Company. 
Consolidation 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  wholly  owned  US 
subsidiary,  Desert  Star  Resources  (USA)  Inc.  Inter‐company  balances  and  transactions,  including 
inter‐company  transactions,  are  eliminated  on 
unrealized 
consolidation. 
Significant estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make estimates 
and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.    The  Company’s  management  reviews  these  estimates  and 
underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on  experience  and  other  factors,  including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Revisions to 
estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the estimates are revised. 
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Significant judgments 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  the  Company  to  make 
judgments,  apart  from  those  involving  estimates,  in  applying  accounting  policies.    The  most  significant 
judgments in applying the Company’s financial statements include: 
-
-
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; 
the  classification  /  allocation  of  expenditures  as  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  or 
operating expenses; 
the classification of financial instruments; and 
the determination of the functional currency of the parent company and its subsidiaries.
- 
- 
Foreign currency translation 
The  functional  currency  of  the  Company’s  is  measured  using  the  currency  of  the  primary  economic 
environment in which that Company operates.  The functional currency of the parent company and the 
subsidiary is the Canadian dollar. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Foreign  currency  monetary  items  are  translated  at  the  period‐end 
exchange rate. Non‐monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange 
rate  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Non‐monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  are  reported  at  the 
exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined. 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items or on settlement of monetary items are 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise, 
except where deferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge. 
Exchange  differences  arising  on  the  translation  of  non‐monetary  items  are  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive loss to the extent that gains and losses arising 
on  those  non‐monetary  items  are  also  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income.  Where  the  non‐
monetary gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, the exchange component is also recognized in profit 
or loss. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures 
Costs  incurred  before  the  Company  has  obtained  the  legal  rights  to  explore  an  area  are  expensed  as 
incurred. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures include the costs of acquiring licenses and costs associated with 
exploration and evaluation activity.  Option payments are considered acquisition costs provided that the 
Company has the intention of exercising the underlying option.  
Property  option  agreements  are  exercisable  entirely  at  the  option  of  the  optionee.    Therefore,  option 
payments (or recoveries) are recorded when payment is made (or received) and are not accrued.

2.
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures (cont’d) 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalized. The Company capitalizes costs to specific blocks 
of claims or areas of geological interest.  Government tax credits received are recorded as a reduction to 
the cumulative costs incurred and capitalized on the related property. 
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  tested  for  impairment  if  facts  or  circumstances  indicate  that 
impairment exists.  Examples of such facts and circumstances are as follows: 
‐
the period for which the Company has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the 
period or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
‐
‐
‐
substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific 
area is neither budgeted nor planned;
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery 
of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such 
activities in the specific area; and
sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, 
the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from 
successful development or by sale.
After technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the 
Company stops capitalizing expenditures for the applicable block of claims or geological area of interest 
and tests the asset for impairment.  The capitalized balance, net of any impairment recognized, is then 
reclassified to either tangible or intangible mine development assets according to the nature of the asset. 
Farms outs 
The  Company  does  not  record  any  expenditure  made  by  the  farmee  on  its  account.  It  also  does  not 
recognize any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm out arrangements but reallocates any 
costs previously capitalized in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained and 
any consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalized.  If the 
consideration  exceeds  amounts  previously  capitalized,  any  excess  is  recorded  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive loss. 
Share‐based payments 
The Company operates a stock option plan. Share‐based payments to employees are measured at the fair 
value of the instruments issued and amortized over the vesting periods.  Share‐based payments to non‐
employees are measured at the fair value of goods or services received or the fair value of the equity 
instruments issued, if it is determined the fair value of the goods or services cannot be reliably measured, 
and are recorded at the date the goods or services are received.  The corresponding amount is recorded 
to the option reserve.  The fair value of options is determined using a Black–Scholes pricing model. The 
number of shares and options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting 
period such that the amount recognized for services received as consideration for the equity instruments 
granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.

Financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or 
loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held‐to‐maturity  investments,  available‐for‐sale  and  financial  liabilities.  The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.  
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss when they are either held for trading for 
the  purpose  of  short‐term  profit  taking,  derivatives  not  held  for  hedging  purposes,  or  when  they  are 
designated  as  such  to  avoid  an  accounting  mismatch  or  to  enable  performance  evaluation  where  a 
Company of financial assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance 
with a documented risk management or investment strategy. Such assets are subsequently measured at 
fair value with changes in carrying value being included in profit or loss.  The Company has no financial 
assets classified at fair value through profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables are non‐derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are included in 
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These 
are classified as non‐current assets.  Financial assets classified as loans and receivable include cash and its 
receivable.   
Held‐to‐maturity investments are non‐derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or 
determinable payments, and it is the Company’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost.  Held‐to‐maturity investments are included in non‐current 
assets, except for those which are expected to mature within 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period.  The Company has no financial assets classified as held‐to‐maturity. 
Available‐for‐sale financial assets are non‐derivative financial assets that are designated as available‐for‐
sale or are not suitable to be classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables  or  held‐to‐maturity  investments  and  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.    These  are 
included in current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses.  The Company has no financial assets 
classified as available‐for‐sale. 
Non‐derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortized cost.  The Company’s non‐derivative financial liabilities consist of trade payables and the loan 
payable. 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade‐date – the date on which the 
Company commits to purchase the asset.  
Financial  assets  are  derecognized  when  the  rights  to  receive  cash  flows  from  the  investments  have 
expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership.  
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial 
instrument  has  been  impaired.  In  the  case  of  available‐for‐sale  financial  instruments,  a  significant  and 
prolonged decline in the value of the instrument is considered to determine whether an impairment has 
arisen. 
The Company does not have any derivative financial assets and liabilities.

Impairment of assets  
The carrying amount of the Company’s assets (which include equipment and exploration and evaluation 
assets) is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its 
cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement 
of comprehensive loss.  
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‐
tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from 
other  assets,  the  recoverable  amount  is  determined  for  the  cash‐generating  unit  to  which  the  asset 
belongs.  
An impairment loss is only reversed if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, however, not 
to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognized in previous years.  
Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  not  subject  to  amortization  and  are  tested  annually  for 
impairment. 
Income taxes 
Current income tax: 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount  are  those  that  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted,  at  the  reporting  date,  in  the  countries 
where the Company operates and generates taxable income. 
Current  income  tax  relating to  items  recognized directly in  other comprehensive  income  or  equity  is 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically 
evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax: 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  using  the  balance  sheet  method  on  temporary  differences  at  the 
reporting  date  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial 
reporting purposes. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  offset,  if  a  legally  enforceable  right 
exists  to  set off  current  tax assets  against current  income  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  income  taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Equipment 
Equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  
Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  or  recognized  as  a  separate  asset,  as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part 
is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive loss 
during the financial period in which they are incurred.  
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and 
are recognized in profit or loss. 
Depreciation and amortization are calculated on a straight‐line method to write off the cost of the assets 
to  their  residual  values  over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  The  depreciation  and  amortization  rates

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  International  Accounting  Standard  (“IAS”)  39  “Financial 
Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a 
financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  or  fair  value,  replacing  the  multiple  rules  in  IAS  39.  The 
approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how  an  entity  manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its 
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. 
The  new  standard  also  requires  a  single  impairment  method  to  be  used,  replacing  the  multiple 
impairment methods in IAS 39.  The proposed effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2018.   
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” 
These amendments address inconsistencies when applying the offsetting requirements, and is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. 
The Company has not early adopted these revised standards and is currently assessing the impact that 
these standards will have on its condensed consolidated interim financial statements. 
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but 
have future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Exploration and evaluation assets (cont’d) 
The  following  is  a  description  of  the  Company’s  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  and  the  related 
spending commitments: 
Henry, Canada 
On  April  5,  2012,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Henry 
property  located  in  Saskatchewan,  Canada.    To  acquire  a  100%  interest,  the  Company  made  cash 
payments  of  $155,000  and  issued  1,000,000  shares.    The  vendors  will  retain  a  2%  net  smelter  royalty 
(“NSR”) on the property. On May 13, 2013, the company accelerated payments under the Henry property 
option agreement and exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the property by issuing 250,000 
common shares. 
The cash payments made by the Company to the optionor are as follows: 
 
April 5, 2012 
April 18, 2012 
 
The common shares issued by the Company to the optionor are as follows: 
 
April 18, 2012 
October 13, 2012 
April 13, 2013 
April 13, 2014 
 
During the year and subsequent to year end, certain of the claims comprising of the Henry property were 
allowed to lapse.  Consequently, certain accumulated costs of the property were written off at April 30, 
2014, resulting in an impairment charge of $390,288. 
Anchor, USA 
On  September  16,  2013,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  51%  interest  (the 
“Primary Earn‐In”) in the Anchor property located in Nevada, USA. In order to earn a 51% interest, the 
Company is required to issue 1,000,000 common shares and incur exploration expenditures of not less 
than US$2,000,000 by September 24, 2015. The optionor will retain 1% NSR on the property. 
The common shares to be issued by the Company to the optionor are as follows: 
 
September 24, 2013  
September 24, 2014 
September 24, 2015 
 
Upon completion the Primary Earn‐In, the Company has the option to earn an additional 14% interest (the 
“Secondary  Earn‐In”)  in  the  Anchor  property  by  incurring  additional  exploration  expenditures  of 
US$4,000,000 and issuing 1,000,000 common shares by September 24, 2017. 
Upon completion the Secondary Earn‐In, the Company may earn an additional 5% in the Anchor property 
if  it  elects  to  complete  a  preliminary  economic  assessment  (“PEA”)  and  the  optionor  elects  not  to 
participate in funding its proportionate cost of the PEA.

Callaghan, USA 
On  December  21,  2012,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the 
Callaghan property located in Nevada, USA. In order to maintain the option, the company was to make 
cash  payments  of  US$475,000  over  a  period  of  ten  years.  The  option  was  to  be  exercised  during  the 
Option Period (December 21, 2012 – December 31, 2022) by paying an amount equal to the greater of:
a)
the  price  of  1,200  troy  ounces  of  gold  at  the  average  price  fixed  by  The  London  Gold  Market 
Fixing Ltd. in US dollars during the period of 30 consecutive days ending on the day before the 
day on which the Company makes the payment, and
b)  US$1,500,000
The optionor would retain a 1% NSR on the property. 
On April 22, 2014, the Company gave the optionor three months’ notice, in accordance with the option 
agreement,  of  its  intention  to  terminate  the  agreement.  Consequently,  the  accumulated  costs  of  the 
property were written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in impairment of $102,439.

Exploration and evaluation assets (cont’d) 
Nassile, Niger 
The Company acquired the Nassile Gold Permit in consideration of the payment of US$20,000 and has 
expended $665,237 in acquisition and evaluation expenditures on the property.  
In November 2009, the Company entered into an option agreement with Cassidy Gold Corp. (“Cassidy”) 
pursuant  to  which  Cassidy  earned  a  51%  interest  in  the  Nassile  property  by  spending  approximately 
$1,000,000 on exploration expenditures on the property.  
In August 2010, the Company and Cassidy entered into an option agreement with Middle Island Resources 
Pty Ltd (“MIR”) of Perth, Australia, pursuant to which the Company and Cassidy granted MIR an option to 
acquire  up  to  a  70%  interest  in  the  Nassile  property.  In  November  2012  MIR  gave  notice  that  it  had 
complied with its obligations pursuant to the option agreement to earn a 70% interest in the property by 
having incurred approximately US$2,000,000 in exploration expenditures on the property. The Company, 
Cassidy  and  MIR  were  deemed  to  have  formed  a  joint  venture  with  respect  to  the  property,  with  the 
Company and Cassidy each holding an approximately 15% interest. MIR claimed that, under the terms of 
the  option  agreement,  the  Company  had  forfeited  its  right  to  further  participate  in  exploration  of  the 
property  and  its  interest  in  the  joint  venture  is  to  be  diluted  in  accordance  with  terms  of  the  option 
agreement. The Company denied this claim and the matter was put to arbitration where the arbitrator 
found  in  favour  of  MIR.  The  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MIR  on  May  13,  2014  which 
provides  for  a  settlement  of  the  arbitrated  matter.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  Company 
transferred all of its rights in the property to MIR and paid MIR the sum of $50,000. The Company will 
retain a 1% NSR interest over the property. Consequently, the accumulated costs on the property were 
written off at January 31, 2014, resulting in impairment of $665,237. At April 30, 2014, the Company has 
recognized a liability for the arbitration settlement of $50,000.

Loan payable 
The Company borrowed $500,000 by way of a loan agreement entered into on August 13, 2012. The loan, 
which  is  unsecured,  bears  interest  at  10%  per  annum.  The  loan  and  accrued  interest  is  repayable  on 
August 13, 2014 but may be repaid at any time prior to that without penalty. 
The Company issued 833,335 common shares at a value of $0.15 per share as bonus shares to the lender.  
The Company also issued 200,000 units as a finder’s fee connection with the loan. Each unit is comprised 
of one common share (with a fair value of $0.15 per share) and one common share purchase warrant. 
Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of 
$0.40  per  share  until  August  24,  2014.    The  fair  value  of  the  warrants  was  determined  to  be  $19,597 
which was determined using the Black‐Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: Risk 
free interest rate of 1.15%; Expected life of 2 years; Expected volatility of 125% and dividend yield of nil.  
The bonus shares and finders’ units were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the loan.

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash held 
in  bank  accounts.  This  risk  is  managed  by  using  major  banks  that  are  high  credit  quality  financial 
institutions as determined by rating agencies.  The Company’s secondary exposure to risk is on its other 
receivables.    This  risk  is  minimal  as  receivables  consist  primarily  of  refundable  government  goods  and 
services taxes. 
Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
The  Company  has  a  planning  and  budgeting  process  in  place  to  help  determine  the  funds  required  to 
support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis. The Company ensures that 
there  are  sufficient  funds  to  meet  its  short‐term  business  requirements,  taking  into  account  its 
anticipated cash flows from operations and its holdings of cash and cash equivalents. 
Historically,  the  Company’s  sole  source  of  funding  has  been  the  issuance  of  equity  securities  for  cash, 
primarily through private placements. The Company’s access to financing is always uncertain. There can 
be no assurance of continued access to significant equity funding. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash 
equivalents  as  these  instruments  have  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  and  are  therefore 
exposed to interest rate fluctuations on renewal.

Financial risk management (cont’d) 
Capital Management 
The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence  and  to  sustain  future  development  of  the  business.  The  capital  structure  of  the  Company 
consists of equity, comprising share capital, net of accumulated deficit.  
There were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year.  
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
Fair value 
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount. 
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy  according  to  the  relative  reliability  of  the  inputs  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values.  The  three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
 


Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  either 
directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Subsequent events 
a)  On May 14, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with MIR, which provides for a settlement 
of  the  arbitrated  matter  regarding  the  Nassile  property.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the 
Company transferred all of its rights in the property to MIR and paid MIR the sum of AUS$50,000 
(Note 6). 
 
In  July  2014,  the  company  extended  the  term  of  833,335  share  purchase  warrants,  which  were 
originally due to expire on August 24, 2014, to August 24, 2015. The warrants have an exercise price 
of $0.40 per common share.
b)
c)
In June 2014, 739,841 warrants expired unexercised. In August 2014, 125,000 common shares were 
issued for proceeds of $18,750 as a result of warrants exercised.

Performance Summary 
 
Mineral Properties 
 
Henry, Canada 
 
On  April  5,  2012,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Henry  property  located  in 
Saskatchewan,  Canada.   To  acquire  a  100%  interest,  the  Company  made  cash  payments  of  $155,000  and  issued  1,000,000 
shares.  The vendors will retain a 2% NSR on the property. On May 13, 2013, the company accelerated payments under the 
Henry  property  option  agreement  and  exercised  its  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  property  by  issuing  250,000 
common shares. To date, the Company has made payments totalling $155,000, issued 1,000,000 common shares and incurred 
$273,577 in exploration activity, primarily on a geophysical survey of the property. During the year and subsequent to year 
end, certain of the claims comprising of the property were allowed to lapse. Consequently, a portion of the accumulated costs 
of the property were written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in an impairment charge of $390,288. 
 
Anchor, USA 
 
On September 16, 2013, the Company signed an option agreement to acquire a 51% interest (the “Primary Earn-In”) in the 
Anchor project located in Nevada, USA. In order to earn a 51% interest, the company must issue 1,000,000 commons shares 
and incur exploration expenditures of not less than US$2,000,000 by September 2015. The optionor will retain a 1% NSR on 
the property, the parties will form a limited liability company (LLC), and enter into shareholders’ agreement governing the 
LLC. Upon completion the Primary Earn-In, the Company has the option to earn an additional 14% interest (the “Secondary 
Earn-In”)  in  the  Anchor  project  by  incurring  additional  exploration  expenditures  of  US$4,000,000  and  issuing  1,000,000 
common shares. Upon completion of the Secondary Earn-In, the Company may earn an additional 5% in the Anchor Project 
if it elects to complete a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) and the optionor elects not to participate in funding its 
proportionate cost of the PEA.  
 
To date, the Company has issued 200,000 common shares and incurred $8,683 in exploration activity, primarily on general 
costs of the property.
Callaghan, USA 
 
On  December  21,  2012  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Callaghan  Property 
located in  Nevada, USA. In order to  maintain the  option, the company  must  make cash  payments of US$475,000 over ten 
years. The option may be exercised during the option period (December 21, 2012 – December 31, 2022) by paying an amount 
equal to the greater of:
a)
the price of 1,200 troy ounces of gold at the average price fixed by The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. in US dollars 
during the period of 30 consecutive days ending on the day before the day on which the Company makes the payment, 
and
b)  US$1,500,000
The vendor will retain a 1% NSR on the property. 
 
On  April  22,  2014,  the  Company  gave  the  optionor  three  months’  notice,  in  accordance  with  the  option  agreement,  of  its 
intention to terminate the agreement. Consequently, the accumulated costs of the property were written off at April 30, 2014, 
resulting in impairment of $102,439. 
 
Copper King, USA 
 
On September 3, 2013, the Company entered into an option agreement to acquire  a 100% interest in Copper King property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven  years 
and make advance minimum royalty (“AMR”) payments based on the value of 380,000 pounds of copper in the first seven 
years. In addition, various payments are to be made upon specified milestones, including completion of a pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on 
the value of various quantities of copper and certain of the payments  will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the 
AMR  payments  shall  be  set  off  against  a  2.5%  NSR  payable  upon  the  project  being  brought  into  commercial  production. 
Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
To date, the Company has issued 350,000 common shares and incurred $120,291 in exploration activity, primarily on general 
costs of the property.
In  June  2014,  the  Company  completed  field  exploration  at  the  Copper  King  property,  which  greatly  expanded  the  Copper 
King  porphyry  alteration  footprint  beyond  the  area  of  the  previous  known  footprint  and  identified  significant  copper 
mineralization at surface.  A total of 5 samples (out of a total of 43) returned values between 0.5% and 4.55% copper. 
 
The exploration program consisted of 1:5000 scale geological mapping and sampling as well as surface alteration mapping.  
Desert Star geologists are targeting the potentially copper-bearing down-plunge projection of the porphyry system exposed at 
surface.    The  objective  of  the  2014  field  program  was  to  map  the  extent  and  distribution  of  alteration  at  surface,  and  to 
improve the resolution of the existing geological mapping in order to bring the project to the drill-testing phase.   
 
In August 2014, the Company completed an Induced Polarization (“IP”) Geophysical survey at the Copper King project.  The 
IP survey at Copper King produced two high quality anomalies consisting of chargeability highs coincident with resistivity 
low  features.    The  combined  anomalies  measure  approximately  2,700  meters  in  length  when  projected  to  surface  and  are 
present beyond the depth of the survey (approximately 600 meters).  The anomalies identified by the survey are open to the 
southwest,  coalesce  at  depth,  appear  to  plunge  toward  the  southwest,  and  are  interpreted  to  be  caused  by  disseminated 
sulphides, which is consistent with mineralization associated with porphyry copper systems.     
  
Copper Springs, USA 
 
On September 3, 2013, the Company entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper Springs property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven years 
and  make  AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of  380,000  pounds  of  copper  in  the  first  seven  years.  In  addition,  various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  a 
decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of various
quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall 
be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase 
one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
To date, the Company has issued 350,000 common shares and incurred $74,986 in exploration activity, primarily on general 
costs of the property. 
 
In  June  2014  the  Company  completed  a  gravity  survey  at  its  Copper  Springs  project  which  builds  on  a  historic  single  line 
survey  completed  in  2012.    The  current  survey  consisted  of  120  new  stations  across  the  property  as  well  as  20  additional 
regional  stations.    Gravity  is  useful  in  determining  depths  to  bedrock,  the  geometry  of  the  basin  and  locating  geological 
structures,  and  takes  advantage  of  density  contrasts  in  the  subsurface,  such  as  those  between  bedrock  (gravity  high)  and 
alluvial  sediments  (gravity  low).    The  gravity  survey  at  Copper  Springs  is  expected  to  allow  Desert  Star  to  model  the 
interface  between  the  Precambrian  to  Laramide  bedrock  and  the  modern  sedimentary  basin-fill.    Prospective  host  rocks  lie 
beneath the latter.  The survey is also expected to identify major faults and lithological contacts which will be used to guide 
exploration drilling.  
 
Oro, USA 
 
On January 14, 2013, the Company entered into an option agreement  to  earn an initial  51% in the Oro property  located in 
New Mexico, USA. In order to earn the initial 51% interest, the Company must make cash payments of US$225,000, issue 
1,000,000 shares, and incur expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$3,000,000 over a period of forty-two months. The 
TSX Venture Exchange accepted this agreement for filing on the effective date of February 5, 2013. The vendor will retain a 
1%  or  2%  NSR  on  the  property.  In  addition,  the  State  Leases  included  in  the  Oro  Project  provide  for  royalties  of  5%  on 
specified special minerals and 2% on other minerals mined from the property subject to such State Leases.  
 
On July 8, 2014, the Company gave the optionor 30 days’ notice, in accordance with the option agreement, of its intention to 
terminate the agreement. Consequently, the accumulated costs of the property were written off at April 30, 2014, resulting in 
impairment of $298,557. 
 
Red Top, USA 
 
On  September  3,  2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  Red  Top  property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven years 
and  make  AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of  380,000  pounds  of  copper  in  the  first  seven  years.  In  addition,  various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  a 
decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of various 
quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered to be AMR  payments. Each of the AMR payments shall 
be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase 
one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
To date, the Company has issued 350,000 common shares and incurred $78,750 in exploration activity, primarily on general 
costs of the property. 
 
In June 2014 the Company completed a 12-day exploration field program on its Red Top property,which included geological 
mapping, sampling and an alteration study utilizing Terraspec analysis, and has delineated a 1,400 meter by 1,500 meter zone 
of intense illite ± pyrophyllite alteration.  The Company interprets this alteration zone to be the upper portion of a porphyry 
system. 
 
The  exploration  program  consisted  of  1:5000  scale  geological  mapping  and  sampling  as  well  as  a  short  wave  infrared 
alteration  study  using  a  Terraspec  4®  Mineral  Analyzer.    The  Terraspec  is  able  to  identify  minerals  (often  clays)  that  are 
indistinguishable by visual inspection, and which can provide vectors towards mineralization in distal porphyry to epithermal 
settings.  The objective of the field program was to advance Red Top to the drill testing stage. 
 
Nassile, Niger 
 
The Company acquired the Nassile Gold Permit in consideration of the payment of US$20,000 and has expended $665,237 in 
acquisition and evaluation expenditures on the property.
In November 2009, the Company entered into an option agreement with Cassidy Gold Corp. (“Cassidy”) pursuant to which 
Cassidy earned a 51% interest in the Nassile property by spending approximately $1,000,000 on exploration expenditures on 
the property.  
 
In August 2010, the Company and Cassidy entered into an option agreement with Middle Island Resources Pty Ltd (“MIR”) 
of Perth, Australia, pursuant to which the Company and Cassidy granted MIR an option to acquire up to a 70% interest in the 
Nassile  property.  In  November  2012  MIR  gave  notice  that  it  had  complied  with  its  obligations  pursuant  to  the  option 
agreement to earn a 70% interest in the property by having incurred approximately US$2,000,000 in exploration expenditures 
on the property. The Company, Cassidy and MIR were deemed to have formed a joint venture with respect to the property, 
with the Company and Cassidy each holding an approximately 15% interest. MIR claimed that, under the terms of the option 
agreement, the Company had forfeited its right to further participate in exploration of the property and its interest in the  joint 
venture is to be diluted in accordance with terms of the option agreement. The Company denied this claim and the matter was 
put to arbitration where the arbitrator found in favour of MIR. The Company entered into an agreement with MIR on May 13, 
2014 which provides for a settlement of the arbitrated matter. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company transferred all 
of its rights in the property to MIR and paid MIR the sum of AUS$50,000. The Company will retain a 1% NSR interest over 
the  property.  Consequently,  the  accumulated  costs  on  the  property  were  written  off  at  January  31,  2014,  resulting  in 
impairment of $665,237.  
 
Alan  J.  Wainwright,  Ph.D.,  P.Geo.  is  a  Qualified  Person  as  defined  by  National  Instrument  43-101  and  has  reviewed  and 
approved the exploration information and technical disclosure in this MD&A.

The primary reason for the increase over the 2013 was the  write-down of $1,456,521 resulting  from the impairment  of the 
Henry,  Callaghan,  Oro  and  Nassile  properties  as  discussed  above.  Desert  Star  paid  an  obligation  of  $33,000  in  the  2013 
period  for  the  termination  of  an  option  agreement  for  the  Blachford  property  which  was  abandoned  and  incurred  losses  of 
$90,719  due  to  the  abandonment  of  the  Black  Lake,  Montpellier  and  Mt.  Heimdahl  properties  in  2013.  An  arbitration 
settlement of $50,000 regarding the Nassile property was recognized in 2014 as discussed above.  
 
Professional  fees  increased  by  $159,070  in  2014  primarily  due  to  legal  fees  paid  for  the  arbitration  regarding  the  Nassile 
property  as  discussed  above.  The  Company  reduced  management  fees  by  $141,625,  consulting  fees  by  $55,543  and  also 
significantly reduced its general office overheads and other expenses in the year ended April 30, 2014 in its efforts to contain 
costs. Stock-based compensation amounted to $129,917 in 2014 compared with $162,151 in 2013 as a result of stock options 
granted  during  the  respective  periods.  Interest  expenses  increased  to  $143,277  in  2014  compared  to  $81,026  in  2013  as  a 
result  of  the  loan  received  in  August  2012  (see  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  below).  All  other  material  costs  are 
comparable with the previous period and proportionate to the level of activity of the Company. 
 
The Company incurred a loss of $1,051,098 during the quarter ended April 30, 2014 compared to a loss of $253,020 for the 
quarter ended April 30, 2013, an increase of $798,078. The Company wrote down $791,284 of the Henry, Callaghan and Oro 
properties  in  the  2014  quarter  as  discussed  above.  An  arbitration  settlement  of  $50,000  was  recognized  during  the  quarter 
ended April 30, 2014 resulting from the settlement of the Nassile property arbitration as discussed above. Savings of $57,800 
were realized in management and consulting fees in the 2014 quarter compared to 2013 while professional fees increased by 
$60,479  primarily  due  to  legal  fees  paid  for  the  arbitration  regarding  the  Nassile  property.  Stock-based  compensation 
amounted  to  $20,405  during  the  quarter  ended  April  30,  2014  compared  to  $68,774  for  quarter  ended  April  30,  2013.  All 
other material costs are comparable with the previous period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Desert  Star  does  not  currently  own  or  have  an  interest  in  any  producing  resource  properties  and  has  not  yet  derived  any 
revenues from the sale of  mineral property interests in the last three financial  years.   The Company’s exploration activities 
have been funded through the issuance of common shares pursuant to private placements, the exercise of stock options and 
warrants and loan financing. In the year ended April 2014, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement comprising 
5,843,888 units at a price of $0.18 per unit for gross proceeds of $1,051,900. Each unit is comprised of one common share of 
the Company and one common share purchase warrant.  The Company expects that it will continue to be able to utilize this 
source of financing until it develops cash flow from its operations.  There can be no assurance, however, that  the Company 
will be able to obtain required financing in the future on acceptable terms, or at all.  As of April 30, 2014, the Company had 
working deficiency of $27,033. The Company has not earned cash from operations in the past nor does it expect to in future 
periods. 
 
On  August  18,  2014,  the  Company  announced  a  non-brokered  private  placement  up  to  $250,000  principal  amount  of 
convertible  notes  of  the  Company.  The  convertible  notes  will  be  outstanding  for  a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of 
issuance and bear interest of 12% per annum calculated and payable quarterly. The lenders may convert at any time, all or a 
portion  of  the  principal  into  units  of  the  Company  and  one  transferable  common  share  purchase  warrant.  Each  warrant  is
exercisable  into  one  common  share  in  the  capital  of  the  Company  for  a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of  issue,  at  an 
exercise price of $0.25 per warrant share. The private placement is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.
On August 13, 2012 the Company borrowed $500,000 from an arm’s length party. The loan bears interest at 10% per annum 
and  was  repayable  on  maturity  on  August  13,  2014. The  Company  issued  833,335  common  shares  at  a  value  of  $0.15  per 
share as bonus shares and 200,000 units at a value of $0.248 per unit as a finder’s fee in connection with the loan. Each unit 
is comprised of one common share and one common share purchase warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one 
common  share  of  the  Company  at  a  price  of  $0.40  per  share  until  August  13,  2014.  On  August  19,  2014,  the  Company 
announced that it has negotiated an extension with the lender. The lender has agreed to defer the maturity date of the loan and 
accrued  interest  for  one  year.  $350,000  of  the  principal  and  accrued  interest  is  being  extended  on  the  same  terms  as  the 
existing loan, while $250,000 of the balance owing by the Company will be rolled into convertible notes of  the Company on 
the  same  terms  as  the  convertible  note  private  placement  of  $250,000  discussed  above.  The  convertible  note  private 
placement is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.

The Company does not have any investor relations arrangements. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
The  Company  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  which  may  affect  the  Company’s  current  or  future 
operations or conditions.

Financial Instruments 
 
Desert Star’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, trade payables and loans payable. Unless otherwise noted, it 
is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these 
financial  instruments.    The  fair  value  of  these  financial  instruments  is  approximately  equal  to  their  carrying  values.  As  at 
April  30,  2014  the  Company  has  $648,757  in  cash  held  in  Canadian  dollars.  The  Company  does  not  use  derivative 
instruments or foreign exchange contracts to hedge against gains or losses arising from foreign exchange fluctuations. 
 
Capital Management 
 
The Company’s objectives when managing capital is to maintain sufficient capital for potential investment opportunities and 
to pursue generative exploration opportunities. The Company from time to time will issue new shares to fund specific project 
initiatives.  The  Company  considers  its  cash  to  be  its  manageable  capital.    The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  sufficient 
cash and deposit balances to cover operating and exploration costs over a reasonable future period.  The Company accesses 
capital markets through equity issues as necessary and may also acquire additional funds where advantageous circumstances 
arise. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  International  Accounting  Standard  (“IAS”)  39  “Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition  and  Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized  cost  or  fair  value,  replacing  the  multiple  rules  in  IAS  39.  The  approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how  an  entity 
manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its  business  model  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the 
financial assets.
The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the multiple impairment methods in IAS 39.  
The proposed effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”
These  amendments  address  inconsistencies  when  applying  the  offsetting  requirements,  and  is  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
Financial statement presentation
The  Company  has  not  early  adopted  these  revised  standards  and  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  these  standards  will 
have on its consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but have future effective 
dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Forward Looking Statements 
 
This  discussion  includes  certain  forward  looking  statements  with  respect  to  various  issues  including  upcoming  events. 
Forward  looking  statements  are  statements  that  are  not  historical  facts  and  are  generally,  but  not  always,  identified  by  the 
words “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”, “projects”, “potential” and similar expressions, or 
that  events  or  conditions  “will”,  “would”,  “may”,  “could”  or  “should”  occur.    Although  the  Company  believes  the 
expectations  expressed  in  such  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  reasonable  assumptions,  such  statements  are  not 
guarantees of future results and actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking statements.  Factors that 
could  cause  the  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  in  forward-looking  statements  include  market  prices, 
exploitation  and  exploration  success,  continued  availability  of  capital  and  financing  and  general  economic,  market  or 
business conditions. Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future results and actual results or 
developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are 
based  on  the  beliefs,  estimates  and  opinions  of  Desert  Star’s  management  on  the  date  the  statements  are  made.  Mineral 
exploration is subject to a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge, and careful evaluation 
may  fail  to  overcome.  Exploration  activities  seldom  result  in  the  discovery  of  a  commercially  viable  mineral  resource. 
Exploration activities are also expensive.  Desert Star will therefore require additional financing to carry on its business, and 
such financing may not be available when it is needed.  Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, Desert Star 
expressly disclaims any intention and assumes no obligation to update or revise any  forward-looking statements in the event 
that  management’s  beliefs,  estimates  or  opinions,  or  other  factors,  should  change,  whether  as  a  result  of  new  information, 
future events or otherwise.

Consolidated Financial Statements
April 30, 2013
Expressed in Canadian Dollars
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Desert Star Resources Ltd. 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.,  which 
comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at April 30, 2013, and the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
 
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We 
conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the 
consolidated  financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are 
appropriate  in  the circumstances,  but  not for  the purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion on  the  effectiveness  of  the 
entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the consolidated financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence that we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
Desert Star Resources Ltd. as at April 30, 2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then 
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Without  modifying  our  opinion,  we  draw  attention  to  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  which 
describes  matters  and  conditions  that  indicate  the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  may  cast  significant 
doubt about Desert Star Resources Ltd.’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Other Matter 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2012,  were 
audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on August 28, 2012.

Nature and continuance of operations 
Desert Star Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the province of British 
Columbia, Canada, and its principal activity is the acquisition and exploration of resource properties and 
has not yet been able to determine whether any of these properties contain resource reserves that are 
economically  recoverable.    The  Company’s  shares  are  traded  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  (“TSX‐V”) 
under the symbol “DSR”. 
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at 1030 West Georgia 
Street, Suite 918, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.  
On January 18, 2013, the Company changed its name from First Graphite Corp. to Desert Star Resources 
Ltd. and completed a consolidation of its common shares on the basis of one post‐consolidation common 
share for every two pre‐consolidation common shares issued and outstanding.  All references to common 
shares and per share amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements have 
been retroactively restated to reflect all the share changes that have taken place during the period. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will 
continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be 
able  to  realize  assets  and  discharge  liabilities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  operations.    Different  bases  of 
measurement  may  be  appropriate  if  the  Company  is  not  expected  to  continue  operations  for  the 
foreseeable  future.    As  at  April  30,  2013  the  Company  had  not  advanced  its  properties  to  commercial 
production  and  is  not  able  to  finance  day  to  day  activities  through  operations.    The  Company’s 
continuation  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  the  successful  results  from  its  mineral  property 
exploration activities and its ability to attain profitable operations and generate funds there from and/or 
raise equity capital or borrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations.  These factors indicate 
the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  about  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continue  as  a  going  concern.    Management  intends  to  finance  operating  costs  over  the  next  twelve 
months with loans or private placement of common shares.   
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation 
The financial statements were authorized for issue on August 27, 2013 by the directors of the Company. 
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  and 
interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). The financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual basis, based on historical costs. The financial statements 
are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. 
Consolidation 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  wholly  owned  US 
subsidiary,  Desert  Star  Resources  (USA)  Inc.    Inter‐company  balances  and  transactions,  including 
unrealized 
inter‐company  transactions,  are  eliminated  on 
consolidation. 
Significant estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make estimates 
and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.    The  Company’s  management  reviews  these  estimates  and 
underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on  experience  and  other  factors,  including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Revisions to 
estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the estimates are revised.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Significant estimates and assumptions (cont’d) 
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities. 
Significant judgments 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  the  Company  to  make 
judgments,  apart  from  those  involving  estimates,  in  applying  accounting  policies.    The  most  significant 
judgments in applying the Company’s financial statements include: 
-
-
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; 
the  classification  /  allocation  of  expenditures  as  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  or 
operating expenses; 
the classification of financial instruments; and 
the determination of the functional currency of the parent company and its subsidiary.
- 
- 
Foreign currency translation 
The  functional  currency  of  the  Company’s  is  measured  using  the  currency  of  the  primary  economic 
environment in which that Company operates.  The functional currency of the parent company and the 
subsidiary is the Canadian dollar. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Foreign  currency  monetary  items  are  translated  at  the  period‐end 
exchange rate. Non‐monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange 
rate  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Non‐monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  are  reported  at  the 
exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined. 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items or on settlement of monetary items are 
recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise, 
except where deferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge. 
Exchange  differences  arising  on  the  translation  of  non‐monetary  items  are  recognized  in  other 
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive loss to the extent that gains and losses arising 
on  those  non‐monetary  items  are  also  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income.  Where  the  non‐
monetary gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, the exchange component is also recognized in profit 
or loss. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures 
Costs  incurred  before  the  Company  has  obtained  the  legal  rights  to  explore  an  area  are  expensed  as 
incurred. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures include the costs of acquiring licenses and costs associated with 
exploration and evaluation activity.  Option payments are considered acquisition costs provided that the 
Company has the intention of exercising the underlying option.  
Property  option  agreements  are  exercisable  entirely  at  the  option  of  the  optionee.    Therefore,  option 
payments (or recoveries) are recorded when payment is made (or received) and are not accrued.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures (cont’d) 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalized. The Company capitalizes costs to specific blocks 
of claims or areas of geological interest.  Government tax credits received are recorded as a reduction to 
the cumulative costs incurred and capitalized on the related property. 
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  tested  for  impairment  if  facts  or  circumstances  indicate  that 
impairment exists.  Examples of such facts and circumstances are as follows: 
‐
the period for which the Company has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the 
period or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
‐
‐
‐
substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific 
area is neither budgeted nor planned;
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery 
of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such 
activities in the specific area; and
sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, 
the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from 
successful development or by sale.
After technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the 
Company stops capitalizing expenditures for the applicable block of claims or geological area of interest 
and tests the asset for impairment.  The capitalized balance, net of any impairment recognized, is then 
reclassified to either tangible or intangible mine development assets according to the nature of the asset. 
Although  the  Company  has  taken  steps  that  it  considers  adequate  to  verify  title  to  exploration  and 
evaluation assets which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title.  Title 
to exploration and evaluation assets in foreign jurisdictions is subject to uncertainty and consequently, 
such properties may be subject to prior undetected agreements or transfers and title may be affected by 
such instances. 
Farm outs 
The  Company  does  not  record  any  expenditure  made  by  the  farmee  on  its  account.  It  also  does  not 
recognize any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm out arrangements but reallocates any 
costs previously capitalized in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained and 
any consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalized.  If the 
consideration  exceeds  amounts  previously  capitalized,  any  excess  is  recorded  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive loss. 
Share‐based payments 
The Company operates a stock option plan. Share‐based payments to employees are measured at the fair 
value of the instruments issued and amortized over the vesting periods.  Share‐based payments to non‐
employees are measured at the fair value of goods or services received or the fair value of the equity 
instruments issued, if it is determined the fair value of the goods or services cannot be reliably measured, 
and are recorded at the date the goods or services are received.  The corresponding amount is recorded 
to the option reserve.  The fair value of options is determined using a Black–Scholes pricing model. The 
number of shares and options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting 
period such that the amount recognized for services received as consideration for the equity instruments 
granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or 
loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held‐to‐maturity  investments,  available‐for‐sale  and  financial  liabilities.  The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.  
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss when they are either held for trading for 
the  purpose  of  short‐term  profit  taking,  derivatives  not  held  for  hedging  purposes,  or  when  they  are 
designated  as  such  to  avoid  an  accounting  mismatch  or  to  enable  performance  evaluation  where  a 
Company of financial assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance 
with a documented risk management or investment strategy. Such assets are subsequently measured at 
fair value with changes in carrying value being included in profit or loss.  The Company has no financial 
assets classified at fair value through profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables are non‐derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are included in 
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These 
are classified as non‐current assets.  Financial assets classified as loans and receivable include cash and its 
receivable.   
Held‐to‐maturity investments are non‐derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or 
determinable payments, and it is the Company’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost.  Held‐to‐maturity investments are included in non‐current 
assets, except for those which are expected to mature within 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period.  The Company has no financial assets classified as held‐to‐maturity. 
Available‐for‐sale financial assets are non‐derivative financial assets that are designated as available‐for‐
sale or are not suitable to be classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables  or  held‐to‐maturity  investments  and  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.    These  are 
included in current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses.  The Company has no financial assets 
classified as available‐for‐sale. 
Non‐derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortized cost.  The Company’s non‐derivative financial liabilities consist of trade payables and the loan 
payable. 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade‐date – the date on which the 
Company commits to purchase the asset.  
Financial  assets  are  derecognized  when  the  rights  to  receive  cash  flows  from  the  investments  have 
expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership.  
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial 
instrument  has  been  impaired.  In  the  case  of  available‐for‐sale  financial  instruments,  a  significant  and 
prolonged decline in the value of the instrument is considered to determine whether an impairment has 
arisen. 
The Company does not have any derivative financial assets and liabilities.

Impairment of assets  
The carrying amount of the Company’s assets (which include equipment and exploration and evaluation 
assets) is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its 
cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement 
of income and comprehensive income.  
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‐
tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from 
other  assets,  the  recoverable  amount  is  determined  for  the  cash‐generating  unit  to  which  the  asset 
belongs.  
An impairment loss is only reversed if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, however, not 
to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognized in previous years.  
Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  not  subject  to  amortization  and  are  tested  annually  for 
impairment. 
Income taxes 
Current income tax: 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount  are  those  that  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted,  at  the  reporting  date,  in  the  countries 
where the Company operates and generates taxable income. 
Current  income  tax  relating to  items  recognized directly in  other comprehensive  income  or  equity  is 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically 
evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax: 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  using  the  balance  sheet  method  on  temporary  differences  at  the 
reporting  date  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial 
reporting purposes. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  offset,  if  a  legally  enforceable  right 
exists  to  set off  current  tax assets  against current  income  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  income  taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  or  recognized  as  a  separate  asset,  as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective 
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  IAS  39  “Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how 
an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial assets. 
The  new  standard  also  requires  a  single  impairment  method  to  be  used,  replacing  the  multiple 
impairment  methods  in  IAS 39.    IFRS  9  is  effective  for  annual  periods beginning  on  or  after  January  1, 
2015.   
New standard IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” 
This  new  standard  will  replace  IAS  27  “Consolidated  and  Separate  Financial  Statements”,  and  Standing 
Interpretations  Committee  abstract  (“SIC”)  12  “Consolidation  –  Special  Purpose  Entities”.    Concurrent 
with IFRS 10, the IASB issued IFRS 11 “Joint Ventures”; IFRS 12 “Disclosures of Involvement with Other 
Entities”; IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements”, which has been amended for the issuance of IFRS 10 
but retains the current guidance for separate financial statements; and IAS 28 “Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures”, which has been amended for conforming changes based on the issuance of IFRS 10 
and IFRS 11. 
IFRS  10  uses  control  as  the  single  basis  for  consolidation,  irrespective  of  the  nature  of  the  investee, 
eliminating  the  risks  and  rewards  approach  included  in  SIC‐12,  and  requires  continuous  assessment  of 
control over an investee. The above consolidation standards are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2013.

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective (cont’d) 
New standard IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” 
This new standard requires a venturer to classify its interest in a joint arrangement as a joint venture or 
joint operation.  Joint ventures will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereas for a 
joint operation the venture will recognize its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the 
joint  operation.  Under  existing  IFRS,  entities  have  the  choice  to  proportionately  consolidate  or  equity 
account for interests in joint ventures. IFRS 11 supersedes lAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, and SIC‐13, 
Jointly Controlled Entities‐Non‐monetary Contributions by Venturers. 
New standard IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” 
This  new  standard  establishes  disclosure  requirements  for  interests  in  other  entities,  such  as  joint 
arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and off balance sheet vehicles. The standard carries 
forward  existing  disclosures  and  also  introduces  significant  additional  disclosure  requirements  that 
address the nature of, and risks associated with, an entity's interests in other entities. 
New standard IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” 
This new standard replaces the fair value measurement guidance currently included in various other IFRS 
standards  with  a  single  definition  of  fair  value  and  extensive  application  guidance.    IFRS  13  provides 
guidance on how to measure fair value and does not introduce new requirements for when fair value is 
required  or  permitted.    It  also  establishes  disclosure  requirements  to  provide  users  of  the  financial 
statements with more information about fair value measurements.  IFRS 13 is effect for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2013. 
New interpretation IFRIC 20 “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine” 
This new IFRIC clarifies when production stripping should lead to the recognition of an asset and how that 
asset  should  be  measured,  both  initially  and  in  subsequent  periods.    IFRIC  20  is  effective  for  annual 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.   
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” 
These amendments address inconsistencies when applying the offsetting requirements, and is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. 
Financial statement presentation 
In  June  2011,  the  IASB  and  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  amendments  to 
standards  to  align  the  presentation  requirements  for  other  comprehensive  income  (“OCI”).    The  IASB 
issued  amendments  to  IAS  1  “Presentation  of  Financial  Statements”  to  require  companies  preparing 
financial statements under IFRS to group items within OCI that may be reclassified to the profit or loss. 
The  amendments  also  reaffirm  existing  requirements  that  items  in  OCI  and  profit  or  loss  should  be 
presented as either a single statement or two consecutive statements.  The amendments are effective for 
fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2012. 
The  Company  has  not  early  adopted  these  new  and  revised  standards  and  is  currently  assessing  the 
impact that these standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but 
have future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Company’s financial statements.

The  following  is  a  description  of  the  Company’s  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  and  the  related

The Company has a 10.62% carried interest and a 2.16% working interest in a mineral claim group in the

participate in a joint venture by agreeing to repay its proportionate share of expenditures, plus interest, 
from  production  or  converting  to  a  3% gross  overriding  royalty  relating  to  its  interest.  During  the  year 
ended  April  30,  2013,  the  Company  has  relinquished  its  rights  to  this  property  and  therefore  the 
acquisition and exploration costs were written‐off.

Nassile, Niger (cont’d) 
On November 16, 2009, the Company entered into an option agreement (the “Nassile Agreement”) with 
Cassidy Gold Corp. (“Cassidy”), a Company that had three common directors with the Company. Pursuant 
to  the  agreement,  Cassidy  has  the  right  to  acquire  up  to  70%  interest  in  the  Nassile  Property.    In 
consideration for the option Cassidy paid $100,000 and issued 100,000 common shares in the capital of 
Cassidy.    In  order  to  earn  a  51%  interest  in  the  property,  Cassidy  is  required  to  spend  $1,000,000 
(incurred) on exploration expenditures on or before the first anniversary of receipt of TSX‐V approval.  In 
order to earn an additional 9% for a total of 60% interest in the Property, Cassidy is required to incur an 
additional $2,000,000 in exploration expenditures on or before the third anniversary of receipt of TSX‐V 
approval.    Cassidy  shall  be  entitled  to  earn  an  additional  10%  interest,  for  a  total  70%  interest  in  the 
Property,  by  advising  the  Company  of  its  intention  to  complete  a  bankable  feasibility  study  for  the 
Property at its sole cost within a period of five years from the exercise of the option. 
On July 6, 2010, Cassidy gave notice to the Company that it has complied with its obligations pursuant to 
the Nassile Agreement and has earned a 51% interest in the Nassile Property. The Agreement provides that 
the Company and Cassidy are deemed to have entered into a joint venture agreement with respect to the 
Nassile Property upon this exercise of the option by the Company.  
On August 31, 2010, the Company and Cassidy (the “Optionor’s) entered into an amended mining option 
agreement  (the  “Option  Agreement”)  with  Middle  Island  Resources  Pty  Ltd  (“MIR”)  of  Perth,  Australia 
pursuant to which the Company and Cassidy have granted MIR an option (the “Option”) to acquire up to a 
70% interest in the Nassile Property.  
In  consideration  of  the  grant  of  the  Option,  MIR  will  incur  expenditures  on  the  Nassile  Property  of  a 
minimum of US$250,000 (the “Minimum Expenditures”). If the Optionors incur expenditures on the Nassile 
Property, MIR will reimburse them to a maximum of US$150,000, which reimbursement would be applied 
towards the Minimum Expenditures. In order to maintain and exercise the Option, MIR must incur certain 
expenditures  on  the  Nassile  Property  and  pay  all  taxes,  assessments  and  other  charges  relating    to  the 
Nassile Property occurring until the earlier of August 31, 2013 and the date that the Option is exercised, 
lapses or is abandoned. MIR may elect to exercise the Option in one of three ways:
1.
2.
3.
if MIR incurs US$500,000 in exploration expenditures on the Nassile Property by August 31, 2011, 
then MIR may acquire a 25% interest in the Nassile Property; 
if MIR incurs US$500,000 in exploration expenditures on the Nassile Property by August 31, 2011 
and US$500,000 in exploration expenditures on the Nassile Property by August 31, 2012 for a total 
of  US$1,000,000  in  exploration  expenditures  by  August  31,  2012,  then  MIR  may  acquire  a  51% 
interest in the Nassile Property; or 
if MIR incurs US$500,000 in exploration expenditures on the Nassile Property by August 31, 2011, 
US$500,000  in  exploration  expenditures  on  the  Nassile  Property  by  August  31,  2012  and 
US$1,000,000  in  exploration  expenditures  on  the  Property  by  August  31,  2013  for  a  total  of 
US$2,000,000  in  exploration  expenditures  by  August  31,  2013,  then  MIR  may  acquire  a  70% 
interest  in  the  Nassile  Property.  If  MIR  exercises  the  Option,  then,  pursuant  to  the  Option 
Agreement, MIR, the Company and Cassidy will be deemed to have formed a joint venture for the 
purpose  of  exploring  the  Nassile  Property  and  will  enter  into  a  formal  joint  venture agreement 
based on industry standards.

 If  MIR  exercises  the  third  option  and  acquires  a  70%  interest  in  the  property,  the  Optionors  must  elect 
whether to contribute to further exploration of the Nassile Property. In the event that the Optionors do not 
contribute,  their  interest  will  be  diluted  pro  rata.    If  any  party  to  the  agreement  elects  not  to  further 
participate  in further  exploration  and  their  interest  in  the  Nassile  Property  is  reduced  to 10%,  that  10% 
shall automatically convert to a 1% NSR.  
In  November  2012  MIR  gave  notice  that  it  has  complied  with  its  obligations  pursuant  to  the  Option 
Agreement to earn a 70% interest in the property.  MIR has claimed that, under the terms of the Option 
Agreement, the Company has forfeited its right to further participate in exploration of the Property and its 
interest  has  been  diluted  to  a  1%  NSR.  The  Company  denies  this  claim  and  the  matter  is  set  for  an 
arbitration hearing in September 2013.

The Company borrowed $500,000 by way of a loan agreement entered into on August 13, 2012. The loan 
is unsecured and bears interest at 10% per annum, compounded annually. The loan and accrued interest 
is repayable on August 13, 2014 but may be repaid at any time prior to that without penalty. 
The Company issued 833,335 common shares with a fair value of $0.15 per share as bonus shares to the 
lender.  The Company also issued 200,000 units as a finder’s fee connection with the loan. Each unit is 
comprised of one common share (with a fair value of $0.15 per share) and one common share purchase 
warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise 
price  of  $0.40  per  share  until  August  24,  2014.    The  fair  value  of  the  warrants  was  determined  to  be 
$19,597  which  was  determined  using  the  Black‐Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  the  following 
assumptions: Risk free interest rate of 1.15%; Expected life of 2 years; Expected volatility of 125% and 
dividend yield of nil.  The bonus shares and finders’ units were recorded as a reduction to the carrying 
value of the loan of $174,597. The difference between the amount initially recorded and the principal and

Financial risk and capital management 
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of 
Directors  approves  and  monitors  the  risk  management  processes,  inclusive  of  documented  investment 
policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the 
way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:  
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash. All 
of  the  Company’s  cash  is  deposited  in  a  bank  account  held  with  a  major  bank  in  Canada.    As  the 
Company’s cash is held by one bank there is a concentration of credit risk.  This risk is managed by using a 
major  bank  that  is  a  high  credit  quality  financial  institution  as  determined  by  rating  agencies.    The 
Company’s  secondary  exposure  to  risk  is  on  its  receivable.    This  risk  is  minimal  as  receivables  consist 
primarily of refundable government goods and services taxes. 
Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
The  Company  has  a  planning  and  budgeting  process  in  place  to  help  determine  the  Company  funds 
required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis. The Company 
ensures that there are sufficient funds to meet its short‐term business requirements, taking into account 
its anticipated cash flows from operations and its holdings of cash and cash equivalents. 
Historically,  the  Company's  sole  source  of  funding  has  been  the  issuance  of  equity  securities  for  cash, 
primarily through private placements. The Company’s access to financing is always uncertain. There can 
be no assurance of continued access to significant equity funding. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.  The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk.

Financial risk management (cont’d) 
Capital Management 
The  Company's  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence  and  to  sustain  future  development  of  the  business.  The  capital  structure  of  the  Company 
consists of equity, comprising share capital, net of accumulated deficit.  
There were no changes in the Company 's approach to capital management during the year.  
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
Fair value 
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount. 
Litigation settlement 
During the year ended April 30, 2012, the Company reached a settlement with respect to a statement of 
claim by an arm’s length party, which was served to the Company in connection with letters of intent on 
five  properties  located  in  Saskatchewan, Canada. On  payment  by  the  Company  of $100,000,  the arm’s 
length party has agreed to a full release of all claims and the filing of a consent dismissal order without 
costs.  
Subsequent events 
On May 13, 2013, the Company accelerated payments under the Henry property option agreement and 
exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the property by issuing 250,000 common shares (Note 
6). 
On July 29, 2013, the Company made the required option payment of US$150,000 pursuant to the Oro 
Property option agreement (Note 6).

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars - unaudited) 
For the six months ended October 31, 2014 and 2013
1.
Nature and continuance of operations
Desert  Star Resources  Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the province of British 
Columbia, Canada, and its principal activity is the acquisition and exploration of  resource properties and 
has not yet been able to determine whether any of these properties contain resource reserves that are 
economically  recoverable.    The  Company’s  shares  are  traded  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  (“TSX-V”) 
under the symbol “DSR”.
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at  1030 West Georgia 
Street, Suite 717, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that 
the Company will continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future  and  will  be  able  to  realize  assets  and  discharge  liabilities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  operations. 
Different  bases  of  measurement  may  be  appropriate  if  the  Company  is  not  expected  to  continue 
operations  for  the  foreseeable  future.  As  at  October  31,  2014,  the  Company  had  not  advanced  its 
properties to commercial production and is not able to finance day-to-day activities through operations. 
The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the successful results from its mineral 
property  exploration  activities  and  its  ability  to  attain  profitable  operations  and  generate  funds  there 
from and/or raise equity capital or borrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  were  authorized  for  issue  on  December  22, 
2014 by the directors of the Company.
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
The  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  and  interpretations  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting 
Interpretations  Committee  (“IFRIC”).  Therefore,  these  financial  statements  comply  with  International 
Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”.
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information required of 
full  annual  financial  statements  and  are  intended  to provide  users  with  an  update  in  relation  to  events 
and  transactions  that  are  significant  to  an  understanding  of  the  changes  in  financial  position  and 
performance  of  the  Company  since  the  end  of  the  last  annual  reporting  period.  It  is  therefore 
recommended that this financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the 
Company  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2014.  However,  these  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial 
statements  provide  selected  significant  disclosures  that  are  required  in  the  annual  financial  statements 
under IFRS.
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis, based 
on  historical  costs.  The  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Canadian 
dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency.
Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions
The  preparation  of  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  the 
Company  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.    The  Company’s 
management  reviews  these  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are  believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.  Revisions to estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the 
estimates are revised.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d)
Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions (cont’d)
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities.
The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires 
the Company to make judgments, apart from those involving estimates, in applying accounting policies.  
The most significant judgments in applying the Company’s financial statements include: 
-
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; 
the  classification  /  allocation  of  expenditures  as  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  or 
operating expenses; 
the classification of financial instruments; and 
the determination of the functional currency of the parent company and its subsidiaries.

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  International  Accounting  Standard  (“IAS”)  39  “Financial 
Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a 
financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  or  fair  value,  replacing  the  multiple  rules  in  IAS  39.  The 
approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how  an  entity  manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its 
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.
The  new  standard  also  requires  a  single  impairment  method  to  be  used,  replacing  the  multiple 
impairment methods in IAS 39.  The proposed effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2018.

The Company borrowed $500,000 by way of a loan agreement entered into on August 13, 2012. The loan, 
which is unsecured, bears interest at 10% per annum, compounded annually.
The Company issued 833,335 common shares at a value of $0.15 per share as bonus shares to the lender.  
The Company also issued 200,000 units as a finder’s fee connection with the loan. Each unit is comprised 
of  one  common  share  (with  a  fair  value  of  $0.15  per  share)  and  one  common  share  purchase  warrant. 
Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of 
$0.40  per  share  until  August  24,  2014.    The  fair  value  of  the  warrants  was  determined  to  be  $19,597 
which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: Risk 
free interest rate of 1.15%; Expected life of 2 years; Expected volatility of 125% and dividend yield of nil.  
The bonus shares and finders’ units were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the loan. The 
difference between the amount initially recorded and the principal and interest due on maturity is being 
amortized using the effective interest rate method.
On  September  9,  2014,  the  lender  converted  $245,000  of  the  loan  balance  into  a  convertible  note 
described in Note 9 below. By way of an amending agreement entered into on September 12, 2014, the 
repayment date of the balance of the loan capital, amounting to $360,000, and accrued interest thereon 
was extended to August 15, 2015.

as of the day of closing. The lenders may, at any time, convert all or a portion of the principal into units of 
the  Company,  each  unit  comprising  one  common  share  and  one  transferable  common  share  purchase

$15,777  was paid in share issue costs in connection with this transaction. The  Company issued 548,788

Financial risk management
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of 
Directors  approves  and  monitors  the  risk  management  processes,  inclusive  of  documented  investment 
policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the 
way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash held 
in  bank  accounts.  This  risk  is  managed  by  using  major  banks  that  are  high  credit  quality  financial 
institutions as determined by rating agencies.  The Company’s secondary exposure to risk is on its other 
receivables.    This  risk  is  minimal  as  receivables  consist  primarily  of  refundable  government  goods  and 
services taxes.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
The  Company  has  a  planning  and  budgeting  process  in  place  to  help  determine  the  funds  required  to 
support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis. The  Company ensures that 
there  are  sufficient  funds  to  meet  its  short-term  business  requirements,  taking  into  account  its 
anticipated cash flows from operations and its holdings of cash and cash equivalents.
Historically,  the  Company’s  sole  source  of  funding  has  been  the  issuance  of  equity  securities  for  cash, 
primarily through private placements. The  Company’s access to financing is always uncertain. There can 
be no assurance of continued access to significant equity funding.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because  of  changes  in  market  interest  rates.    The  Company  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  on  its  cash 
equivalents  as  these  instruments  have  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  and  are  therefore 
exposed to interest rate fluctuations on renewal.
Capital Management
The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence  and  to  sustain  future  development  of  the  business.  The  capital  structure  of  the  Company 
consists of equity, comprising share capital, net of accumulated deficit.

Financial risk management (cont’d)
There were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Fair value
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount.
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy  according  to  the  relative  reliability  of  the  inputs  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values.  The  three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
 


Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  either 
directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Subsequent events
Proposed amalgamation
On  November  25,  2014,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Letter  of  Intent  with  Providence  Resources  Corp. 
(“Providence”), which sets out the terms of a proposed amalgamation of the two companies pursuant to 
the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Providence, which is listed on the TSX-
V, is an exploration stage company engaged in the evaluation and exploration of its interests in mineral 
properties located in south-eastern British Columbia. The Company and Providence are related parties by 
way of common directors and officers.
The  proposed  share  exchange  ratios  for  which  the  existing  common  shares  of  the  respective 
amalgamating companies will be exchanged for shares of a new entity (“Amalco”) are as follows:
(a)
for  every  one  common  share  of  Providence,  shareholders  will  receive  approximately  0.3  of  an 
Amalco  common  share  and  0.3  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole 
warrant,  an  “Amalco  Warrant”).  Each  Amalco  Warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  acquire  an 
additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a price of 
$0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share; and
(b)
for  every  one  common  share  of  the  Company,  shareholders  will  receive  one  Amalco  common 
share.
The  proposed  amalgamation  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Company  and 
Providence and the approval of applicable regulatory authorities.  The amalgamating companies plan on 
holding special meetings of their respective shareholders on such a date as agreed to with regulators to 
consider  the  proposed  amalgamation  and  matters  related  thereto.  The  proposed  amalgamation  will 
require the statutory approval of at least two thirds of the shareholders of each company voting on the 
matters.
In  connection  with  the  proposed  amalgamation,  Providence  advanced  the  Company  $250,000  as  an 
unsecured,  non-interest  bearing  loan  which  will  be  fully  refundable  to  the  Company  within  30  business 
days if the proposed amalgamation does not complete.

Mineral Properties 
 
Henry, Canada 
 
On  April  5,  2012,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  Henry  property  located  in 
Saskatchewan,  Canada.   To  acquire  a  100%  interest,  the  Company  made  cash  payments  of  $155,000  and  issued  1,000,000 
shares.  The vendors will retain a 2% NSR on the property. On May 13, 2013, the company accelerated payments under the 
Henry  property  option  agreement  and  exercised  its  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the  property  by  issuing  250,000 
common shares.  
 
To  date,  the  Company  has  made  payments  totalling  $155,000,  issued  1,000,000  common  shares  and  incurred  $273,577  in 
exploration activity, primarily on a geophysical survey of the property. During 2014, certain of the claims comprising of the 
property were allowed to lapse. Consequently, a portion of the accumulated costs of the property were written off at April 30, 
2014. 
 
Anchor, USA 
 
On  September  16,  2013,  the  Company  signed  an  option  agreement,  as  amended  on  September  23,  2014,  to  acquire a  51% 
interest (the “Primary Earn-In”) in the Anchor project located in Nevada, USA. In order to earn a 51% interest, the company 
must issue 1,100,000 commons shares and incur exploration expenditures of not less than US$2,000,000 by March 2016. The 
optionor  will  retain  a  1%  NSR  on  the  property,  the  parties  will  form  a  limited  liability  company  (LLC),  and  enter  into 
shareholders’ agreement governing the LLC. Upon completion the Primary Earn-In, the Company has the option to earn an 
additional 14% interest (the “Secondary Earn-In”) in the Anchor project by incurring additional exploration expenditures of 
US$4,000,000  and  issuing  1,000,000  common  shares  by  September  2017.  Upon  completion  of  the  Secondary  Earn-In,  the 
Company  may  earn  an  additional  5%  in  the  Anchor  Project  if  it  elects  to  complete  a  preliminary  economic  assessment 
(“PEA”) and the optionor elects not to participate in funding its proportionate cost of the PEA. The Company is currently in 
negotiations with the optionor to extend certain of the financial commitments under the option agreement.
As  at  October  31,  2014  the  Company  has  issued  600,000  common  shares  and  incurred  $19,237  in  exploration  activity, 
primarily on general costs of the property.  
 
Copper King, USA 
 
On September 3, 2013, the Company entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper King property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven  years 
and make advance minimum royalty (“AMR”) payments based on the value of 380,000 pounds of copper in the first seven 
years. In addition, various payments are to be made upon specified milestones, including completion of a pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies, a decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on 
the value of various quantities of copper and certain of the payments  will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the 
AMR  payments  shall  be  set  off  against  a  2.5%  NSR  payable  upon  the  project  being  brought  into  commercial  production. 
Desert Star may purchase one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
As  at  October  31,  2014,  the,  the  Company  has  issued  350,000  common  shares,  incurred  $311,953  in  exploration  activity, 
primarily on general costs of the property, consulting, and geophysical survey and paid $23,584 in AMRs. A further $48,232 
in AMRs has been paid subsequent to the end of the period.
In August 2014, the Company completed an Induced Polarization (“IP”) Geophysical survey at the Copper King project.  The 
IP survey at Copper King produced two high quality anomalies consisting of chargeability highs coincident with resistivity 
low  features.    The  combined  anomalies  measure  approximately  2,700  meters  in  length  when  projected  to  surface  and  are 
present beyond the depth of the survey (approximately 600 meters). The anomalies identified by the survey are open to the 
southwest,  coalesce  at  depth,  appear  to  plunge  toward  the  southwest,  and  are  interpreted  to  be  caused  by  disseminated 
sulphides, which is consistent with mineralization associated with porphyry copper systems.  
 
In September 2014, the Company commenced follow-up geophysics at Copper King in order to further define the location, 
extent and geometry of the IP anomalies the Company identified  previously. The work, which was completed in November 
2014,  identified a large Induced Polarization (“IP”) geophysical anomaly resulting from  a 3D IP survey.  The IP anomaly, 
together  with  the  lithological,  alteration  and  geochemical  data  the  Company  previously  generated  represents  a  high  quality 
porphyry copper drill target for Desert Star.   
 
The Company commissioned the 11-day Volterra 3D IP geophysical survey in order to increase confidence in the location, 
geometry and intensity of the geophysical anomaly first identified in August, 2014. The parameters of the survey included a 
112-meter distributed diamond array with a line spacing of 300 meters.   The survey defined a coincident chargeability high 
(18  to  ˃35  msec)  and  resistivity  low  (>10  to  2000  ohm-m)  anomaly  within  the  Copper  King  Project  claim  block.    The 
geophysical target features are present from 200m to 700m depth (open at depth) and range in plan-view size from 700m x 
500m  (200m  depth  slice)  to  1000m  x  1300m  (700m  depth  slice).  The  IP  anomaly  is  characterized  by  a  zoned 
chargeability/resistivity  pattern  typical  of  porphyry  systems,  and  has  a  spatial  association  with  the  eastern  contact  between 
pre-mineral  quartz  diorite  and  Pinal  Schist.    The  IP  anomaly  is  consistent  in  size,  geometry  and  position  with  a  west-
southwest plunging porphyry copper target, previously suggested by geologic mapping.    
  
Copper Springs, USA 
 
On September 3, 2013, the Company entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in Copper Springs property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven years 
and  make  AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of  380,000  pounds  of  copper  in  the  first  seven  years.  In  addition,  various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  a 
decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of various 
quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall 
be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase 
one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
As  at  October  31,  2014,  the  Company  has  issued  350,000  common  shares,  and  incurred  $171,419  in  exploration  activity, 
primarily on general costs of the property, consulting, and gravity survey.
In  June  2014  the  Company  completed  a  gravity  survey  at  its  Copper  Springs  project  which  built  on  a  historic  single  line 
survey completed in 2012.  The results of the survey suggest that historic drill hole CSN-5 (drilled and cased to a depth of 
594 meters) was abandoned within a few hundred meters of the bedrock contact to test the copper (porphyry) potential of this 
prospective property in the heart of the prolific Globe-Miami Mining District.    
 
The  gravity  survey  at  Copper  Springs  builds  on  a  historic  single  line  (22  stations)  survey  completed  in  2012.   The  current 
survey  consists  of  120  new  stations  across  the  property  as  well  as  20  additional  regional  stations.    Gravity  is  useful  in 
determining depths to bedrock, the geometry of the basin and locating geological structures, and takes advantage of density 
contrasts in the subsurface, such as those between bedrock (gravity high) and alluvial sediments (gravity low).  The gravity 
survey  at  Copper  Springs  is  expected  to  allow  Desert  Star  to  model  the  interface  between  the  Precambrian  to  Laramide 
bedrock and the modern sedimentary basin-fill.  Prospective host rocks lie beneath the latter.  The survey is also expected to 
identify major faults and lithological contacts which will be used to guide exploration drilling.  
 
Red Top, USA 
 
On  September  3,  2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  Red  Top  property 
located  in  Arizona,  USA.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  the  Company  must  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue 
350,000 common shares, incur exploration expenditures of not less than an aggregate US$5,000,000 in the first seven years 
and  make  AMR  payments  based  on  the  value  of  380,000  pounds  of  copper  in  the  first  seven  years.  In  addition,  various 
payments  are  to  be  made  upon  specified  milestones,  including  completion  of  a  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  a 
decision to develop a mine and commencement of commercial mining. The payments will be based on the value of various 
quantities of copper and certain of the payments will be considered to be AMR payments. Each of the AMR payments shall 
be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being brought into commercial production. Desert Star may purchase 
one-fifth of the royalty at any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
 
As  at  October  31,  2014,  the  Company  has  issued  350,000  common  shares,  incurred  $231,389  in  exploration  activities, 
primarily on general costs of the property, consulting, and geophysical survey and paid $23,584 in AMRs. A further $48,232 
in AMRs has been paid subsequent to the end of the period. 
 
In June 2014 the Company completed a 12-day exploration field program on its Red Top property, which included geological 
mapping, sampling and an alteration study utilizing Terraspec analysis, and has delineated a 1,400 meter by 1,500 meter zone 
of intense illite ± pyrophyllite alteration.  The Company interprets this alteration zone to be the upper portion of a porphyry 
system. 
 
The  exploration  program  consisted  of  1:5000  scale  geological  mapping  and  sampling  as  well  as  a  short  wave  infrared 
alteration  study  using  a  Terraspec  4®  Mineral  Analyzer.    The  Terraspec  is  able  to  identify  minerals  (often  clays)  that  are 
indistinguishable by visual inspection, and which can provide vectors towards mineralization in distal porphyry to epithermal 
settings.  The objective of the field program was to advance Red Top to the drill testing stage. 
 
Two IP surveys were completed at Red Top in October 2014 which consisted of a Volterra 3D Distributed Diamond Array 
survey and a Volterra-2D Survey.  The surveys were completed in order to increase confidence in the location, geometry and 
intensity of the geophysical anomaly first identified in June, 2014.  The surveys identified a large Induced Polarization (“IP”) 
geophysical  anomaly  which,  together  with  the  lithological,  alteration  and  geochemical  data  the  Company  previously 
generated represents a high quality porphyry copper drill target for Desert Star.  The parameters of the Volterra-3D Survey 
included a 112-meter distributed diamond array with a line spacing of 300 meters and a station spacing of 100 meters (line 
azimuth 090˚).  The Volterra-2D line with an active array 350 meters in length has an azimuth of 330˚ and a station spacing 
of 50 meters. 
 
The  IP  anomaly  is  characterized  by  a  chargeability/resistivity  pattern  typical  of  porphyry  systems,  and  occurs  primarily 
within prospective Pinal Schist.  The IP anomaly is consistent in size, geometry and position with a west-southwest plunging 
porphyry copper target, consistent with previous geologic mapping. 
 
Alan  J.  Wainwright,  Ph.D.,  P.Geo.  is  a  Qualified  Person  as  defined  by  National  Instrument  43-101  and  has  reviewed  and 
approved the exploration information and technical disclosure in this MD&A.

Loss for the quarter 
 
Consulting  fees  comprise  expenditures  on  geological  and  accounting  services.  Interest  expense  arises  from  loans  and 
convertible  notes  as  discussed  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  below.  Management  fees  increased  in  2014  over 2013  as a 
result of increased activity relating to the Company’s Arizona properties.  Office and miscellaneous costs in the 2014 period 
included  approximately  $4,100  for  website  development,  $3,000  for  minor  equipment  purchases,  $18,250  for  leasehold 
expenses  related  to  new  office  accommodation,  $2,400  for  training  courses  and  $4,000  for  shareholder  communications. 
Professional fees comprise expenditures on legal services received. The reduction from the 2013 costs was as a result of the 
legal  costs  related  to  arbitration  on  the  Company’s  former  Nassile  property  incurred  in  that  period.  The  company  incurred 
$24,744  on  corporate  marketing  in  the  2014  period.  All  other  material  costs  are  comparable  with  the  previous  period  and 
proportionate to the level of activity of the Company. 
 
During the quarter ended October 31, 2014, the company incurred a loss of $170,254, compared with a loss of $217,601 in 
the  comparative  period  in  2013.  Consulting  fees  reduced  from  $11,500  in  2013  to  $2,180  in  2014  and  interest  expense 
reduced from $35,655 to $27,028. Management fees were $29,250 in the 2014 quarter, up from $10,500 in 2013 and office 
and miscellaneous costs were $29,202, up from  $2,806 for the reasons discussed above.  Professional fees, comprising legal 
costs,  reduced  from  $62,368  in  2013  to  $24,217  in  2014  as  a  result  of  arbitration  in  2013.  All  other  material  costs  are 
comparable with the previous year.

Desert  Star  does  not  currently  own  or  have  an  interest  in  any  producing  resource  properties  and  has  not  yet  derived  any 
revenues from the sale of  mineral property interests in the last three financial  years.   The Company’s exploration activities 
have been funded through the issuance of common shares pursuant to private placements, the exercise of stock options and 
warrants and loan financing. The Company expects that it will continue to be able to utilize this source of financing until it 
develops cash flow from its operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to obtain required 
financing  in  the  future  on  acceptable  terms,  or  at  all.  As  of  October  31,  2014,  the  Company  had  working  deficiency  of 
$861,030,  primarily  as  a  result  of  loan  and  convertible  note  financings  which  mature  in  August  and  September  2015.  The 
Company has not earned cash from operations in the past nor does it expect to in future periods. 
 
In September 2014, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement of $495,000 of convertible notes of the Company. 
The  convertible  notes  will  be  outstanding  for  a  period  of  one  year  from  the  date  of  issuance  and  bear  interest  of  12%  per 
annum calculated and payable quarterly. The lenders may convert at any time, all or a portion of the principal into units of the 
Company. Each unit consists  of one common share of the Company and one transferable common share purchase  warrant. 
Each warrant is exercisable into one common share in the capital of the Company for a period of one year from the date of 
issue, at an exercise price of $0.25 per warrant share.
In  August  2012,  the  Company  borrowed  $500,000  from  an  arm’s  length  party.  The  loan  bears  interest  at  10%  per  annum 
compounded annually and was repayable on maturity on August 13, 2014. The Company issued 833,335 common shares at a 
value of $0.15 per share as bonus shares and 200,000 units at a value of $0.248 per unit as a finder’s fee in connection with 
the loan.  In September 2014, the  Company  negotiated an extension  with  the  lender. $245,000 of the balance owing by the 
Company was rolled into convertible notes of the Company as discussed above. The lender has agreed to defer the maturity 
date of the balance of the loan amounting to $360,000 and accrued interest for one year.
On November 25, 2014, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Providence Resources Corp. (“Providence”), which 
sets out the terms of a proposed amalgamation of the two companies pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations 
Act (British Columbia). Providence, which is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, is an exploration stage company engaged 
in  the  evaluation  and  exploration  of  its  interests  in  mineral  properties  located  in  south-eastern  British  Columbia.  The 
Company  and  Providence,  which  has  approximately  $1.4  million  of  cash  on  hand,  are  related  parties  by  way  of  common 
directors and officers.
The proposed share exchange ratios for which the existing common shares of the respective amalgamating companies will be 
exchanged for shares of a new entity (“Amalco”) are as follows:
(a) 
for  every  one  common  share  of  Providence,  shareholders  will  receive  approximately  0.3  of  an  Amalco  common 
share  and  0.3  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole  warrant,  an  “Amalco  Warrant”).  Each  Amalco 
Warrant  will entitle the  holder to acquire an additional share of  Amalco (an  “Amalco  Warrant Share”)  for a period of two 
years at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share; and
(b)
for every one common share of the Company, shareholders will receive one Amalco common share.
The proposed amalgamation is subject to the approval of the shareholders of  the Company and Providence and the approval 
of  applicable  regulatory  authorities.  The  amalgamating  companies  plan  on  holding  special  meetings  of  their  respective 
shareholders on such a date as agreed to with regulators to consider the proposed amalgamation and matters related thereto. 
The  proposed  amalgamation  will  require  the  statutory  approval  of  at  least  two  thirds  of  the  shareholders  of  each  company 
voting on the matters.
In connection with the proposed amalgamation, Providence advanced the Company $250,000 as an unsecured, non-interest 
bearing loan which will be fully refundable to the Company within 30 business days if the proposed amalgamation does not 
complete.
On  November  26,  2014,  the  company  announced  that  it  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  complete  a  private  placement  for  gross 
proceeds  of  up  to  $1,500,000  through  the  issuance  of  units  at  a  price  of  $0.15  per  unit.    Each  unit  is  comprised  of  one
common share and one common share purchase warrant.  Each warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional share of 
the Company for a period of two years from the date of issuance at a price of $0.25 per share.
The  funds  from  both  the  proposed  amalgamation  and  financing  will  be  used  for  further  exploration  of  the  company’s 
properties, for general and administrative expenses and for general working capital.

The Company does not have any investor relations arrangements. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
The  Company  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  which  may  affect  the  Company’s  current  or  future 
operations or conditions.

Financial Instruments 
 
Desert Star’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, trade payables and loans payable. Unless otherwise noted, it 
is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these 
financial  instruments.    The  fair  value  of  these  financial  instruments  is  approximately  equal  to  their  carrying  values.  As  at 
October  31,  2014  the  Company  has  $81,378  in  cash  held  in  Canadian  dollars.  The  Company  does  not  use  derivative 
instruments or foreign exchange contracts to hedge against gains or losses arising from foreign exchange fluctuations. 
 
Capital Management 
 
The Company’s objectives when managing capital is to maintain sufficient capital for potential investment opportunities and 
to pursue generative exploration opportunities. The Company from time to time will issue new shares to fund specific project 
initiatives.  The  Company  considers  its  cash  to  be  its  manageable  capital.    The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  sufficient 
cash and deposit balances to cover operating and exploration costs over a reasonable future period.  The Company accesses 
capital markets through equity issues as necessary and may also acquire additional funds where advantageous circumstances 
arise. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  International  Accounting  Standard  (“IAS”)  39  “Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition  and  Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized  cost  or  fair  value,  replacing  the  multiple  rules  in  IAS  39.  The  approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how  an  entity 
manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its  business  model  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the 
financial assets.
The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the multiple impairment methods in IAS 39.  
The proposed effective date of IFRS 9 is for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
Financial statement presentation
The  Company  has  not  early  adopted  these  revised  standards  and  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  these  standards  will 
have on its consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but have future effective 
dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Forward Looking Statements 
 
This  discussion  includes  certain  forward  looking  statements  with  respect  to  various  issues  including  upcoming  events. 
Forward  looking  statements  are  statements  that  are  not  historical  facts  and  are  generally,  but  not  always,  identified  by  the 
words “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”, “projects”, “potential” and similar expressions, or 
that  events  or  conditions  “will”,  “would”,  “may”,  “could”  or  “should”  occur.    Although  the  Company  believes  the 
expectations  expressed  in  such  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  reasonable  assumptions,  such  statements  are  not 
guarantees of future results and actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking statements.  Factors that 
could  cause  the  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  in  forward-looking  statements  include  market  prices,
exploitation  and  exploration  success,  continued  availability  of  capital  and  financing  and  general  economic,  market  or 
business conditions. Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future results and actual results or 
developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are 
based  on  the  beliefs,  estimates  and  opinions  of  Desert  Star’s  management  on  the  date  the  statements  are  made.  Mineral 
exploration is subject to a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge, and careful evaluation 
may  fail  to  overcome.  Exploration  activities  seldom  result  in  the  discovery  of  a  commercially  viable  mineral  resource. 
Exploration activities are also expensive.  Desert Star will therefore require additional financing to carry on its business, and 
such financing may not be available when it is needed.  Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, Desert Star 
expressly disclaims any intention and assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in the event 
that  management’s  beliefs,  estimates  or  opinions,  or  other  factors,  should  change,  whether  as  a  result  of  new  information, 
future events or otherwise.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Providence Resources Corp.: 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  statements  of  Providence  Resources  Corp.,  which  comprise  the 
statements  of  financial  position  as  at  September  30,  2014  and  2013,  and  the  statements  of  comprehensive  loss, 
changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. 
 
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  conducted  our 
audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement.  
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, 
the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity's  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  entity's  internal  control.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence that we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
 
In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Providence 
Resources Corp. as at September 30, 2014 and 2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Without  qualifying  our  opinion,  we  draw  attention  to  Note  1  in  the  financial  statements  which  describe  certain 
conditions that indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

Providence Resources Corp. 
Notes to the financial statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
For the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 
 
1.
2.
Nature and continuance of operations 
Providence Resources Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act of 
the Province of British Columbia on September 15, 2006.  The Company is engaged in the acquisition and 
development of mineral properties in British Columbia, Canada.  The Company’s shares are traded on the 
TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX‐V”) under the symbol “PV”. 
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at 1030 West Georgia 
Street, Suite 717, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.  
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  assumes  that  the 
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for 
the foreseeable future.  The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise 
adequate financing to develop its mineral property, and to commence profitable operations in the future.  
To date, the Company has not generated any revenue and is considered to be in the exploration stage. 
Management’s  plan  includes  continuing  to  pursue  additional  sources  of  financing  through  equity 
offerings, seeking joint venture partners to fund exploration, monitoring exploration activity and reducing 
overhead costs.  As a result of its plans, management expects that the Company will have sufficient capital 
to  fund  operations  and  keeps  its  mineral  property  in  good  standing  for  the  upcoming  fiscal  year.  The 
financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of 
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be 
unable to continue in existence.  
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation 
The financial statements were authorized for issue on December 3, 2014 by the directors of the Company. 
Statement of compliance  
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations of 
the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). 
 
Basis of preparation 
The  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  and  are  based  on 
historical costs, modified where applicable.  The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars 
unless otherwise noted. 
Significant estimates and assumptions  
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make estimates 
and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.    The  Company’s  management  reviews  these  estimates  and 
underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on  experience  and  other  factors,  including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Revisions to 
estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the estimates are revised. 
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities.

Significant judgments 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  the  Company  to  make 
judgments,  apart  from  those  involving  estimates,  in  applying  accounting  policies.    The  most  significant 
judgments applied in preparing the Company’s financial statements include: 
 
‐
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; and 
The classification / allocation of expenditures as exploration and valuation expenditures or operating 
expenses.
‐
Foreign currency translation 
The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars.  Foreign denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated to their Canadian dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed 
at the balance sheet date.  Non‐monetary items are translated at historical exchange rates.  Revenue and 
expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year.  Exchange gains or losses arising on 
foreign currency translation are included in the determination of operating results for the year.   
Exploration and evaluation expenditures 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  include  the  costs  of  acquiring  licenses,  costs  associated  with 
exploration and evaluation activity, and the fair value (at acquisition date) of exploration and evaluation 
assets acquired in a business combination. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalized. Costs 
incurred before the Company has obtained the legal rights to explore an area are recognized in profit or 
loss. Government tax credits received are recorded as a reduction to the cumulative costs incurred and 
capitalized on the related property. 
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  if  (i)  sufficient  data  exists  to  determine 
technical  feasibility  and  commercial  viability,  and  (ii)  facts  and  circumstances  suggest  that  the  carrying 
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of 
interest are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first 
tested for impairment and then reclassified to mining property and development assets within property, 
plant and equipment.  
Recoverability of the carrying amount of any exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful 
development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest. 
Share‐based payments 
The Company operates a stock option plan. Share‐based payments to employees are measured at the fair 
value of the instruments issued and amortized over the vesting periods.  Share‐based payments to non‐
employees  are  measured  at the fair  value of goods  or  services  received  or  the fair  value  of  the  equity 
instruments issued, if it is determined the fair value of the goods or services cannot be reliably measured, 
and are recorded at the date the goods or services are received.  The corresponding amount is recorded 
to  the  share‐based  payment  reserve.    The  fair  value  of  options  is  determined  using  the  Black–Scholes 
pricing model.  The number of shares and options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of 
each  reporting  period  such  that  the  amount  recognized  for  services  received  as  consideration  for  the 
equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.

Loss per share 
The Company uses the treasury stock method for the computation and disclosure of loss per share.  The 
treasury  stock  method  is  used  to  determine  the  dilutive  effect  of  stock  options  and  other  dilutive 
instruments  which  assume  that  proceeds  received  from  in‐the‐money  stock  options  are  used  to 
repurchase common shares at the prevailing market rate. 
Basic  and  diluted  net  loss  per  share  is  calculated  using  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares 
outstanding during the period.  Diluted loss per share figures are equal to those of basic loss per share for 
each period since the effects of the stock options and other dilutive instruments have been excluded as 
they are anti‐dilutive. 
Financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or 
loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held‐to‐maturity  investments,  available‐for‐sale  and  financial  liabilities.  The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.  
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss when they are either held for trading for 
the  purpose  of  short‐term  profit  taking,  derivatives  not  held  for  hedging  purposes,  or  when  they  are 
designated as such to avoid an accounting mismatch or to enable performance evaluation where a group 
of financial assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance with a 
documented  risk  management  or  investment  strategy.  Such  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair 
value with changes in carrying value being included in profit or loss.   
Loans and receivables are non‐derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are included in 
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These 
are classified as non‐current assets.   
Held‐to‐maturity investments are non‐derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or 
determinable payments, and it is the Company’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost.  Held‐to‐maturity investments are included in non‐current 
assets, except for those which are expected to mature within 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period.   
Available‐for‐sale financial assets are non‐derivative financial assets that are designated as available‐for‐
sale or are not suitable to be classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables  or  held‐to‐maturity  investments  and  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.    These  are 
included in current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive loss, except 
for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Non‐derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortized cost.   
The  Company’s  financial  instruments  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  marketable 
securities and accounts payable.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are measured at face 
value, representing fair value, and are classified as held‐for‐trading.  Receivables, which are measured at 
amortized cost, are classified as loans and receivables.  Accounts payable are measured at amortized cost 
and classified as other financial liabilities.   
The Company does not have any derivative financial assets and liabilities.

Impairment of assets  
The carrying amount of the Company’s assets (which include equipment and exploration and evaluation 
assets) is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss.   An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its 
cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement 
of income and comprehensive income. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of an asset’s fair 
value  less  cost  to  sell  and  value  in  use.  In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre‐tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  the  current  market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not 
generate  cash  inflows  largely  independent  of  those  from  other  assets,  the  recoverable  amount  is 
determined for the cash‐generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
An impairment loss is only reversed if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, however, not 
to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognized in previous years.  
Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  not  subject  to  amortization  and  are  tested  annually  for 
impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  deposit  and  short‐term,  highly  liquid  interest  bearing 
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. 
Income taxes 
Current income tax: 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount  are  those  that  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted,  at  the  reporting  date,  in  the  countries 
where the Company operates and generates taxable income. 
Current  income  tax  relating to  items  recognized directly in  other comprehensive  income  or  equity  is 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically 
evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax: 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  using  the  asset  and  liaiblity  method  on  temporary  differences  at  the 
reporting  date  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial 
reporting purposes. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Significant accounting policies and basis for presentation (cont’d) 
Income taxes (cont’d)
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  offset,  if  a  legally  enforceable  right 
exists  to  set  off  current  tax assets  against current  income  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  income  taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Flow‐through shares: 
On the issuance of flow‐through shares, any premium received in excess of the closing market price of the 
Company’s common shares is initially recorded as a liability (“flow‐through tax liability”) and included in 
trade  payables  and  accrued  liabilities.    Provided  that  the  Company  has  renounced  the  related 
expenditures, or that there is a reasonable expectation that it will do so, the flow‐through tax liability is 
reduced on a pro‐rata basis as the expenditures are incurred and a deferred tax liability is recognized.  The 
reduction to the flow‐through tax liability is recognized in profit or loss as other income.   
To  the  extent  that  the  Company  has  suitable  unrecognized  deductible  temporary  differences,  an 
offsetting recovery of deferred income taxes would be recorded.

Equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective 
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  IAS  39  “Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how 
an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single impairment method to 
be  used,  replacing  the  multiple  impairment  methods  in  IAS  39.    IFRS  9  is  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The adaptation of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an impact on the 
Company’s financial statements.  
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” 
Amendments  to  IAS  32,  “Financial  Instruments:  Presentation”,  which  addresses  inconsistencies  when 
applying the offsetting requirements, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2014. 
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but 
have future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Company’s financial statements.

Iron Range Property  
 
Pursuant  to  an  option  agreement  dated  June  3,  2010,  the  Company  earned  a  60%  interest  in  the  Iron 
Range Project located near Creston, British Columbia, Canada and, entered into a 60/40 joint venture with 
the optionor. 
 
On  November  12,  2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  asset  purchase  and  sale  agreement  to  sell  its 
interest  in  the  Iron  Range  Property  to  its  original  optionor  (the  “Buyer”).  The  sale  was  completed  on 
January 16, 2014 and the Company received the following as consideration for its 60% interest: 
‐
The Buyer issued 500,000 common shares of the Buyer to the Company with a fair value of $37,500 
(Note 6);  
The Buyer returned 900,000 common shares of the Company (with a fair value of $49,500) (Note 10), 
which were issued to the Buyer as partial consideration for earning in its interest in the joint venture; 
and  
The Buyer granted to the Company a royalty equal to 1% on net smelter returns on the property.
‐ 
During the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company completed an equity financing of $4,000,000.  
Under  the  terms  the  equity  financing,  the  Company  was  required  to  spend  $3,400,000  on  exploration 
expenditures  on  the  Iron  Range  Property.    Prior  to  selling  its  interest  in  the  Iron  Range  Property  the 
Company incurred $3,014,242 in exploration expenditures on the Iron Range Property.  On September 18, 
2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  whereby  the  remainder  of  the  funds,  of  $385,758,  are 
required to be spent on a mineral property agreed to between the two parties.  No funds have been spent

Financial risk and capital management 
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of 
Directors  approves  and  monitors  the  risk  management  processes,  inclusive  of  documented  investment 
policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the 
way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:  
 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash and 
cash equivalents held in bank accounts. The cash and cash equivalents are deposited in bank accounts 
held with a major bank in Canada.  As the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by one bank 
there is a concentration of credit risk.  This risk is managed by using a major bank that is a high credit 
quality financial institution as determined by rating agencies.  The Company’s secondary exposure to risk 
is on its receivables. This risk is minimal as receivables consist primarily of refundable government goods 
and services taxes.

Financial risk and capital management (cont’d) 
Currency Risk 
Currency  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will  fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Company does not incur significant expenditures that 
are denominated in foreign currencies, and does not have any mineral property commitments that are 
denominated  in  foreign  currencies.    Therefore,  the  Company’s  exposure  to  currency  risk  is  considered 
minimal. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Interest  rate  risk  refers  to  the  risk  that  fair  values  of  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as cash 
and cash equivalents earn interest income at variable rates.  A 1% change in the interest rate will increase 
or decrease the net loss approximately $14,000. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises through the excess of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any 
point in time.  The Company’s objective in managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available 
reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements.  As at September 30, 2014, the Company was holding 
cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  $1,439,975.  Consequently  liquidity  risk  for  the  upcoming  financial  year  is 
considered to be minimal.  
Capital Management 
The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence and to sustain future development of its business. The Company Considered common shares 
and working capital as capital. 
There  were  no  changes  in  the  Company’s  approach  to  capital  management  during  the  period.  The 
Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
Fair value 
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount. 
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy  according  to  the  relative  reliability  of  the  inputs  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values.  The  three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
 


Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  either 
directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Financial instruments classified as level 1 include cash and cash equivalents.

Subsequent events 
Proposed amalgamation 
On  November  25,  2014,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Letter  of  Intent  with  Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd. 
(“Desert Star”), which sets out the terms of a proposed amalgamation of the two companies pursuant to 
the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Desert Star, which is listed on the TSX‐
V, is a mineral exploration company focused on the identification, acquisition and development of copper 
and gold projects located in the southwestern USA. The Company and Desert Star are related parties by 
way of common directors and officers. 
The  proposed  share  exchange  ratios  for  which  the  existing  common  shares  of  the  respective 
amalgamating companies will be exchanged for shares of a new entity (“Amalco”) are as follows: 
(a)
for every one common share of the Company, shareholders will receive approximately 0.3 of an 
Amalco  common  share  and  0.3  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole 
warrant,  an  “Amalco  Warrant”).  Each  Amalco  Warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  acquire  an 
additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a price of 
$0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share; and 
for  every  one  common  share  of  Desert  Star,  shareholders  will  receive  one  Amalco  common 
share.
(b) 
 
The proposed amalgamation is subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company and Desert 
Star and the approval of applicable regulatory authorities. The amalgamating companies plan on holding 
special meetings of their respective shareholders on such a date as agreed to with regulators to consider 
the  proposed amalgamation  and  matters  related  thereto.  The  proposed  amalgamation  will  require  the 
statutory approval of at least two thirds of the shareholders of each company voting on the matters. 
In connection with the proposed amalgamation, the Company will advance Desert Star $250,000 as an 
unsecured, non‐interest bearing loan which will be fully refundable to the Company within 30 business 
days if the proposed amalgamation does not complete. 
Investment 
On November 25, 2014, the Company subscribed for 1.5 million units of Black Sea Copper and Gold Corp. 
(“Black  Sea”)  at  $0.20  per  unit  (each  a  “Unit”)  for  a  total  consideration  of  $300,000.  Each  Unit  is 
comprised of one common share and one half of one share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”). Each 
whole Warrant is exercisable to acquire an additional common share of the Black Sea at a price of $0.50 
per  share  for  period  of  five  years.  Black  Sea  is  a  private  mineral  exploration  company  focused  on  the 
identification, acquisition and development of copper and gold projects located in Eastern Europe.  The 
Company and Black Sea are related parties by way of common directors and officers.

requirements of the option agreement with Eagle Plains. In accordance with the option agreement, a formal  joint venture 
agreement was executed between the Company and the Eagle Plains.  
 
The Company undertook various exploration programs during the period from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate the potential of the 
Property. After extensive analysis of the results of the programs, the Company concluded that it would not undertake any 
further exploration work on the Property.  On November 12, 2013, the Company entered into an asset purchase and  sale 
agreement  to  sell  its  interest  in  the  Property  to  its  original  optionor,  Eagle  Plains.  The  transaction  was  completed  on 
January 16, 2014 after receiving the approval of the TSX-Venture Exchange and an exemption order granted by the British 
Columbia Securities Commission. 
 
The purchase price paid by Eagle Plains consisted of the following:
 


Eagle Plains issued 500,000 common shares to the Company;  
Eagle  Plains  returned  900,000  common  shares  of  the  Company,  which  were  issued  to  Eagle  Plains  as  partial 
consideration for earning in its interest in the joint venture; and  
Eagle Plains granted to the Company a royalty equal to 1% on net smelter returns on the property.
Kokanee Creek Property 
 
Providence and Eagle Plains entered into an option agreement on May 15, 2013 whereby Providence may earn an interest 
in the Kokanee Creek poly-metallic property, located in south-eastern British Columbia approximately 20km NE of Nelson.
Under terms of the agreement, Providence has the option to earn a 60% interest in the property by completing $3,000,000 
in exploration expenditures, making $260,000 in cash payments and issuing 1,000,000 common shares to Eagle Plains over 
5 years.

Consulting  fees  increased  as  a  result  of  ongoing  geological  services  provided  to  the  Company.  Office  and  miscellaneous 
costs  decreased  as  a  result  of  cost-cutting  measures  undertaken,  including  insurance  premiums,  promotional  efforts  and 
general resource property costs. Transfer agent and  filing fee costs and professional fees increased in the current  period 
due  to  fees  related  to  the  disposal  of  the  Iron  Range  Property,  which  was  written  down  in  2013.  Share-based  payments 
reflect the value assigned to stock options granted during the 2013 period. No options were granted in 2014. Other income 
comprises tax credits and fees earned in the operation of the joint venture on the Iron Range Property which commenced 
in 2012. Interest income primarily reflects the amounts earned from funds on deposit. The increase in 2014 period reflects 
interest on a mineral exploration tax credit received.  
 
Providence incurred a loss of $149,267 before income taxes during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 compared to a 
loss of $4,015,362 for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. The primary reason for the decrease was the write-down of 
the  Iron  Range  Property  amounting  to  $3,881,138  in  2013  as  discussed  above.    Interest  income  from  funds  on  deposit 
amounted to $4,387 in 2014 and $5,285 in 2013. Management fees and geological consulting fees increased from $91,000 
in 2013 to $99,500 in 2013. The Company recorded an unrealized loss on investments of $5,000 in the 2014 quarter with no 
such charge in 2013.  Other  expenses, including office  expenses, professional  fees,  investor relations, regulatory fees and 
travel, in total was approximately equal in 2014 and 2013.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Providence does not currently own or have an interest in any producing resource properties and has not yet derived any 
revenues  from  the  sale  of  resource  products.  The  Company  has  to  date  relied  on  equity  financing  for  its  activities. 
Providence’s  exploration  activities  have  been  funded  through  the  issuance  of  common  shares  pursuant  to  private 
placements and the exercise of stock options and warrants, and Providence expects that it will continue to be able to utilize 
this  source  of  financing  to  further  develop  resources.  The  Company  anticipates  that  sufficient  funds  and  other  current 
assets are available to meet its project and administrative obligations for the short term. The Company continues to closely 
monitor  its  ongoing  requirements  and  to  explore  all  methods  of  raising  additional  funds.  There  can  be  no  certainty  that 
such  additional  funds  may  be  raised  when  required.  At  September  30,  2014,  the  Company  had  net  working  capital  of 
$1,501,740.
During the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company completed an equity financing of $4,000,000.  Under the terms 
the  equity  financing,  the  Company  was  required  to  spend  $3,400,000  on  exploration  expenditures  on  the  Iron  Range 
Property.  Prior to selling its interest in the Iron Range Property as discussed above, the Company had incurred $3,014,242 
in exploration expenditures on the Property.  On September 18, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement whereby 
the remainder of the funds of $385,758 are required to be spent on a mineral property agreed to between the two parties.  
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
Providence  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  which  may  affect  its  current  or  future  operations  or 
conditions.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
about  future  events  that  affect  amounts  reported  in  the  financial  statements.    Actual  results  could  differ  from  these 
estimates.    Details  of  the  Company’s  significant  accounting  policies  can  be  found  in  Note  2  of  the  audited  financial 
statements for the year ended September 30, 2014.

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective 
 
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
 
This new standard is a partial replacement of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.  IFRS 9 uses a 
single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple 
rules  in  IAS  39.  The  approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how an  entity  manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its 
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single 
impairment method to be used, replacing the multiple impairment methods in IAS 39.  IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods 
beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2015.    The  adaptation  of  IFRS  9  is  not  expected  to  have  an  impact  on  the  Company’s 
financial statements. 
 
Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” 
 
Amendments  to  IAS  32,  “Financial  Instruments:  Presentation”,  which  addresses  inconsistencies  when  applying  the 
offsetting requirements, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014.  
 
Other  accounting  standards  or  amendments  to  existing  accounting  standards  that  have  been  issued  but  have  future 
effective  dates  are  either  not  applicable  or  are  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial 
statements.

Risk Factors 
 
Exploration-stage  mineral  exploration  companies  face  a  variety  of  risks  and,  while  unable  to  eliminate  all  of  them, 
Providence aims at managing and reducing such risks as much as possible.  Few  exploration projects successfully achieve 
development  stage,  due  to  factors  that  cannot  be  predicted  or  anticipated,  and  even  one  such  factor  may  result  in  the 
economic  viability  of  a  project  being  detrimentally  impacted  such  that  it  is  neither  feasible  nor  practical  to  proceed.  
Providence closely monitors its activities and those factors that could impact them, and employs experienced consultants to 
assist in its risk management and to make timely adequate decisions. 
 
Environmental  laws  and  regulations  could  also  impact  the  viability  of  a  project.    Providence  has  ensured  that  it  has 
complied with these regulations, but there can be changes in legislation outside Providence’s control that could also add a 
risk factor to a project.   
 
Subsequent events
Proposed amalgamation
On November 25, 2014, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Desert Star Resources Ltd. (“Desert Star”), which 
sets  out  the  terms  of  a  proposed  amalgamation  of  the  two  companies  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Business 
Corporations Act (British Columbia). Desert Star, which is listed on the TSX-V, is a mineral exploration company focused on 
the identification, acquisition and development of copper and gold projects located in the southwestern USA. The Company 
and Desert Star are related parties by way of common directors and officers.
The proposed share exchange ratios for which the existing common shares of the respective amalgamating companies will 
be exchanged for shares of a new entity (“Amalco”) are as follows:
(a) 
for every one common share of the Company, shareholders will receive approximately 0.3 of an Amalco common 
share and 0.3 of a common share purchase warrant of Amalco (each whole warrant, an “Amalco Warrant”). Each Amalco 
Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire an additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two 
years at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share; and
(b)
for every one common share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive one Amalco common
share.
The  proposed  amalgamation  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Company  and  Desert  Star  and  the 
approval  of  applicable  regulatory  authorities.  The  amalgamating  companies  plan  on  holding  special  meetings  of  their 
respective shareholders on such a date as agreed to with regulators to consider the proposed amalgamation and matters 
related thereto. The proposed amalgamation will require the statutory approval of at least two thirds of the shareholders of 
each company voting on the matters.
In  connection  with  the  proposed  amalgamation,  the  Company  will  advance  Desert  Star  $250,000  as  an  unsecured,  non-
interest bearing loan which will be fully refundable to the Company within 30 business days if the proposed amalgamation 
does not complete.
Investment
On November 25, 2014, the Company subscribed for 1.5 million units of Black Sea Copper and Gold Corp. (“Black Sea”) at 
$0.20 per unit (each a “Unit”) for a total consideration of $300,000. Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one 
half of one share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”). Each whole Warrant is exercisable to acquire an additional common 
share  of  the  Black  Sea  at  a  price  of  $0.50  per  share  for  period  of  five  years.  Black  Sea  is  a  private  mineral  exploration 
company focused on the identification, acquisition and development of copper and gold projects located in Eastern Europe.  
The Company and Black Sea are related parties by way of common directors and officers. 
 
Approval 
 
The Board of Directors of the Company approved the disclosure contained in this MD&A on December 3, 2014.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Providence Resources Corp. 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  statements  of  Providence  Resources  Corp.,  which  comprises  of  the 
statements  of  financial  position  as  at  September  30,  2013  and  2012,  and  the  statements  of  comprehensive  loss, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
 
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits. We  conducted  our 
audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement.  
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, 
the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity's  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  entity's  internal  control.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence that we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
 
In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Providence 
Resources Corp. as at September 30, 2013 and 2012, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements which describe 
certain  conditions  that  indicate  the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  about  the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Nature and continuance of operations 
Providence Resources Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act of 
the Province of British Columbia on September 15, 2006.  The Company is engaged in the acquisition and 
development of mineral properties in British Columbia, Canada.  
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at 1030 West Georgia 
Street, Suite 918, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.  
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  assumes  that  the 
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for 
the foreseeable future.  The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise 
adequate financing to develop its mineral property, and to commence profitable operations in the future.  
To date, the Company has not generated any revenue and is considered to be in the exploration stage. 
Management’s  plan  includes  continuing  to  pursue  additional  sources  of  financing  through  equity 
offerings, seeking joint venture partners to fund exploration, monitoring exploration activity and reducing 
overhead costs.  As a result of its plans, management expects that the Company will have sufficient capital 
to  fund  operations  and  keeps  its  mineral  property  in  good  standing  for  the  upcoming  fiscal  year.  The 
financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of 
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be 
unable to continue in existence.   
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation 
The financial statements were authorized for issue on January 16, 2014 by the directors of the Company. 
Statement of compliance  
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Interpretations of 
the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). 
 
Basis of preparation 
The  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  and  are  based  on 
historical costs, modified where applicable.  The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars 
unless otherwise noted. 
 
Significant estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make estimates 
and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.    The  Company’s  management  reviews  these  estimates  and 
underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on  experience  and  other  factors,  including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Revisions to 
estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the estimates are revised. 
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities. 
Significant judgments 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  the  Company  to  make 
judgments,  apart  from  those  involving  estimates,  in  applying  accounting  policies.    The  most  significant 
judgments applied in preparing the Company’s financial statements include:

Significant accounting policies and basis for presentation (cont’d) 
Significant judgments (cont’d) 
-
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; and 
The classification / allocation of expenditures as exploration and valuation expenditures or operating 
expenses.
-
Foreign currency translation 
The financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars.  Foreign denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated to their Canadian dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed 
at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary items are translated at historical exchange rates.  Revenue and 
expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year.  Exchange gains or losses arising on 
foreign currency translation are included in the determination of operating results for the year.   
Exploration and evaluation expenditures 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  include  the  costs  of  acquiring  licenses,  costs  associated  with 
exploration and evaluation activity, and the fair value (at acquisition date) of exploration and evaluation 
assets acquired in a business combination. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalized. Costs 
incurred before the Company has obtained the legal rights to explore an area are recognized in profit or 
loss. Government tax credits received are recorded as a reduction to the cumulative costs incurred and 
capitalized on the related property. 
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  if  (i)  sufficient  data  exists  to  determine 
technical  feasibility  and  commercial  viability,  and  (ii)  facts  and  circumstances  suggest  that  the  carrying 
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of 
interest are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first 
tested for impairment and then reclassified to mining property and development assets within property, 
plant and equipment.  
Recoverability of the carrying amount of any exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful 
development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a stock option plan. Share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair 
value of the instruments issued and amortized over the vesting periods.  Share-based payments to non-
employees are measured at  the fair  value of goods or  services received or the fair value of the  equity 
instruments issued, if it is determined the fair value of the goods or services cannot be reliably measured, 
and are recorded at the date the goods or services are received.  The corresponding amount is recorded 
to  the  share-based  payment  reserve.    The  fair  value  of  options  is  determined  using  the  Black–Scholes 
pricing model.  The number of shares and options expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of 
each  reporting  period  such  that  the  amount  recognized  for  services  received  as  consideration  for  the 
equity instruments granted shall be based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest. 
Loss per share 
The Company uses the treasury stock method for the computation and disclosure of loss per share.  The 
treasury  stock  method  is  used  to  determine  the  dilutive  effect  of  stock  options  and  other  dilutive 
instruments  which  assume  that  proceeds  received  from  in-the-money  stock  options  are  used  to 
repurchase common shares at the prevailing market rate.

Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation (cont’d) 
Loss per share (cont’d) 
Basic  and  diluted  net  loss  per  share  is  calculated  using  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares 
outstanding during the period.  Diluted loss per share figures are equal to those of basic loss per share for 
each period since the effects of the stock options and other dilutive instruments have been excluded as 
they are anti-dilutive. 
Financial instruments 
The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or 
loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held-to-maturity  investments,  available-for-sale  and  financial  liabilities.  The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.  
Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss when they are either held for trading for 
the  purpose  of  short-term  profit  taking,  derivatives  not  held  for  hedging  purposes,  or  when  they  are 
designated as such to avoid an accounting mismatch or to enable performance evaluation where a group 
of financial assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance with a 
documented  risk  management  or  investment  strategy.  Such  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair 
value with changes in carrying value being included in profit or loss.   
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are included in 
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These 
are classified as non-current assets.   
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or 
determinable payments, and it is the Company’s intention to hold these investments to maturity. They 
are subsequently measured at amortized cost.  Held-to-maturity investments are included in non-current 
assets, except for those which are expected to mature within 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period.   
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-
sale or are not suitable to be classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables  or  held-to-maturity  investments  and  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.    These  are 
included in current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive loss, except 
for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortized cost.   
The  Company’s  financial  instruments  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables  and  accounts 
payable.  Cash and cash equivalents are measured at face value, representing fair value, and are classified 
as  held-for-trading.    Receivables,  which  are  measured  at  amortized  cost,  are  classified  as  loans  and 
receivables.  Accounts payable are measured at amortized cost and classified as other financial liabilities.   
The Company does not have any derivative financial assets and liabilities. 
Impairment of assets  
The carrying amount of the Company’s assets (which include equipment and exploration and evaluation 
assets) is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss.   An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its

Impairment of assets (cont’d) 
cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement 
of income and comprehensive income. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of an asset’s fair 
value  less  cost  to  sell  and  value  in  use.  In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  the  current  market 
assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not 
generate  cash  inflows  largely  independent  of  those  from  other  assets,  the  recoverable  amount  is 
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
An impairment loss is only reversed if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, however, not 
to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognized in previous years.  
Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  not  subject  to  amortization  and  are  tested  annually  for 
impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  deposit  and  short-term,  highly  liquid  interest  bearing 
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. 
Income taxes 
Current income tax: 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amount  are  those  that  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted,  at  the  reporting  date,  in  the  countries 
where the Company operates and generates taxable income. 
Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity is 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically 
evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Deferred income tax: 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  using  the  balance  sheet  method  on  temporary  differences  at  the 
reporting  date  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  for  financial 
reporting purposes. 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  offset,  if  a  legally  enforceable  right 
exists to  set off current tax  assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Flow-through shares: 
On the issuance of flow-through shares, any premium received in excess of the closing market price of the 
Company’s common shares is initially recorded as a liability (“flow-through tax liability”) and included in 
trade  payables  and  accrued  liabilities.    Provided  that  the  Company  has  renounced  the  related 
expenditures, or that there is a reasonable expectation that it will do so, the flow-through tax liability is 
reduced on a pro-rata basis as the expenditures are incurred and a deferred tax liability is recognized.  The 
reduction to the flow-through tax liability is recognized in profit or loss as other income.   
To  the  extent  that  the  Company  has  suitable  unrecognized  deductible  temporary  differences,  an 
offsetting recovery of deferred income taxes would be recorded. 
Equipment 
Equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  
Equipment  is  recorded  at  cost  and  amortization  is  calculated  on  the  declining  balance  basis  at  the 
following annual rate:

Accounting standards issued by not yet effective 
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  IAS  39  “Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how 
an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial assets. 
The  new  standard  also  requires  a  single  impairment  method  to  be  used,  replacing  the  multiple 
impairment  methods  in  IAS  39.    IFRS  9  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on or  after  January  1, 
2015.  The adaptation of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.  
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but 
have future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Company’s financial statements.

Financial risk and capital management 
 
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of 
Directors  approves  and  monitors  the  risk  management  processes,  inclusive  of  documented  investment 
policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the 
way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:

Financial risk and capital management (cont’d) 
 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash and 
cash equivalents held in bank accounts. The cash and cash equivalents are deposited in bank accounts 
held with a major bank in Canada.  As the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by one bank 
there is a concentration of credit risk.  This risk is managed by using a major bank that is a high credit 
quality financial institution as determined by rating agencies.  The Company’s secondary exposure to risk 
is on its receivables.  This risk is minimal as receivables consist primarily of refundable government taxes 
and credits. 
Currency Risk 
Currency  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will  fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Company does not incur significant expenditures that 
are denominated in foreign currencies, and does not have any mineral property commitments that are 
denominated  in  foreign  currencies.    Therefore,  the  Company’s  exposure  to  currency  risk  is  considered 
minimal. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Interest  rate  risk  refers  to  the  risk  that  fair  values  of  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as cash 
and cash equivalents earn interest income at variable rates.  A 1% change in the interest rate will increase 
or decrease the net loss approximately $17,000. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises through the excess of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any 
point in time.  The Company’s objective in managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available 
reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements.  As at September 30, 2013, the Company was holding 
cash and cash equivalents of $1,667,162.  Consequently liquidity risk for the upcoming financial year is 
considered to be minimal.  
Capital Management 
The  Company's  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence and to sustain future development of its business. The Company considered common shares 
and working capital as capital. 
There were no changes in the Company's approach to capital management during the period.  
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Financial risk management (cont’d) 
Fair value 
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount. 
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy  according  to  the  relative  reliability  of  the  inputs  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values.  The  three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
• 
•
•
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  either 
directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Financial instruments classified as level 1 include cash and cash equivalents. 
 
Subsequent events

Providence Resources Corp. 
Notes to the financial statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
For the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013
1.
Nature and continuance of operations
Providence  Resources  Corp.  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  under  the  Business  Corporations  Act  of 
the Province of British Columbia on September 15, 2006.  The Company is engaged in the acquisition and 
development of mineral properties in British Columbia, Canada.  The Company’s shares are traded on the 
TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) under the symbol “PV”.
The head office, principal address and records office of the Company are located at 1030 West  Georgia 
Street, Suite 717, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2Y3.
These  condensed  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which 
assumes  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  realize  its  assets  and  discharge  its  liabilities  in  the  normal 
course of business for the foreseeable future.  The continuing operations of the Company are dependent 
upon its ability to raise adequate financing to develop its mineral property, and to commence profitable 
operations in the future.  To date, the Company has not generated any revenue and is considered to be in 
the exploration stage. Management’s plan includes continuing to pursue additional sources of financing 
through  equity  offerings,  seeking  joint  venture  partners  to  fund  exploration,  monitoring  exploration 
activity and reducing overhead costs.  As a result of its plans, management expects that the Company will 
have  sufficient  capital  to  fund  operations  and  keeps  its  mineral  property  in  good  standing  for  the 
upcoming  fiscal  year.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the 
recoverability  and  classification  of  recorded  asset  amounts  and  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be 
necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
2.
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The financial statements were authorized for issue on February 20, 2015 by the directors of the Company.
Statement of compliance
The  condensed  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International 
Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”) 
and  Interpretations  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Interpretations  Committee  (“IFRIC”). 
Therefore, these condensed interim financial statements comply with International Accounting Standards 
(“IAS”) 34 “interim Financial Reporting”. 
 
This  interim  financial  report  does  not  include  all  of  the  information  required  of  a  full  annual  financial 
report  and  is  intended  to  provide  users  with  an  update  in  relation  to  events  and  transactions  that  are 
significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Company since 
the end of the last annual reporting period. It is therefore recommended that this financial report be read 
in conjunctions with the annual financial statements of the Company for the year ended September 30, 
2014. 
 
Basis of preparation
The condensed interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared on an accrual basis and 
are based on historical costs, modified where applicable.  The condensed interim financial statements are 
presented in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.

2.
Significant accounting policies and basis for presentation (cont’d)
Significant estimates and assumptions
The preparation of condensed interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company 
to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The Company’s management reviews these 
estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  on  an  ongoing  basis,  based  on  experience  and  other  factors, 
including  expectations  of  future  events  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  
Revisions to estimates are adjusted for prospectively in the period in which the estimates are revised.
Estimates and assumptions where there is significant risk of material adjustments to assets and liabilities 
in future accounting periods include the recoverability of the carrying value of exploration and evaluation 
assets,  fair  value  measurements  for  financial  instruments,  the  recoverability  and  measurement  of 
deferred tax assets, provisions for restoration and environmental obligations and contingent liabilities.
Significant judgments
The preparation of condensed interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company 
to  make  judgments,  apart  from  those  involving  estimates,  in  applying  accounting  policies.    The  most 
significant judgments applied in preparing the Company’s financial statements include: 
 
-
The  assessment  of  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  whether  there  are 
events or conditions that may give rise to significant uncertainty; and 
The classification / allocation of expenditures as exploration and valuation expenditures or operating 
expenses.
-
3.
Accounting standards issued by not yet effective
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
This  new  standard  is  a  partial  replacement  of  IAS  39  “Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement”.    IFRS  9  uses  a  single  approach  to  determine  whether  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at 
amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how 
an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial assets.
The  new  standard  also  requires  a  single  impairment  method  to  be  used,  replacing  the  multiple 
impairment  methods  in  IAS  39.    IFRS  9  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1, 
2015.  The adaptation of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Other accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have been issued but 
have future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on 
the Company’s financial statements.

Financial risk and capital management
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of 
Directors  approves  and  monitors  the  risk  management  processes,  inclusive  of  documented  investment 
policies, counterparty limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the 
way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:  
 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss.  The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash and 
cash  equivalents  held  in  bank  accounts.  The  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  deposited  in  bank  accounts 
held  with  a  major  bank  in  Canada.    As  the  Company’s  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  held  by  one  bank 
there  is  a  concentration  of  credit  risk.    This  risk  is  managed  by  using  a  major  bank  that  is  a  high  credit 
quality financial institution as determined by rating agencies.  The Company’s secondary exposure to risk 
is on its receivables. This risk is minimal as receivables consist primarily of refundable government goods 
and services taxes.
Currency Risk
Currency  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will  fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.  The Company does not incur significant expenditures that 
are  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  and  does  not  have  any  mineral  property  commitments  that  are 
denominated  in  foreign  currencies.    Therefore,  the  Company’s  exposure  to  currency  risk  is  considered 
minimal.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest  rate  risk  refers  to  the  risk  that  fair  values  of  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as cash 
and cash equivalents earn interest income at variable rates.  A 1% change in the interest rate will increase 
or decrease the net loss approximately $8,000.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk  arises through the excess of financial obligations over available  financial assets due at any 
point in time.  The Company’s objective in managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available 
reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements.  As at December 31, 2014, the Company was holding 
cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  $826,818.  Consequently  liquidity  risk  for  the  upcoming  financial  year  is 
considered to be minimal.
Capital Management
The  Company’s  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  capital  base  so  as  to  maintain  investor  and  creditor 
confidence and to sustain future development of its business. The Company Considered common shares 
and working capital as capital.
There  were  no  changes  in  the  Company’s  approach  to  capital  management  during  the  period.  The 
Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Financial risk and capital management (cont’d)
Fair value
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amount.
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy  according  to  the  relative  reliability  of  the  inputs  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values.  The  three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
 


Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  –  Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  either 
directly or indirectly; and 
Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Financial instruments classified as level 1 include cash and cash equivalents.

Proposed amalgamation
On  November  25,  2014,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Letter  of  Intent  with  Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd. 
(“Desert Star”), which sets out the terms of a proposed amalgamation of the two companies pursuant to 
the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Desert Star, which is listed on the TSX-
V, is a mineral exploration company focused on the identification, acquisition and development of copper 
and gold projects located in the southwestern USA. The Company and Desert Star are related parties by 
way of common directors and officers.
The  proposed  share  exchange  ratios  for  which  the  existing  common  shares  of  the  respective 
amalgamating companies will be exchanged for shares of a new entity (“Amalco”) are as follows:
(a)
for every one common share of the Company, shareholders will receive approximately 0.3 of an 
Amalco  common  share  and  0.3  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole 
warrant,  an  “Amalco  Warrant”).  Each  Amalco  Warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  acquire  an 
additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a price of 
$0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share; and
(b)
for  every  one  common  share  of  Desert  Star,  shareholders  will  receive  one  Amalco  common 
share.
The  proposed  amalgamation  is  subject  to  the  approval  of the  shareholders  of  the  Company and  Desert 
Star and the approval of applicable regulatory authorities. The amalgamating companies plan on  holding 
special meetings of their respective shareholders on such a date as agreed to with regulators to consider 
the  proposed  amalgamation  and  matters  related  thereto.  The  proposed  amalgamation  will  require  the 
statutory approval of at least two thirds of the shareholders of each company voting on the matters.

Kokanee Creek Property 
 
Providence  and  Eagle  Plains  entered  into  an  option  agreement  on  May  15,  2013  whereby  Providence  may  earn  an 
interest in the Kokanee Creek poly-metallic property, located in south-eastern British Columbia approximately 20km NE 
of  Nelson.  Under  terms  of  the  agreement,  Providence  has  the  option  to  earn  a  60%  interest  in  the  property  by 
completing $3,000,000 in exploration expenditures, making $260,000 in cash payments and issuing 1,000,000 common 
shares to Eagle Plains over 5 years. 
 
Iron Range Property 
 
The Company entered into an option agreement with Eagle Plains Resources Ltd. (“Eagle Plains”) with an effective date of 
June 3, 2010 to  earn a  60% interest  in the Iron Range  Property  (the “Property”)  located near Creston, BC. The Company 
undertook  various  exploration  programs  during  the  period  from  2010  to  2012  to  evaluate  the  potential  of  the  Property. 
After  extensive  analysis  of  the  results  of  the  programs,  the  Company  concluded  that  it  would  not  undertake  any  further 
exploration  work  on  the  Property.  On  November  12,  2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  asset  purchase  and  sale 
agreement  to  sell  its  interest  in  the  Property  to  its  original  optionor,  Eagle  Plains.  The  transaction  was  completed  on
January 16, 2014 after receiving the approval of the TSX-Venture Exchange and an exemption order granted by the British 
Columbia Securities Commission. 
 
The purchase price paid by Eagle Plains consisted of the following:
 


Eagle Plains issued 500,000 common shares to the Company;  
Eagle  Plains  returned  900,000  common  shares  of  the  Company,  which  were  issued  to  Eagle  Plains  as  partial 
consideration for earning in its interest in the joint venture; and  
Eagle Plains granted to the Company a royalty equal to 1% on net smelter returns on the property.

Management fees and office and miscellaneous costs decreased as a result of cost-cutting measures undertaken, including 
insurance  premiums,  promotional  efforts  and  general  resource  property  costs.  Transfer  agent  and  filing  fee  costs  and 
professional fees decreased in the current period due to costs related to the disposal of the Iron Range Property, which was 
disposed  of  in  2013.  Interest  income  is  primarily  from  funds  on  deposit.  The  2014  period  includes  interest  on  a  mineral 
exploration tax credit received.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Providence does not currently own or have an interest in any producing resource properties and has not yet derived any 
revenues  from  the  sale  of  resource  products.  The  Company  has  to  date  relied  on  equity  financing  for  its  activities. 
Providence’s  exploration  activities  have  been  funded  through  the  issuance  of  common  shares  pursuant  to  private 
placements and the exercise of stock options and warrants, and Providence expects that it will continue to be able to utilize 
this  source  of  financing  to  further  develop  resources.  The  Company  anticipates  that  sufficient  funds  and  other  current 
assets are available to meet its project and administrative obligations for the short term. The Company continues to closely 
monitor  its  ongoing  requirements  and  to  explore  all  methods  of  raising  additional  funds.  There  can  be  no  certainty  that 
such  additional  funds  may  be  raised  when  required.  At  December  31,  2014,  the  Company  had  net  working  capital  of 
$1,109,413.
During the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company completed an equity financing of $4,000,000.  Under the terms 
the  equity  financing,  the  Company  was  required  to  spend  $3,400,000  on  exploration  expenditures  on  the  Iron  Range 
Property.  Prior to selling its interest in the Iron Range Property as discussed above, the Company had incurred $3,014,242 
in exploration expenditures on the Property.  On September 18, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement whereby 
the remainder of the funds of $385,758 are required to be spent on a mineral property agreed to between the two parties.  
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
Providence  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  which  may  affect  its  current  or  future  operations  or 
conditions.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
about  future  events  that  affect  amounts  reported  in  the  financial  statements.    Actual  results  could  differ  from  these 
estimates.    Details  of  the  Company’s  significant  accounting  policies  can  be  found  in  Note  2  of  the  audited  financial 
statements for the year ended September 30, 2014.
$
Accounting standards issued by not yet effective 
 
New standard IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” 
 
This new standard is a partial replacement of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.  IFRS 9 uses a 
single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value, replacing the multiple 
rules  in  IAS  39.  The  approach  in  IFRS  9  is  based  on  how an  entity  manages  its  financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  its 
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.  
 
The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the multiple impairment methods in IAS 
39.  IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The adaptation of IFRS 9 is not expected to 
have an impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
 
Other  accounting  standards  or  amendments  to  existing  accounting  standards  that  have  been  issued  but  have  future 
effective  dates  are  either  not  applicable  or  are  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial 
statements.

Risk Factors 
 
Exploration-stage  mineral  exploration  companies  face  a  variety  of  risks  and,  while  unable  to  eliminate  all  of  them, 
Providence aims at managing and reducing such risks as much as possible.  Few exploration projects successfully achieve 
development  stage,  due  to  factors  that  cannot  be  predicted  or  anticipated,  and  even  one  such  factor  may  result  in  the 
economic  viability  of  a  project  being  detrimentally  impacted  such  that  it  is  neither  feasible  nor  practical  to  proceed.  
Providence closely monitors its activities and those factors that could impact them, and employs experienced consultants to 
assist in its risk management and to make timely adequate decisions. 
 
Environmental  laws  and  regulations  could  also  impact  the  viability  of  a  project.    Providence  has  ensured  that  it  has 
complied with these regulations, but there can be changes in legislation outside Providence’s control that could also add a 
risk factor to a project.   
 
Approval 
 
The Board of Directors of the Company approved the disclosure contained in this MD&A on February 20, 2015.

DESERT STAR RESOURCES LTD.  
Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements  
October 31, 2014 
Expressed in Canadian Dollars 
 
1.  Basis of Presentation
Desert Star Resources Ltd. (“Desert Star”) and Providence Resources Corp. (“Providence”) have entered 
into an agreement to amalgamate into a separate entity (“Amalco”) to be called Desert Star Resources 
Ltd. It is anticipated that the amalgamation will result in the issuance of approximately 51.6 million Amalco 
shares  to  the  former  shareholders  of  the  amalgamating  corporations  based  on  the  following  share 
exchange ratio:
•
•
for every one common share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive 1.0 Amalco common share; 
and 
for every one common share of Providence, shareholders will receive 0.4 of an Amalco common 
share and 0.4 of a common share purchase warrant of Amalco. Each whole warrant will entitle the 
holder to acquire an additional share of Amalco for a period of two years at a price of $0.25 per 
share.
The current issued and outstanding common shares of the amalgamating corporations are as follows:
•  39,912,792 common shares of Desert Star 
•  21,605,479 common shares of Providence
The  accompanying  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) with Desert Star considered to have 
acquired Providence for accounting purposes. As Providence is deemed to be a non-producing company, 
the transaction has been treated as an asset acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as at October 31, 2014 has been 
prepared  incorporating  the  assumptions  and  adjustments  described  in  Note  2  and  has  been  compiled 
from the following financial statements:
•  Desert Star’s unaudited interim financial statements as at October 31, 2014. 
•  Providence’s audited annual financial statements as at September 30, 2014.
The  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  the  year  ended  April  30,  2014  has 
been prepared from information derived from the following:
•  Desert Star’s audited annual financial statements as at and for the year ended April 30, 2014. 
•  Providence’s management prepared financial statements as at and for the twelve-month period 
ended March 31, 2014 derived from the audited financial statements of Providence for the year 
ended September 30, 2014 and adjusted by the unaudited financial statements for the six months 
ended March 31, 2013 and 2014.
The  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  the  six  months  ended  October  31, 
2014 has been prepared from information derived from the following:
•  Desert Star’s unaudited interim financial statements as at and for the period ended October 31,
2014.

DESERT STAR RESOURCES LTD.  
Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements  
October 31, 2014 
Expressed in Canadian Dollars 
 
1.  Basis of Presentation (continued)
•  Providence’s  management  prepared  financial  statements  as  at  and  for  the  six-month  period 
ended September 30, 2014 derived from the audited financial statements of Providence for the 
year ended September 30, 2014 and adjusted by the unaudited financial statements for the six 
months ended March 31, 2014.
•  The pro forma adjustments include all those transactions attributable to the transaction.
The  pro  forma  adjustments  include  all  those  transactions  attributable  to  the  acquisition  for  which  the 
complete financial effects are objectively determinable.. The pro forma consolidated financial statements 
of financial position should be read in conjunction with the other sections of the Filing Statement.
The pro forma adjustments reflecting the acquisition of the Providence are based on certain estimates and 
assumptions as set forth in the notes hereto. Desert Star's management believes that such assumptions 
provide a reasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects of the transaction contemplated and 
that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those adjustments and are properly applied in the 
pro forma statement of financial position. The allocation of the purchase price to reflect the fair values of 
the assets and liabilities assumed is based on management’s estimate of such assets and liabilities and, 
accordingly, the adjustments that have been included in the pro forma consolidated statements of financial 
position may be subject to change.  The final purchase price allocations may differ significantly from the 
allocations included herein.
2.  Pro Forma Assumptions and Adjustments 
These  pro  forma  financial  statements  give  effect  to  the  completion  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by 
Desert Star and Providence as if they had occurred on October 31, 2014 with the following assumptions 
and adjustments:
a)  After  the  completion  of  the  amalgamation  and  the  financing  described  below,  the  former 
shareholders of Desert Star will hold approximately 83% of Amalco and accordingly, Desert Star is 
considered to have acquired Providence. Providence’s shareholders will be issued 8,642,192 units 
of Amalco at $0.18 per share (Desert Star’s share price on October 31, 2014) for a fair value of 
$1,555,594,  based  on  the  ratios  described  above.    The  actual  calculation  and  allocation  of  the 
purchase price will be based on the assets purchased and liabilities assumed at the closing date.  
Accordingly,  the  actual  amounts  for  each  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will  vary  from  the  pro-forma 
amounts and the variation may be material. The cost of the amalgamation is estimated at $100,000.

In November 2014, Providence acquired 1.5 million units of Black Sea Copper and Gold Corp., a 
private  company  exploring  for  minerals  in  Eastern  Europe,  at  $0.20  per  unit,  for  a  total  cost  of 
$300,000. Each unit consists of one common share and one half of one share purchase warrant. 
Each whole warrant is exercisable into additional common shares at a price of $0.50 per share for a 
period of five years.
c)
In January 2015, Desert Star terminated an agreement whereby it had an option to acquire 100% of 
a mineral property situated in Arizona, USA. Consequently, $232,669 of accumulated costs related 
to the property has been written off.
d)  Desert  Star  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  complete  a  private  placement  for  gross  proceeds  of  up  to 
$2,000,000 through the issuance of units of Desert Star, at a price of $0.15 per unit, for a total of 
13,333,333 units.  Each unit is comprised of one common share and one common share purchase 
warrant.  Each warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional share of Desert Star for a period 
of  two  years  from  the  date  of  issuance  at  a  price  of  $0.25  per  share.  Desert  Star  will  pay 
commissions  in  accordance  with  TSX  Venture  Exchange  policies,  comprising  an  estimated  cash 
payment  of  10%  of  gross  proceeds  and  agents  warrants  totalling  10%  of  units  issued.  Cash 
commissions  are  estimated  to  be  $200,000  and  estimated  agents’  warrants  to  be  issued  are 
1,333,333. The fair value of agents’ warrants is estimated to be $113,608 using the Black Scholes 
Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: Risk free interest rate of 1.035%; expected life 
of 2 years; expected volatility of 106%; and dividend yield of 0%. Proceeds of the private placement 
will be used for the continued exploration of Desert Star’s properties and for general working capital 
purposes.

Re:       Fairness Opinion Regarding the Proposed Amalgamation with 
            Providence Resources Corp.  
 
 
Dear Sirs:
Summary 
 
Ross  Glanville  &  Associates  Ltd.  ("Glanville")  has  been  retained  by  the  Independent  Special 
Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.  (“Desert  Star”,  or  the 
“Company”) to determine the fairness to the shareholders of Desert Star (the “Fairness Opinion” 
or  “Opinion”)  of  the  proposed  amalgamation  (the  “Amalgamation"  or  “Transaction”)  of  Desert 
Star and Providence Resources Corp. (“Providence”). Pursuant to the Amalgamation, the existing 
common shares of the amalgamating companies will be exchanged for Amalco common shares 
based on the following share exchange ratio:
for every one share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive one Amalco common share; 
and Desert Star’s outstanding warrants (the “Desert Star Warrants”) will be converted into 
warrants of Amalco, on a one-for-one basis, on the same terms and conditions as the Desert 
Star Warrants’ and 
 
for every one common share of Providence, shareholders will receive 0.4 of an Amalco 
common  share  and  0.4  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole 
warrant, an “Amalco Warrant”). Each Amalco Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire an 
additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a 
price of $0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share.

Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.  (TSX-V:  DSR)  is  a  Vancouver-based  junior  mineral  exploration 
company  focused  on  the  acquisition  and  exploration  of  copper  and  gold  properties  located  in 
favourable mineral belts in the southwestern United States. Desert Star currently has about 43.0 
million shares outstanding, and its trading range over the past year has been from $0.130 to $0.255 
per share. The closing trading price on February 16th, 2015, was $0.185 per share. Desert Star's 
Financial  Statements,  as  at  October  31,  2014,  showed  it  had  negative  working  capital  of 
approximately  $0.86  million  and  total  assets  of $1.57  million.  Its  current  working  capital  (after 
recent  financings)  is  approximately  $0.70  million,  while  its  current  market  capitalization  is 
approximately  $7.95  million.  Desert  Star's  most  advanced  properties  are  its  drill-ready  Copper 
King  and  Red  Top  copper  properties  in  south-central  Arizona,  and  its  Anchor  gold  property  in 
Eureka County, Nevada.
Providence  (TSX-V:  PV;  OTCQX:  PRVSF)    is  a  Vancouver-based,  junior  base  and  precious 
metals exploration company focused on acquisition and exploration of mineral properties located 
in  favourable  mineral  belts.  Providence  has  approximately  21.6  million  shares  outstanding,  its 
trading range over the past year has been $0.035 to $0.120 per share, and it closed at $0.040 on 
February 26th, 2015. Providence's Financial Statements, as at December 31st, 2014, show it had 
working  capital  of  approximately  $1.11  million,  a  $300,000  investment  in  units  of  Black  Sea 
Copper  and  Gold  Corp.,  and  a  current  market  capitalization  of  approximately  $0.86  million. 
Providence has been working on several properties in southeastern British Columbia, but the only 
one remaining is the Kokanee Creek silver, gold, zinc, lead property near Nelson, BC, which has 
accumulated costs of of $10,000. 
 
In  order  to  provide  the  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  has  relied  on  the  reports  provided  by  the 
Company and Providence and the reports of professionals who have worked on the Company’s 
and Providence's mineral properties, and has reviewed geological and financial information filed 
by  the  Company  and  Providence  on  their  websites  and  on  the  SEDAR  site.  Glanville  has  not 
visited the mineral properties of Desert Star or Providence in connection with this assignment, or 
performed independent geological or mining investigations. Formal valuations of Providence or 
Desert Star, or their mineral properties, within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 of 
the Canadian Securities Administrators, have not been undertaken; however, informal valuations 
have been prepared as part of the Fairness Opinion. These informal valuations considered option 
agreements,  prior  expenditures,  exploration  and  development  results,  and  values  of  similar 
exploration projects. In addition to the foregoing, Glanville reviewed relative share trading prices 
of  Desert  Star  and  Providence  over  the  past  few  months  -  up  to  and  after  the  time  of  the 
announcement of the proposed Transaction.
Based upon and subject to the limitations in this Fairness Opinion, and such other matters as 
Glanville has considered relevant, it is his opinion that, as of the date hereof, the terms of the 
proposed Transaction (pursuant to which the companies will amalgamate on the basis of a 
Desert Star shareholder receiving one Amalco share for each Desert Star share held and a 
Providence shareholder receiving 0.4 of an Amalco share and 0.4 of an Amalco Warrant for 
each Providence share held) are fair from a financial point of view to the existing Desert Star 
shareholders. However, Glanville expresses no opinion as to the expected trading price of the 
shares of the combined company if the proposed merger is completed, or of Providence and Desert 
Star if it is terminated.

Engagement of Glanville   
 
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated December 5th, 2014 (the “Engagement Letter”), the Board 
of Directors of Desert Star retained the services of Ross Glanville & Associates Ltd. ("Glanville”) 
in connection with the preparation of a Fairness Opinion. Glanville’s services included providing 
advice and assistance to the Independent Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Desert 
Star  in  connection  with  the  proposed  Transaction,  and  the  preparation  and  delivery  to  the 
Independent  Special  Committee  an  opinion  (the  “Fairness  Opinion”)  as  to  the  fairness  of  the 
proposed Transaction. Glanville will be paid a fee for his services as financial advisor to Desert 
Star, but the fee is not contingent on completion of the Transaction. In addition, Glanville is to be 
indemnified in respect of certain liabilities that might arise out of the preparation of the Fairness 
Opinion. Glanville expresses no opinion, nor has he been requested to do so, as to the expected 
trading price of the shares of the combined company if the proposed Transaction is completed, or 
of Providence or Desert Star if it is terminated.
Use of Fairness Opinion
Glanville  specifically  agrees  that  the  Fairness  Opinion  may  be  filed  with  the  TSX  Venture 
Exchange,  other  regulatory  authorities,  and  provided  to  the  shareholders  of  the  Company,  if 
required by regulators. Glanville consents to the Company including in any disclosure documents 
required in connection with the Transaction (including, without limitation, any document that is 
required to be filed with any of the provincial securities commissions and/or required to be mailed 
by the Company to its shareholders) the complete text of the Fairness Opinion in its final form 
and/or a summary thereof, together with a description of the services provided by Glanville under 
this engagement.
For greater certainty, the parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, nothing 
herein  shall  prevent  the  Company  from  making  such  disclosure  which,  in  the  judgment  of  the 
Company is required under applicable securities or other laws or policy statements.
Relationship with Interested Parties 
Glanville  is  an  independent  arm’s-length  consultant  who  has  no  financial  interest  (nor  does  he 
expect to have any future interest), directly or indirectly, in Desert Star or Providence (or their 
subsidiary or associated companies). He does not expect any consideration other than the fee and 
expenses from Desert Star for the preparation of this Fairness Opinion, nor is the fee contingent 
upon  the  completion  of  the  proposed  Transaction.  There  are  no  understandings,  agreements  or 
commitments  between  Glanville  and  Desert  Star,  or  any  of  their  associates  or  affiliates  with 
respect to any future business dealings. 
 
Credentials of Glanville 
Ross  Glanville,  P.Eng.,  MBA,  CGA,  B.A.Sc.,  has  prepared  this  Fairness  Opinion.  Glanville  has  the 
required expertise and recognition within the industry to prepare the Opinion, and has prepared 
over  200  Fairness  Opinions  and  more  than  600  valuations  of  mining  companies  and 
exploration/development properties.
4
Glanville has almost forty-five years of mining and exploration/development experience in many 
countries, and has been involved in the exploration, financing, development, and operation of a 
number  of  mines.  He  worked  at  various  mine  sites  with  a  major  mining  company  (Placer 
Development, which was acquired by Barrick Gold Corporation), and subsequently was appointed 
Vice President of Wright Engineers (since acquired by Fluor Corp.) and then President of Giant 
Bay  Resources.  Mr.  Glanville  has  been  a  Director  and  founder  of  a  number  of  exploration, 
development, and mining companies, and is currently a director of two mining companies and two 
exploration companies.  
 
Mr.  Glanville  graduated  from  the  University  of  British  Columbia  in  1970  with  a  Bachelor  of 
Applied  Science  Degree  (Mining  Engineering)  and  became  a  member  of  the  Association  of 
Professional Engineers of British Columbia in 1972 (P.Eng.). In 1974, he obtained a Master of 
Business  Administration  Degree  (MBA),  specializing  in  finance  and  securities  analysis;  and  in 
1980 he became a member of the Certified General Accountants of B.C. (CGA). Since 1985, Mr. 
Glanville  has  specialized  in  valuations,  fairness  opinions,  and  litigation  support  related  to  the 
mining and exploration industry.  
 
Mr.  Glanville  has  prepared  a  large  number  of  fairness  opinions  (more  than  200)  for  mergers, 
amalgamations,  and  acquisitions  of  public  and  private  companies.  These  assignments  were 
undertaken for investment dealers, regulatory bodies (including stock exchanges), banks, various 
government  agencies,  venture  capital  firms,  forestry  companies,  mining  and  exploration 
companies, oil and gas companies, energy companies, and others. He has also valued more than 
four  hundred  mining  and  exploration  companies/projects  in  Canada,  the  U.S.A.,  Australia,  and 
Mexico, as well as over two hundred in many other areas of the world, including Africa, South 
America,  Europe,  and  Asia.  He  has  formed  public  companies  (listed  on  the  Toronto  Stock 
Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, New York Market, and the TSX Venture 
Exchange) and has served on the Boards of Directors of five companies with producing mines. Mr. 
Glanville  has  also  acted  in  more  than  50  court  cases  and  assessment  appeal  board  hearings  in 
Canada,  the  U.S.A.,  Australia,  and  the  U.K.  He  has  written  several  articles,  and  given  many 
presentations, related to valuations of exploration and mining companies.  
 
 
Scope of Review 
 
Glanville  did  not  visit  Desert  Star’s  or  Providence’s  mineral  properties  in  connection  with  this 
assignment,  nor  did  he  perform  independent  geological  or  mining  investigations.  Formal 
valuations  of  Desert  Star  and  Providence,  or  their  mineral  properties,  within  the  meaning  of 
Multilateral Instrument 61-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators, were not undertaken; 
however, less formal valuations, adequate for the purpose intended, were prepared as part of the 
Fairness Opinion. These less formal valuations considered prior exploration history, expenditures 
for acquisition and exploration of the properties, exploration results, and comparisons with values 
of similar projects. In addition to the foregoing, Glanville reviewed trading prices of the shares of 
Desert  Star  and  Providence  on  the  TSX-V  over  the  past  few  months  –  prior  to  and  after  the 
announcement of the proposed Transaction. 
 
Specifically, Glanville reviewed and relied upon, or carried out (as the case may be) the following, 
among other things:
Providence
5
•  correspondence  and  discussions  with  directors/officers/management  of  Desert  Star  and
•  news releases of Desert Star and Providence over the past year 
•  planned exploration programs on the Providence and Desert Star properties  
• 
•  SEDAR  filings  of  Desert  Star  and  Providence,  including  MD&As  and  Financial
information on the websites of Desert Star and Providence
Statements 
investor presentations by Desert Star and Providence
• 
•  estimated current working capital positions of Desert Star and Providence 
•
relevant information relating to other companies whose activities and properties are similar 
to those of Desert Star and Providence, respectively
•  market capitalizations of listed companies with similar or comparable portfolios of mineral
development properties
•  prior fairness opinions and valuations completed by Glanville 
•  data  related  to  other  transactions  of  a  comparable  or  similar  nature,  which  Glanville
considered to be relevant 
income tax returns of Desert Star and Providence
• 
•  estimated prior expenditures on the exploration properties of Desert Star and Providence 
•  certain industry reports and statistics that Glanville deemed appropriate 
•  such other reviews, calculations, analyses, research and investigations deemed appropriate
and relevant in the circumstances.
Assumptions and Limitations 
 
Glanville has utilized assumptions and input parameters in this Fairness Opinion that he believes 
are reasonable and appropriate based on industry standards. Major caveats include the uncertainty 
of  future  exploration,  general  market  conditions,  the  future  prices  of  commodities  (copper  and 
gold,  in  particular),  changes  to  government  regulations,  and  environmental/permitting  concerns. 
The geological summaries, websites, and other publications of the companies, as well as filings on 
SEDAR,  contain  more  detailed  information  on  the  exploration  projects.  As  a  result,  only  brief 
summaries of the projects are presented in this Fairness Opinion. 
 
In  providing  this  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  assumed  and  relied  upon  the  accuracy  and 
completeness of all technical, financial, and other information furnished to him by Desert Star and 
Providence,  and  by  their  consultants  and  representatives.  He  has  not  undertaken  any  specific 
independent  verification  of  such  information  (although  data  was  reviewed  to  determine  its 
“reasonableness”). However, Glanville has no reason to believe that the information provided to 
him  is  not  accurate  or  complete,  and  he  has  not  been  denied  access  to any  information  that  he 
requested from the management or directors of Desert Star or Providence.  
 
Glanville  decided  upon  the  methodologies  to  be  utilized  in  this  Fairness  Opinion,  and  did  not 
request  or  receive,  from  the  managements  of  Desert  Star  or  Providence,  suggestions  as  to  the 
methodologies  that  might  have  been  utilized.  Glanville  has  relied  upon  summary  technical  and 
financial reports, discussions with executives/officers of Desert Star and Providence, information 
provided  by  management/directors  of  Desert  Star  and  Providence,  publicly  available  results  to 
date, comparable properties, and the share trading histories of the companies.  
 
Glanville has made assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, market
6
and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of any party 
involved with the proposed Transaction. Although Glanville believes that these assumptions are 
reasonable with respect to Desert Star and Providence (and the industry in which they operate), to 
the extent that they are found to be incorrect, they may impact on the fairness of the proposed 
Transaction to the shareholders of Desert Star. 
 
This Fairness Opinion is based upon the state of securities markets, economic and general business 
and  financial  conditions  prevailing  as  at  the  date  hereof.  It  is  also  based  on  the  conditions  and 
prospects,  financial  and  otherwise,  of  Desert  Star  and  Providence  as  they  are  reflected  in  the 
information, data and other material (financial or otherwise) available to or presented to Glanville 
in discussions with management of the companies. It should be noted that this report is a Fairness 
Opinion, not a technical report. As a result, Glanville has not provided detailed information that 
has  been  included  in  other  reports  on  the  mineral  properties.  Those  reports  contain  information 
regarding geology, mineralization, drilling, sampling, assaying, and exploration.  
 
Desert  Star  has  acknowledged  that  the  services  provided  by  Glanville  were  provided  in  an 
advisory capacity only, and that Glanville is not liable for losses, damages, or other claims that 
may result from or be alleged to result from any application or use that Desert Star and/or others 
may make of such information, data and opinions of Glanville. Desert Star has waived, released, 
indemnified and agreed to hold Glanville harmless from any and all liability for losses, damages, 
legal costs, and other claims arising from the Opinion and/or related issues. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing,  this  indemnity  shall  not  apply  to  Glanville  to  the  extent  that  a  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non-appealable shall determine that:
i.  Glanville  has  been  negligent  or  dishonest  or  has  committed  any  fraudulent  or  willful
ii.
misconduct act in the course of performance of his respective duties hereunder; and 
 
the expenses, costs, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as to which indemnification is 
claimed (up to a maximum of the fees and expenses paid to Glanville), primarily resulted 
from such negligence, dishonesty, fraud or willful misconduct referred to in (i).
Glanville  has  not  conducted  a  review  of  the  mineral  titles,  ownership,  costs,  or  environmental 
obligations, and consequently Glanville has not expressed any opinion on these subjects. Glanville 
does not accept any responsibility for errors or omissions pertaining to information provided by 
Desert Star or Providence, or their lawyers, advisors, directors, agents, or other related parties.
At any time prior to the completion of the Transaction, Glanville reserves the right to amend or 
withdraw this Fairness Opinion in certain circumstances, including in the event that there occurs a 
material  change  of  facts  or  representations  upon  which  Glanville  relied,  or  in  the  event  that 
Glanville  reasonably  concludes  that  the  information  provided  to  him  or  any  representation  he 
relied upon contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact that, in his 
reasonable opinion, would make this Fairness Opinion untrue or inaccurate in any material respect. 
However, Glanville is under no obligation to make any subsequent changes or provide notification 
to anyone of such changes to the information. The management and directors of Desert Star should 
inform  Glanville  if  anything  in  this  Fairness  Opinion,  or  any  of  the  information  on  which  it  is 
based, is, in their opinion, inaccurate or misleading in any way.  
 
Glanville has also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory, court, or other approvals 
and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained,
7
and  that  in  connection  with  obtaining  any  necessary  governmental,  regulatory,  court,  or  other 
approvals and consents, no limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed that would have 
a material adverse effect on Desert Star’s shareholders. 
 
This Fairness Opinion is addressed to and is for the sole use and benefit of the Desert Star Board 
of Directors and shareholders, and may not be referred to, summarized, circulated, publicized or 
reproduced by Desert Star, other than as set out in this Fairness Opinion, or disclosed to, used or 
relied upon by any other party without the express written consent of Glanville. 
 
Glanville believes that his analyses must be considered as a whole, and that selecting portions of 
the  analyses  or  the  factors  considered  by  him,  without  considering  all  factors  and  analyses 
together,  could  create  a  misleading  view  of  the  process  underlying  the  Fairness  Opinion.  The 
preparation  of  a  fairness  opinion  is  a  complicated  process,  and  is  not  necessarily  amenable  to 
partial analysis or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on 
any particular factor or analysis. 
 
Proposed Transaction  
Desert Star and Providence have entered into a Letter of Intent to amalgamate the two companies 
(the “Amalgamation”). Pursuant to the proposed Amalgamation, the existing common shares of 
the  amalgamating  companies  will  be  exchanged  for  Amalco  common  shares  based  on  the 
following share exchange ratio:
•
•
for every one share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive one Amalco common share; 
and Desert Star’s outstanding warrants (the “Desert Star Warrants”) will be converted into 
warrants of Amalco, on a one-for-one basis, on the same terms and conditions as the Desert 
Star Warrants’ and 
 
for every one common share of Providence, shareholders will receive 0.4 of an Amalco 
common  share  and  0.4  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of  Amalco  (each  whole 
warrant, an “Amalco Warrant”). Each Amalco Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire an 
additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a 
price of $0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share.
Some of the other key terms of the agreement are as follows:
•  The proposed amalgamation is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Providence
and Desert Star, and the approval of applicable regulatory authorities.
•  The proposed amalgamation will require the statutory approval of at least two thirds of the
shareholders of each company voting on the matters.
•  A joint information circular in respect of the special meeting of shareholders of each of the 
amalgamating  companies  will  be  mailed  to  the  shareholders  when  formal  notices  of  the 
special meetings are given.
•  The respective boards of directors of Providence and Desert Star have approved a proposed 
Amalgamation  of  the  two  companies  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Business 
Corporations Act (British Columbia).
•
In connection with the Amalgamation, Providence has provided Desert Star $250,000 as an 
unsecured, non-interest bearing loan (the “Loan”), which Loan will be fully refundable to 
Providence within 30 business days if the Amalgamation does not complete.
8
•  Desert  Star  has  outstanding  convertible  loans  in  the  aggregate  of  $495,000  (the 
“Convertible Loans”), which are convertible into units of Desert Star (at $0.19 per unit) 
comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  transferable  share  purchase  warrant.  Each 
warrant is exercisable by the holder to purchase an additional common share of Desert Star 
for a period of 12 months from the issuance of the warrant at an exercise price of $0.25 per 
share. On completion of the Amalgamation, the Convertible Loans will become liabilities 
of  Amalco  and  will  be  convertible  to  acquire  units  of  Amalco  on  the  same  terms  and 
conditions as set out in this paragraph.
•  Desert  Star  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  complete  a  private  placement  (the  “Private 
Placement”)  for  gross  proceeds  of  up  to  $2.0  million  (to  date  $1.544  million  has  been 
raised) through the issuance of units (each a “Unit”) of Desert Star, at a price of $0.15 per 
Unit.  Each  unit  is  comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  common  share  purchase 
warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one additional share of 
Desert Star for a period of two years from the date of issuance at a price of $0.25 per share. 
•  No material adverse change shall have occurred in the business, assets, liabilities, results, 
financial condition, affairs or prospects of Providence or Desert Star from the date of the 
Letter of Intent to the Closing Date.
•  Satisfactory  completion  of  due  diligence  reviews  by  Desert  Star  and  Providence,
respectively, acting reasonably.
•  Receipt of all required approvals and consents to the transaction, including the approval of
the TSX-V.
Desert Star  
Overview 
Desert  Star  Resources  Ltd.  (TSX-V:  DSR)  is  a  Vancouver-based  junior  mineral  exploration 
company  focused  on  the  acquisition  and  exploration  of  copper  and  gold  properties  located  in 
favourable mineral belts in the southwestern United States. Desert Star currently has about 39.9 
million shares outstanding, and its trading range over the past year has been from $0.130 to $0.255 
per share. The closing trading price on February 27th, 2015, was $0.185 per share. Desert Star's 
Financial  Statements,  as  at  October  31,  2014,  showed  it  had  negative  working  capital  of 
approximately  $0.86  million  and  total  assets  of $1.57  million.  Its  current  working  capital  (after 
recent  financings)  is  approximately  $0.70  million,  while  its  current  market  capitalization  is 
approximately  $7.95  million.  Desert  Star's  most  advanced  properties  are  its  drill-ready  Copper 
King  and  Red  Top  copper  properties  in  south-central  Arizona,  and  its  Anchor  gold  property  in 
Eureka County, Nevada.
Desert Star’s Exploration Properties
9
Desert Star has drill-ready Laramide-age porphyry copper projects situated in a world-class copper 
district in Arizona, and one drill-ready Carlin-type gold project strategically located in the highly-
endowed Battle Mountain – Eureka gold trend. The Company has optioned the properties from 
strong  partners  –  Eurasian  Minerals  and  Pilot  Gold.  Drill  permitting  is  ongoing  at  Red  Top, 
Copper King, and Anchor. 
Copper King 
The Copper King Project covers 1,438 hectares (189 unpatented federal lode mining claims), and 
is  located  approximately  five  kilometers  northwest  from  the  Resolution  Copper  Project  (a  joint 
venture of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton) and the town of Superior, Arizona. Recently, President 
Barak  Obama  signed  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  into  law,  which  includes  riders 
containing the largest public lands package since 2009, and includes land swaps that benefit the 
Resolution Copper Project in Arizona and the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Project in Nevada. The 
Resolution Copper Project is one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper projects. 
On September 3rd, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), Desert Star signed an option agreement to acquire 
a 100% interest in the Copper King property. In order to earn the 100% interest, the Company is 
required  to  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue  350,000  common  shares  (issued),  make 
advance  minimum  royalty  payments  (“AMR”),  and  incur  exploration  expenditures  of  US$5.0 
million. Each AMR payment shall be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being 
brought  into  commercial  production.  The  AMR  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Company  to  the 
optionor are the value of 6,667 pounds of copper on October 3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 6,667 
pounds of copper on November 3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 6,666 pounds of copper on December 
3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 30,000 pounds of copper on September 3rd, 2015, the value of 40,000 
pounds of copper on September 3rd, 2016, the value of 60,000 pounds of copper on September 3rd, 
2017,  the  value  of  70,000  pounds  of  copper  on  September  3rd,  2018,  and  the  value  of  80,000 
pounds  of  copper  on  each  of  the  anniversaries  of  the  Effective  Date  until  commencement  of 
commercial production. 
The  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Company  (in  addition  to  the  foregoing  AMR  payments)  are 
US$30,000  upon  having  drilled  1,000  meters  on  the  property;  the  value  of  35,000  pounds  of 
copper  upon  completion  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment,  which  payment  will  be 
considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR; the value of 50,000 pounds of copper 
upon completion of a pre-feasibility study, which payment will be considered as additional AMR 
and  credited  against  the  NSR;  on  the  completion  of  a  feasibility  study,  an  amount  equal  to  (i) 
0.25% of the value of each pound of copper up to and including 500 million pounds of copper 
included  in  the  estimated  reserves  of  minerals  as  reported  in  the  feasibility  study  (“Reserves”), 
plus (ii) 0.05% of the value of each pound of copper above 500 million pounds of copper included 
in the Reserves; if the Company has not completed a feasibility study or the Copper King property 
has not been placed into commercial production on or before the 12th anniversary of the Effective 
Date,  an  annual  payment  of  the  value  of  200,000  pounds  of  copper  commencing  on  the  12th 
anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date  and  continuing  thereafter  until  the  17th  anniversary  of  the 
Effective Date; the value of 175,000 pounds of copper upon the decision by the board of directors 
of the Company to develop a mine for production, which payment will be considered as additional 
AMR  and  credited  against  the  NSR;  and  the  value  of  250,000  pounds  of  copper  upon 
commencement of commercial production from the mine on the property, which payment will be 
considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR. Each of the foregoing payments shall 
be  due  and  payable  30  days  after  the  date  of  the  event  triggering  the  payment.  If  commercial 
production  has  not  occurred  on  or  before  five  years  after  completion  of  a  feasibility  study,  an 
annual payment of the value of 250,000 pounds of copper is required, commencing upon the date
10
that is five years after the completion of the feasibility study and ending upon commencement of 
commercial  production,  which  payments  will  be  considered  an  additional  AMR  and  credited 
against the NSR. The Company may purchase one-fifth of the royalty relating to the property at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
The exploration expenditures to be incurred by the Company are US$100,000 by September 3rd, 
2014 (completed), an additional US$500,000 by September 3rd, 2015, an additional US$500,000 
by  September  3rd,  2016,  an  additional  US$750,000  by  September  3rd,  2017,  an  additional 
US$1,150,000 by September 3rd, 2018, and an additional US$1,000,000 by each anniversary of the 
Effective Date thereafter until completion of a feasibility study.  
The  Copper  King  project  is  considered  prospective  for  bulk  tonnage  supergene  (oxide)  and 
hypogene  (sulphide)  copper  and  molybdenum  mineralization.  Surface  geology,  copper  and 
molybdenum  metal  zonation  defined  by  surface  rock  sampling,  as  well  as  a  very  large  (one 
kilometer by one kilometer) alteration zone suggest to the Company that the Copper King project 
represents the top and/or side of an intact porphyry system. Locally intense calc-silicate alteration 
of moderately inclined sedimentary wall rocks, in addition to copper oxide and copper sulphide 
minerals  present  in  both  wall  rocks  and  porphyritic  intrusions,  may  represent  leakage  from  an 
intact but unexposed porphyry system. 
In August 2014, the Company completed an Induced Polarization ("IP”) geophysical survey at the 
Copper King project, which produced two high quality anomalies consisting of chargeability highs 
coincident  with  resistivity  low  features.  The  combined  anomalies  measure  approximately  2,700 
meters in length when projected to surface, and are present beyond the estimated detection depth 
of the survey (approximately 600 meters). The anomalies identified by the survey are open to the 
southwest,  coalesce  at  depth,  appear  to  plunge  toward  the  southwest,  and  are  interpreted  to  be 
caused  by  disseminated  sulphides,  which  is  consistent  with  mineralization  associated  with 
porphyry copper systems. In September 2014, the Company commenced follow-up geophysics at 
Copper King in order to further define the location, extent, and geometry of the IP anomalies that 
the Company identified previously. The work, which was completed in November 2014, identified 
a large IP geophysical anomaly resulting from a 3D IP survey. The survey defined a coincident 
chargeability high and resistivity low anomaly within the Copper King project claim block. The 
geophysical target features are present from 200m to 700m depth (open at depth), and range in 
plan view size from 700m x 500m (at a 200m depth slice) to 1000m x 1300 m (at a 700m depth 
slice).  The  IP  anomaly  is  characterized  by  a  zoned  chargeability/resistivity  pattern  typical  of 
porphyry  systems,  and  has  a  spatial  association  with  the  eastern  contact  between  pre-mineral 
quartz diorite and Pinal Schist. The IP anomaly is consistent in size, geometry, and position with a 
west-southwest plunging porphyry copper target, previously suggested by geologic mapping. The 
IP  anomaly,  together  with  the  lithological  alteration,  and  geochemical  data  that  the  Company 
previously generated is believed to represent a high quality porphyry copper drill target for Desert 
Star. 
As at October 31st, 2014, approximately $397,000 had been incurred by Desert Star for exploration 
and acquisition expenditures on the Copper King property. 
 
Red Top 
The Red Top Project covers 1,463 hectares (192 unpatented federal lode mining claims), and is 
located approximately eight kilometers northwest of the Resolution Copper Project (a joint venture 
of  Rio  Tinto  and  BHP  Billiton)  and  8.5  kilometers  from  the  town  of  Superior,  Arizona.  It  is 
contiguous to, and north of the Copper King property.

On September 3rd, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), Desert Star signed an option agreement to acquire 
a  100%  interest  in  the  Red  Top  property.  In  order  to  earn  the  100%  interest,  the  Company  is 
required  to  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue  350,000  common  shares  (issued),  make 
advance  minimum  royalty  payments  (“AMR”),  and  incur  exploration  expenditures  of  US$5.0 
million. Each AMR payment shall be set off against a 2.5% NSR payable upon the project being 
brought  into  commercial  production.  The  AMR  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Company  to  the 
optionor are the value of 6,667 pounds of copper on October 3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 6,667 
pounds of copper on November 3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 6,666 pounds of copper on December 
3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 30,000 pounds of copper on September 3rd, 2015, the value of 40,000 
pounds of copper on September 3rd, 2016, the value of 60,000 pounds of copper on September 3rd, 
2017,  the  value  of  70,000  pounds  of  copper  on  September  3rd,  2018,  and  the  value  of  80,000 
pounds  of  copper  on  each  of  the  anniversaries  of  the  Effective  Date  until  commencement  of 
commercial production. 
The  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Company  (in  addition  to  the  foregoing  AMR  payments)  are 
US$30,000  upon  having  drilled  1,000  meters  on  the  property;  the  value  of  35,000  pounds  of 
copper upon completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA"), which payment will be 
considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR; the value of 50,000 pounds of copper 
upon completion of a pre-feasibility study, which payment will be considered as additional AMR 
and  credited  against  the  NSR;  on  the  completion  of  a  feasibility  study,  an  amount  equal  to  (i) 
0.25% of the value of each pound of copper up to and including 500 million pounds of copper 
included  in  the  estimated  reserves  of  minerals  as  reported  in  the  feasibility  study  (“Reserves”), 
plus (ii) 0.05% of the value of each pound of copper above 500 million pounds of copper included 
in the Reserves; if the Company has not completed a feasibility study, or the Copper King property 
has not been placed into commercial production on or before the 12th anniversary of the Effective 
Date,  an  annual  payment  of  the  value  of  200,000  pounds  of  copper  commencing  on  the  12th 
anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date  and  continuing  thereafter  until  the  17th  anniversary  of  the 
Effective Date; the value of 175,000 pounds of copper upon the decision by the board of directors 
of the Company to develop a mine for production, which payment will be considered as additional 
AMR  and  credited  against  the  NSR;  and  the  value  of  250,000  pounds  of  copper  upon 
commencement of commercial production from the mine on the property, which payment will be 
considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR. Each of the foregoing payments shall 
be  due  and  payable  30  days  after  the  date  of  the  event  triggering  the  payment.  If  commercial 
production  has  not  occurred  on  or  before  five  years  after  completion  of  a  feasibility  study,  an 
annual payment of the value of 250,000 pounds of copper  is required, commencing upon the date 
that is five years after the completion of the feasibility study and ending upon commencement of 
commercial  production,  which  payments  will  be  considered  an  additional  AMR  and  credited 
against the NSR. The Company may purchase one-fifth of the royalty relating to the property at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000. 
The exploration expenditures to be incurred by the Company are US$100,000 by September 3rd, 
2014 (completed), an additional US$500,000 by September 3rd, 2015, an additional US$500,000 
by  September  3rd,  2016,  an  additional  US$750,000  by  September  3rd,  2017,  an  additional 
US$1,150,000 by September 3rd, 2018, and an additional US$1,000,000 by each anniversary of the 
Effective Date thereafter until completion of a feasibility study.  
The Red Top project is considered by the Company to be prospective for bulk tonnage supergene 
(oxide) and hypogene (sulphide) porphyry copper and molybdenum mineralization. The property 
contains an abundance of (oxidized) sulphides, and, together with the style, size (greater than 350 
meters of exposed strike length) and intensity of advanced argillic hydrothermal alteration (sericite 
with  dickite  and  pyrophyllite),  the  zoned  copper-molybdenum  footprint  based  on  rock  chip
12
samples;  (greater  than  1.5  kilometers  in  length),  and  presence  of  favorable  Laramide-age 
porphyritic  intrusions  suggest  that  the  Red  Top  project  represents  a  high  level  intact  porphyry 
system. 
In  June  2014,  the  Company  completed  a  12-day  exploration  field  program  on  its  Red  Top 
property,  which  included  geological  mapping,  sampling,  and  an  alteration  study  utilizing 
Terraspec  analysis,  and  has  delineated  a  1,400  meter  by  1,500  meter  zone  of  intense  illite  +/- 
pyrophyllite alteration. The Company interprets this alteration zone to be the upper portion of a 
porphyry system. Two IP surveys were completed at Red Top in October 2014 in order to increase 
confidence in the location, geometry, and intensity of the geophysical anomaly first identified in 
June  2014.  The  surveys  identified  a  large  IP  geophysical  anomaly,  which,  together  with  the 
lithological,  alteration,  and  geochemical  data  the  Company  previously  identified  is  believed  to 
represent a high quality porphyry copper drill target for Desert Star. As a result of the Company 
identifying  an  open-ended,  1,400-meter  coincident  chargeability  and  resistivity  anomaly,  Desert 
Star  staked  44  additional  claims  (720  acres,  or  approximately  290  hectares)  to  the  north  of  the 
property. 
As at October 31st, 2014, expenditures of approximately $316,000 had been incurred by Desert 
Star for exploration on and acquisition of the Red Top property. 
 
Anchor 
The Anchor Project consists of 54 unpatented federal mineral claims on BLM land, and is located 
at the south end of Diamond Valley, Eureka County, Nevada. The Anchor Project is situated about 
ten  kilometers  northwest  of  Barrick  Gold’s  Ruby  Hill  mine  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Battle 
Mountain-Eureka gold trend. This prolific gold trend includes mines such as the Pipeline Mine 
complex, the Marigold Deposit, and Barrick Gold’s recent Gold Rush discovery. 
On September 16th, 2013, the Company signed an option agreement to acquire a 51% interest in 
the Anchor property. On September 23rd, 2014, Desert Star entered into an agreement to amend the 
option  agreement,  whereby  the  Company  is  required  (in  order  to  earn  a  51%  interest)  to  issue 
1,100,000  of  its  common  shares  and  incur  exploration  expenditures  of  not  less  than  US$2.0 
million by March 24th, 2016 (including drilling 1,500 meters aimed at the Devils Gate formation 
by September 16th, 2015). The optionor will retain a 1% NSR on the property, the parties will form 
a limited liability company (LLC), and enter into a shareholders’ agreement governing the LLC. 
The common shares to be issued by the Company to the optionor include 200,000 by September 
24th,  2013  (issued),  400,000  by  September  23rd,  2014  (issued),  and  500,000  by  September  24th, 
2015.   
Upon completion of the earn-in to 51%, the Company has the option to earn an additional 14% 
interest in the Anchor property by incurring additional exploration expenditures of US$4.0 million 
and  issuing  one  million  common  shares  by  September  24th,  2017.  Upon  earning  the  additional 
14%, the Company may earn an additional 5% in the Anchor property if it elects to complete a 
PEA, and the optionor elects not to participate in funding its proportionate cost of the PEA. 
The Anchor Project is centered on a 600 meter by 500 meter gold-arsenic-antimony rock and soil 
geochemical  anomaly  hosted  in  Mississippian  siliciclastic  sedimentary  rocks  (Chainman 
Formation). Previous exploration work conducted by various groups identified gold mineralization 
(rock  grab  samples)  up  to  1.83  gpt  gold,  which  were  associated  with  highly  anomalous  arsenic 
(11,900 ppm) and antimony (1,030 ppm), elements typically linked with Carlin-style gold systems. 
Historic drilling at the Anchor project focused on siliciclastic Chainman Formation, and did not 
test  the  carbonate  debris  flow  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  underlying  Devils  Gate  Formation.
13
Carbonate debris flow sedimentary rocks are the most prolific gold host rocks in the Great Basin. 
Desert Star’s technical team believes the gold and associated arsenic and antimony mineralization 
within  the  siliciclastic  sedimentary  rocks  at  the  Anchor  project  represent  a  ‘leakage  anomaly’ 
above  possible  gold  mineralization  in  the  prospective  Devils  Gate  Formation  debris  flow  host 
rocks at depth. 
As at October 31st, 2014, approximately $137,000 had been incurred by Desert Star for exploration 
and acquisition expenditures on the Anchor property. 
 
Henry 
On April 5th, 2012, Desert Star signed an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Henry 
property located in Saskatchewan. To acquire a 100% interest, the Company made cash payments 
of $155,000 and issued one million shares. The vendors retain a 2% net smelter royalty on the 
property. On May 13th, 2013, the Company accelerated payments under the Henry property option 
agreement, and exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the property by issuing 250,000 
common shares. An impairment charge of $390,288 was realized at April 30th, 2014, due to certain 
claims being allowed to lapse. 
 
Other Assets/Liabilities of Desert Star 
The  other  assets  of  Desert  Star  consist  of  its  current  working  capital  of  approximately  $0.34 
million  (which  includes  a  loan  payable  of  about  $380,0001  and  convertible  notes  of  about 
$510,0002), its share listing on the TSX-V, income tax pools available to shield potential future 
income, and a small amount of equipment.

Providence Resources Corp. 
Overview
Providence  (TSX-V:  PV;  OTCQX:  PRVSF)    is  a  Vancouver-based,  junior  base  and  precious 
metals exploration company focused on acquisition and exploration of mineral properties located 
in  favourable  mineral  belts.  Providence  has  approximately  21.6  million  shares  outstanding,  its 
trading range over the past year has been $0.035 to $0.120 per share, and it closed at $0.040 on 
February 27th, 2015. Providence's Financial Statements, as at December 31st, 2014, show it had 
working capital of approximately $1.11 million, an investment of $300,000 in units of Black Sea 
Copper  and  Gold  Corp.,  and  a  current  market  capitalization  is  approximately  $0.86  million. 
Providence has been working on several properties in southeastern British Columbia, but the only 
one remaining is the Kokanee Creek silver, gold, zinc, lead property near Nelson, BC, which has 
accumulated costs of $10,000. 
 
Kokanee Creek Property 
Providence entered into an option agreement with an effective date of May 15th, 2013, to earn a 
60%  interest  in  the  Kokanee  Creek  property  located  near  Nelson,  British  Columbia.  Upon 
exercising  the  option,  a  60/40  joint  venture  would  be  established  between  Providence  and  the 
optionor.  In  order  to  exercise  the  option,  Providence  is  required  to  make  cash  payments  of 
$260,000 ($10,000 has been paid, $25,000 is due by May 15th, 2015, $50,000 is due by May 15th, 
2016, $75,000 is due by May 15th, 2017, and $100,000 is due by May 15th, 2018) issue 1,000,000 
of its common shares to the optionor (150,000 by May 15th, 2015, 200,000 by May 15th, 2016, 
250,000  by  May  15th, 2017, and 400,000 by May 15th, 2018), and incur  minimum exploration 
expenditures  of $3,000,000 on the property ($200,000 by May 15th, 2015, $500,000 additional by 
May 15th, 2016, $1,000,000 additional by May 15th, 2016, and a further $1,300,000 by May 15th, 
2018). 
The  Kokanee  Creek  silver/gold/zinc/lead  claims,  comprised  of  60  units  and  covering  1,400 
hectares, were staked in 1996 after base metal mineralization was found in the Lower Kokanee 
Creek  Road.  The  claims  cover  two  historical  mineral  showings,  and  are  located  within  five 
kilometers of two past producing mines. The claims are owned 100% by Eagle Plains Resources 
Ltd., and carry an underlying 1% net smelter return royalty. 
Both  base  and  precious  metal  mineralization  occurs  on  the  Kokanee  Creek  claims.  One  of  the 
showings  consists  of  pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  sphalerite,  and  galena  associated  with  irregular  quartz 
veinlets and fractures within a fine-grained to porphyritic granite. Gold mineralization was also 
located by 1997 drilling. 
 
Investment in Black Sea Copper and Gold
15
On November 25th, 2014, Providence subscribed for 1.5 million units of Black Sea Copper and 
Gold Corp. (“Black Sea”) at $0.20 per unit (each a “Unit”) for a total consideration of $300,000. 
Each unit is comprised of one common share and one half on one share purchase warrant (each a 
“Warrant”).  Each  whole  Warrant  is  exercisable  to  acquire  an  additional  common  share  of  the 
Black Sea at a price of $0.50 per share for a period of five years. Black Sea is a private mineral 
exploration  company  focused  on  the  identification,  acquisition,  and  development  of  copper  and 
gold projects in Eastern Europe. Providence and Black Sea are related parties by way of common  
directors and officers.  
Other Assets of Providence 
In  addition  to  its  mineral  exploration  projects,  Providence  currently  has  working  capital  of 
approximately  $1.0  million  (including  500,000  shares  of  Eagle  Plains  Resources  Ltd.,  with  an 
estimated market value of $35,000), and other relatively minor assets, including a listing on the 
TSX-V, income tax pools, and office plus field equipment. 
Shares and Options and Warrants 
As at September 30th, 2014, there were 21,605,479 issued and fully paid common shares. There 
are  2,400,000  outstanding  options  at  a  weighted  average  exercise  price  of  $0.22  per  share, 
including 550,000 at an exercise price of $0.13 per share (and expiring October 5th, 2015). 
 
Fairness Opinions and Mineral Property Valuations  
The Exchanges (TSX-V and TSX) require that CIMVal Standards (Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy Standards and Guidelines for Valuations of Mineral Properties) be used by Issuers and 
their  professional  advisors  when  preparing  formal  valuations  and  valuation  reports  on  mineral 
properties. The CIMVal Standards are limited to Valuations of Mineral Properties (including any 
interests  therein),  and  do  not  apply  to  fairness  opinions  or  valuations  of  corporations  or  other 
entities that hold Mineral Properties as assets. As a result, the use of CIMVal standards are not 
mandatory for this Fairness Opinion; however, Glanville is familiar with the CIMVal Standards, 
and has applied them where appropriate. 
It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  Fairness  Opinion  is  not  a  Technical  Report  nor  a  formal 
valuation as defined in The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum publication of 
February 2003 and amended December 2005, “Standards and Guidelines for Valuation of Mineral 
Properties” (CIMVal Standards and Guidelines). 
Although  purchase  transactions  involving  exploration/development  projects  and  undeveloped 
mineral resources are commonplace (but often do not involve all-cash purchases), such properties 
and resources are often difficult to value by objective means. As a result, a number of different 
methods have been utilized as reasonable indicators of value in supporting the Fairness Opinion. 
There are also standards for valuations published by the CIM and by the TSX-V. According to 
Appendix 3G (Valuation Standards and Guidelines for Minerals Properties) of the TSX Venture 
Exchange (“TSX-V”) “Most valuation methods of  mineral  properties  are highly subjective, and 
often arbitrary in their application, making it difficult to obtain reproducible valuations. It is the 
TSX-V’s view that valuation methods utilized must be appropriate to the subject and be prudently 
applied in order to maintain fairness and consistency, and avoid misuse, bias and misapplication of 
valuation methods”.  
 
Fairness Considerations
In  connection  with  the  provision  of  the  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  has  performed  a  variety  of 
financial,  technical,  and  other  analyses.  In  arriving  at  the  Fairness  Opinion,  Glanville  has  not 
attributed any particular weight to any specific analysis or factor considered, but rather Glanville 
has  made  qualitative  judgments  based  on  his  experience  in  rendering  such  opinions  and  on  the 
circumstances and information as a whole. Glanville considered a number of factors in arriving at 
the Fairness Opinion, including the following, among others.

Fairness Opinion 
Based upon and subject to the limitations in this Fairness Opinion, and such other matters 
as Glanville has considered relevant, it is his opinion that, as of the date hereof, the terms of 
the proposed Transaction (pursuant to which the companies will amalgamate on the basis 
of a Desert Star shareholder receiving one Amalco share for each Desert Star share held 
and  a  Providence  shareholder  receiving  0.4  of  an  Amalco  share  and  0.4  of  an  Amalco 
Warrant  for  each  Providence  share  held)  are  fair  from  a  financial  point  of  view  to  the 
existing Desert Star shareholders. However, Glanville expresses no opinion as to the expected 
trading price of the shares of the combined company if the proposed merger is completed, or of 
Providence and Desert Star if it is terminated. 
 
This Fairness Opinion may be relied upon (subject to the qualifications set out in this report) by 
the Board of Directors, regulatory authorities, and shareholders of Desert Star, but may not be 
used  or  relied  upon  by  any  other  person  without  express  prior  written  consent  of  Glanville. 
However,  Glanville  consents  to  the  duplication  and  inclusion  of  this  Fairness  Opinion  in  a

Desert  Star's  most  advanced  properties  are  its  drill-ready  Copper  King  and  Red  Top  copper 
properties in south-central Arizona and its Anchor gold property in Eureka County, Nevada.
Bruce McKnight Minerals Advisor Services ("McKnight")  has been retained by the Independent 
Special  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Providence  to  determine  the  fairness  to  the 
shareholders of Providence (the “Fairness Opinion” or “Opinion”) of the proposed amalgamation 
(the  “Amalgamation"  or  “Transaction”)  of  Providence  and  Desert  Star.  Pursuant  to  the 
Amalgamation, the existing common shares of the amalgamating companies will be exchanged for 
Amalco common shares based on the following share exchange ratio:
for every one common share of Providence, shareholders will receive 0.4 of an Amalco 
common  share  and  0.4  of  a  common  share  purchase  warrant  of Amalco  (an  “Amalco 
Warrant”).  Each  whole Amalco  Warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  acquire  an  additional 
share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) for a period of two years at a price of $0.25 
per Amalco Warrant Share, and
•
•
for every one share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive one Amalco common 
share; and Desert Star’s outstanding warrants (the “Desert Star Warrants”) will be 
converted into warrants of Amalco, on a one-for-one basis, on the same terms and 
conditions as the Desert Star Warrants.
Fairness Opinion  
This Fairness Opinion is rendered for Providence Resources Corp., and may only be used 
and relied upon in connection the fairness of the proposed Amalgamation, and is valid as 
of the date hereof. In the event that other information material to the Opinion is made 
available subsequent to the date of this Opinion, I reserve the right to modify or withdraw 
the  Opinion  and  disclaim  any  obligation  to  advise  any  person  of  any  change  in  the 
Opinion subsequent to the date herein. 
Subject to the foregoing, and based on a review of all factors considered relevant, it 
is my Opinion that, as of the date hereof, the terms of the proposed Amalgamation 
(pursuant  to  which  the  companies  will  amalgamate  on  the  basis  of  a  Providence 
shareholder  receiving  0.4  of  an  Amalco  share  and  0.4  of  an  Amalco  Warrant  for 
each  Providence  share  held  and  a  Desert  Star  shareholder  receiving  one  Amalco 
share for each Desert Star share held) are fair from a financial point of view to the 
existing  Providence  shareholders.  However,  I  express  no  opinion  as  to  the  expected 
trading  price  of  the  shares  of  Amalco,  the  combined  company,  if  the  proposed 
Amalgamation is completed, or of Providence or Desert Star if it is terminated.

Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
Key Assumptions and Limitations
In arriving at this Opinion, I have relied on the material completeness and accuracy of the 
information, data and reports on both companies' properties; accordingly, my Opinion is 
conditional  upon  the  foregoing.  I  have  not  undertaken  any  specific  independent 
verification  of  such  information  (although  data  was  reviewed  to  determine  its 
“reasonableness”). However, I have no reason to believe that the information provided to 
me is not accurate or complete, and I have not been denied access to any information that 
I requested from the management or directors of Providence or Desert Star.  I conducted 
such investigations, research and analyses as I deemed necessary and appropriate to the 
circumstances,  and  my  Opinion  is  rendered  within  the  context  of  general  business  and 
market conditions prevailing now.
All  references  to  currencies  in  this  report  are  Canadian  dollars,  unless  specified 
otherwise.
It should be emphasized that this report is a Fairness Opinion, and is not intended to be a 
Technical Report as defined in the CIMVAL Standards. As a result, I have only provided 
summaries of some of the key information provided in the technical reports reviewed by 
me.  I  have  utilized  assumptions  and  input  parameters  in  this  Fairness  Opinion  that  I 
believe  are  reasonable  and  appropriate  based  on  industry  standards.  Major  caveats 
include the uncertainty of future exploration, general market conditions, the future prices 
of commodities (copper and gold, in particular), changes to government regulations, and 
environmental/permitting  concerns.  The  geological  summaries,  websites,  and  other 
publications  of  the  companies,  as  well  as  filings  on  SEDAR,  contain  more  detailed 
information  on  the  exploration  projects.  As  a  result,  only  brief  summaries  of  the 
properties are presented in this Fairness Opinion.
I  decided upon the methodologies to be utilized in this Fairness Opinion, and did not 
request or receive, from the managements of Providence or Desert Star, suggestions as to 
the methodologies that might have been utilized. I have relied upon summary technical 
and financial reports, discussions with executives/officers of Providence and Desert Star, 
information provided by management/directors of Providence and Desert Star, publicly 
available  results  to  date,  comparable  properties,  and  the  share  trading  histories  of  the 
companies. This Fairness Opinion is based upon the state of securities markets, economic 
and general business and financial conditions prevailing as at the date hereof. It is also 
based on the conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of Providence and Desert 
Star  as  they  are  reflected  in  the  information,  data  and  other  material  (financial  or 
otherwise)  available  to  or  presented  to  me  in  discussions  with  management  of  the 
companies.  
 
My Opinion must be considered as a whole. Extracting or considering only portions of 
the  Opinion  may  lead  to  incorrect  or  misleading  conclusions,  for  which  I  take  no
6
Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
responsibility.  This  Opinion  should  not  be  construed  as  a  recommendation  for  outside 
investors  or  for  shareholders  to  purchase  or  sell  securities  of  Amalco  if  the 
Amalgamation is completed or of Providence or Desert Star if it is not.
Providence  has  acknowledged  that  the  services  provided  by  me  were  provided  in  an 
advisory capacity only, and that I am not liable for losses, damages, or other claims that 
may result from or be alleged to result from any application or use that Providence and/or 
others may make of my information, data and opinions. Providence has waived, released, 
indemnified  and  agreed  to  hold  me  harmless  from  any  and  all  liability  for  losses, 
damages,  legal  costs,  and  other  claims  arising  from  the  Opinion  and/or  related  issues. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this indemnity shall not apply to me to the extent that a 
court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non-appealable shall 
determine that:
i.
ii.
I have been negligent or dishonest or have committed a fraudulent or willful act of 
misconduct in the course of performance of my respective duties hereunder; and 
 
the  expenses,  costs,  losses,  claims,  damages  or  liabilities,  as  to  which 
indemnification  is  claimed  (up  to  a  maximum  of  the  fees  and  expenses  paid  to 
me),  primarily  resulted  from  such  negligence,  dishonesty,  fraud  or  willful 
misconduct referred to in (i).
I have not conducted a review of the mineral titles, ownership, costs, or environmental 
obligations, and consequently I have not expressed any opinion on these subjects. I do not 
accept any responsibility for errors or omissions pertaining to information provided by 
Providence or Desert Star, or their lawyers, advisors, directors, agents, or other related 
parties.
At any time prior to the completion of the Amalgamation, I reserve the right to amend or 
withdraw this Fairness Opinion in certain circumstances, including in the event that there 
occurs a material change of facts or representations upon which I relied, or in the event 
that I reasonably conclude that the information provided to me or  any  representation  I 
relied upon contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact 
that, in my reasonable opinion, would make this Fairness Opinion untrue or inaccurate in 
any material respect. However, I am under no obligation to make any subsequent changes 
or provide notification to anyone of such changes to the information. The management 
and directors of Providence should inform me if anything in this Fairness Opinion, or any 
of the information on which it is based, is, in their opinion, inaccurate or misleading in 
any way.
This Fairness Opinion is addressed to and is for the sole use and benefit of the Providence 
Board of Directors and shareholders, and may not be referred to, summarized, circulated, 
publicized or reproduced by Providence, other than as set out in this Fairness Opinion, or

disclosed to, used or relied upon by any other party without my express written consent.
Proposed Transaction
Providence and Desert Star have entered into a Letter of Intent to amalgamate the two 
companies (the “Amalgamation”). Pursuant to the proposed Amalgamation, the existing 
common shares of the amalgamating companies will be exchanged for Amalco common 
shares based on the following share exchange ratio:
•
•
for every one common share of Providence, shareholders will receive 0.4 of an 
Amalco common share and 0.4 of a common share purchase warrant of Amalco 
(each whole warrant, an “Amalco Warrant”). Each Amalco Warrant will entitle 
the holder to acquire an additional share of Amalco (an “Amalco Warrant Share”) 
for a period of two years at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Warrant Share, and 
 
for every one share of Desert Star, shareholders will receive one Amalco common 
share; and Desert Star’s outstanding warrants (the “Desert Star Warrants”) will be 
converted into warrants of Amalco, on a one-for-one basis, on the same terms and 
conditions as the Desert Star Warrants.
Some of the other key terms of the agreement are as follows:
•  The  proposed  Amalgamation  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  of 
Providence and Desert Star, and the approval of applicable regulatory authorities. 
•  The  proposed  Amalgamation  will  require  the  statutory  approval  of  at  least  two
thirds of the shareholders of each company voting on the matters.
•  A joint information circular in respect of the special meeting of shareholders of 
each  of  the  amalgamating  companies  will  be  mailed  to  the  shareholders  when 
formal notices of the special meetings are given.
•  The respective boards of directors of Providence and Desert Star have approved a 
proposed Amalgamation of the two companies pursuant to the provisions of the 
Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). 
In  connection  with  the  Amalgamation,  Providence  has  provided  Desert  Star 
$250,000  as  an  unsecured,  non-interest  bearing  loan  (the  “Loan”),  which  Loan 
will  be  fully  refundable  to  Providence  within  30  business  days  if  the 
Amalgamation does not complete.
•
•  Desert Star has outstanding convertible loans in the aggregate of $495,000 (the 
“Convertible Loans”), which are convertible into units of Desert Star (at $0.19 per 
unit)  comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  transferable  share  purchase 
warrant.  Each  warrant  is  exercisable  by  the  holder  to  purchase  an  additional 
common share of Desert Star for a period of 12 months from the issuance of the
8
Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
warrant  at  an  exercise  price  of  $0.25  per  share.  On  completion  of  the 
Amalgamation, the Convertible Loans will become liabilities of Amalco and will 
be convertible into units of Amalco on the same terms and conditions as set out in 
this paragraph.
•  No material adverse change shall have occurred in the business, assets, liabilities, 
results, financial condition, affairs or prospects of Providence or Desert Star from 
the date of the Letter of Intent to the Closing Date.
•  Satisfactory completion of due diligence reviews by Providence and Desert Star,
respectively, acting reasonably.
•  Receipt  of  all  required  approvals  and  consents  to  the  transaction,  including  the
approval of the TSX-V.

Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
The  Kokanee  Creek  silver/gold/zinc/lead  claims,  comprised  of  60  units  and  covering 
1,400  hectares,  were  staked  in  1996  after  base  metal  mineralization  was  found  in  the 
Lower Kokanee Creek Road. The claims cover two historical mineral showings, and are 
located within five kilometres of two past producing mines. The claims are owned 100% 
by Eagle Plains Resources Ltd., and carry an underlying 1% net smelter return ("NSR") 
royalty.
Both base and precious metal mineralization occurs on the Kokanee Creek claims. One of 
the  showings  consists  of  pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  sphalerite,  and  galena  associated  with 
irregular quartz veinlets and fractures within a fine-grained to porphyritic granite. Gold 
mineralization was also located by 1997 drilling.
Investment in Black Sea Copper and Gold
On  November  25th,  2014,  Providence  subscribed  for  1.5  million  units  of  Black  Sea 
Copper  and  Gold  Corp.  (“Black  Sea”)  at  $0.20  per  unit  for  a  total  consideration  of 
$300,000.  Each  unit  is  comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  half  on  one  share 
purchase warrant.  Each whole warrant is exercisable to acquire an additional common 
share of the Black Sea at a price of $0.50 per share for a period of five years. Black Sea is 
a  private  mineral  exploration  company  focused  on  the  identification,  acquisition,  and 
development of copper and gold projects in Eastern Europe. Providence and Black Sea 
are related parties by way of common  directors and officers.  
 
Other Assets of Providence 
 
In addition to its mineral exploration projects, Providence currently has working capital 
of approximately $1.0 million (including 500,000 shares of Eagle Plains Resources Ltd., 
with an estimated market value of $35,000), and other relatively minor assets, including a 
listing on the TSX-V, income tax pools, and office plus field equipment.

Nevada. 
 
Desert Star’s Exploration Properties 
 
Desert Star has drill-ready Laramide-age porphyry copper projects situated in a world-class 
copper district in Arizona, and one drill-ready Carlin-type gold project strategically located 
in the highly-endowed Battle Mountain – Eureka gold trend. The company has optioned the

ongoing at Red Top, Copper King, and Anchor. 
 
Copper King
The  Copper  King  Project  covers  1,438  hectares  (189  unpatented  federal  lode  mining 
claims),  and  is  located  approximately  five  kilometres  northwest  from  the  Resolution 
Copper Project (a joint venture of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton) and the town of Superior, 
Arizona.  Recently,  President  Barak  Obama  signed  the  National  Defense  Authorization 
Act  into  law,  which  includes  riders  containing  the  largest  public  lands  package  since 
2009, and includes land swaps that benefit the Resolution Copper Project in Arizona and 
the Pumpkin Hollow Copper Project in Nevada. The Resolution Copper Project is one of 
the world’s largest undeveloped copper projects.
On September 3rd, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), Desert Star signed an option agreement to

The payments to be made by Desert Star (in addition to the foregoing AMR payments) 
are  US$30,000  upon  having  drilled  1,000  metres  on  the  property;  the  value  of  35,000 
pounds  of  copper  upon  completion  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment,  which 
payment will be considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR; the value 
of 50,000 pounds of copper upon completion of a pre-feasibility study, which payment 
will be considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR; on the completion of 
a feasibility study, an amount equal to (i) 0.25% of the value of each pound of copper up 
to  and  including  500  million  pounds  of  copper  included  in  the  estimated  reserves  of 
minerals as reported in the feasibility study (“Reserves”), plus (ii) 0.05% of the value of 
each pound of copper above 500 million pounds of copper included in the Reserves; if 
the company has not completed a feasibility study or the Copper King property has not 
been placed into commercial production on or before the 12th anniversary of the Effective 
Date, an annual payment of the value of 200,000 pounds of copper commencing on the 
12th anniversary of the Effective Date and continuing thereafter until the 17th anniversary 
of the Effective Date; the value of 175,000 pounds of copper upon the decision by the 
board of directors of the company to develop a mine for production, which payment will 
be considered as additional AMR and credited against the NSR; and the value of 250,000 
pounds of copper upon commencement of commercial production from the mine on the 
property, which payment will be considered as additional AMR and credited against the 
NSR. Each of the foregoing payments shall be due and payable 30 days after the date of 
the event triggering the payment. If commercial production has not occurred on or before 
five  years  after  completion  of  a  feasibility  study,  an  annual  payment  of  the  value  of 
250,000 pounds of copper is required, commencing upon the date that is five years after 
the completion of the feasibility study and ending upon commencement of commercial 
production, which payments will be considered an additional AMR and credited against 
the NSR. The company may purchase one-fifth of the royalty relating to the property at 
any time within twelve years for an amount of US$2,500,000.
The  exploration  expenditures  to  be  incurred  by  the  company  are  US$100,000  by 
September 3rd, 2014 (completed), an additional US$500,000 by September 3rd, 2015, an 
additional US$500,000 by September 3rd, 2016, an additional US$750,000 by September 
3rd,  2017,  an  additional  US$1,150,000  by  September  3rd,  2018,  and  an  additional 
US$1,000,000 by each anniversary of the Effective Date thereafter until completion of a 
feasibility study.
The Copper King project is considered prospective for bulk tonnage supergene (oxide) 
and  hypogene  (sulphide)  copper  and  molybdenum  mineralization.  Surface  geology,
12
Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
copper and molybdenum metal zonation defined by surface rock sampling, as well as a 
very large (one kilometre by one kilometre) alteration zone suggest to Desert Star that the 
Copper King project represents the top and/or side of an intact porphyry system. Locally 
intense calc-silicate alteration of moderately inclined sedimentary wall rocks, in addition 
to copper oxide and copper sulphide minerals present in both wall rocks and porphyritic 
intrusions, may represent leakage from an intact but unexposed porphyry system.
In  August  2014,  the  company  completed  an  Induced  Polarization  ("IP”)  geophysical 
survey at the Copper King project, which produced two high quality anomalies consisting 
of chargeability highs coincident with resistivity low features. The combined anomalies 
measure  approximately  2,700  metres  in  length  when  projected  to  surface,  and  extend 
beyond  the  estimated  detection  depth  of  the  survey  (approximately  600  metres).  The 
anomalies identified by the survey are open to the southwest, coalesce at depth, appear to 
plunge toward the southwest, and are interpreted to be caused by disseminated sulphides, 
which is consistent with mineralization associated with porphyry copper systems.
In September 2014, the company commenced follow-up geophysics at Copper King in 
order  to  further  define  the  location,  extent,  and  geometry  of  the  IP  anomalies  that  the 
Company  identified  previously.  The  work,  which  was  completed  in  November  2014, 
identified  a  large  IP  geophysical  anomaly  resulting  from  a  3D  IP  survey.  The  survey 
defined  a  coincident  chargeability  high  and  resistivity  low  anomaly  within  the  Copper 
King project claim block. The geophysical target features are present from 200m to 700m 
depth (open at depth), and range in plan view size from 700m x 500m (at a 200m depth 
slice) to 1000m x 1300 m (at a 700m depth slice). The IP anomaly is characterized by a 
zoned  chargeability/resistivity  pattern  typical  of  porphyry  systems,  and  has  a  spatial 
association with the eastern contact between pre-mineral quartz diorite and Pinal Schist. 
The  IP  anomaly  is  consistent  in  size,  geometry,  and  position  with  a  west-southwest 
plunging  porphyry  copper  target,  previously  suggested  by  geologic  mapping.  The  IP 
anomaly,  together  with  the  lithological  alteration,  and  geochemical  data  that  the 
Company previously generated is believed to represent a high quality porphyry copper 
drill target for Desert Star.
As at October 31st, 2014, approximately $397,000 had been incurred by Desert Star for 
exploration and acquisition expenditures on the Copper King property. 
 
Red Top 
The Red Top Project covers 1,463 hectares (192 unpatented federal lode mining claims), 
and is located approximately eight kilometers northwest of the Resolution Copper Project 
(a  joint  venture  of  Rio  Tinto  and  BHP  Billiton)  and  8.5  kilometers  from  the  town  of 
Superior, Arizona. It is contiguous to, and north of the Copper King property.  
On September 3rd, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), Desert Star signed an option agreement to 
acquire a 100% interest in the Red Top property. In order to earn the 100% interest, the 
company  is  required  to  make  a  cash  payment  of  US$30,000,  issue  350,000  common 
shares  (issued),  make  advance  minimum  royalty  payments  (“AMR”),  and  incur

a  2.5%  NSR  payable  upon  the  project  being  brought  into  commercial  production.  The 
AMR payments to be made by the company to the optionor are the value of 6,667 pounds 
of copper on October 3rd, 2014 (paid), the value of 6,667 pounds of copper on November

commencement of commercial production from the mine on the property, which payment 
will be considered as an additional AMR payment and credited against the NSR. Each of 
the  foregoing  payments  shall  be  due  and  payable  30  days  after  the  date  of  the  event 
triggering the payment. If commercial production has not occurred on or before five years 
after completion of a feasibility study, an annual payment of the value of 250,000 pounds 
of copper  is required, commencing upon the date that is five years after the completion 
of  the  feasibility  study  and  ending  upon  commencement  of  commercial  production,

Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
The Red Top project is considered by the company to be prospective for bulk tonnage 
supergene  (oxide)  and  hypogene  (sulphide)  porphyry  copper  and  molybdenum 
mineralization. The property contains an abundance of (oxidized) sulphides, and, together 
with  the  style,  size  (greater  than  350  metres  of  exposed  strike  length)  and  intensity  of 
advanced  argillic  hydrothermal  alteration  (sericite  with  dickite  and  pyrophyllite),  the 
zoned  copper-molybdenum  footprint  based  on  rock  chip  samples;  (greater  than  1.5 
kilometres  in  length),  and  presence  of  favorable  Laramide-age  porphyritic  intrusions 
suggest that the Red Top project represents a high level intact porphyry system. 
 
In June 2014, Desert Star completed a 12-day exploration field program on its Red Top 
property, which included geological mapping, sampling, and an alteration study utilizing 
Terraspec  analysis,  and  through  this  delineated  a  1,400  metre  by  1,500  metre  zone  of 
intense illite +/- pyrophyllite alteration. The company interprets this alteration zone to be 
the upper portion of a porphyry system. Two IP surveys were completed at Red Top in 
October 2014 in order to increase confidence in the location, geometry, and intensity of 
the geophysical anomaly first identified in June 2014. The surveys identified a large IP 
geophysical anomaly, which, together with the lithological, alteration, and geochemical 
data the company previously identified is believed to represent a high quality porphyry 
copper drill target for Desert Star. As a result of the company identifying an open-ended, 
1,400-metre  coincident  chargeability  and  resistivity  anomaly,  Desert  Star  staked  44 
additional claims (720 acres, or approximately 290 hectares) to the north of the property. 
 
As at October 31st, 2014, expenditures of approximately $316,000 had been incurred by 
Desert Star for exploration on and acquisition of the Red Top property.
Anchor 
The Anchor Project consists of 54 unpatented federal mineral claims on BLM land, and is 
located at the south end of Diamond Valley, Eureka County, Nevada. The Anchor Project 
is  situated  about  ten  kilometres  northwest  of  Barrick  Gold’s  Ruby  Hill  Mine  at  the 
southern end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trend. This prolific gold trend includes 
mines  such  as  the  Pipeline  Mine  complex,  the  Marigold  Deposit,  and  Barrick  Gold’s 
recent Gold Rush discovery. 
 
On  September  16th,  2013,  Desert  Star  signed  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  a  51% 
interest  in  the  Anchor  property.  On  September  23rd,  2014,  Desert  Star  entered  into  an 
agreement to amend the option agreement, whereby the company is required (in order to 
earn  a  51%  interest)  to  issue  1,100,000  of  its  common  shares  and  incur  exploration 
expenditures  of  not  less  than  US$2.0  million  by  March  24th,  2016  (including  drilling 
1,500 metres aimed at the Devils Gate formation by September 16th, 2015). The optionor 
will retain a 1% NSR on the property, the parties will form a limited liability company 
(LLC), and enter into a shareholders’ agreement governing the LLC. The common shares 
to be issued by the company to the optionor include 200,000 by September 24th, 2013

(issued),  400,000  by  September  23rd,  2014  (issued),  and  500,000  by  September  24th, 
2015.   
 
Upon completion of the earn-in to 51%, the company has the option to earn an additional 
14% interest in the Anchor property by incurring additional exploration expenditures of 
US$4.0 million and issuing one million common shares by September 24th, 2017. Upon 
earning  the  additional  14%,  the  company  may  earn  an  additional  5%  in  the  Anchor 
property  if  it  elects  to  complete  a  PEA,  and  the  optionor  elects  not  to  participate  in 
funding its proportionate cost of the PEA. 
 
The  Anchor  property  is  centered  on  a  600  metre  by  500  metre  gold-arsenic-antimony 
rock  and  soil  geochemical  anomaly  hosted  in  Mississippian  siliciclastic  sedimentary 
rocks  (Chainman  Formation).  Previous  exploration  work  conducted  by  various  groups 
identified  gold  mineralization  (rock  grab  samples)  up  to  1.83  gpt  gold,  which  were 
associated  with  highly  anomalous  arsenic  (11,900  ppm)  and  antimony  (1,030  ppm), 
elements typically linked with Carlin-style gold systems. Historic drilling at the Anchor 
property focused on the siliciclastic Chainman Formation, and did not test the carbonate 
debris flow sedimentary rocks of the underlying Devils Gate Formation. Carbonate debris 
flow sedimentary rocks are the most prolific gold host rocks in the Great Basin. Desert 
Star’s 
the  gold  and  associated  arsenic  and  antimony 
mineralization within the siliciclastic sedimentary rocks at the Anchor project represent a 
‘leakage anomaly’ above possible gold at depth in the prospective Devils Gate Formation 
debris flow host rocks. 
 
As at October 31st, 2014, approximately $137,000 had been incurred by Desert Star for 
exploration and acquisition expenditures on the Anchor property.

Henry 
On April 5th, 2012, Desert Star signed an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in 
the Henry property located in Saskatchewan. To acquire a 100% interest, the company 
made cash payments of $155,000 and issued one million shares. The vendors retain a 2% 
net  smelter  royalty  on  the  property.  On  May  13th,  2013,  the  company  accelerated 
payments under the Henry property option agreement, and exercised its option to acquire 
a  100%  interest  in  the  property  by  issuing  250,000  common  shares.  An  impairment 
charge  of  $390,288  was  applied  as  at  April  30th,  2014,  due  to  certain  claims  being 
allowed to lapse. 
 
Approaches to Fairness Opinions and Valuations of Mineral 
Properties 
 
For  mineral  exploration  and  mining  properties,  the  approach  to  valuations  normally 
entails assessing the value of the properties using as many techniques as are applicable, in 
order  to  check  them  against  each  other  and  to  determine  the  most  reasonable  values.
16
Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
There are three basic methods of mineral property valuations (for properties which are 
not yet at the Economic Assessment stage):
•  Valuation based on the comparables approach, utilizing dollars per ounce (in situ) 
of  precious  metals  and  cents  per  pound  of  contained  copper  and  nickel  in  the 
resource, and
•  Valuation  based  on  the  adjusted  appraised  (book)  value  approach,  using  a 
multiplier  to  adjust  the  book  value.  The  “Book  Value  Multiplier”  ratio  is  derived 
from a number of comparable precious and base-metal exploration and development 
companies,  and  is  essentially  the  average  of  ratios  of  the  market  capitalizations 
attributed  to  mineral  properties  divided  by  the  past  expenditures  or  deferred 
exploration expenses, also known as the “book values”
•  Valuation based on the attributed market capitalization approach, which allocates 
a portion of a company's market capitalization (after adjusting for other assets and 
liabilities) to the property in question.
Net Asset Value approaches such as discounted cash flow (“DCF”) may not be formally 
used if the property has no reserves or resources as defined by the CIM Standards On 
Mineral  Resources  And  Reserves,  dated  August  20,  2000,  as  required  by  NI  43-101. 
Since  there  has  been  no  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  carried  out,  the  DCF 
approach  was  not  utilized.  However,  the  Comparable  Transaction  and  the  Book  Value 
Approaches were utilized.
transactions
involving  exploration  and  development  properties  are 
Although 
commonplace (but seldom involve all-cash purchases), such properties and resources are 
often difficult to value by objective means. As a result, a number of different methods 
have been utilized as reasonable indicators of value, and are discussed below. There are 
also  standards  for  valuations  published  by  the  CIM  and  by  the  TSX-V.  According  to 
Appendix 3G (Valuation Standards and Guidelines for Minerals Properties) of the TSX 
Venture Exchange “Most valuation methods of mineral properties are highly subjective, 
and  often  arbitrary  in  their  application,  making  it  difficult  to  obtain  reproducible 
valuations. It is the Exchange’s view that valuation methods utilized must be appropriate 
to the subject and be prudently applied in order to maintain fairness and consistency, and 
avoid misuse, bias and misapplication of valuation methods.” Based on the foregoing, the 
Exchange  accepts  the  use  of  the  following  primary  valuation  methods  for  properties 
without mineral reserves:
•  Appraised Value whereby only the retained past expenditures (also known
as “book value”, “historical costs” or “replacement costs”) are included.
•  Comparable  Transactions  whereby  properties  similar
in  all  aspects  are
17
Providence Resources Corp.  Fairness Opinion, February 27, 2015
incorporated into the analysis, whereby fair market value can be determined.
Although  the  Exchange  does  not  specifically  exclude  other  valuation  approaches  for 
exploration and development (non-producing) properties, they are considered secondary 
valuation  methods.  These  other  approaches  include  the  modified  appraisal  method,  the 
values of similar (but not truly comparable) property portfolios (since there are no two 
properties  similar  in  all  respects),  and  the  adjusted  market  capitalization  approach.  It 
should  also  be  noted  that  I  am  not  required  to  use  the  CIMVAL  or  the  Exchange 
Valuation Standards in preparation of this Fairness Opinion, but I am familiar with them 
and have utilized them where appropriate.
