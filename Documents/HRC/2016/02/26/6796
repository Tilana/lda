<p><b>Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, by decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  On the issue of the right to development, a 
comprehensive annual report (E/CN.4/2006/24) was submitted to the sixty-second session of 
the Commission on Human Rights pursuant to its resolution 1998/72.  The information in the 
report remains relevant, and is complemented by the report submitted more recently to the 
General Assembly (A/61/211) pursuant to its resolution 60/157.  The Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights understands decision 2/102 as preserving the previous annual 
reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the Council.  The present report 
to the Human Rights Council accordingly addresses developments in respect of the right to 
development over the last year.

<p><b>Activities relating to the implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 1/4 of 30 June 2006, which 
endorsed the recommendations of the seventh session of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights undertook preparations 
for the implementation of the recommendations and for the third session of the high-level task 
force on the implementation of the right to development.   
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of the task force was to apply the criteria for periodic evaluation of global 
development partnerships - as identified on Millennium Development Goal 8 (MDG 8) - from 
the perspective of the right to development, on a pilot basis, to selected partnerships, with a view 
to operationalizing and progressively developing these criteria, and thus contributing to 
mainstreaming the right to development in the policies and operational activities of relevant 
actors at the national, regional and international levels, including multilateral financial, trade and 
development institutions (see E/CN.4/2006/26, para. 77).   
</p>
<p>3. The third session of the task force took place from 22 to 26 January 2007 in Geneva, at 
which a dialogue took place between the expert members of the task force, representatives of 
institutional members of the task force, and representatives of the organizations involved in the 
above-mentioned partnerships.  Member States observers also participated in the rich and 
fruitful discussions of the meeting.   
</p>
<p>4. The three partnerships selected for an initial assessment by the task force were 
the following:  the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM); the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)/Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) Mutual Review of 
Development Effectiveness in the context of the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development 
(NEPAD); and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.   
</p>
<p>5. In line with the practical and action-oriented approach adopted by the Working Group on 
the Right to Development in recent years, the task force deemed it important to ensure that the 
implementation of the right to development be supported by an operational framework that is 
conceptually and methodologically rigorous.  Furthermore, building upon comparative 
experiences in the implementation of other partnerships and their monitoring mechanisms - to 
the extent of legitimate overlap with the above criteria - will help avoid having application of 
these criteria &#8220;reinvent the wheel&#8221;.  The exercise of piloting the criteria would also contribute to 
revealing the distinctive attributes brought by the right to development, in a practical sense.   
</p>
<p>6. In addition to an initial assessment of the three partnerships above, the task force 
concluded that the right to development framework has value-added for the partnerships it 
reviewed, and that continued refinement and application of the criteria could make significant 
contributions to the current and future partnerships, and might possibly inspire them to explicitly 
factor essential elements of the right to development into their respective operational 
frameworks.  To this end, the task force suggested that additional development partnerships, 
within the scope of MDG 8, be considered. </p>

</p>
<p>7. The report of the task force, including its conclusions and recommendations 
(A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2), will be submitted to the eighth session of the Working Group on the 
Right to Development, to be held in Geneva from 26 February to 2 March 2007. 
</p>
<p>8. In the period covered by this report, several events were organized on the right to 
development at which OHCHR participated.  The Egyptian National Human Rights Council 
organized a conference in Cairo to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration 
on the Right to Development, on 2 and 3 December 2006, at which experts in the field of 
development and human rights, the Chairperson of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development and OHCHR were represented.  The discussions during this meeting, which was 
attended by many representatives of the Government of Egypt and civil society organizations, 
focused on both national and international dimensions of the right to development, including 
national-level implementation, the role of international actors independently and in partnership, 
as well as on what international partnerships could do to focus their efforts more effectively 
towards realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>9. During the third session of the Human Rights Council, the Friedrich Ebert 
Stiftung foundation organized a panel discussion and expert meeting in Geneva 
on 29 and 30 November 2006, respectively.  The panel discussion held on 29 November 
intended to raise awareness among those attending the Council session about the twentieth 
anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development and recent developments in the 
right-to-development process.  The expert meeting on 30 November aimed to inform 
representatives of several national development agencies about the right-to-development criteria 
adopted by the Working Group on the Right to Development at its seventh session, and to 
explore the possibilities of involving these institutions in the implementation process.
