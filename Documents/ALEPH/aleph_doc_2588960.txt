Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1. Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of the Business—Our business consists of refining and marketing, retail and midstream services
conducted primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast, Northeast and Southeast regions of the United
States, through subsidiaries, including Marathon Petroleum Company LP, Speedway LLC and its subsidiaries
(“Speedway”) and MPLX LP and its subsidiaries (“MPLX”).
See Note 9 for additional information about our operations.
Basis of Presentation—All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
These interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of our management,
these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported. All
such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. These interim consolidated
financial statements, including the notes, have been prepared in accordance with the rules of the SEC
applicable to interim period financial statements and do not include all of the information and disclosures
required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
In the first quarter of 2016, we revised our segment reporting in connection with the contribution of our inland
marine business to MPLX. See Note 3 for additional information. The operating results for our inland marine
business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners LLC (“Crowley Ocean
Partners”), are now reported in our Midstream segment. Previously they were reported as part of our Refining
& Marketing segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment
presentation. See Note 9 for additional information.
2. Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted
In September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that eliminates the requirement to restate
prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments related to business combinations. This
accounting standard update requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment be
recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The change was effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We recognized measurement period adjustments
during the first and second quarters of 2016 on a cumulative prospective basis as additional analysis was
completed on the preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.
(“MarkWest”). See Note 4 for further discussion and detail related to these measurement period adjustments.
In May 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that eliminates the requirement to categorize
investments that are measured at net asset value using the practical expedient in the fair value hierarchy. The
change was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within the fiscal
year. Retrospective application is required. Adoption of this accounting standard update in the first quarter of
2016 did not have a material impact on our disclosures.
In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update clarifying whether a customer should account
for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by
providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a
software license acquisition. The change was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015. Retrospective or prospective application is allowed. We adopted
this accounting standard update prospectively in the first quarter of 2016 and it did not have a material impact
on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update making targeted changes to the current
consolidation guidance. The accounting standard update changes the considerations related to substantive
rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the VIE consolidation model and eliminates
certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The
change was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015. Under the accounting standard update, we continue to consolidate our master limited partnership,
MPLX, but it is now considered to be a VIE. The accounting standard update did impact our disclosures for this
consolidated VIE, but did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.
8
Table of Contents
In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for the elimination of the concept of
development stage entity (“DSE”) from U.S. GAAP and removes the related incremental reporting. The
accounting standard update eliminated the additional financial statement requirements specific to a DSE and
was adopted in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the portion of the accounting standard update that
amended the consolidation model to eliminate the special provisions in the VIE rules for assessing the
sufficiency of the equity of a DSE was adopted in the first quarter of 2016. Adoption of this accounting standard
update in the first quarter of 2015 and 2016 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the accounting for credit losses on
certain financial instruments. The guidance requires that for most financial assets, losses be based on an
expected loss approach which includes estimates of losses over the life of exposure that considers historical,
current and forecasted information. Expanded disclosures related to the methods used to estimate the losses
as well as a specific disaggregation of balances for financial assets are also required. The change is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early
adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. We do not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to simplify some provisions in stock
compensation accounting. The areas for simplification involve the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and
classification within the statement of cash flows. This change will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Prospective early adoption is permitted. We do
not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update eliminating the requirement that an investor
retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an investment that it had accounted for by another
method initially qualifies for the equity method. This change will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. The guidance will be applied prospectively and
early adoption is permitted. We do not expect application of this accounting standard update to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on lease accounting. This accounting
standard update requires lessees to record virtually all leases on their balance sheets. The accounting
standard update also requires expanded disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the
amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The change will be effective on a
retrospective or modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of determining the impact of
the accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring unconsolidated equity
investments, not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. The accounting standard update also requires the use of the exit price notion when
measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and the separate presentation of
financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form on the balance sheet and accompanying
notes. The accounting standard update eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and assumptions
used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. Lastly, the accounting
standard update requires separate presentation in other comprehensive income of the portion of the total
change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when electing
to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The
changes are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017. Upon adoption, entities will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated
results of operations as of the beginning of the first reporting period the guidance is effective. Early adoption is
permitted only for the guidance regarding presentation of a liability’s credit risk. We do not expect application
of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring management to assess an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances.
Management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the issuance of the financial statements. Disclosures will be required if
conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether
management’s plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The change will be effective for the first
fiscal period ending after December 15, 2016, and for fiscal periods and interim periods thereafter with early
application permitted. We do not expect application of this accounting standard update to have an impact on
our disclosures.

Table of Contents
In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for revenue recognition for contracts with
customers. The guidance in the accounting standard update states that revenue is recognized when a
customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach
including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction
price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations
are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The change
will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted, no earlier than January 1,
2017. We are in the process of determining the impact of the accounting standard update on our consolidated
financial statements.
3. MPLX LP
MPLX is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire
pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of hydrocarbon-based products,
including crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGLs. On December 4, 2015, MPLX and MarkWest
completed a merger, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (the “MarkWest
Merger”). MarkWest’s operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL
gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. MPLX’s other assets include a 100 percent
interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LLC, which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product
pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States
and a 100 percent interest in a butane cavern in Neal, West Virginia. MPLX also owns an inland marine
business, which is comprised of 18 tow boats and approximately 200 barges that transports primarily crude oil
and refined products principally for MPC in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 23 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner
interest. MPLX is a VIE because the limited partners of MPLX do not have substantive kick-out or substantive
participating rights over the general partner. We are the primary beneficiary of MPLX because in addition to
significant economic interest, we also have the power, through our 100 percent ownership of the general
partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact MPLX. We therefore consolidate MPLX and
record a noncontrolling interest for the 77 percent interest owned by the public. The components of our
noncontrolling interest consist of equity-based noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest.
The redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to MPLX’s preferred units, discussed below.
The creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC’s general credit through guarantees or other financial
arrangements. The assets of MPLX are the property of MPLX and cannot be used to satisfy the obligations of
MPC.
Private Placement of Preferred Units
On May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A
Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net
proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units was used for capital
expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes.
The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon
liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to
$0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of
issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the
MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit
distributions paid to common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a
one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to
certain conditions.
The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption
provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are
presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. We have
recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX
Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future,
adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable
that the security would become redeemable.

Table of Contents
Contribution of Inland Marine Business to MPLX
On March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million common
units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by
dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading
days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also
agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions with
respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was
accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss.
ATM Program
On March 4, 2016, MPLX filed a prospectus supplement to its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on
March 27, 2015, authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in
amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any
offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the “ATM Program”).
MPLX expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program for general partnership purposes.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, MPLX issued an aggregate of 12 million common units under the
ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $315 million. As a result of common units issued
under the ATM Program during the period, we contributed approximately $6 million to MPLX in exchange for
general partner units to maintain our two percent general partner interest.
Agreements
We have various long-term, fee-based transportation and storage services agreements with MPLX. Under
these agreements, MPLX provides transportation and storage services to us, and we commit to provide MPLX
with minimum quarterly throughput volumes on crude oil and refined products systems and minimum storage
volumes of crude oil, refined products and butane. We also have agreements with MPLX that establish fees for
operational and management services provided between us and MPLX and for executive management
services and certain general and administrative services provided by us to MPLX. These transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.
4. Acquisition and Investments
Merger with MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.
On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred
was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment
of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid in equal amounts,
the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017, in connection with
the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics
reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.

Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocations as of December 31, 2015 stem mainly from
additional information obtained by management in the first quarter about facts and circumstances that existed
at the acquisition date including updates to forecasted employee benefit costs and capital expenditures, and
completion of certain valuations to determine the underlying fair value of certain acquired assets. The
adjustment to intangibles mainly relates to a misstatement in the preliminary purchase price allocation as of
December 31, 2015. The correction of the error in the first quarter resulted in a $68 million reduction to the
carrying value of goodwill and offsetting increases of $64 million in intangibles and $2 million in both equity
method investments and property, plant and equipment. Management concluded that the correction of the error
is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
The increases to fair value of equity method investments, property plant and equipment, and other noncurrent
assets noted above would not have resulted in a material effect to depreciation and amortization or income
from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31,
2015, had the fair value adjustments been recorded as of December 4, 2015.
The net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the MarkWest Merger was
less than the fair value of the total consideration resulting in the recognition of $2.21 billion of goodwill in three
reporting units within our Midstream segment, substantially all of which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill represents the complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest and MPLX that
will provide significant additional opportunities across the hydrocarbon value chain.
As further discussed in Note 14, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge based on the implied fair value of
goodwill as of the interim impairment analysis in the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016,
we finalized the analysis of the purchase price allocation. The completion of the purchase price allocation
resulted in a refinement of the impairment expense recorded, as more fully discussed in Note 14.

Investments in Ocean Vessel Joint Ventures
We currently have ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley Maritime Corporation
(“Crowley”), which were established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in clean product service.
In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners,
with Crowley. The joint venture will own and operate four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which will
be leased to MPC. Contributions to the joint venture occur as each vessel is delivered. Two of the vessels
were delivered in 2015, the third was delivered in April 2016 and the fourth is expected to be delivered in the
third quarter of 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we contributed $35 million in connection
with the delivery of the third vessel. We have contributed a total of $107 million for the first three vessels.
In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners LLC
(“Crowley Coastal Partners”), in which MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each
contributed their 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal
Partners. In addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership
interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners LLC (“Crowley Blue Water Partners”) to Crowley Coastal Partners.
Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series ATB vessels that are
leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as part of our Midstream
segment using the equity method of accounting.
See Note 5 for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as a VIE and Note 22 for information on our
conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners and
commitments for future contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners.
Investment in Pipeline Company
In November 2013, we agreed to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline project and fund 37.5
percent of the construction costs of the project, which was to become part of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P.’s
(“Enbridge Energy Partners”) North Dakota System. In exchange for these commitments, we were to earn an
approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System when the
Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. We made contributions of $14 million to North Dakota Pipeline
Company LLC (“North Dakota Pipeline”) during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and have contributed
$301 million since project inception to fund our share of the construction costs for the project. As discussed
further in Note 23, our commitment to fund this pipeline project is expected to be cancelled in connection with
our anticipated investment in the Bakken Pipeline system. Due to these subsequent events, which were not
known or knowable at June 30, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in North Dakota Pipeline is
expected to be subject to an impairment review in the third quarter of 2016. This review could result in a
charge to impair our investment in the project. We account for our interest in North Dakota Pipeline as part of
our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting. See Note 22 for information on future
contributions to North Dakota Pipeline.

5. Variable Interest Entities
In addition to MPLX, as described in Note 3, the following entities are also VIEs.
Crowley Coastal Partners
In May 2016, Crowley Coastal Partners was formed to own the interest in both Crowley Ocean Partners and
Crowley Blue Water Partners. We have determined that Crowley Coastal Partners is a VIE based on the terms
of the existing financing arrangements for Crowley Blue Water Partners and Crowley Ocean Partners and the
associated parent debt guarantees. Our maximum exposure to loss at June 30, 2016 was $426 million, which
includes our equity method investment in Crowley Coastal Partners and the debt guarantees provided to each
of the lenders to Crowley Blue Water Partners and Crowley Ocean Partners. We are not the primary
beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to control the activities that significantly influence
the economic outcomes of the entity and therefore, do not consolidate the entity.
MarkWest Utica EMG
On January 1, 2012, MarkWest Utica Operating Company, LLC (“Utica Operating”), a wholly-owned and
consolidated subsidiary of MarkWest, and EMG Utica, LLC ("EMG Utica") (together the "Members"), executed
agreements to form a joint venture, MarkWest Utica EMG LLC (“MarkWest Utica EMG”), to develop significant
natural gas gathering, processing and NGL fractionation, transportation and marketing infrastructure in eastern
Ohio.
MarkWest has a 60 percent legal ownership interest in MarkWest Utica EMG. MarkWest Utica EMG's inability
to fund its planned activities without subordinated financial support qualify it as a VIE. Utica Operating is not
deemed to be the primary beneficiary due to EMG Utica’s voting rights on significant matters. We account for
our ownership interest in MarkWest Utica EMG as an equity method investment. MPLX receives engineering
and construction and administrative management fee revenue and reimbursement for other direct personnel
costs for operating MarkWest Utica EMG. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with
MarkWest Utica EMG includes our equity investment, any additional capital contribution commitments and any
operating expenses incurred by the subsidiary operator in excess of compensation received for the
performance of the operating services. Our equity investment in MarkWest Utica EMG at June 30, 2016 was
$2.27 billion.
Ohio Gathering
Ohio Gathering Company, L.L.C. (“Ohio Gathering”) is a subsidiary of MarkWest Utica EMG and is engaged in
providing natural gas gathering services in the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio. Ohio Gathering is a joint venture
between MarkWest Utica EMG and Summit Midstream Partners, LLC. As of June 30, 2016, we had a 36
percent indirect ownership interest in Ohio Gathering. As this entity is a subsidiary of MarkWest Utica EMG,
which is accounted for as an equity method investment, MPLX reports its portion of Ohio Gathering’s net
assets as a component of its investment in MarkWest Utica EMG. MPLX receives engineering and
construction and administrative management fee revenue and reimbursement for other direct personnel costs
for operating Ohio Gathering.

7. Income per Common Share
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to MPC by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted income per share assumes exercise of certain stock-
based compensation awards, provided the effect is not anti-dilutive.
MPC grants certain incentive compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors that are
considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, we have calculated
our earnings per share using the two-class method.

Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase
authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.36 billion of our common stock under these
authorizations, leaving $2.64 billion available for repurchases as of June 30, 2016. Under these
authorizations, we have acquired 202 million shares at an average cost per share of $36.45.
We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases,
negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of
which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will
depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be
discontinued at any time.
Total share repurchases were as follows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

9. Segment Information
In the first quarter of 2016, we revised our segment reporting in connection with the contribution of our inland
marine business to MPLX. The operating results for our inland marine business and our investment in Crowley
Ocean Partners are now reported in our Midstream segment. Previously they were reported as part of our
Refining & Marketing segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised
segment presentation.
We have three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these
segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.
Refining & Marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest
regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined
products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined
products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to
our Speedway segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.
Speedway – sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in retail markets in the Midwest, East
Coast and Southeast regions of the United States.
Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment
gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs and
•
•
•
transports and stores crude oil and refined products.
On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed a merger with MarkWest and its results are included in the Midstream
segment. Segment information for periods prior to the MarkWest Merger does not include amounts for these
operations. See Note 4.
Segment income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. Corporate
administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets are not allocated to the reportable
segments. In addition, certain items that affect comparability (as determined by the chief operating decision
maker) are not allocated to the reportable segments.

The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes $11 million and $22 million, respectively, for the
amortization of the discount related to the difference between the fair value and the principal amount of the
assumed MarkWest debt.
11. Income Taxes
The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 33 percent and 34 percent for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and 37 percent and 35 percent for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 varies
from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to the net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests (including their proportional share of the goodwill impairment
charge recorded by MPLX), the domestic manufacturing deduction and state and local tax expense. The
effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 is equivalent to or slightly less than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic
manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense.
On March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for MPLX common units
representing limited partner interests and general partner units resulting in an increase in MPC’s controlling
interest in MPLX. As a result of the change in our ownership of the underlying assets of MPLX, we recorded a
decrease in MPC’s deferred tax liabilities of $42 million with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital.
During the first quarter of 2016, MPC’s deferred tax liabilities increased $115 million and additional paid-in
capital decreased by the same amount for an out of period adjustment to update the preliminary tax effects
recorded in 2015 related to the MarkWest Merger. The impact of the out of period adjustment was not material
to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
We are continuously undergoing examination of our income tax returns, which have been completed for our
U.S. federal and state income tax returns through the 2009 and 2003 tax years, respectively. We had $13
million of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016. Pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with Marathon
Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”), the unrecognized tax benefits related to pre-spinoff operations for which
Marathon Oil was the taxpayer remain the responsibility of Marathon Oil and we have indemnified Marathon
Oil accordingly. See Note 22 for indemnification information.

products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these
inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories
exceeded market value by $370 million. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost. The effect of the
change in LCM reserve was a $370 million benefit to cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative
effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
The cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined
primarily under the LIFO method. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded LIFO liquidations
caused by permanently decreased levels in refined products inventory volumes. Cost of revenues increased
and income from operations decreased by approximately $54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
as a result of the LIFO liquidations. There were no material liquidations of LIFO inventories for the six months
ended June 30, 2015.

14. Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below the carrying value of the net assets of
the reporting unit.
During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX, our consolidated subsidiary, determined that an interim impairment
analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on
consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near
term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted
capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released
or communicated by MPLX’s producer customers and iii) increases in the cost of capital. The combination of
these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first
step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for three of the reporting units to which goodwill
was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than their respective carrying value. In step
two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values
within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of
the reporting units. Accordingly, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the
first quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, we completed our purchase price allocation, which resulted
in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016
had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. This adjustment to the impairment
21
Table of Contents
expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the MarkWest
Merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized.
The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on
applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company
method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate was based on known or
knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop
the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates
of the expected future results and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. Fair value
determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and
factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the
interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were as follows:

Represents the impact of netting assets, liabilities and cash collateral when a legal right of offset exists. As
of June 30, 2016, cash collateral of $12 million was netted with the mark-to-market derivative liabilities. As
of December 31, 2015, $23 million was netted with mark-to-market derivative assets.
We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting arrangements that are reflected gross on
the balance sheet.
Includes $4 million and $5 million classified as current at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,

Commodity derivatives in Level 1 are exchange-traded contracts for crude oil and refined products measured
at fair value with a market approach using the close-of-day settlement prices for the market. Commodity
derivatives are covered under master netting agreements with an unconditional right to offset. Collateral
deposits in futures commission merchant accounts covered by master netting agreements related to Level 1
commodity derivatives are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Commodity derivatives in Level 2 include crude oil and natural gas swap contracts and are measured at fair
value with a market approach. The valuations are based on the appropriate commodity prices and contain no
significant unobservable inputs. LIBO Rates are an observable input for the measurement of these derivative
contracts. The measurements for commodity contracts contain observable inputs in the form of forward prices
based on WTI crude oil prices; and Columbia Appalachia, Henry Hub, PEPL and Houston Ship Channel
natural gas prices.
Level 3 instruments include OTC NGL contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts. The fair
value calculation for these Level 3 instruments used significant unobservable inputs including: (1) NGL prices
interpolated and extrapolated due to inactive markets ranging from $0.24 to $3.35 per gallon, (2) electricity
prices ranging from $26.47 to $57.95 per megawatt hour and (3) the probability of renewal of 50 percent for the
first five-year term and 75 percent for the second five-year term of the gas purchase agreement and the related
keep-whole processing agreement. For these contracts, increases in forward NGL prices result in a decrease
in the fair value of the derivative assets and an increase in the fair value of the derivative liabilities. The
forward prices for the individual NGL products generally increase or decrease in a positive correlation with one
another. The embedded derivative liability relates to a natural gas purchase agreement embedded in a
keep‑whole processing agreement. Increases or decreases in forward NGL prices result in an increase or
decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative. An increase in the probability of renewal would result in
an increase in the fair value of the related embedded derivative liability.
The contingent consideration represents the fair value as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of the
remaining amount we expect to pay to BP related to the earnout provision associated with our 2013
acquisition of BP’s refinery in Texas City, Texas and related logistics and marketing assets. We refer to these
assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.” The fair value of the remaining contingent
consideration was estimated using an income approach and is therefore a Level 3 liability. The amount of
cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput
volumes for the months during which the earnout applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the
annual and total payment. The earnout payment cannot exceed $250 million per year for the last three years of
the arrangement, with the total cumulative payment capped at $700 million over the six-year period
commencing in 2014. Any excess or shortfall from the annual cap for a current year’s earnout calculation will
not affect subsequent years’ calculations. The fair value calculation used significant unobservable inputs,
including: (1) an estimate of forecasted monthly refinery throughput volumes; (2) a range of internal and
external monthly crack spread forecasts from approximately $11 to $17 per barrel; and (3) a range of risk-
adjusted discount rates from five percent to 10 percent. An increase or decrease in forecasts for the crack
spread or refinery throughput volumes may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of
the contingent consideration liability. Increases to the fair value as a result of increasing forecasts for both of
these unobservable inputs, however, are limited as the earnout payment is subject to annual caps. An
increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to the fair value of the
contingent consideration liability, respectively. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is
reassessed each quarter, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues.

Table of Contents
During the second quarter of 2016, we paid BP $200 million for the third year’s contingent earnout. On the
consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016, $164 million of the contingent
earnout payment is included as a financing activity with the remainder included as an operating activity.
Including this second quarter payment, we have paid BP approximately $569 million in total leaving $131
million remaining under the total cap of $700 million.

During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate, an equity method investment, were
reduced in line with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for
maintaining its financial records, we completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in
accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed
asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate’s financial statements was $96 million. Based on
our 60 percent ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately $58 million was recorded in the second quarter
of 2016 in Income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.
Our investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest
Merger, exceeded its proportionate share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC

Topic 360 impairment analysis, we completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC
Topic 323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our
consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional
impairment charge of approximately $31 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in Income (loss)
from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income, which eliminated
the basis differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger.
The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying assets was determined based upon applying the
discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which
is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable
information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the
estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the
expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of
11.9 percent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in

underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio Condensate equity method investment
and its underlying assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim impairment test will prove to be an accurate
prediction of the future.
See Note 14 for additional information on the goodwill impairment.

(a) 
Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are trade accounts
receivable and payables. We believe the carrying values of our current assets and liabilities approximate fair
value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration
of the instruments, (2) our investment-grade credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected
future insignificance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.
Fair values of our financial assets included in investments and other financial assets and of our financial
liabilities included in deferred credits and other liabilities are measured primarily using an income approach
and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows
are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. Other financial assets primarily
consist of environmental remediation receivables. Deferred credits and other liabilities primarily consist of a
liability resulting from a financing arrangement for the construction of MPLX’s steam methane reformer
(“SMR”), a payable for merger cash consideration to be paid to MPLX’s Class B unitholders upon conversion
to MPLX common units, insurance liabilities and environmental remediation liabilities.
Fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt is measured using a market approach, based upon the average of

quotes for our debt from major financial institutions and a third-party valuation service. Because these quotes
cannot be independently verified to the market, they are considered Level 3 inputs. Fair value of variable-rate
long-term debt approximates the carrying value.
16. Derivatives
For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, including any effect of
master netting agreements or collateral, see Note 15. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative
instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.
Derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges may include commodity derivatives used to hedge
price risk on (1) inventories, (2) fixed price sales of refined products, (3) the acquisition of foreign-sourced
crude oil, (4) the acquisition of ethanol for blending with refined products, (5) the sale of NGLs, (6) the
purchase of natural gas and (7) the purchase of electricity.

Commercial Paper - On February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to
have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date
of issuance. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available
capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed and
repaid $763 million under the commercial paper program. At June 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding
under the commercial paper program.
There were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the MPC bank revolving credit facility at
June 30, 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed $280 million under the trade receivables
securitization facility at an average interest rate of 1.3 percent and repaid all of these borrowings. At June 30,
2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our trade receivables securitization facility.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, MPLX borrowed $434 million under the MPLX bank revolving
credit facility at an average interest rate of 1.9 percent, per annum, and repaid $1.3 billion of the outstanding
borrowings. At June 30, 2016, MPLX had no outstanding borrowings and $8 million letters of credit
outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility, resulting in total availability of $1.99 billion.

Net periodic benefit cost
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we made no contributions to our funded pension plans. We have
no required funding for 2016, but plan to make a $175 million voluntary contribution in the third quarter. Benefit
payments related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $8 million and $13 million,
respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we determined that certain of our pension plans’ lump
sum payments to employees retiring in the respective years will exceed the plans’ total service and interest
costs for the year. Settlement losses are required to be recorded when lump sum payments exceed total
service and interest costs. As a result, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
pension settlement expenses of $3 million and $2 million.

22. Commitments and Contingencies
We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Some
of these matters are discussed below. For matters for which we have not recorded an accrued liability, we are
unable to estimate a range of possible loss because the issues involved have not been fully developed
through pleadings and discovery. However, the ultimate resolution of some of these contingencies could,
individually or in the aggregate, be material.
Environmental matters—We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require
responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites and certain other locations
including presently or formerly owned or operated retail marketing sites. Penalties may be imposed for
noncompliance.
31
Table of Contents
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $156 million and $163
million, respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that
might be incurred or the penalties if any that may be imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain
states, under programs to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at
presently or formerly owned or operated retail marketing sites, were $74 million and $70 million at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
We are involved in a number of environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the resolution
of these environmental matters will not, individually or collectively, have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Litigation Relating to the MarkWest Merger—In July 2015, a purported class action lawsuit asserting claims
challenging the MarkWest Merger was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by a purported
unitholder of MarkWest. In August 2015, two similar putative class action lawsuits were filed in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiffs who purport to be unitholders of MarkWest. On September 9,
2015, these lawsuits were consolidated into one action pending in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, now captioned In re MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. Unitholder Litigation. On October 1, 2015, the
plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the individual members of the board of directors of MarkWest
Energy GP, L.L.C. (the “MarkWest GP Board”), MPLX, MPLX GP, MPC and Sapphire Holdco LLC, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of MPLX, asserting in connection with the MarkWest Merger and related disclosures that,
among other things, (i) the MarkWest GP Board breached its duties in approving the MarkWest Merger with
MPLX and (ii) MPC, MPLX, MPLX GP, and Sapphire Holdco LLC aided and abetted such breaches. On
February 4, 2016, the Court approved a stipulation and proposed order to dismiss all claims with prejudice as
to the named plaintiffs, but the Court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate a fee application by the plaintiffs’
counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses. On March 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed
an application for reimbursement of approximately $2 million of legal fees and expenses. On May 17, 2016,
the plaintiffs withdrew the fee application and the case is now dismissed.
MarkWest Environmental Proceeding – In July 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States
Department of Justice entered a pipeline launcher/receiver site of MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources,
L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MarkWest Liberty Midstream”), utilized for pipeline maintenance
operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. MarkWest Liberty Midstream has
provided information in response to subpoenas presented by the government and similar requests for
information from the EPA, state and other agencies related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations
located in Pennsylvania. MarkWest is engaged in ongoing discussions with the EPA and the U.S. Attorney’s
office regarding alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its
launcher/receiver facilities in the region. MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s internal review has determined that its
operations have been conducted consistent with industry practices and in a manner protective of its
employees and the public. It is possible however, that in connection with any potential or asserted civil or
criminal enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material
assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify operations
or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other
obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect
our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties,
fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any
potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time.
Other Lawsuits—In May 2015, the Kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Marathon Petroleum Company LP (“MPC LP”) in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes, the Kentucky Consumer
Protection Act, and state common law. The complaint, as amended in July 2015, alleges that MPC LP used
deed restrictions, supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to
unreasonably restrain trade in areas within Kentucky and seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages, civil
penalties, restitution and disgorgement of profits. At this early stage, the ultimate outcome of this litigation
remains uncertain, and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, can be
determined, and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or range of loss) for this matter. We
intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.
32
Table of Contents
In May 2007, the Kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against us and Marathon Oil in state court in
Franklin County, Kentucky for alleged violations of Kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection
laws following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The lawsuit alleges that we overcharged customers by
$89 million during September and October 2005. The complaint seeks disgorgement of these sums, as well as
penalties, under Kentucky’s emergency pricing and consumer protection laws. We are vigorously defending
this litigation. We believe that this is the first lawsuit for damages and injunctive relief under the Kentucky
emergency pricing laws to progress this far and it contains many novel issues. In May 2011, the Kentucky
attorney general amended his complaint to include a request for immediate injunctive relief as well as
unspecified damages and penalties related to our wholesale gasoline pricing in April and May 2011 under
statewide price controls that were activated by the Kentucky governor on April 26, 2011 and which have since
expired. The court denied the attorney general’s request for immediate injunctive relief, and the remainder of
the 2011 claims likely will be resolved along with those dating from 2005. If the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably
in its entirety, it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
However, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse
effect.
We are also a party to a number of other lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the
resolution of these other lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Guarantees—We have provided certain guarantees, direct and indirect, of the indebtedness of other
companies. Under the terms of most of these guarantee arrangements, we would be required to perform
should the guaranteed party fail to fulfill its obligations under the specified arrangements. In addition to these
financial guarantees, we also have various performance guarantees related to specific agreements.
Guarantees related to indebtedness of equity method investees—We hold interests in an offshore oil port,
LOOP, and a crude oil pipeline system, LOCAP. Both LOOP and LOCAP have secured various project
financings with throughput and deficiency agreements. Under the agreements, we are required to advance
funds if the investees are unable to service their debt. Any such advances are considered prepayments of
future transportation charges. The duration of the agreements vary but tend to follow the terms of the
underlying debt, which extend through 2037. Our maximum potential undiscounted payments under these
agreements for the debt principal totaled $172 million as of June 30, 2016.
We hold an interest in a refined products pipeline through our investment in Centennial, and have guaranteed
our portion of the payment of Centennial’s principal, interest and prepayment costs, if applicable, under a
Master Shelf Agreement, which is scheduled to expire in 2024. The guarantee arose in order for Centennial to
obtain adequate financing. Our maximum potential undiscounted payments under this agreement for debt
principal totaled $31 million as of June 30, 2016.
In connection with our 50 percent indirect interest in Crowley Ocean Partners, we have agreed to conditionally
guarantee our portion of the obligations of the joint venture and its subsidiaries under a senior secured term
loan agreement. The term loan agreement provides for loans of up to $325 million to finance the acquisition of
four product tankers. MPC’s liability under the guarantee for each vessel is conditioned upon the occurrence of
certain events, including if we cease to maintain an investment grade credit rating or the charter for the
relevant product tanker ceases to be in effect and is not replaced by a charter with an investment grade
company on certain defined commercial terms. As of June 30, 2016, our maximum potential undiscounted
payments under this agreement for debt principal totaled $122 million.
In connection with our 50 percent indirect interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners, we have agreed to provide
a conditional guarantee of up to 50 percent of its outstanding debt balance in the event there is no charter
agreement in place with an investment grade customer for the entity’s three vessels as well as other financial
support in certain circumstances. The maximum exposure under these arrangements is 50 percent of the
amount of the debt, which was $146 million as of June 30, 2016.
Marathon Oil indemnifications—In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we have entered into
arrangements with Marathon Oil providing indemnities and guarantees with recorded values of $3 million as of
June 30, 2016, which consist of unrecognized tax benefits related to MPC, its consolidated subsidiaries and
the refining, marketing and transportation business operations prior to our spinoff which are not already
reflected in the unrecognized tax benefits described in Note 11, and other contingent liabilities Marathon Oil
may incur related to taxes. Furthermore, the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with
Marathon Oil to effect our spinoff provide for cross-indemnities between Marathon Oil and us. In general,
Marathon Oil is required to indemnify us for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil’s historical oil and gas
exploration and production operations, oil sands mining operations and integrated gas operations, and we are
required to indemnify Marathon Oil for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil’s historical refining, marketing and
transportation operations. The terms of these indemnifications are indefinite and the amounts are not capped.

Table of Contents
Other guarantees—We have entered into other guarantees with maximum potential undiscounted payments
totaling $83 million as of June 30, 2016, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an
equity method investee for certain catastrophic events, up to $50 million per event, in lieu of procuring
insurance coverage and leases of assets containing general lease indemnities and guaranteed residual
values.
General guarantees associated with dispositions – Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal
course of our business. Certain of the related agreements contain performance and general guarantees,
including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and
environmental and general indemnifications that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering
event or condition. These guarantees and indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We
are typically not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under
such contractual provisions because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often,
the nature of the guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the
exposure because the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable
prediction of the outcome can be based.
Contractual commitments and contingencies—At June 30, 2016, our contractual commitments to acquire
property, plant and equipment and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $1.2 billion, which
includes $131 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay
Refinery and Related Assets, $618 million for contributions to North Dakota Pipeline and $34 million for
contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners. As discussed further in Note 23, our commitment to fund North
Dakota Pipeline in regards to the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project is expected to be cancelled in
connection with our anticipated $500 million investment in the Bakken Pipeline system. Furthermore, MPC
expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system. See Note 4 for additional information
on our investments in North Dakota Pipeline and Crowley Ocean Partners. See Note 15 for additional
information on the contingent consideration.
Certain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing
plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified
construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain
producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements with us if there are significant
delays that are not due to force majeure. As of June 30, 2016, management does not believe there are any
indications that we will not be able to meet the construction milestones, that force majeure does not apply, or
that such fees and charges will otherwise be triggered.
23.Subsequent Events
Trade Receivables Securitization Facility
On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables securitization facility (“trade receivables facility”) to,
among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to
July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.
Bank Revolving Credit Facility
On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC
bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank
revolving credit facility maturing on July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank
revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements
remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.
Investment in Pipeline Company
On August 2, 2016, we announced an agreement with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco
Logistics Partners, L.P. (“SXL”), to acquire a 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the Dakota Access
Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred
to as the Bakken Pipeline system, for $500 million. Subsequent to closing conditions, the transaction is
expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. Upon closing, MPC has committed to participate in a forthcoming
DAPL/ETCOP open season, and subject to the terms and conditions of the open season, make a long-term
volume commitment on the Bakken Pipeline system.
The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil
from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and
ultimately to the Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline system is expected to be ready for service by the end of
2016.
34
Table of Contents
ETP and SXL collectively own a 75 percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the
Bakken Pipeline system. MPC and Enbridge Energy Partners will form a new joint venture to acquire 49
percent of ETP and SXL’s 75 percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. We will own 25 percent
of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in our 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the
Bakken Pipeline system. We expect to account for our investment as part of our Midstream segment using the
equity method of accounting.
Subject to the closing of the transaction with ETP and SXL, Enbridge Energy Partners and MPC have agreed
to the following with respect to MPC’s commitments to the Sandpiper project: a) Enbridge will cancel MPC’s
transportation services agreement with respect to the project and release MPC from paying any termination fee
per that agreement and b) Enbridge will effect the liquidation of MPC’s member interest in North Dakota
Pipeline, which would effectively cancel MPC’s commitment to fund any further construction costs for the
project. As of June 30, 2016, we have contributed $301 million to fund our share of the construction costs for
the Sandpiper pipeline project. Due to these subsequent events, which were not known or knowable at June
30, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in North Dakota Pipeline is expected to be subject to an
impairment review in the third quarter. This review could result in a charge to impair our investment in the
project.

Corporate Overview
We are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We
currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil
refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products
to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast
and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the
largest terminal operations in the United States and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned
trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers
within our market area.
We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-
owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and
convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,770 convenience stores in 22 states throughout
the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the
Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,400 retail
outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.
Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one
of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the
Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the
largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset
network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States
to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural
gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and
marketing. Our assets include approximately 5,500 MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,500 MMcf/d of natural gas
processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than 5,000 miles of gas
gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than
10 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. We own, lease or have ownership
interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our
refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas.
We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution
of our inland marine business to MPLX. In previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in
an ocean vessel joint venture, (Crowley Ocean Partners), were presented within our Refining & Marketing
segment. They are now presented in our Midstream segment. Comparable prior period information has been
recast to reflect our revised segment presentation.
Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and
Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and
services it offers.
Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and
Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes
refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell
refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot
market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail
outlets.
Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in the retail market in the Midwest, East
Coast and Southeast regions of the United States.

Excludes goodwill impairment charges of $1 million and $130 million for the three months and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as discussed in Acquisitions and Investments and an $89 million equity
method investment impairment charge for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, as
discussed in Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Net income attributable to MPC was $801 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $802
million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2016 compared to $826 million, or $1.51 per diluted
share, and $1.72 billion, or $3.14 per diluted share, for the same periods of 2015.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $101 million in the second quarter and
$1.46 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a
non-cash benefit of $360 million and $345 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,
respectively, related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the decreases
in both periods were mainly the result of lower crack spreads, primarily in the Gulf Coast.
Speedway segment income from operations increased $66 million in the second quarter and $65 million in the
first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit
of $25 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 related to the reversal of the Company's LCM
reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increases in segment income were primarily due to higher light
product and merchandise margins. In addition, in the first six months of 2016, the Speedway segment had a
$24 million gain from the sale of a retail location, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Midstream segment income from operations increased $98 million in the second quarter and $175 million in
the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The increases were primarily due to the
inclusion of MarkWest’s operating results following the merger with MPLX on December 4, 2015, as well as
earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments.
MPLX LP
As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 23 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner
interest. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration
transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we
made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid
in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017, in
connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and
operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.
Private Placement of Preferred Units
On May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A
Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net
proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units was used for capital
expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. The approximate $1.3 billion of financing
from the combination of the ATM issuances in the first quarter and this private placement should provide for
MPLX’s anticipated funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.
37
Table of Contents
The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon
liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to
$0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of
issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the
MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit
distributions paid to common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a
one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to
certain conditions.
The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption
provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are
presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have
recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX
Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future,
adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable
that the security would become redeemable.
Contribution of Inland Marine Business to MPLX
On March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX
common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was
determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for
the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement.
We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions,
with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business
was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or
loss.
ATM Program
On March 4, 2016, MPLX filed a prospectus supplement to its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on
March 27, 2015, authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in
amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any
offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the “ATM Program”).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, MPLX issued an aggregate of 12 million common units under the
ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $315 million. As a result of common units issued
under the ATM Program during the period, we contributed approximately $6 million in exchange for general
partner units to maintain our two percent general partner interest.
Distributions from MPLX
The following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first six months of
2016 and 2015.

The market value of the 79.5 million MPLX common units we owned at June 30, 2016 was $2.7 billion based
on the June 30, 2016 closing unit price of $33.63. Over time, we also believe there will be substantial value
attributable to our two percent general partnership interest.
On July 22, 2016, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5100 per common unit payable on
August 12, 2016. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $222 million to its limited and general
partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $91 million.

Acquisitions and Investments
On August 2, 2016, we announced an agreement with ETP and SXL, subject to closing conditions, to acquire
a 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the DAPL and ETCOP projects, collectively referred to as the
Bakken Pipeline system, for $500 million. Subject to closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in
the third quarter of 2016. Upon closing, MPC has committed to participate in a forthcoming DAPL/ETCOP
open season, and subject to the terms and conditions of the open season, make a long-term volume
commitment on the Bakken Pipeline system.
The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil
from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and
ultimately to the Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline system is expected to be ready for service by the end of
2016.
ETP and SXL collectively own a 75 percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the
Bakken Pipeline system. MPC and Enbridge Energy Partners will form a new joint venture to acquire 49
percent of ETP and SXL’s 75 percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. We will own 25 percent
of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in our 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the
Bakken Pipeline system. We expect to account for our investment as part of our Midstream segment using the
equity method of accounting.
Subject to the closing of the transaction with ETP and SXL, Enbridge Energy Partners and MPC have agreed
to the following with respect to MPC’s commitments to the Sandpiper project: a) Enbridge will cancel MPC’s
transportation services agreement with respect to the project and release MPC from paying any termination fee
per that agreement and b) Enbridge will effect the liquidation of MPC’s member interest in North Dakota
Pipeline, which would effectively cancel MPC’s commitment to fund any further construction costs for the
project. As of June 30, 2016, we have contributed $301 million to fund our share of the construction costs for
the Sandpiper pipeline project. Due to these subsequent events, which were not known or knowable at June
30, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in North Dakota Pipeline is expected to be subject to an
impairment review in the third quarter. This review could result in a charge to impair our investment in the
project.
In June 2016, Speedway and Pilot Flying J signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture consisting of 120
travel plazas, primarily in the Southeast United States. The new entity, PFJ Southeast LLC, will initially consist
of 41 existing locations contributed by Speedway and 79 locations contributed by Pilot Flying J, all of which
will carry either the Pilot or Flying J brand and will be operated by Pilot Flying J. This transaction is subject to
customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances.
We currently have ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley, which were
established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in clean product service.
In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners,
with Crowley. The joint venture will own and operate four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which will
be leased to MPC. Contributions to the joint venture occur as each vessel is delivered. Two of the vessels
were delivered in 2015, the third was delivered in April 2016 and the fourth is expected to be delivered in the
third quarter of 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we contributed $35 million in connection
with the delivery of the third vessel. We have contributed a total of $107 million for the first three vessels.
In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners, in which
MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in
Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal Partners. In addition, we contributed $48
million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners to
Crowley Coastal Partners. Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series
ATB vessels that are leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as
part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.
See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as
a VIE and Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on our conditional
guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners and
commitments for future contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners.
On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited
partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest
outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX
having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class
B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to
MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an
39
Table of Contents
additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the
MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units in equal installments, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and
the second of which will be paid in July 2017. These contributions are with respect to MPC’s existing interests
in MPLX (including IDRs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in MPLX. We assigned
the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity
consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
and noncontrolling interest assumed in the MarkWest Merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. During
the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. These
adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among
other items, resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. As a result, we
recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and
$2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion,
including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. MPLX recorded an impairment
charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as
adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed
its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have
been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date.
This adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax
liabilities associated with the MarkWest Merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized.
See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of this interim assessment of goodwill. See
Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on goodwill recorded from the
MarkWest Merger. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of
the acquisition.
Consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the MarkWest Merger combines one of the
nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica
shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by MPC.
The complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest, MPLX and MPC provide significant
additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The combined entity will
further MarkWest's leading midstream presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales by allowing it to pursue
additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their
growing production in these important shale regions. In addition, the combination provides significant vertical
integration opportunities, as MPC is a large consumer of NGLs.
Share Repurchases
Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase
authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.36 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.64 billion
available for repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we have acquired 4 million common
shares at an average cost per share of $40.52 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited
consolidated financial statements.
We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases,
negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of
which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will
depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be
discontinued at any time.
Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.75 billion, an unused $2.5 billion bank revolving
credit facility and approximately $758 million of availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables
securitization facility based on eligible trade receivables. Availability under MPC’s trade receivables facility is
a function of eligible accounts receivable, which will be lower in a sustained lower refined product price
environment. As of June 30, 2016, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not
intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank
revolving credit facility. The above amounts exclude MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which
as of June 30, 2016, had no borrowings and $8 million letters of credit outstanding.
On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables securitization facility (“trade receivables facility”) to,
among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to
July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.
On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC
bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank
revolving credit facility maturing on

Table of Contents
July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July
19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous
bank revolving credit facility.
The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our business strategies and growth
and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets, the pending joint venture with Pilot
Flying J, the timing of delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners, our investment in the Bakken Pipeline
system and the related cancellation of our commitment to fund the Sandpiper pipeline project, and the timing
and amount of the impairment related to the Sandpiper project and our share repurchase authorizations.
Factors that could affect our business strategies and growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect
to our midstream assets include, but are not limited to, volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry
conditions, our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives,
availability of liquidity, actions taken by competitors, regulatory approvals and operating performance. Factors
that could affect the pending joint venture with Pilot Flying J include, but are not limited to, our ability to
successfully close the pending joint venture, including, without limitation, satisfying customary closing
conditions. Factors that could affect delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners include, but are not
limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and the ability to
complete the vessel on the anticipated terms and timetable. Factors that could affect our investment in the
Bakken Pipeline system and the related cancellation of our commitment to fund the Sandpiper pipeline project,
and the timing and amount of the impairment related to the Sandpiper project include, but are not limited to, the
parties’ ability to satisfy closing conditions in the third quarter of 2016. Factors that could affect the share
repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business
conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others,
could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Overview of Segments
Refining & Marketing
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross
margin and refinery throughputs.
Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the
costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our
refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference
between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the
refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not
move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with
other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most
closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS
crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent
residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.
Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In
recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as WTI and LLS, have traded at prices less than Brent due to the
growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts had
favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. The decline in crude oil prices in 2015 and continuing into
the first quarter of 2016 has led to declines in sequential (month on month) onshore U.S. crude oil production
and narrowed the LLS discount to Brent. With the end of the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, LLS and Brent are
expected to trade near parity.
Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a
discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly,
causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In
general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.
Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S.
energy policy.

In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount
of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:
•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;
•our refinery yields;
•the selling prices realized for refined products;
•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;
•the cost of products purchased for resale;
•the effect of changes to refined product prices on LCM inventory valuation reserves; and
•the impact of liquidations of LIFO inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined
products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these
inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a
consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $345 million was allocated to our
Refining & Marketing segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM
reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Based on
movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to
earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
The cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined
primarily under the LIFO method. During the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a permanent reduction in
our refined products inventories for LIFO accounting purposes. The cost of these inventories was based on
prices in early 2015, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax charge
of approximately $54 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction. There were no liquidation of
LIFO inventories for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating
costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other
manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by
our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major
maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are
periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering
projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly more planned turnaround and major
maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries during the first six months of 2016
compared to the same period in 2015.
Speedway
Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost
of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts
the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local
competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the
level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for
gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize.
The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has
contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of
merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined
products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these
inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a
consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $25 million was allocated to our
Speedway segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM reserve
resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Based on movements of
refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such
losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
Midstream
NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as
well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of
additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity
prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants,
purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the
cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the
level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes
shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and
availability of our vessels and barges. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our
common carrier pipelines and marine vessels serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude
oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served
directly by our crude oil pipelines and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are
the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of
alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and
transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected
by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product
pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season,
which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As
with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product
movements.

Net income attributable to MPC decreased $25 million in the second quarter and $915 million in the first six
months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. In both periods of 2016, decreases in income from
operations for our Refining & Marketing segment were partially offset by increases in our Speedway and
Midstream segments. Income from operations includes a non-cash benefit related to the reversal of the
Company’s LCM reserve of $385 million and $370 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,
respectively. Items not allocated to segments include an $89 million impairment charge related to an equity
method investment held by MPLX. See Segment Results for additional information.
Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $3.73 billion in the second
quarter and $8.16 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases
were primarily due to lower average refined product sales prices which decreased $0.43 per gallon and $0.47
per gallon, for the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively.
Income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $70 million in the second quarter and $63 million in
the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to an impairment charge of
$89 million related to an equity method investment held by MPLX, partially offset by increases in income from
our pipeline and marine affiliates.
Net gain on disposal of assets increased $21 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same
period of 2015, primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.

Cost of revenues decreased $3.54 billion in the second quarter and $6.88 billion in the first six months of 2016
compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to:
decreases in refined product cost of sales of $3.3 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, primarily due to
decreases in raw material costs; partially offset by
increases in refinery direct operating costs of $71 million, or $0.61 per barrel of total refinery throughput, and
$302 million, or $1.11 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to increased planned turnaround
activity in 2016.
Purchases from related parties increased $42 million in the second quarter and $73 million in the first six
months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to:
increases in volumes transported by by Illinois Extension Pipeline, which is a pipeline affiliate that became
operational in December 2015, of $28 million and $55 million, respectively;
increases in transportation services provided by Crowley Ocean Partners, which is a new marine joint venture
established in September of 2015, of $17 million and $23 million, respectively;
increases in condensate processing services provided by Ohio Condensate of $3 million and $6 million,
respectively;
decreases in prices for ethanol purchases, partially offset by increases in volume from TAME, TACE, and
TAAE of $6 million and $9 million, respectively; and
•decreases in transportation services provided by Explorer of $1 million and $6 million, respectively.
Inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $385 million in the second quarter
and $370 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The December 31,

•
•
2015 LCM reserve of $370 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the
2015 reserve and a new LCM reserve of $385 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market
prices at that time. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost due to increases in refined product prices
during the second quarter and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of $385
million for the second quarter and $370 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Consumer excise taxes decreased $46 million in the second quarter and $52 million in the first six months of
2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in taxable refined product sales
volumes and tax rates in certain locations.
Impairment expense reflects a $1 million impairment charge recorded by MPLX in the second quarter and
$130 million in the first six months of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted,
recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a
discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill.
Depreciation and amortization increased $138 million in the second quarter and increased $265 million in the
first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to depreciation of the fair value of
the assets acquired in connection with the MarkWest Merger.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8 million in the second quarter and $28 million in the
first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s
expenses, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit expenses.
Other taxes increased $7 million in the second quarter and $19 million in the first six months of 2016 compared
to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s property taxes.
Net interest and other financial costs increased $73 million in the second quarter and $134 million in the first
six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the
MarkWest Merger.
Provision for income taxes decreased $37 million in the second quarter and $512 million in the first six months
of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in income before income taxes of
$93 million in the second quarter and $1.55 billion in the first six months of 2016. The effective tax rate for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to
certain permanent tax differences related to the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including
their proportional share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX, the domestic manufacturing
deduction and state and local tax expense. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015 is equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain
permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and
local tax expense.

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $101 million in the second quarter and
$1.46 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a
non-cash benefit of $360 million and $345 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,
respectively, related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the decrease
in the second quarter was mainly the result of lower crack spreads and less favorable effects of changes in
market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. These decreases were partially offset by the
effects of more favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana
Sweet crude oil. The decrease in the first six months of 2016 was primarily the result of lower crack spreads,
unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil,
and higher operating costs, primarily related to increased turnaround activity, partially offset by more favorable
product price realizations and the favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market
reference prices.
The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results
of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.
Corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX are included in the Midstream segment. Corporate
overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.

Based on the market indicators above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate the following impacts on
Refining & Marketing segment income from operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2016
compared to the same periods of 2015:
The USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $3.61 per barrel for the second quarter and $4.37 per barrel
for the first six months, which had a negative impact on segment income of $442 million for the second quarter
and $1.01 billion for the first six months.
The sweet/sour crude oil differential increased $1.99 per barrel in the second quarter and $0.85 per barrel in
the first six months resulting in positive impacts on segment income of $227 million in the second quarter and
$231 million in the first six months.
The LLS-WTI crude oil differential decreased $3.25 per barrel for the second quarter and $2.92 per barrel for
the first six months, which had a negative impact on segment income of $100 million in the second quarter
and $181 million for the first six months.
The Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread decreased $1.09 per barrel for the second quarter and $2.92 per
barrel for the first six months, which had a negative impact on segment income of $61 million for the second
quarter and $365 million for the first six months.
The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product
sales. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix
and crude costs, as well as the effects of inventory valuation adjustments, market structure on our crude oil
acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated positive
impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $258 million for the second quarter and $175 million in
the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015.

Crude oil throughputs decreased 61 mbpd in the second quarter and 66 mbpd in the first six months of 2016
compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to higher planned turnaround and major maintenance
activity at the Robinson refinery in both periods of 2016 and the Galveston Bay refinery in the first six month of
2016.

Refinery direct operating costs increased $0.61 per barrel in the second quarter and increased $1.11 in the
first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to increases in planned
turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.50 per barrel and $1.04 per barrel, respectively. The increases
in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to significant turnaround costs
incurred by the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and
the Garyville refinery in the second quarter of 2016. Other manufacturing costs were consistent with the
second quarter and first six months of 2015.
We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated
with purchased RINs increased to $78 million in the second quarter and $141 million in the first six months of
2016 from $75 million in the second quarter and $117 million in the first six months of 2015. The second
quarter of 2015 includes a $46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the
renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced
biofuels. Excluding this charge, the increases for both periods of 2016 were primarily due to the effect of
increased prices for bio-mass based diesel RINs.
Speedway segment income from operations increased $66 million in the second quarter and $65 million in the
first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit
of $25 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 related to the reversal of the Company's LCM
reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increases in segment income were primarily due to increases in our
gasoline and distillate gross margin of $35 million, or $0.0198 per gallon, and $2 million, or $0.0038 per
gallon, respectively, increases in merchandise margins of $10 million and $29 million, respectively. In
addition, for the first six months of 2016, the Speedway segment had a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail
location, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Midstream segment income from operations increased $98 million in the second quarter and $175 million in
the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015 primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s
operating results following the merger with MPLX on December 4, 2015, as well as earnings from new and
existing pipeline and marine equity investments.
Corporate and other unallocated items decreased $8 million in the second quarter and $20 million in the first
six months of 2016, largely due to reductions in employee benefit expenses.
Unallocated items also include an impairment charge of $1 million and $130 million recorded by MPLX in the
second quarter and the first six months of 2016, respectively, to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill,
as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and an $89 million impairment charge in the
second quarter of 2016 related to an equity method investment held by MPLX. See the Critical Accounting
Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill and equity method
investments.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $406 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to
the first six months of 2015, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of $1.06 billion and an
increase in deferred income taxes of $187 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $1.04 billion.
Changes in working capital were a net $771 million source of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to
a net $292 million use of cash in the first six month of 2015. The changes in working capital were primarily due
to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by an
increase in current receivables. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
Changes from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
•Accounts payable increased $471 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices.
Current receivables increased $272 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices,
partially offset by lower volumes.
Inventories decreased $16 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined
product inventory volumes partially offset by a $370 million reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory
valuation reserve.
The net $292 million use of cash from working capital changes in the first six months of 2015 was primarily
due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current
receivables and inventory. Changes from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 per the consolidated balance
sheets were as follows:
•Accounts payable decreased $436 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.
Current receivables decreased $182 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and
•
•
•crude oil prices.
Inventories decreased $102 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined
product inventory volumes.
Net cash used in investing activities was $640 million higher in the first six months of 2016 compared to the
first six months of 2015, primarily due to increases in additions to property, plant and equipment, primarily due
to the inclusion of MarkWest capital spending, and acquisitions and investments in affiliates, partially offset by
an increase in disposal of assets.

Net cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment increased $667 million for the first six months of
2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest capital spending in
our Midstream segment. Net cash contributed to equity method investments increased $25 million for the first
six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to contributions to our marine joint
ventures of $82 million, MPLX equity affiliates of $39 million, Illinois Extension Pipeline of $24 million to fund
the SAX pipeline project and North Dakota Pipeline of $14 million to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline
project as compared to our contributions to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $94 million and North Dakota
Pipeline of $44 million in the first six months of 2015. Cash from disposal of assets increased primarily due to
the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.
Financing activities were a net $467 million use of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a net $941
million use of cash in the first six months of 2015. The sources of cash in 2016 included the issuance of the
MPLX Preferred Units and common units and long-term debt borrowings which were more than offset by uses
of cash which included long-term debt repayments, dividend payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests
and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations. In addition, in the first six months
of 2016, uses of cash also included a significant portion of the contingent consideration payment to the seller
of the Galveston Bay refinery.
Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $893 million use of
cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a net $97 million source of cash in the first six months of 2015.
During the first six months of 2016, MPLX used proceeds from its issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units to
repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility. During the first six months of 2015,
MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX Senior Notes to repay amounts outstanding under the
MPLX Credit Agreement, as well as for general partnership purposes.

MPLX. As of June 30, 2016, noncontrolling interests held a 77 percent interest in MPLX, compared to a 29.5
percent interest as of June 30, 2015.
Cash used in dividend payments increased $67 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six
months of 2015, primarily due to a $0.14 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset
by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our
dividend payments were $0.64 per common share in the first six months of 2016 compared to $0.50 per
common share in the first six months of 2015.

Excludes MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $1.99 billion available as of June 30,
2016.
Availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which
will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products. As of July 31, 2016, eligible trade
receivables supported borrowings of $735 million.

Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital
markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is
adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements,
including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments,
defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid
in connection with contingencies.
On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables securitization facility (“trade receivables facility”) to,
among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to
July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.
On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC
bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank
revolving credit facility maturing on July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank
revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements
remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.
On February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0
billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings
in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had no
commercial paper borrowings outstanding.

Table of Contents
The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX
credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX term loan facility
(“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and
events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant
included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of
the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the
Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total
Capitalization of 0.30 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the
MPC bank revolving credit facility.
The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of
Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not
greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated
EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during
the relevant period. As of June 30, 2016, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of
Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.6 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the
MPLX Credit Agreement.
Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of June 30, 2016, the credit ratings on our
senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.

MPLX Moody’s
 
 
The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit
profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any
given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their
respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.

Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade
receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest,
principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of
our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable
under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC bank revolving credit facility, our trade receivables securitization
facility and debt held by one of our ocean vessel joint ventures. In addition, a downgrade of our senior
unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the
amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility,
impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit
under existing transportation services agreements.

Our board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of $4.2 billion towards the end of 2015. In
light of current market conditions and revisions to expected completion dates for certain projects, we expect
2016 capital spending and investments to be approximately $3.0 billion, excluding capitalized interest. The
expected 2016 capital spending and investments also excludes our anticipated $500 million investment in the
Bakken Pipeline system. This reduced forecast for capital spending and investments includes spending on
refining, retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures and investments were $1.44 billion, excluding
capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2016 capital and investment budget since
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed. We continuously evaluate
our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.
During the second quarter of 2016, we paid BP $200 million for the third year’s contingent earnout. Including
this second quarter payment, we have paid BP approximately $569 million in total leaving $131 million
remaining under the total cap of $700 million. See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has
continued through the second quarter of 2016. At June 30, 2016, Centennial was not shipping product. As a
result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that
no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for
various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and
the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future
impairment of our Centennial interest. As of June 30, 2016, our equity investment in Centennial was $35
million and we had a $31 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See
Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we made no voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans.
We have no required funding for 2016, but plan to make a $175 million voluntary contribution in the third
quarter of 2016.
On July 27, 2016, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.36 per share on common stock. The
dividend is payable September 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 17,
2016.
During the first six months of 2016, we paid $126 million to acquire 4 million common shares through open
market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $40.52 per delivered share. Since January 1, 2012,
our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations. As of June 30, 2016,
we had $2.64 billion of remaining share repurchase authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated
financial statements.
We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market
purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for
shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share
repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such
repurchases may be discontinued at any time.

Table of Contents
The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our capital requirements, including
our capital spending and budget plan, the contingent earnout payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay
Refinery and Related Assets, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our
funded pension plans and share repurchases. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are
based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking
statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity, business conditions, a further
decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of
different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for
crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of
market and industry conditions, the effects of the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, completion of pipeline
capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest, our ability to successfully achieve the strategic and other expected
objectives relating to the MarkWest Merger, modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth
objectives, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor,
materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of
or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our
refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions,
acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic
considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth
in the forward-looking statements.
Contractual Cash Obligations
As of June 30, 2016, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease
obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first six months of 2016, our long-
term debt commitments decreased $1.21 billion due to repayment of borrowings under the MPLX bank
revolving credit facility. Also, during the first six months of 2016, our long-term transportation commitments,
beginning in 2018, decreased $432 million due to the suspension of a pipeline project for which the Company
had made a commitment under a Transportation Services Agreement.
As discussed in Note 23 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, on August 2, 2016 we announced
an anticipated investment of $500 million for an indirect ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system.
MPC also expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system. Subject to the closing of
this investment, Enbridge has agreed to cancel our commitment under a long-term transportation services
agreement related to the Sandpiper pipeline project and our commitment to fund a portion of the construction
of the pipeline.
There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of
business.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital
resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S.
GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described
below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them
to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably
likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital
resources.
We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from
Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are
described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the
financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available
information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely
affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various
factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets,
investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in
particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.
Transactions with Related Parties
We believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with
unrelated parties.

Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs
We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation
expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not
ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected.
We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and
regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors,
including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it
is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require,
among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in
calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur
standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We
anticipate that we will spend an estimated $600 million to $700 million between 2014 and 2021 for capital
expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of
approximately $200 million in 2017.
There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments
As of June 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as noted below.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below the carrying value of the net assets of
the reporting unit.
During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX, our consolidated subsidiary, determined that an interim impairment
analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on
consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near
term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted
capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released
or communicated by MPLX’s producer customers and iii) increases in the cost of capital. The combination of
these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first
step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the three reporting units to which goodwill
was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than their respective carrying value. In step
two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values
within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of
the reporting units. Accordingly, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the
first quarter of 2016.
The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on
applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company
method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or
knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop
the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates
of the expected future results and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. The fair
value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is
an income approach. Key assumptions include attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from 5.0 percent to 10.0
percent and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from 11.5 percent to 12.8 percent. Fair value
determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and
factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the
interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
MPLX did not record an impairment charge for one reporting unit assigned goodwill. As of March 31, 2016,
MPLX’s allocation of the purchase price was provisional. Based on MPLX’s assessment as of that date, this
reporting unit had $1.81 billion of goodwill assigned to it (which amount was not adjusted as of June 30, 2016
when MPLX finalized its purchase price allocation). Step one of the first quarter interim impairment analysis
resulted in the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value by 0.62%; therefore, MPLX
completed Step two of the goodwill impairment analysis. Step two of the goodwill impairment analysis requires
MPLX to determine the fair value of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any, of the reporting
unit, whether or not currently recognized. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual value of the
reporting unit's fair value, less the fair value of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any. The
results of MPLX’s
57
Table of Contents
Step two first quarter interim impairment analysis concluded that the fair value of the goodwill of this reporting
unit exceeded its carrying value of $1.81 billion by approximately $20 million, or 1.2%. An increase of 0.50% to
the discount rate used to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value as of MPLX’s first quarter interim impairment
analysis would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment charge of more than $400 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2016. The other significant assumption used to estimate this reporting unit's fair
value included estimates of future cash flows. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily
by commodity prices and producers' production plans, for this reporting unit were to decline, the overall
reporting unit's fair value would decrease, resulting in a potential goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, an
increase in the cost of capital would result in a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit, causing its value
to decline and goodwill to potentially be impaired.
During the second quarter of 2016, MPLX determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill
recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was not necessary. The stabilization and, in some cases,
improvement in the second quarter of the circumstances considered during its first quarter impairment
analysis, the date of its last full goodwill impairment analysis, lead to its conclusion that it is not more likely
than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their respective carrying values.
 
In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed its purchase price accounting for the MarkWest Merger. The
completion of this accounting resulted in additional goodwill attributed to certain reporting units for which an
impairment charge had been taken in the first quarter of 2016. MPLX therefore recorded an additional $1
million of impairment expense in the second quarter of 2016.
Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected
undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment
whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. In the first quarter of 2016, MPLX also
considered whether there was any indication of impairment of long-lived assets and equity method
investments recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and determined that there were none.
MPLX’s investments in Centrahoma, Jefferson Dry Gas, MarkWest Utica EMG, Ohio Condensate and
MarkWest Pioneer were recorded at fair value based on the MarkWest Merger on December 4, 2015. If
expected cash flows used to determine the fair value as of December 4, 2015 are not realized its equity
method investments may be subject to future impairment charges. Based on a review of cash flow forecasts as
of the second quarter of 2016, MPLX has concluded that no indicators of an other than temporary impairment
exist except for Ohio Condensate as discussed further below.
During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate, an equity method investment, were
reduced in line with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for
maintaining its financial records, MPLX completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in
accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed
asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate’s financial statements was $96 million. Based on
MPLX’s 60 percent ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately $58 million was recorded in the second
quarter of 2016 in Income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.
MPLX’s investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest
Merger, exceeded its share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC Topic 360
impairment analysis, MPLX completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC Topic
323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated
financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional impairment
charge of approximately $31 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in Income (loss) from equity
method investments within the accompanying consolidated statements of income, which eliminated the basis
differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger.
The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying assets was determined based upon applying the
discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which
is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable
information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the
estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the
expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of
11.9%. An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of $1
million on the consolidated statements of income. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment
and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio
Condensate equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a
result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim
impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.

We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however,
such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. Effects of these offsets
are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.
We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise
strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after
June 30, 2016 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.

At June 30, 2016, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate
borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate
debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and
corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and
cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value.
Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement
and the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Part II – Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment.
Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings
previously reported.
Litigation
We are a party to a number of lawsuits and proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter
with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which
we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant
in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in July 2015, a
purported class action lawsuit asserting claims challenging the MarkWest Merger was filed in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware by a purported unitholder of MarkWest. In August 2015, two similar putative
class action lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiffs who purport to
be unitholders of MarkWest. On September 9, 2015, these lawsuits were consolidated into one action pending
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, now captioned In re MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.
Unitholder Litigation. On October 1, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the individual
members of the board of directors of MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. (the “MarkWest GP Board”), MPLX, MPLX
GP, MPC and Sapphire Holdco LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX, asserting in connection with the
MarkWest Merger and related disclosures that, among other things, (i) the MarkWest GP Board breached its
duties in approving the MarkWest Merger with MPLX and (ii) MPC, MPLX, MPLX GP, and Sapphire Holdco
LLC aided and abetted such breaches. On February 4, 2016, the Court approved a stipulation and proposed
order to dismiss all claims with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs, but the Court retained jurisdiction to
adjudicate a fee application by the plaintiffs’ counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of
expenses. On March 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an application for reimbursement of approximately $2 million
of legal fees and expenses. On May 17, 2016, the plaintiffs withdrew the fee application and the case is now
dismissed.
Environmental Proceedings
On May 18, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX
(“MarkWest Liberty Midstream”), received a draft Consent Order (“Consent Order”) from the West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protection (“WVDEP”) alleging certain air permitting and emissions violations at
our Sherwood Facility, a gas processing facility located in West Virginia, including failure to comply with
monitoring, tagging, recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain equipment at the facility as
well as the failure to comply with certain permit application requirements. The Consent Order sets forth a
proposed civil penalty of $425,000. 
On July 6, 2016, the EPA presented a draft administrative enforcement order to Cincinnati Renewable Fuels
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC that operates a biofuels production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio (“CRF”).
The order alleges CRF and its predecessors failed to implement air regulations for a period beginning in May
2008 and prior to our acquisition of the facility. The EPA may seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in
connection with this matter.
The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (“IEPA”) initiated an enforcement action against Marathon Pipe
Line LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MPL”), in connection with an April 17, 2016 pipeline release
to the Wabash River near Crawleyville, Indiana. MPL also received a Clean Water Act request for information
from the EPA in furtherance of its investigation of possible violations arising from the April 17, 2016 pipeline
release. The IEPA and the EPA may each seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in connection with this matter.
As previously reported, in July 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of
Justice entered a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance
operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. MarkWest Liberty Midstream has
provided information in response to subpoenas presented by the government and similar requests for
information from the EPA, state and other agencies related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations
located in Pennsylvania. MarkWest is engaged in ongoing discussions with the EPA and the U.S. Attorney’s
office regarding alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its
launcher/receiver facilities in the region. MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s internal review has determined that its
operations have been conducted consistent with industry practices and in a manner protective of its
employees and the public. It is possible however, that in connection with any potential or asserted civil or
criminal enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material
assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify

operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be
subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential
assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be
incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at
this time.
We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While
the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these
environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks
and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

The amounts in this column include 105,201, 161 and 777 shares of our common stock delivered by
employees to MPC, upon vesting of restricted stock, to satisfy tax withholding requirements in April, May

Amounts in this column reflect the weighted average price paid for shares purchased under our share
repurchase authorizations and for shares tendered to us in satisfaction of employee tax withholding

repurchase authorization through July 31, 2017, resulting in $10.0 billion of total share repurchase
authorizations since January 1, 2012. This authorization is in addition to the previous authorization,
announced July 30, 2014, which had approximately $635 million remaining as of June 30, 2016.
