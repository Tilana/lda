FRONTIER OILFIELD SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Frontier
Oilfield Services, Inc. (“the Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. However, in the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments, unless
otherwise indicated) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of
operations for the periods presented have been made. The results for interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of trends or of results to be expected for the full year. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 (including the notes thereto) set forth in
Form 10-K.
2.BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. a Texas corporation (and collectively with its subsidiaries,
“we”, “our”, “Frontier”, “FOSI”, or the “Company”), was organized on March 24, 1995. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and Frontier Acquisition I, Inc., and its subsidiary Chico Coffman Tank Trucks, Inc. (CTT)
and its subsidiary Coffman Disposal, LLC, and Frontier Income and Growth, LLC (FIG) and
its subsidiaries Trinity Disposal & Trucking, LLC and Trinity Disposal Wells, LLC.
Frontier operates its business in the oilfield service industry and is primarily involved in
the disposal of saltwater and other oilfield fluids in Texas. The Company currently owns
and operates nine disposal wells in Texas, six within the Barnett Shale in North Texas and
three in east Texas near the Louisiana state line. The Company’s customers include
national, integrated, and independent oil and gas exploration companies.
3.GOING CONCERN
The Company’s financial statements are prepared using U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) applicable to a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As
of the date of the financial statements, the Company has generated losses from
operations, has an accumulated deficit and working capital deficiency. These factors raise
substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. As a
result, our auditors issued an audit opinion with respect to our 2015 and 2014 annual
financial statements which included a statement describing our going concern status.
In order to continue as a going concern and achieve a profitable level of operations, the
Company will need, among other things, to increase its business volume and grow
revenues, reduce its operating expenses, raise additional capital resources and develop
new and stable sources of revenue sufficient to meet its operating expenses.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon
management’s ability to successfully implement management’s plans to pursue additional
business volumes from new and existing customers, reduce indebtedness through sales
of non-performing assets and conversions of debt to equity, and rationalize the
Company’s cost structure to achieve profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continued existence will ultimately
be dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operations as
well as provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities on a timely basis. The
Company faces significant risk in implementing its business plan and there can be no
assurance that financing for its operations and business plan will be available or, if
available, such financing will be on satisfactory terms.

4.SUMMARY OF SELECTED ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In April 2015, FASB issued an accounting pronouncement ASU 2015-3 related to the
presentation of debt issuance costs (FASB ASC Subtopic 835-30). This standard will
require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. These
costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2015, and retrospective adoption is required. We have
adopted this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. We do not
expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, which provides guidance on a single comprehensive model for entities to use
in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The effective date for
this ASU, which was deferred by ASU 2015-14 issued in August 2015, is for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-08, an
amendment to the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which revises the structure of the indicators
to provide indicators of when the entity is the principal or agent in a revenue transaction,
and eliminated two of the indicators (“the entity’s consideration is in the form of a
commission” and “the entity is not exposed to credit risk”) in making that determination.
This amendment also clarifies that each indicator may be more or less relevant to the
assessment depending on the terms and conditions of the contract. In April 2016, the
FASB also issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance on
identifying promised goods or services and on determining whether an entity’s promise to
grant a license with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied
at a point in time) or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied
over time). The amendments, collectively, should be applied retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
Early adoption of the guidance is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 and the related updates to it on its financial position,
results of operations and disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides guidance for the recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The
guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that year. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts
of the adoption of this ASU.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will, among other impacts,
change the criteria under which leases are identified and accounted for as on- or off-
balance sheet. The guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December
15, 2018, including interim periods within that year. Once effective, the new guidance must
be applied for all periods presented. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impacts of the adoption of this ASU.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be effective for the fiscal year
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. The
Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this ASU.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In accordance with the reporting requirements of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments,
the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial
instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to
the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those
financial instruments. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value
adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at the balance sheet dates, nor
gains or losses reported in the statements of operations that are attributable to the change
in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, except as disclosed.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share (EPS)
Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income or loss by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share are calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of
all potentially dilutive stock options and warrants. The computation of diluted EPS does
not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of shares that would have an
anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share. Anti-dilution results from an increase in
earnings per share or reduction in loss per share from the inclusion of potentially dilutive
shares in EPS calculations. Currently there are no stock options in 2016, which have been
excluded from EPS that could potentially have a dilutive effect on EPS in the future. The
table below sets forth the reconciliation for net loss and weighted average shares used for
calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.

5.STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Board of Directors of the Company elected to suspend all stock based compensation
in 2015 as part of the Company’s cost cutting and restructuring measures.
In April 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of an
aggregate of 54,000 shares of common stock to the members of the Board of Directors.
The three members of the Board of Directors received 18,000 shares each.

The Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan (Senior Loan Facility) have a maturity date of
July 23, 2017 and a default interest rate which is the base rate plus the applicable margin plus
2% (6.75% and 7.75%, respectively as June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015). The term loan
portion of the Senior Loan Facility requires monthly payments of $100,000 plus interest. The
Senior Loan Facility also provides for the payment of an unused commitment fee of .375% per
annum. The loans are secured by all of the Company’s properties and assets except for its
disposal wells wherein the Senior Loan Facility has a subordinated secured position. On April
11, 2014 an accredited investor, who is also a significant stockholder in the Company,
purchased the Senior Loan Facility and related collateral from Capital One Bank N.A. and
assumed all the existing terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and Forbearance
Agreements. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with its debt covenants
under the Senior Loan Facility and the lender had not exercised its rights under the Senior
a.
Loan Facility. The outstanding balance of the Senior Loan Facility is included in current
liabilities at June 30, 2016 due to the fact that the Company was not in compliance with its debt
covenants, including the timely payment of interest and principal.
F-6
b.
The Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Term Loan, Guaranty and Security
Agreement on July 23, 2012 with ICON in the amount of $5 million (the “Loan Agreement”). On
December 27, 2014 an affiliate of an accredited investor who is also a stockholder purchased
the note payable under the Loan Agreement. The accredited investor assumed the terms and
conditions of the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement provides for an annual interest rate of
14% with monthly payments of interest and with repayment of the principal and all accrued but
unpaid interest due on February 1, 2018. The Loan Agreement provides the lender with a
senior secured position on the Company’s disposal wells and a subordinated position to the
Senior Loan Facility on all other Company properties and assets. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company was not in compliance with its debt covenants under the Loan Agreement and the
lender had not exercised its rights under the Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance of the
note pursuant to the Loan Agreement is included in current liabilities at June 30, 2016 due to
the fact that the Company was not in compliance with its debt covenants, including the timely
payment of interest.
c.
On May 27, 2014 an accredited investor, who is also a stockholder in the Company, entered
into a loan agreement with the Company for the amount of $2,783,484. As of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 the principal balance of the note was $2,786,536 and $2,786,536,
respectively. The note bears interest at 9% per annum. The terms of the note require the cash
payment of one half of the interest cost monthly (4.5% per annum), and the remaining half is
accrued as payment in kind interest. The note and all accrued interest were due and payable
in November 27, 2015. The principal and interest on the note payable is past due according to
its terms.
d.
On March 21, 2014 the CEO of the Company, who is also a stockholder in the Company
entered into a promissory note agreement whereby the CEO loaned the Company $87,000.
The promissory note has an interest rate of 7% per annum. The note was to have been repaid
in installments throughout the year ended December 31, 2014 with a portion of the repayment
conditioned upon the sale of certain of the Company’s disposal wells. The principal and
interest on the note payable to the CEO is past due according to its terms.
e.
The Company has an installment loan with an outstanding principal balance of approximately
$11,941 which was used to acquire property and equipment for use in the Company’s
operations. The collateral for the loan was no longer in use in the Company’s operations and
was returned to the lender May 2016. The reduction in principal from the surrender of the
collateral was less than the total balance owed. The remaining principal balance of the loan
has been classified as a short-term liability.
Unamortized debt issuance costs are amortized as interest expense over the terms of the
related notes payable using the effective interest method and are classified as a discount to
the related recorded debt balance. Total interest expense on debt discount for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $103,382 and $127,260, respectively.

7.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a.
The Company is obligated for approximately $1.3 million under long-term leases for the use of
land where seven of its disposal wells are located. Three of the leases are for extended
periods of time. The first lease expires on February 7, 2023 (with two options to renew for an
additional 10 years each).The second lease expires on December 1, 2034 with no option to
renew and the third lease expires on May 31, 2018 with one year renewal options. The
aggregate monthly lease payment for the disposal well leases is $10,985.
b.
The Company was a named defendant along with the previously named officers in certain
litigation in the 271st Judicial District Wise County, Texas wherein the Plaintiffs alleged they
had been damaged by the failure of the Company to complete a disposal well in a joint venture
between the parties. On April 23, 2016, the litigation was settled by mutual agreement of the
parties. Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs returned to the Company 53,000 shares
of restricted and unregistered stock of the Company issued to them in 2013. The Company
issued 317,000 shares of restricted and unregistered shares of stock in the Company to the
plaintiffs. The Company will have exclusive trading authority over the shares issued to the
plaintiffs and will have the right of first refusal to purchase the shares upon any planned sale
by the plaintiffs. The Company will also have a call option on the shares which will entitle the
Company to purchase the shares at $1.25 per share at any time. The settlement agreement
resulted in the termination of the litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a
liability of $206,000 associated with the settlement of this litigation.
c.
From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. The Company accrues costs and legal costs associated with these matters
when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s
management does not expect any liability from the disposition of such claims and litigation
individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 to the audited
consolidated financial statements included on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company
to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and
financial condition.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we reported a net loss of $1,011,667 as compared
to a net loss of $152,118 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The components of
these results are explained below.
3
Revenue- Total revenue decreased by $2.5 million, or 78% from $3.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to $700,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The
decrease was due to Management’s decision to no longer provide transportation services
as a part of the services offered by the Company and to focus on the disposal business.
Expenses- The components of our costs and expenses for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

%
Increase
(Decrease)
The decrease in the volumes of saltwater and other fluids transported and disposed of
necessitated a decrease in operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The decrease in direct costs is primarily attributable to Management’s decision to no
longer provide transportation services as a part of the services offered by the Company
and to focus on the disposal business. This resulted in the reduction of the number of
employees and the related salaries, wages and benefits as well as the elimination of costs
for fuel, repairs and maintenance for the truck fleet and the cost of the use of third party
disposal wells.
The decrease in indirect costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016, is the result of an
overall reduction of administrative salaries and benefits, insurance costs and utilities
resulting from management’s decision to no longer provide transportation services to
customers.
Other (Income) Expenses- Other (income)/expenses for the six months ended June 30,
2016 was approximately $570,000 of interest expense and $(45,000) of gain on the disposal
of assets; Other (income)/expenses of $(2.7) million for the six months ended June 30,
2015 included interest expense of $656,000; loss on disposal of property of $7,000 and a
gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 million.
Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect a net loss of $1,011,667.
We have not recorded any federal income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 because of our accumulated losses and our substantial net operating loss carry
forwards.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows and Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, we had total current assets of approximately $335,000. Our total
current liabilities as of June 30, 2016 were $12.7 million, including $8.3 million of debt
classified as current liabilities. We had a working capital deficit of $12.4 million as of June
30, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $12 million as of December 31, 2015.
Management is focused on working closely with our current lenders to fund operations
through current cash flows, and pay interest costs when excess cash becomes available.
Management plans to work with our current lenders and debt holders to lower our cost of
borrowing by renegotiating the terms of our existing debt and potentially offering debt
holders an opportunity to exchange their debt for equity in the Company. Management will
seek additional financing in those instances in which we believe such additional
financings will assist in accomplishing our goals. There can be no assurance that
management’s plan will succeed.
Our ability to obtain access to additional capital through third parties or other debt or
equity financing arrangements is strictly contingent upon our ability to locate adequate
financing or equity investments on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms.

The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended June
30, 2016 and 2015:
For the Six Months Ended
 June 30, 2016 June 30, 2015
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (234,668

)   (29,298
      
   $ 527,312
)
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $49,000 in cash, an increase of approximately
$26,000 from December 31, 2015 due to positive cash flow from investing and financing
activities.
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $235,000 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 due to operating loss. Net cash provided by operating activities was
approximately $555,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, due to improved
profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $294,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 due to repayment of an advance from an entity owned by one of the principal
shareholders of the Company as well as proceeds from the disposition of a certificate of
deposit. The cash advance is held in an investment account of the entity and is due on
demand to the Company at any time. Net cash provided by investing activities was $1,400
for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $32,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 which consisted of debt repayments. Net cash used in financing activities
was approximately $29,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, which also consisted
of debt repayments.
Capital Expenditures
The Company suspended capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30,
2016 due to the lower volumes disposed. The Company does not currently anticipate any
major capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016. The Company made the decision to
no longer provide transportation services to our customers which led to significant
disposal activities on our transportation equipment in 2015.
Indebtedness
On April 11, 2014 an accredited investor, who is also a stockholder in the Company
purchased the Capital One Note from Capital One and assumed all the existing terms and
conditions of the Senior Loan Facility including Capital One’s security interest in the
Company’s assets.
The Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Term Loan, Guaranty and Security
Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) on July 23, 2012 with ICON for the amount of $5
million. The Loan Agreement has a senior secured position in the Company’s disposal
wells and a subordinated position to the Senior Loan Facility on all other Company
properties and assets. The covenants in the Loan Agreement are, in all material respects,
the same as in the Senior Loan Facility. On December 27, 2014 an affiliate of an accredited
investor who is also a stockholder purchased the note payable associated with the Loan
Agreement. The accredited investor assumed the terms and conditions of the Loan
Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with its debt
covenants under the Loan Agreement and the lender had not exercised their rights under
the Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance of the Loan Agreement note is included in
current liabilities at June 30, 2016 due to the fact that the Company was not in compliance
with its debt covenants.
On February 12, 2015, the Company executed a settlement agreement in litigation which
had been asserted against certain officers of the Company and for which the Company
was obligated to indemnify such officers. The effect of the settlement agreement was the
cancellation of two subordinated promissory notes totaling $3,665,263. The settlement
resulted in the reduction of the Company’s indebtedness by $2,082,408. These promissory
notes were owed to the former owners of CTT and related to the acquisition of CTT. The
settlement resulted in a one-time gain on extinguishment of debt of $2,082,408 in the three
months ended March 31, 2015.

Outlook
Management may seek to acquire other profitable oilfield service companies to broaden
the Company’s customer base and capabilities. Management believes that certain
acquisitions could be potentially achieved through the issuance of the company’s equity
securities or through other financings. Management may need to incur additional
financing in those instances in which we believe such additional financings will assist in
accomplishing our goals. There can be no assurance that management’s plan will
succeed.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not required for smaller reporting companies.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
Chief Accounting Officer (CAO), the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the
quarter covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. In making this assessment, the
Company used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that
evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO, concluded that the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in that there was a
material weakness as of June 30, 2016.
A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis by the Company’s internal controls.
The Company’s management has identified a material weakness in the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting related to a shortage of resources in the
accounting department required to assure appropriate segregation of duties with
employees having appropriate accounting qualifications related to the Company’s unique
industry accounting and disclosure rules. Management has outsourced certain financial
functions to mitigate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. The
Company is reviewing its finance and accounting staffing requirements.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. As a result, no corrective actions were required or undertaken.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the CEO, does not expect that its disclosure controls or its
internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company was a named defendant along with the previously named officers in certain
litigation in the 271st Judicial District Wise County, Texas wherein the Plaintiffs alleged
they had been damaged by the failure of the Company to complete a disposal well in a
joint venture between the parties. On April 23, 2016, the litigation was settled by mutual
agreement of the parties. Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs returned to the
Company 53,000 shares of restricted and unregistered stock of the Company issued to
them in 2013. The Company issued 317,000 shares of restricted and unregistered shares
of stock in the Company to the plaintiffs. The Company will have exclusive trading
authority over the shares issued to the plaintiffs and will have the right of first refusal to
purchase the shares upon any planned sale by the plaintiffs. The Company will also have
a call option on the shares which will entitle the Company to purchase the shares at $1.25
per share at any time. The settlement agreement resulted in the termination of the
litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a liability of $206,000
associated with the settlement of this litigation.

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
The outstanding principal balance of the Senior Loan Facility, the Loan Agreement and
the two stockholder loans are included in current liabilities at June 30, 2016 due to the fact
that the Company was not in compliance with the debt covenants or payment terms on the
indebtedness, including the timely payment of interest and principal in accordance with all
of these loan agreements. To date, none of the holders of the Senior Loan Facility, the
Loan Agreement or the two stockholder loans have declared that the Company is in
default or have otherwise sought remedies under the respective terms of these loan
agreements.
Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION
The Board of Directors and management of the Company are currently evaluating
transactions that may provide the Company with an opportunity to improve its current
financial condition including; (i) refinancing of all or a portion of our existing debt, (ii) the
acquisition of profitable oilfield service companies that could increase the scale of our
operations and improve cash flows and (iii) raising additional equity to pay down debt.
There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in finding and closing any of
the above options.
