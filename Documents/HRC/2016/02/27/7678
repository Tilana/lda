<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/26, the Human Rights Council affirmed that Israeli settlements 
and activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, were illegal 
under international law and constituted very serious violations of international humanitarian 
law and of the human rights of the Palestinian people therein, and undermined international 
efforts aimed at invigorating the peace process and the realization of a two-State solution. 
Furthermore, the Council expressed grave concern at the continuing Israeli settlement and 
related activities, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, and the confiscation and destruction of property, which changed the 
physical character and demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East 
Jerusalem and the occupied Syrian Golan. The Council called upon Israel to take and 
implement serious measures, including confiscation of arms and enforcement of criminal 
sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and other measures 
to guarantee the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report addresses progress made in the implementation of Human Rights 
Council resolution 22/26 during the reporting period, from 22 March 2013 to 30 October 
</p><p>2013. Important information from November 2013 is included in instances where it is 
particularly relevant. The information contained in the report is based on monitoring and 
other information-gathering activities carried out by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and information provided by other United 
Nations entities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The report also contains information 
received from Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and media 
sources. It should be read in conjunction with previous reports of the Secretary-General on 
Israeli settlements.1 
</p>
<p>3. Previous reports outlined continuing Israeli settlement activities (A/HRC/20/13) and 
analysed various elements of the impact of Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and settler violence on the human rights of Palestinians. The most 
recent report to the General Assembly (A/68/513) focused on the leading role played by the 
Government of Israel in the creation and expansion of settlements and the impact of such 
actions and of related legislation and public policies, on Palestinians&#8217; human rights. The 
present report also addresses the expansion of settlements during the reporting period, as 
relevant to the Council&#8217;s call (see para. 1 above) in resolution 22/26, with particular 
attention to paragraphs 3 and 5. The report further complements the analysis in the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s report to the General Assembly on Israeli settlements (A/68/513) by 
focusing on Israeli planning policy in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the 
impact thereof on the human rights of Palestinians. Moreover, the report considers the 
impact of Israeli settlements and settler violence on the economic and social rights of 
Palestinians. Finally, in relation to paragraph 6 of resolution 22/26, the report provides an 
update on violent acts committed by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property, 
and stresses the lack of law enforcement and accountability in relation to such acts.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal background 
</b></p>
<p>4. Israel, as the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, is bound by 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including as contained 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A/HRC/20/13, A/68/513, A/67/375, A/66/364, A/65/365, A/64/516 and A/63/519. </p>


<p>in international customary law. In particular, Israel is bound by the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) 
and the Hague Regulations.2 Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention establishes that 
the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the 
territory it occupies. The Security Council,3 the General Assembly,4 the Human Rights 
Council5 and the International Court of Justice6 have all confirmed that the construction and 
expansion of Israeli settlements and other settlement-related activities in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory are illegal under international law. 
</p>
<p>5. In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Israel must comply 
with obligations contained in the international human rights treaties that it has ratified, 
including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Violence against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This 
has been confirmed by the International Court of Justice7 and human rights treaty bodies.8 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview 
</b>6. As stated in previous reports of the Secretary-General, Israeli settlements are an 
obstacle to the creation of a future Palestinian State.9 Despite the expressed commitment of 
Israel to freeze all settlement activity under the Quartet road map as well as multiple calls 
made by the international community for Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem, to be stopped, the Government of Israel has continued to play a leading role 
in their creation and expansion, in violation of international law. During the reporting 
period, Israeli settlements continued to expand and new settlements were approved. 
According to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, during the reporting period, plans for 8,943 new 
settlement units were promoted by the Government of Israel, including 6,521 in the West 
Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, and 2,422 in East Jerusalem.10 The NGO estimated that 
this would mean housing for more than 44,000 new Israeli settlers, assuming that the 
average size of a settler family is 5 persons.11 Further, it appears that new settlement 
construction increased by 70 per cent in the first half of 2013, with the construction of

 The Hague Regulations are annexed to the Hague Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of 
</p>
<p>War on Land of 18 October 1907 (Convention IV). The International Court of Justice has stated that 
even though Israel is not a party to this Convention, the Hague Regulations are applicable to Israel, as 
they have become part of customary law. See <i>Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice 
(ICJ) on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>

<p>1,708 units, 180 of them in outposts,12 as compared with 995 units built during the same 
period in 2012.13 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, in October 2013 the Government of Israel announced the construction of 
5,000 new units in Israeli settlements located in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.14 
According to the media, the aim of this measure was to neutralize negative reactions 
towards the release of Palestinian prisoners in the context of the peace talks.15 In November 
2013, the media reported that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, had 
ordered the Minister of Housing and Construction, Uri Ariel, to reconsider construction 
plans for more than 20,000 housing units in Israeli settlements,16 including in the E-1 
block,17 reportedly in order not to create an unnecessary confrontation with the international 
community.18 However, as of 20 November 2013, those plans had not been withdrawn.  
</p>
<p>8. The population in Israeli settlements continues to grow. According to the Israeli 
Central Bureau of Statistics, the growth rate of the settler population in 2012 was 5 
per cent, almost three times higher than the national growth rate, which was 1.9 per cent.19 
Estimations of the current settlement population in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem, range between 500,000 and 650,000.20  
</p>
<p>9. Israeli settlement activity, security measures adopted to protect settlers and their 
movement, and the violence committed by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their 
property are behind most of the human rights violations against Palestinians in the West 
Bank, including East Jerusalem.21 For example, settlements have given rise to multiple 
restrictions imposed by Israel on Palestinian construction, in particular in Area C,22 making 
it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits for homes and 
infrastructure.23 As noted below, these restrictions often leave Palestinians with no other 
option than to build without permits, risking eviction and the demolition of their structures 
and their subsequent displacement (see paras. 11-20 below). As previously reported, in 
many cases, the demolition of Palestinian homes lacking building permits is linked to 
settlement expansion.24 According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian

 Area of the West Bank within the municipal boundary of Ma&#8217;ale Adumim settlement, adjacent to East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem. Plans to construct settlements in E-1 would create an urban block between Ma&#8217;ale 
Adumim and Jerusalem, exacerbate the isolation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, 
and interrupt the territorial contiguity of the West Bank. See

<p>Affairs of the United Nations, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 392 Palestinian 
structures were demolished in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, during the 
reporting period, displacing 588 people, including 272 children.25 
</p>
<p>10. The situation in East Jerusalem remains an issue of concern. Between November 
2012 and October 2013, 99 Palestinian structures were demolished, displacing 320 people, 
including 161 children.26 In addition, new housing units in settlements situated in East 
Jerusalem were approved. For example, in August 2013, the Jerusalem Municipality Local 
Planning and Construction Committee approved the building of 58 housing units in the 
Pisgat Ze&#8217;ev settlement. The media reported that the Mayor of Jerusalem had voiced his 
support for a government plan to construct 793 new homes: including 400 in Gilo, 210 in 
Har Homa and 183 in Pisgat Ze&#8217;ev.27 In November 2013, demolition orders for 10 
apartment buildings in the Ras Khamis neighbourhood were issued. If implemented, they 
would result in the displacement of some 1,500 Palestinians.28 Residents of Silwan have 
affirmed that they also received several demolition orders around the end of October.29

<p><b> IV. Israeli planning policy in the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem, and its impact on the human rights 
of Palestinians 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Nature of planning policy, law</b>30<b> and practice  
</b></p>
<p>11. The establishment and expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem, is associated with a complex system of policies that negatively affect the 
human rights of Palestinians.31 The planning policy which regulates the construction of 
housing and structures in the West Bank,32 including East Jerusalem, is extremely 
problematic.33 The Secretary-General34 and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination35 have previously noted the discriminatory nature of Israeli planning policy. 
For instance, in East Jerusalem, Israeli authorities have planned and zoned only 13 per cent 
of the city, most of which is already built up, for Palestinian construction. In addition,

 The planning regime in the West Bank is governed by a system of laws which were in force before 
</p>
<p>1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank. This system comprises three layers: the Ottoman, the 
British Mandate and the Jordanian Law. Israel has amended the system mainly through military 
orders. See www.yesh-din.org/postview.asp?postid=254.

 Planning and development in East Jerusalem is governed by Israeli national planning institutions. See

 In 2012, the Committee expressed concern regarding the discriminatory planning policy of Israel and 
</p>
<p>urged it to reconsider it entirely in order to guarantee Palestinian and Bedouin rights to property, 
access to land, access to housing and access to natural resources (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 25). </p>


<p>Palestinians undergo a long and costly process before a building permit within this area 
may be granted. Even if requirements to obtain a building permit in West Jerusalem are 
similar, underinvestment by the Municipality in public infrastructure and the inequitable 
allocation of budgetary resources in East Jerusalem make it very difficult for Palestinians to 
fulfil all requirements to obtain a permit.36 As a result, at least 33 per cent of Palestinian 
homes in East Jerusalem lack Israeli-issued building permits, placing at least 93,100 
residents at risk of eviction, demolition of their homes and displacement.37 
</p>
<p>12. In Area C of the West Bank, Palestinians are not allowed to build on approximately 
70 per cent of the land mass and are subject to severe restrictions regarding construction in 
the remaining 30 per cent.38 Less than 1 per cent of Area C has been planned for Palestinian 
urban development.39 Palestinians are not represented in the planning process, unlike Israeli 
settlers.40 The combination of these factors makes it virtually impossible for Palestinians to 
obtain a permit to construct homes or infrastructure in Area C. Many Palestinians therefore 
build without building permits, putting them at risk of eviction, demolition of their homes 
and displacement.41 According to the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA), between 2009 and 
2012, only 2.3 per cent of the permit applications by Palestinians in Area C were 
approved.42 Between 30 November 2012 and 30 October 2013, 477 Palestinian structures 
were demolished in Area C, which caused the eviction and displacement of 644 people, half 
of them children.43 
</p>
<p>13. In contrast, Israeli authorities have provided settlements with detailed planning and 
established preferential policies, including granting incentives and benefits to settlers, 
allocating settlements land for expansion and connecting them to public services and 
infrastructure.44 In addition, the strict application of planning laws to Palestinian 
communities, which causes a large number of evictions and demolitions of Palestinian 
structures, contrasts with the flexibility shown by the planning authorities towards Israeli 
settlements.45 The widespread lack of enforcement of laws granting the power to evict and 
demolish structures when they are violated by Israeli settlers further highlights the 
differentiated application of planning policy.46 For instance, in Area C, in the period 2010&#8211;
2012, 2,418 demolition orders were issued for Palestinian buildings, while only 1,143 
demolition orders were issued for Israeli settlement buildings.47  
</p>
<p>14. Israeli planning policy is thus discriminatory against Palestinians as compared with 
Israeli settlers. As illustrated above, even if the planning laws in principle do not establish 
different requirements for Palestinians and Israeli settlers, they impose unachievable 
conditions for Palestinian construction. In contrast, Israeli settlers do not face such 
difficulties, for instance regarding the allocation of building permits and participation in the

<p>planning process.48 This is in clear contravention of the international human rights 
obligations of Israel, in particular the principle of non-discrimination in relation to the right 
to adequate housing contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights,49 which has been ratified by Israel. By not upholding that principle, Israel 
is violating an international obligation of immediate effect.50 Furthermore, it is violating the 
rule of law by virtue of a discriminatory application of the law against Palestinians, in this 
case the planning regime. In this respect, Israel is violating articles 2 (non-discrimination 
and equality before the law) and 26 (equal protection of the law) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it is also a party.51 
</p>
<p><b>  Impact of planning policy, law and practice on the human rights 
of Palestinians 
</b></p>
<p>15. The planning policy undermines one of the most important components of the right 
to adequate housing, namely security of tenure. The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has established that everyone should possess a degree of security of tenure 
which guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats.52 
The Committee has also affirmed that States must take immediate measures aimed at 
conferring legal security of tenure upon those persons and households lacking such 
protection, in genuine consultation with affected persons and groups.53 Israel is not 
complying with this obligation, since it is not taking any steps to protect the security of 
tenure of Palestinians. On the contrary, its planning policy, law and practice expose them to 
constant risks of forced eviction, demolition and displacement, which interferes directly 
with their enjoyment of the right to adequate housing. In addition, as previously reported, 
Palestinians cannot participate in the planning process,54 in violation of the right to 
participate in public decision-making.55 
</p>
<p>16. Land ownership and possession is another element of the right of Palestinians to 
adequate housing which is affected by Israeli planning policy and, more broadly, by Israeli 
settlement-related activities.56 As stated by the former Special Rapporteur on the right to

 According to B&#8217;tselem, despite the fact that the same legal and institutional system is responsible for 
</p>
<p>planning in Palestinian areas and in the settlements, the criteria applied are diametrically opposed. See

 While land-related rights are a fundamental element of the right to adequate housing, there is no 
</p>
<p>recognition of a human right to land. See UN Habitat, &#8220;The Right to Adequate Housing&#8221;, Fact Sheet 
 </p>


<p>adequate housing, this element is often essential to understanding the seriousness of the 
violations of the right to adequate housing.57 Israel has been using different methods to 
seize land for settlements amounting to almost half of the West Bank.58 
</p>
<p>17. Israeli control of land, and the takeover of land by Israeli settlers, often have as a 
consequence that Palestinians are dispossessed of their land. The case of the Israeli 
settlement outpost of Adei Ad illustrates the infringement of the right to adequate housing 
of Palestinians as a result of the takeover of land by settlers and the failure to enforce 
planning laws. Adei Ad was founded in 1998 by Israeli settlers who invaded a hilltop next 
to the villages of Turmusaya, Al-Mughayyr, Jalud and Qaryut in the West Bank. The 
outpost was established in contravention of Israeli planning law. It was built without a 
government decision to establish it, without its jurisdiction being delineated by an order of 
the Commanding Officer of the Central Command, without a detailed plan by virtue of 
which building permits can be issued and, consequently, without a building permit.59 In 
spite of the illegality deriving from the violation of these laws, the outpost was and 
continues to be supported by government bodies, including the Settlement Division of the 
World Zionist Organization,60 through funding and allocation of land, as well as by the 
Israel Electric Corporation and Mekorot (Israel National Water Company) through the 
provision of services.61 Although it is reported that the Israeli Civil Administration issued 
81 demolition orders against structures in Adei Ad, only very few have been enforced.62 
</p>
<p>18. It appears that various criminal and administrative offences have been committed by 
settlers against Palestinians in the area surrounding the outpost of Adei Ad, including 
fencing and cultivating land, trespassing, vandalism of Palestinian property and evicting 
Palestinians or preventing them from accessing their plots, sometimes through harassment 
and violence. In addition, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) defined extensive non-entry 
zones for Palestinians, who, in many cases, are required to coordinate with IDF to gain 
access to agricultural areas.63 As a result, Palestinians often have no access to agricultural 
lands they cultivated before the establishment of the outpost.64 This has had an impact on 
their right to work, as their economies and way of life were based on agriculture.65 
Moreover, this situation has hindered their access to basic means of livelihood and services, 
which are essential elements of the right to housing and are linked to the fulfilment of the

 According to the Palestinian Institute for the Study of Economic Policy (MAS), 34 per cent of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian agricultural land in the West Bank is not accessible to its owners. The study indicates four 
main causes: settlements, the Wall, closed military zones and methods of enclosure. See MAS, <i>Food 
Security Bulletin</i>, Issue 7 (2012), cited in &#8220;Israeli settlers&#8217; agriculture as a means of land takeover in

<p>rights to food, water, health and education and, generally, to an adequate standard of living 
(see paras. 21-29 and 34-36 above).66  
</p><p>19. The case of Adei Ad illustrates the impact of Israeli planning policies on the 
enjoyment of economic, social, civil and political rights by Palestinians.67 The obligations 
of Israel under international law include the duty to respect human rights by refraining from 
interfering with enjoyment of these rights, for instance, by refraining from denying 
Palestinians security of tenure and from implementing eviction and demolition orders based 
on discriminatory planning policies, laws and practices. In addition, protecting human 
rights entails ensuring law enforcement and accountability for settler violence to prevent 
third parties from interfering with Palestinians&#8217; enjoyment of their rights (see paras. 42-47 
below). Finally, the fulfilment of Palestinians&#8217; rights requires, for example, amendment of 
the planning regime in order to eliminate discriminatory practices, while guaranteeing 
Palestinians full participation in the definition and implementation of planning policies.  
</p>
<p>20. Similarly, Israeli planning policies do not comply with the country&#8217;s obligations 
under international humanitarian law. Israel amended the Jordanian planning law in force at 
the beginning of the occupation to such an extent that it exceeded the competence afforded 
to it, as occupying Power, to legislate.68 The amendment eliminated Palestinian 
participation in the planning process while creating special planning bodies exclusively for 
Israeli settlements (Local Planning Councils). Moreover, Israeli planning policies have 
important long-term implications for the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Palestinian 
population therein, which are not reconcilable with the temporary nature of occupation.69 In 
addition, the occupying Power should look after the welfare of the population in the 
occupied territory.70 The large number of evictions and demolitions suffered by the 
Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as 
well as the negative human rights impact thereof, indicate that such measures have not been 
aimed at ensuring the welfare of the Palestinian population.71

 In its general comment No. 4, paragraph 9, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</p>
<p>highlighted the relationship between the right to adequate housing and civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights: &#8220;the full enjoyment of other rights &#8211; such as the right to freedom of 
expression, the right to freedom of association (such as for tenants and other community-based 
groups), the right to freedom of residence and the right to participate in public decision-making &#8211; is 
indispensable if the right to adequate housing is to be realized and maintained by all groups in society. 
Similarly, the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with one&#8217;s privacy, 
family, home or correspondence constitutes a very important dimension in defining the right to 
adequate housing&#8221;.

<p><b> V. Impact of Israeli settlements and settler violence  
on the economic and social rights of Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Access to land and water  
</b></p>
<p>21. Settlements occupy a sizeable part of Palestinian land, making it impossible for 
Palestinians to develop or maintain their natural resources in any meaningful or sustainable 
manner. Of the land in the West Bank, 43 per cent has been allocated to settlements.72 This 
situation, coupled with the fact that Israel has responsibility for planning and zoning 
throughout Area C, greatly hampers the exercise by Palestinians of a wide range of 
economic and social rights (see paras. 15-20 above).  
</p><p>22. Israel controls all sources of water in the West Bank and effectively prevents 
Palestinians from adequately maintaining or developing water resources. Israel obtains 
approximately a third of the water it uses from the Jordan River,73 while Palestinians are 
denied access to the riverbanks. Israel also extracts a significant portion of its water from 
the Mountain Aquifer, the largest water resource in the region.74  
</p>
<p>23. The Israel national water company, Mekorot, owns all water supply systems in the 
West Bank and supplies approximately 50 per cent of the water available to Palestinian 
communities. Mekorot reportedly significantly reduces the Palestinian water supply during 
the summer months, in order to meet consumption needs in Israel and in the settlements.75 
One emblematic example is that of the village of Kufr al-Deek, near Ariel, one of the 
largest Israeli settlements in the West Bank. When supplies of water are low in the summer 
months, Mekorot closes the valves that supply Kufr al-Deek so as not to affect Ariel&#8217;s 
water supply. Ariel also discharges wastewater inappropriately, resulting in contamination 
of the spring wells on which residents of Kufr al-Deek rely both for drinking water and for 
agriculture.76  
</p>
<p>24.  Because of these severe water cuts and the limited coverage of the water network in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, many Palestinian communities are forced to purchase 
water delivered by water tankers at a cost which is reportedly eight times or more what 
settlers are paying. This is the case even though much of the water may have originally 
been extracted from Palestinian sources.77 Israeli settlers consume a daily average of 369 
litres of water for domestic use, while Palestinians have access to only 70 litres per person 
per day.78 According to the World Health Organization, 100 litres or more per person per 
day provides optimal access, whereas between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day 
are needed to ensure that most basic needs are met and few health concerns arise.79

<p>25. In addition, many cases have been documented of settlers forcibly taking over 
Palestinian water resources, through violence, threats and intimidation. Settlers also erect 
physical obstacles, such as fences, preventing Palestinians from accessing wells.80 In the 
case of 40 out of 56 water springs surveyed by the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs in the course of 2011, Israeli settlers had even begun to develop the 
surrounding areas as a &#8220;tourist attraction&#8221;, installing signs, picnic tables and other 
recreational infrastructure. Many of those initiatives are promoted and funded by Israeli 
governmental or semi-governmental institutions.81  
</p>
<p><b>  Right to an adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>26. Besides being a vital element of Palestinian culture, olive farming is a mainstay of 
the Palestinian economy. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations, olive production accounts for as much as 25 per cent of the total value of 
agricultural income in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with approximately 100,000 
families dependent to some extent on olive farming for their livelihoods.82 The majority of 
olive trees in the West Bank are rain-fed, making olive farmers vulnerable to drought. 
Irrigation techniques could improve the situation significantly; however, as described 
above, Palestinians lack meaningful access to most water resources and must purchase 
water from the drinking water supply for irrigation purposes. Only 6.8 per cent of the 
cultivated land in the West Bank is irrigated.83  
</p>
<p>27. Israeli settlements, on the other hand, are supplied with ample water and many 
engage in cultivation of crops that require large amounts of water, such as bananas. 
Palestinian producers are unable to compete in these conditions, which results in settlement 
products dominating Palestinian markets.84 
</p>
<p>28. Settlers often attack Palestinian agricultural lands and destroy olive trees. During the 
reporting period, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded 270 
incidents in the context of settler-related violence leading to the injury of 103 Palestinians 
and damage to around 6,660 trees owned by Palestinians. During the same period in 2012, 
249 incidents affecting Palestinians were documented, resulting in injury to 97 Palestinians 
and damage to 6,150 trees.85 A damaged 50-year-old olive tree requires five years to bear 
fruit again, and 20 years to reach a significant level of production. For each damaged 50-
year-old tree, there are associated average costs of US$ 750.86 Settler violence is also often 
directed at the herds of herding communities (see para. 42 below).   
</p><p>29. The situations described above affect the right to work of those Palestinians whose 
way of life is based on agriculture. In addition they hinder their access to means of 
livelihood, affecting several of their human rights (see paras. 15-20 above).

<p><b>  Environmental pollution caused by settlements 
</b></p>
<p>30. Israeli settlements in the West Bank have exacerbated existing environmental 
concerns. In a joint study,87 official Israeli sources found that 81 out of 121 Israeli 
settlements are connected to waste treatment facilities. Nonetheless, 5.5 million cubic 
meters of raw wastewater continues to flow from settlements into the West Bank.88 
Furthermore, 80 per cent of solid waste generated by settlers is dumped at dumping sites 
not designed as sanitary landfills, located in the West Bank.89  
</p>
<p>31. Israel transfers electronic waste (e-waste)90 from Israel and Israeli settlements to 
areas near Palestinian communities in the West Bank.91 For instance, many irregular 
e-waste workshops in Idhna, Hebron, operated by backyard recyclers, are located near 
water wells, resulting in toxic chemicals and toxins such as mercury leaking into the ground 
and contaminating the water supply. Many workshops are located in the vicinity of 
agricultural lands, posing a threat to the agro-biodiversity and to the quality of agricultural 
products. According to local physicians, there appears to be a link between e-waste and the 
rise in various forms of cancer affecting Palestinians.92  
</p>
<p>32. Human rights organizations have reported and warned of the impact of dumping 
industrial and chemical waste from industrial Israeli settlements, such as the Barqan 
Industrial Park and chemical factories93 in the West Bank. For example, the settlement of 
Ariel dumps liquid waste sewage and industrial waste into a stream and on agricultural 
land, rendering it contaminated and unworkable.94 Ariel&#8217;s treatment plant ceased 
functioning in 2008 and the settlement&#8217;s wastewater has been flowing into the Al Matwi 
stream and Salfit95 and then west, through agricultural land to the villages of Bruqin and 
Kufr al-Deek,96 passing near a domestic artesian well.97

<p>33. As noted above (see sect. IV), Israel applies restrictive policies, laws and practices 
to Palestinian structures in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This also applies to

<p>waste management infrastructure projects, which has resulted in the curbing of Palestinian 
projects, especially in Area C.98 As Areas A and B are already mostly built up, the suitable 
locations for waste treatment sites are in Area C. The situation appears to be aggravated by 
delays in the Israeli approval and licensing process, which can last for over a decade.99 In 
addition, Israel has also made the development of projects on serving settlements,100 which 
worsens the situation, as the Palestinian Authority systematically refuses to engage with 
settlements, to avoid giving legal recognition to them. For instance, Israel refused a 
construction licence to a German-funded project in 2009 for the construction of a water 
treatment plant for Salfit in Area C. The rejection was premised on the interest of Israel in a 
joint project which would include treatment of Ariel&#8217;s wastewater. The proposal entailed 
the untreated wastewater travelling 12 kilometres through the villages of Bruqin and Kufr 
al-Deek towards the Green Line, where the proposed plant would be erected.101  
</p>
<p><b>  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>34. Cases have been documented of groups of settlers attacking schools in Palestinian 
villages. For example, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) documented five 
incidents of attacks on schools in the village of Urif, south of Nablus, and close to the 
settlement of Yitzhar, from January to June 2013.102 These attacks usually led to clashes 
between the settlers and the residents, followed by interventions by the Israeli Security 
Forces (ISF) using tear gas, rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse 
Palestinians.  
</p>
<p>35. In a case documented by OHCHR, on 24 October 2013 a group of approximately 30 
settlers, most of them masked, attacked the school in Jalud village. Some threw stones at 
the school, while others attempted to enter the schoolyard from the main gate and through 
the fence. The teachers locked the door from the inside, in order to protect the children. The 
settlers proceeded to destroy the cars parked in and around the school, and subsequently set 
fire to olive groves nearby. As a result of the attack, five cars were destroyed and more than 
350 olive trees burned. Jalud is surrounded by six Israeli settlements, in addition to an IDF 
camp, and is the target of frequent settler violence, especially during the olive harvest. 
According to the information available to OHCHR, the Israeli police subsequently arrested 
four suspects for this attack. 
</p>
<p>36. Besides attacking schools, settlers also often engage in violent attacks on children on 
their way to or from school, including throwing stones at school buses. In some locations 
on the West Bank, ISF provide escorts for children to ensure their safety; however, these 
escorts are often unreliable and frequently fail to show up.103

<p><b> VI. Failure to maintain public order, settler violence  
and lack of accountability  
</b></p>
<p>37. Israeli settlers continued to attack Palestinians and their property in the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem, during the reporting period. The lack of effective accountability 
and protection from such incidents by the Israeli authorities continues to be of serious 
concern.104 The enduring failure of Israel to comply with its legal obligations in this regard 
is part of wider systemic failures to guarantee Palestinians&#8217; human rights.105 This has 
allowed settler violence to continue unabated and even, at times, to flourish (see para. 39 
below).  
</p><p>38. Israel is obliged under international law to protect Palestinians and their property 
from acts of violence by settlers, to ensure accountability for crimes committed, and to 
provide a remedy for any violations suffered. This derives from the obligations of Israel as 
an occupying Power, including its obligations to protect Palestinians in the occupied 
territory and guarantee their rights,106 which entails taking action to prevent individuals or 
groups, including settlers, from interfering with the enjoyment of rights by Palestinians. 
</p>
<p><b>  Settler violence: figures and trends  
</b></p>
<p>39. Incidents of settler-related violence continue to be recorded at an alarming rate. 
During the reporting period, OCHA recorded 270 such incidents, leading to the injury of 
103 Palestinians, an increase in comparison with the same period in 2012, when 249 
incidents were registered, resulting in injury to 97 Palestinians. During the reporting period, 
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also recorded 30 incidents of 
violence perpetrated by Palestinians against settlers, in which two settlers were killed and 
41 others injured, which also indicates an increase in violence against Israeli settlers, 
compared with the same period in 2012, when 27 incidents, leading to the injury of 38 
settlers, were recorded.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2013, there has also been an increase in settler or Israeli violence against 
Palestinians and their property in East Jerusalem. The Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs recorded 58 such incidents during the reporting period in 2013, 
compared with 41 in the same period in 2012. On 14 August 2013, OHCHR documented a 
case in which Israeli religious students from a Talmudic school in East Jerusalem attacked a 
Palestinian family. According to the family, more than 40 students were hiding behind a 
building near to the family house, and attacked them with wooden sticks, metal bars and 
chains. The mother and two of her sons were hospitalized as a result of their injuries.  
</p><p>41. On 18 August 2013, in a case monitored by OHCHR, a 47-year-old Palestinian 
shepherd from the village of Mikhmas, near Ramallah, was taking his sheep through a 
water drainage tunnel under Road 60 to graze on privately-owned Palestinian land near the 
partially evacuated settler outpost of Migron, built on privately-owned Palestinian land.

<p>Residents of Mikhmas, who have experienced repeated violence by settlers from 
surrounding outposts and settlements, had only recently begun using the tunnel again, after 
hearing that the settlers had been made to leave Migron by the Israeli authorities &#8211; although 
the outpost had only been partially evacuated. As the shepherd passed through the tunnel, 
he encountered six male settlers, who beat him with metal pipes. The settlers also attacked 
his herd of sheep, killing two of them and causing five pregnant sheep to lose their lambs. 
The shepherd was eventually found unconscious next to the tunnel and taken to Ramallah 
Medical Complex, where he remained for four days, receiving 70 stitches in his head. 
Similar incidents of physical assault by settlers have been documented by OHCHR and 
other organizations.107  
</p>
<p><b>  Law enforcement and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>42. Attacks by settlers have occurred repeatedly in the same areas and often at the same 
times of year, raising concerns about the effectiveness of action by the Israeli authorities to 
prevent such violence.108 For example, Palestinian residents of Burin and neighbouring 
villages in the Nablus governorate have repeatedly faced attacks on their person and 
property by settlers from the nearby Yitzhar and Bracha settlements.109  
</p>
<p>43. These trends have been thoroughly documented by the United Nations and other 
organizations. However the Israeli authorities still fail to protect Palestinian communities 
from such incidents.110 The large and increasing number of injuries to Palestinians caused 
by ISF in settler-related incidents indicates that, in the context of settler violence, security 
forces commonly intervene to disperse Palestinians, rather than to protect them from 
attacks.111 These continuing failures heighten concerns previously expressed by the 
Secretary-General about the willingness of Israeli security forces to undertake law 
enforcement in a non-discriminatory manner.112  
</p>
<p>44. This situation is compounded by the persistent absence of effective accountability 
for attacks by settlers.113 In practice, not much has changed since the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/20/13), with the Israeli authorities 
continuing to fail to investigate cases effectively as required by international law. In figures 
recently released by the NGO Yesh Din, a staggering 97.9 per cent of cases of damage to 
Palestinian trees and agricultural crops between 2005 and 2013 were closed without

<p>indictment; in two cases the files were lost and in four cases an indictment was filed, out of 
an overall total of 197 cases.114  
</p>
<p>45. Victims interviewed by OHCHR have reported that the police have not kept them 
informed of any progress in investigations. For example, in a case documented by OHCHR, 
a man beaten unconscious by settlers and whose skull was fractured with metal piping and 
stones, near Silwad, Ramallah governorate, on 11 April 2013, filed a complaint on 21 April 
at the police station in Binyamin settlement. At the time of preparation of the present report, 
the police had reportedly failed to provide him with any information pertaining to his case.  
</p>
<p>46. This lack of action is in stark contrast with investigations conducted into violence 
against Israeli citizens in the West Bank. For example, the response to the injury of an 
Israeli girl in Psagot settlement on 5 October 2013 saw IDF conduct thorough search 
operations in the neighbouring Palestinian town of Al-Bireh, resulting in the arrest of two 
men on 8 October 2013.115 
</p>
<p>47. The Israeli authorities have announced some positive initiatives, including the 
formation of a special police unit to combat nationalistic hate crimes and &#8220;price tag&#8221;116 
attacks. Unfortunately, this has not been accompanied by any reduction in the number of 
settler-related incidents and, in fact, this type of crime is on the rise.117 There is also a 
mechanism for seeking compensation for such crimes through the Ministry of Defense. 
However, the necessity for effective criminal accountability mechanisms remains evident. 
Without fundamental changes in the approach of the Israeli authorities to these types of 
incident, Palestinians will continue to be vulnerable to settler attacks.

<p><b> VII. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan  
</b>48. Israel continues to occupy the Syrian Golan despite numerous resolutions of the 
Human Rights Council, for example,  resolution 22/26, and of the Security Council calling 
for an end to the occupation, including resolution 497 (1981), in which the Security Council 
decided that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the 
occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international legal effect and 
demanded that Israel, the occupying power, rescind forthwith its decision. In resolution 497 
(1981), the Security Council also called upon Israel to desist from changing the physical 
character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 
Syrian Golan and in particular to desist from the establishment of settlements. In this 
regard, the Secretary-General has, in previous reports, expressed concern regarding the 
approximately 20,000 Israeli settlers who live in 33 settlements in the occupied Syrian 
Golan, and about the ongoing exploitation by Israel of natural resources in the occupied 
Syrian Golan, including gas, oil, wind and water (see A/68/513). It is noted that, during the 
universal periodic review of Israel on 29 October 2013, a number of stakeholders reiterated 
calls for an end to the construction of all Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories, 
including the occupied Syrian Golan.

<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>49. <b>Israeli settlement-related activities and settler violence are at the core of most 
of the violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem. By virtue of the interdependence of human rights, Israeli settlements and 
settler violence violate Palestinians&#8217; economic, social, civil and political rights.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Israel, as the occupying Power, must abide by its international treaty and 
customary obligations by ensuring that the Palestinian population of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory is afforded the protection provided for under international 
humanitarian law, and by respecting, protecting and fulfilling Palestinians&#8217; rights so 
as to enable them to fully enjoy their rights under international human rights law. 
</b>51. <b>Israel is obligated to comply with its commitments as set out in the Quartet 
road map, including by immediately ceasing the transfer of its population to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and by ending and reversing all settlement activity. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Israel should cease all settlement activity and exploitation of natural resources 
in the occupied Syrian Golan, implement relevant United Nations resolutions, 
including Security Council resolution 497 (1981), and withdraw from territories 
occupied in 1967.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>It is incumbent on Israel to cease the violations of Palestinians&#8217; human rights 
resulting from discriminatory and unlawful planning policies, laws and practices. 
Israel has to, in compliance with international law, amend the planning legislation and 
processes in order, in particular, to ensure the security of tenure and the full 
participation of Palestinians. Israel must also refrain from implementing evictions and 
demolition orders based on discriminatory and illegal planning policies, laws and 
practices. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Israel must, as a matter of urgency, enhance its efforts to combat settler 
violence in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. It must take all necessary 
measures, including preventive measures, to protect Palestinians and their property, 
and to ensure that Palestinians have regular and unhindered access to their land, 
particularly, but not exclusively, in areas where the patterns of reported incidents 
show that Palestinians are especially vulnerable. Any law enforcement or protection 
measures must be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Israel is obligated to ensure that all acts of violence committed by Israeli 
settlers against Palestinians and their property are investigated promptly, thoroughly, 
effectively, independently, impartially and in a non-discriminatory manner. 
Investigations should be subject to public scrutiny and allow for victims&#8217; 
participation. Victims should be kept regularly and promptly informed of the 
progress and developments in investigations. Individuals who are responsible for 
violations should be prosecuted and victims should be provided with an effective 
remedy.
