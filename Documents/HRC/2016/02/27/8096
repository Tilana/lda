<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This <b>Addendum</b> represents the official response of the South African government to 
</p>
<p>the 152 recommendations generated by the UN member States on the 2
nd
</p>
<p> South African 
</p>
<p>UPR Report during its examination on 31 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>2. In terms of the procedural requirements of the UPR process, the South African 
</p>
<p>government is expected to submit an official document clearly outlining; the 
</p>
<p>recommendations which are acceptable for implementation, recommendations which are 
</p>
<p>not acceptable and the accompanying rationale and the recommendations which South 
</p>
<p>Africa totally rejects. 
</p>
<p>3. In heeding this procedural requirement, this Addendum cleared at the highest level 
</p>
<p>of government is herewith submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council and 
</p>
<p>should be placed on the website of the United Nations as the official government document 
</p>
<p>presented pursuant to the Report of the Working Group on Universal Periodic Review 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/21/16). 
</p>
<p>4. The methodology and format followed in this Addendum follows a thematic 
</p>
<p>clustering of the recommendations based on the intersectionality of the thematic issues as 
</p>
<p>well as the established domestic implementation mechanisms. To this end, it is important to 
</p>
<p>note that the South African government will, in future, be issuing periodic reports on the 
</p>
<p>status of implementation as required.  
</p>
<p>5. In this regard the following broad thematic categories have been decided upon: 
</p>
<p>(a) Promotion, protection and fulfillment of Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights and the attainment of the MDGs; 
</p>
<p>(b) Attainment of Social Cohesion and Social Transformation; 
</p>
<p>(c) Empowerment and Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Marginalization, social 
</p>
<p>exclusion and economic disparities; 
</p>
<p>(d) Elimination of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
</p>
<p>Intolerance; 
</p>
<p>(e) Combating incitement to hatred and punishing hate crimes; 
</p>
<p>(f) Violence against women and children, manifestations of domestic and social 
</p>
<p>violence and human trafficking; 
</p>
<p>(g) Criminalization of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>and Punishment (CID); 
</p>
<p>(h) Ratification of outstanding IHL and IHRL instruments; 
</p>
<p>(i) Compliance with International Treaty Law and Obligations; 
</p>
<p>(j) Freedom of Opinion and Expression including Global Internet Governance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Government response to UPR recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>6. Pursuant to the foregoing framework, the Government of the Republic of South 
</p>
<p>Africa has decided on three categories of annexes to this Addendum covering 
</p>
<p>recommendations according to their acceptance, non-acceptance and rejection. Kindly refer 
</p>
<p>in this regard to the Annexes to the present Addendum. It should also be borne in mind that 
</p>
<p>the economic, social and cultural rights are being implemented progressively to the best 
</p>
<p>availability of resources and in accordance with Constitutional imperatives. All the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/16/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>Annexes to the present Addendum are arranged according to paragraph 124 in document 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/21/16 and also follow the thematic clustering outlined in paragraph 5 above.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Government of the Republic of South Africa wishes to acknowledge and report 
</p>
<p>its appreciation for the excellent interaction with the UN Human Rights UPR process and 
</p>
<p>the majority of the recommendations which are deemed as constructive and helpful to the 
</p>
<p>countries future efforts towards the achievement of its ideal, namely, social cohesion 
</p>
<p>predicated on respect for human dignity and fundamental human rights and freedoms. The 
</p>
<p>Government is resolute on its National Agenda to ensure, respect for, promotion, protection 
</p>
<p>and fulfillment of all human rights and freedoms on a non-discriminatory basis. Most of the 
</p>
<p>rights to be attained are in the rubric of economic, cultural and social rights and thereby 
</p>
<p>requiring availability of adequate resources. It should be borne in mind that these rights will 
</p>
<p>be realized progressively. The Government also has a commitment to allocate resources for 
</p>
<p>the realisation of the MDGs by 2015. We pledge to work collaboratively and through 
</p>
<p>international cooperation with all partners to this end. The next South African UPR report 
</p>
<p>will, among others, be an encapsulation of progressive achievements in the intervening 
</p>
<p>period.
