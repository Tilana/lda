<p><b>Report of the High Commissioner</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/2 requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;submit a comprehensive and updated report to the Council 
in 2009 in accordance with its annual programme of work, following the structure and scope of 
her report<b>1</b> and with a special focus on further measures to correct the imbalance in geographical 
composition of the staff of the Office&#8221;. The present report addresses developments in the 
composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. In chapter I of the present report, information is provided on the composition of OHCHR 
as at 31 December 2008. It includes data on staff members in posts subject to geographic 
distribution, as well as data on staff in temporary posts funded from extrabudgetary resources or 
in technical cooperation project posts, neither of which are included in the definition of posts 
subject to geographic distribution. 
                                                 
</p>
<p>*  The present report was submitted after the deadline to ensure incorporation of human 
resources data up to and including 31 December 2008. 
<b>1
</b>  A/HCR/7/57, see also A/63/290*. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. Chapter II contains a description of the measures for improvement taken by the High 
Commissioner aimed at addressing the geographical composition issues identified by the Human 
Rights Council in resolution 7/2, while fully observing Secretariat human resources policies, in 
particular, its recruitment and contractual policies. 
</p>
<p><b>I. COMPOSITION OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The recruitment of staff members to posts subject to geographical distribution is governed 
by the system of desirable ranges at the Secretariat level. For that purpose, Member States are 
grouped into four categories: unrepresented, underrepresented, within range and overrepresented. 
A Member State is considered unrepresented when none of its nationals, throughout the entire 
Secretariat, is serving in a post subject to geographical distribution and filled in accordance with 
the established selection process. It is underrepresented when the number of its nationals 
appointed to such posts throughout the entire Secretariat is below the lower limit of the desirable 
range. It is within range when the number of its nationals appointed to such posts is between the 
upper and lower limits of the desirable range, and it is overrepresented when the number of its 
nationals appointed to such posts within the entire Secretariat exceeds the upper limit of the 
desirable range. The representation status of Member States is affected by many factors, notably 
turnover of staff and changes in the scale of assessments. 
</p>
<p>5. The official report on the composition of the Secretariat is submitted annually by the 
Secretary-General to the General Assembly in accordance with a number of resolutions, the most 
recent of which are resolutions 57/305, 59/266, 60/238 and 61/244.  
</p>
<p>6. The latest report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat was issued 
in 2008 (A/63/310). OHCHR is part of the Secretariat and the breakdown of its geographical 
composition has to be seen against the breakdown of the overall distribution within the 
Secretariat.  
</p>
<p>7. Table A1 (annex I) provides a breakdown of all OHCHR staff members in the Professional 
category and above who have been selected through the established recruitment process against 
both regular budget and extrabudgetary posts by nationality, grade and gender as 
at 31 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>8. Table A2 (annex II) provides a breakdown of the following categories of additional 
OHCHR staff in the Professional category and above not included in table A1 by nationality, 
grade and gender as at 31 December 2008: 
</p>
<p> (a) Staff holding appointments of less than one year; 
</p>
<p> (b) Staff charged to general temporary assistance funds; 
</p>
<p> (c) Staff employed as technical cooperation project personnel. 
</p><p>9. Paragraph 14 of section IX of General Assembly resolution 63/250, re-emphasizes that the 
system of geographic ranges is designed to apply to countries rather than to regions or groups. 
Therefore, the data in this report are provided by country, listed in alphabetical order. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR had at 31 December 2008 a total of 460 staff in the Professional category and 
above, of which 317 are considered regular staff. Of the professional staff members, 310 work in 
Geneva, 13 work in the New York office, while 137 work in 38 different locations in the field.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Nationals from 98 countries are represented in the Professional and above workforce; one 
staff member is from Palestine. Of these 98 nationalities, 10 are underrepresented in the 
Secretariat,<b>3</b> 70 are considered within range (38 below mid-point<b>4</b> and 32 above mid-point<b>5</b>), 
while 18 nationalities are overrepresented<b>6</b> in the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>II. RESULTS OF EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE 
EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION 
</b></p>
<p>12. Despite the decision of the General Assembly referenced above to discontinue references 
to regions in reporting on staff representation, the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
Rights Council and the Joint Inspection Unit have made use of the concept of geographic 
diversity by regional grouping when assessing the composition of the staff of OHCHR.<b>7</b> This

 <p> 
</p>
<p>difference in approach, terminology and methodology from the report of the Secretary-General 
(A/63/310) has made comparison of data problematic. While being bound by the resolution of 
the General Assembly on this matter, the High Commissioner has, in order to facilitate a 
consistent and coherent discussion in the present report, continued to make occasional reference 
to the regional methodology used by the Human Rights Council and the Joint Inspection Unit in 
the analysis of the geographic diversity of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>13. As stated in the plan of action of the High Commissioner (A/59/2005/Add.3, annex), 
achieving geographic diversity in OHCHR staff will remain one of her priorities. In line with 
that objective, OHCHR has continued to vigorously implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
procedures and framework for improving geographic diversity, which were explained in detail in 
the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of OHCHR, submitted to 
the Commission on Human Rights in February 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/103). 
</p>
<p>14. The impact of the implementation of the above can be seen clearly in the overall 
geographic diversity of OHCHR. An analysis of the data contained in the table below, using the 
methodology employed by the Joint Inspection Unit, shows that OHCHR has significantly 
increased the percentage of staff from regions identified as requiring better representation within 
OHCHR over the previous two years.

</p>
<p>15. This underlines the issue of what constitutes a successful geographical balance for the 
OHCHR. It is important to note that, while being criticized for its geographical imbalance, 
OHCHR has yet to receive any indication of what would be considered an appropriate level of 
representation for each region, apart from the General Assembly mandated system of desirable 
ranges. 
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR will continue to vigorously implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures and 
framework for improving geographic diversity (E/CN.4/2006/103), which have, to date, proven 
effective. It is anticipated that the current positive geographic trends will continue during the 
current biennium as OHCHR will endeavour to maximize the opportunity afforded by its 
continued growth to further increase geographic diversity. 
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR is confident that a number of other initiatives will continue to enhance its 
geographic diversity. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. A human rights national competitive examination was held in February 2008 and the 
Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM) focused on inviting participation in the 
examination from eligible countries in regions deemed to require improved representation in 
OHCHR. Of the 49 Member States invited to participate, 41 responded with applications and a 
total of 236 candidates sat the examination. A number of OHCHR staff members served on the 
board of examiners. The actual impact of this process on the geographic diversity of OHCHR 
will be only known once OHRM releases the list of successful candidates in early 2009. 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR has also received support at the legislative level. In 2006, the General Assembly, 
on the basis of a report of the Third Committee, adopted resolution 61/159, in which it proposed 
a number of concrete measures to redress the geographical imbalance of the staff of OHCHR, 
including the establishment of a temporary mechanism whereby recruitment for extrabudgetary 
posts at the P-2 level would not be restricted to successful candidates from the national 
competitive examination. In its resolution 61/244, the General Assembly, on the basis of a report 
of the Fifth Committee on human resources management, subsequently made specific reference 
to OHCHR requesting the Secretary-General to present, in consultation with OHCHR, proposals 
to address the imbalance in the geographical distribution of the staff. Following extensive 
consultations between OHCHR and the Office of Human Resources Management, the 
Secretary-General submitted a report (A/61/823) to the Fifth Committee, in which several 
concrete measures were laid out, such as requesting an exemption from the national competitive 
recruitment examination process for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels. Although the report was not 
taken up by the General Assembly at that time, OHCHR worked closely with OHRM to proceed 
with some of the recommendations coming from both the Third and Fifth Committees pending 
their review by the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>20. The General Assembly (Fifth Committee) considered the above report, as well as a 
follow-up report (A/63/204) and related reports from the Joint Inspection Unit during its 
sixty-third session. In its resolution 63/250 on human resources management, the Assembly took 
note of report A/61/823 and the related changes to the staff rules that were proposed therein. 
</p>
<p>21. While seeking to further improve its geographical distribution, OHCHR will continue to 
pay special attention to the issue of gender balance, an area in which determination and 
concerted effort have already brought success, as demonstrated by the fact that as at 
31 December 2008, women represented 50.5 per cent of regular OHCHR staff and 50.3 per cent 
of temporary OHCHR staff at the professional level, equivalent to an overall percentage 
of 50.4 per cent.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>22. Similarly OHCHR will continue its commitment to meeting the goals and obligations 
placed upon it under the General Assembly mandated system of desirable ranges. In this regard, 
it is worth noting that during the current biennium OHCHR exceeded the departmental target 
relating to the recruitment of nationals from un- and underrepresented Member States established 
in the secretariat Human Resources Action Plan and the High Commissioner&#8217;s Compact with the 
Secretary-General.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> The implementation and results to date of the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures and 
framework to improve geographic diversity reflect the priority that the High 
Commissioner continues to give this issue in OHCHR. Noticeable progress has been 
achieved towards improved geographic diversity of its staff through these measures. 
Nevertheless, OHCHR remains attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the 
broadest possible geographic diversity of its staff, and will continue the implementation of 
these measures.
