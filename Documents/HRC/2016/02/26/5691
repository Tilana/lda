<p>3.  The summary of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 15 December 
2007 to 14 December 2008 and the replies received thereto from Governments by 31 
December 2008 are found in addendum 4 to the present report.  Addendum 4 contains a 
summary of the information provided by Governments and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) on implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur following country visits. In relation to addendum 5, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to announce that, starting from the present report, the format of the follow-up report 
has been modified with the aim of rendering it more reader-friendly and of facilitating the 
identification of the steps taken in response to recommendations. For this reason, so-called 
follow-up tables have been created, which contain the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur, a brief description of the situation when the country visit was undertaken, an 
overview of steps taken in previous years and included in previous follow-up reports, and 
more detailed information on the specific measures taken in the current year. These tables 
are submitted to the respective Governments for their input and comments before the 
report is published. Addenda 2 and 3 are reports of country visits to Denmark and 
Moldova, respectively. Addendum 1 is a preliminary note on the visit to Equatorial 
Guinea.
