<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/13. Elimination of discrimination against persons affected 
by leprosy and their family members 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including 
</p>
<p>Article 1 that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that they 
</p>
<p>are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of 
</p>
<p>brotherhood, </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, including article 12,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
</p>
<p>enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to enjoy the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (A/58/427), in which he 
</p>
<p>reported that persons affected by leprosy and their family members often suffer stigma 
</p>
<p>and discrimination born of ignorance and prejudice,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that more than 16 million people affected by leprosy have been cured 
</p>
<p>worldwide since the 1980s and that leprosy as a disease has been scientifically and 
</p>
<p>medically proven to be curable and manageable,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>also that tens of millions of people and their family members still 
</p>
<p>suffer from leprosy not only as a disease but also from political, legal, economic or social </p>

<p>discrimination and ostracization due to society&#8217;s lack of knowledge and misguided 
</p>
<p>notions, such as leprosy being incurable or hereditary, and that the issue of leprosy is not 
</p>
<p>only a matter of medicine or health but also one of discrimination that can give rise to a 
</p>
<p>clear violation of human rights,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note of </i>the previous work done by the Commission on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>its mechanism on discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family 
</p>
<p>members,   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging </i>States to share best practices on combating discrimination against 
</p>
<p>persons affected by leprosy and their family members and also on their efforts to  
</p>
<p>achieve full recovery from and manage this disease, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1.     <i>Affirms</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be 
</p>
<p>treated as individuals with dignity and are entitled to all basic human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms under customary international law, relevant conventions and 
</p>
<p>national constitutions and laws; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2.    <i>Calls upon</i> Governments to take effective measures to eliminate any type of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, including 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3.     <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to include the issue of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their 
</p>
<p>family members as an important matter in its human rights education and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising activities;  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4.     <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights to collect information on the measures that Governments have taken to 
</p>
<p>eliminate discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
</p>
<p>and, if extra-budgetary funding is available, to hold a meeting to exchange views among </p>

<p>relevant actors, including Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations bodies, specialized agencies and programmes, non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>scientists, medical experts as well as representatives of persons affected by leprosy and 
</p>
<p>their family members, and to transmit a report to the Council and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council Advisory Committee; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5.      <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to examine the 
</p>
<p>report referred to in paragraph 4 above, and formulate a draft set of principles and 
</p>
<p>guidelines for the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and 
</p>
<p>their family members, and to submit it to the Council for its consideration by September 
</p>
<p>2009; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6.      <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue based on these reports submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Council in September 2009.   
</p>
<p>  
28th meeting 
18 June 2008 
</p>
<p> 
[Adopted without a vote.]
