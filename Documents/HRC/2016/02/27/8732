<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to resolution 
11/8, in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity and human rights, in consultation with States, the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and all other relevant stakeholders. For the purpose of 
informing the content of the report, a note verbale was sent to States, United Nations 
agencies and non-governmental organizations on 1 October 2009 soliciting information and 
observations. Written contributions were received from 28 States,1 1 observer State,2 9 
United Nations entities and intergovernmental agencies3 and 22 non-governmental 
organizations, coalitions and other groups.4 All submissions may be viewed on the OHCHR 
website.5 
</p>
<p>2. In chapter II of the report, OHCHR provides a short introduction to the definition 
and scale of maternal mortality and morbidity. In chapter III, the human rights dimensions 
of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity are identified, with reference to the 
relevant existing international and regional legal framework, including the jurisprudence, 
general comments and recommendations, and concluding observations of the human rights 
treaty monitoring bodies and judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. In chapter IV, OHCHR 
provides an overview of initiatives and activities within the United Nations system that

<p>address issues of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. Finally, in chapter V, it 
identifies how the Council can add value to existing initiatives through a human rights 
analysis, including efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goal on improving 
maternal health, and recommends options for better addressing the human rights 
dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the United Nations 
system. 
</p>
<p>3. Reports prepared ahead of the forthcoming review at the High-level Plenary Meeting 
of the General Assembly in September 2010 (the Millennium Development Goals Summit) 
indicate that of all the Goals, Goal 5 on improving maternal health, with its related targets 
on reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by 2015 and achieving universal 
access to reproductive health, is the furthest from being achieved.6 Human Rights Council 
resolution 11/8 could thus not have been more timely in acknowledging that preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity is a human rights issue and challenge that needs increased 
attention. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Maternal mortality and morbidity: definition and scale 
</b></p>
<p>4. WHO defines maternal mortality as: &#8220;the death of a woman while pregnant or within 
42 days of termination of pregnancy &#8230; from any cause related to or aggravated by the 
pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes&#8221;.7 In turn, 
maternal morbidity is defined as &#8220;a condition outside of normal pregnancy, labour, and 
childbirth that negatively affects a woman&#8217;s health during those times&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>5. Although standardized definitions of maternal mortality and its causes exist, it is 
difficult to accurately measure levels of maternal mortality for three primary reasons: (a) it 
is challenging to identify maternal deaths; (b) the woman&#8217;s pregnancy status may not be 
known; and (c) in country settings where medical certification of cause of death does not 
exist, accurate attribution of female deaths as maternal death is difficult.9 While updating of 
statistics is a time-consuming exercise, new global statistics are currently being prepared in 
the context of the upcoming 2010 Millennium Development Goals Summit to measure 
international efforts towards achieving the Goals, including on improving maternal health. 
Pending this, according to the most recent official estimates over half a million maternal 
deaths occur worldwide each year. This translates into an adult lifetime risk of maternal 
death (the probability that a 15-year-old female will die eventually from a maternal cause) 
of 1 in 92 for women worldwide.10 In some countries, this risk of maternal death is as high 
as 1 in 7.11 Meanwhile for every maternal death, an estimated 20 women suffer pregnancy-
related injury, infection or disease, i.e. approximately 10 million women. In some cases,

<p>long-term disabilities (such as prolapse, infertility, obstetric fistula or incontinence) can 
result.12 For several reasons, pregnancy and childbirth imply higher risks for young 
adolescents. In developing countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the 
leading causes of death among girls and women between 15 and 19 years old, with 15 per 
cent of total maternal deaths worldwide occurring among adolescents.13 
</p>
<p>6. Five types of obstetric emergencies account for most maternal deaths: haemorrhage 
(25 per cent); infection/sepsis (15 per cent); unsafe abortion (13 per cent); pre-eclampsia 
and eclampsia (12 per cent); and prolonged or obstructed labour (8 per cent).14 According to 
WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank and other stakeholders, the majority of maternal deaths 
and disabilities could be prevented through access to sufficient care during pregnancy and 
delivery and effective interventions. This affirmation is supported by the observation that in 
some countries maternal mortality has been virtually eliminated. Only 15 per cent of 
pregnancies and childbirths need emergency obstetric care because of complications that 
are difficult to predict.15 WHO estimates that 88 to 98 per cent of maternal deaths are 
preventable.16 More recently, UNICEF has reaffirmed that approximately 80 per cent of 
maternal deaths could be averted if women had access to essential maternity and basic 
health-care services.17 World Bank estimates show that 74 per cent of maternal deaths could 
be prevented with increased coverage of professionally delivered interventions, especially 
access to essential obstetric care, access to safe abortion services, active rather than 
expectant management in the third stage of labour, and the use of anticonvulsants for 
women with pre-eclampsia.18 However, the maternal mortality ratio (the number of 
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) declined globally at a rate of less than 1 per cent a 
year between 1990 and 2005.19 The estimated total number of women dying in pregnancy 
or childbirth per year decreased only slightly between 1990 and 2005 (from 576,000 deaths 
in 1990 to 536,000 deaths in 2005).20 
</p><p>7. There are large disparities in maternal mortality rates between and within States. 
Although the majority of maternal deaths occur in developing States, mainly in Africa and 
South Asia,21 when maternal mortality and morbidity data in developed States are 
disaggregated, they reveal rates that vary dramatically between different ethnic and socio-
economic communities. Governments in developed States have binding human rights 
obligations to take measures to address this de facto discrimination. Already in 2001 a 
report by WHO recognized that &#8220;the failure to address preventable maternal disability and 
death represents one of the greatest social injustices of our times&#8221;22 and that &#8220;women&#8217;s

<p>reproductive health risks are not mere misfortunes and unavoidable natural disadvantages 
of pregnancy but, rather, injustices that societies are able and obligated to remedy&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights dimensions of preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity and existing international legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. There has been an increasing understanding at the international and regional levels 
that reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is not solely an issue of development, but a 
matter of human rights.24 In its resolution 11/8 (para. 2), the Human Rights Council 
identifies a range of human rights directly implicated by maternal mortality and morbidity, 
namely, the &#8220;rights to life, to be equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, receive 
and impart information, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from 
discrimination, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
including sexual and reproductive health&#8221;. International human rights treaties and the 
general comments, recommendations and concluding observations of several treaty bodies 
have recognized that maternal mortality implicates a wider range of human rights and have 
recommended that States parties take effective measures to reduce maternal mortality rates 
and improve maternal health,25 with reference to, inter alia, the right to be free from cruel, 
inhumane and degrading treatment, the right to privacy and the right to an effective remedy. 
These rights are enshrined in various international and regional human rights treaties, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>9. Maternal mortality is overwhelmingly due to a number of interrelated reasons, or 
delays, which ultimately prevent pregnant women from accessing the health care they 
need.26 These delays, often referred to as the &#8220;three delays&#8221;, are understood to encompass:

<p>(a) delay in seeking appropriate medical help for an obstetric emergency for reasons of cost, 
lack of recognition of an emergency, poor education, lack of access to information and 
gender inequality; (b) delay in reaching an appropriate facility for reasons of distance, 
infrastructure and transport, and; (c) delay in receiving adequate care when a facility is 
reached because there are shortages in staff, or because electricity, water or medical 
supplies are not available.27 When examining the elements of these three delays from a 
human rights perspective, numerous rights are at play and, consequently, a range of States&#8217; 
human rights responsibilities may be engaged. 
</p>
<p>10. When women die in pregnancy or childbirth because the Government fails to use its 
available resources to take measures necessary to address the preventable causes of 
maternal death and ensure availability, accessibility, acceptability and good quality of 
services, the responsibility of the State may be engaged in respect of a violation of 
women&#8217;s right to life. Preventable maternal deaths and injuries may also entail violations of 
the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual 
and reproductive health, the rights to equality and to non-discrimination and the rights to 
information, to education and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress. These rights 
cannot be seen as absolutely distinct but rather as &#8220;indivisible, interdependent, interrelated, 
and of equal importance for human dignity&#8221;.28 
</p>
<p>11. States are obligated under international human rights law to respect, protect and 
fulfil human rights in relation to surviving pregnancy and childbirth. These human rights 
obligations are not only valid in and of themselves, the analysis they foster also contributes 
to identifying obstacles to more effective public health interventions to eliminate maternal 
mortality and morbidity. 
</p>
<p>12. In the context of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, these obligations 
require States (a) to refrain from taking actions that would obstruct women&#8217;s access to the 
health-care services they need or to the underlying determinants of health29 (duty to 
respect), (b) to take measures to prevent women from dying in childbirth and pregnancy 
(duty to protect) and (c) to take legislative, administrative, and judicial action, including 
through the commitment of maximum available resources to prevent maternal mortality and 
morbidity (duty to fulfil). Therefore, States&#8217; human rights obligations include both negative 
obligations to refrain from action, and positive obligations to act affirmatively to prevent 
maternal mortality and morbidity, including by taking steps to ensure women can access 
maternal health care and other relevant sexual and reproductive health services. 
</p>
<p>13. International human rights treaties and their interpretation by human rights bodies 
have made clear that many of the obligations States must undertake to prevent maternal 
mortality and morbidity are of immediate effect. While ICESCR recognizes that many of 
the rights it guarantees are subject to progressive realization, and requires States to take 
steps to achieve those rights to the maximum of their available resources, the Covenant also 
imposes certain core obligations that are of immediate effect. The Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has emphasized that &#8220;a State Party cannot, under any 
circumstances whatsoever, justify its non-compliance with the core obligations &#8230; which

<p>are non-derogable&#8221;.30 CESCR has stated that the provision of maternal health services is 
comparable to a core obligation, and that States have the immediate obligation to take 
&#8220;deliberate, concrete and targeted steps&#8221; towards fulfilling the right to health in the context 
of pregnancy and childbirth.31 The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women also establishes that State obligations to address maternal 
mortality and morbidity are of immediate effect. It requires States parties to ensure services 
for maternal health and equality in access to health services (art. 12), as denying services 
that only women need is a form of discrimination.32 Moreover, the right to life and other 
civil and political rights, and the right to non-discrimination, are not subject to progressive 
realization.33 
</p>
<p><b> A. Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>14. The scale of maternal mortality and morbidity across the world reflects a situation of 
inequality and discrimination34 suffered by women throughout their lifetimes, perpetuated 
by formal laws, policies and harmful social norms and practices. An approach to 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity that applies the human rights principles of 
equality and non-discrimination will provide stakeholders, including States, international 
organizations, and members of both the human rights and public health communities, with a 
vital tool in their ongoing efforts to address the problem. It can facilitate the identification 
of high-risk groups, enable analysis of the complex gaps in protection, participation and 
accountability they are facing, and promote the identification of comprehensive and 
sustainable solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Obligations under international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>15. International human rights law specifies that all human beings must be able to enjoy 
and exercise their human rights on a basis of equality between women and men,35 and free 
from discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.36 Among other things, 
these fundamental legal requirements oblige States to refrain from discriminatory actions,37 
to take positive proactive steps to guarantee equality38 (not just in law, but in policy and

account of difference.41 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Application in the context of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity 
</b></p>
<p>16. There are a number of ways in which non-discrimination and equality-related 
obligations come into play in the context of efforts to prevent women&#8217;s death and disability 
from pregnancy-related causes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ensuring gender equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex 
</b></p>
<p>17. As research indicates, preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is related to a 
lack of provision and prioritization of health care42 that only women need due to the fact 
that reproduction takes place in their bodies. Though all human beings are affected in 
significant ways by preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, by definition it is the 
lives and health of women and adolescent girls that are directly and immediately impacted. 
But while interventions and services needed to combat maternal mortality do exist, &#8220;there is 
no single cause of death and disability for men between the ages of 15 and 44 that is close 
to the magnitude of maternal mortality&#8221;.43 To ensure gender equality and non-
discrimination on the basis of sex, States must address this. Specifically, States are 
obligated to ensure that their laws, policies and practices meaningfully address the specific 
needs of women due to their ability to become pregnant and give birth.44 This includes, 
among other things, an obligation to ensure women&#8217;s access to emergency obstetric care 
and to other sexual and reproductive health information and services, such as family 
planning.45 
</p>
<p>18. Obligations related to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex also 
explicitly request States to confront a number of underlying factors that contribute to 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. For example, States should take measures to 
effectively reduce and ultimately eliminate gender-based violence and other harmful 
practices against women and girls,46 which exacerbate the risks of a woman&#8217;s death or 
disability as a result of pregnancy-related causes.47 Action is also required to eliminate

<p>other forms of discrimination on the basis of sex that may occur in practice at the local level 
and in the private sphere,48 for example, limits on women&#8217;s access to nutrition and food, 
clean water and sanitation, and education, limits which in turn can increase risks of 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity.49 
</p>
<p><b>  Non-discrimination on other grounds: addressing intersectional and multiple forms of 
discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>19. Specific groups of women face higher levels of risk of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity. The risk of death or injury due to pregnancy-related causes can 
depend upon various grounds, including race, colour, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.50 Where a person faces 
discrimination on the basis of more than one of the prohibited grounds (i.e. on the basis of 
sex and another ground), they are facing cumulative, multiple or intersectional 
discrimination, which can have a substantially heightened effect on their ability to exercise 
and enjoy their human rights.51 
</p><p>20. The elevated risk that a woman may face due to multiple discriminations is often 
tied to a heightened inability to access adequate health-care systems and timely 
interventions and services, although the reasons for this inability may differ. For example, 
laws or social practices may place age limits, or restrictions related to marital status, on 
access to sexual and reproductive health care, services and information. Meanwhile for 
reasons of distance, cost and lack of information or lack of cultural sensitivity, women 
living in rural areas, indigenous women,52 displaced persons/refugees, girls, or women of 
lower social and economic status may not have sufficient access to antenatal services, 
emergency obstetric care and skilled birth attendants. Furthermore, they may be reluctant to 
access health care because of language barriers or insensitivity to indigenous practices and 
traditions. The risk of death and disability from pregnancy-related causes increases even 
further for women who fall into more than one such category. 
</p>
<p>21. The human rights requirements of equality and non-discrimination require States to 
ensure that the steps they take to give effect to the human rights of women and address the 
specific needs of women are meaningful to all women in society. These human rights 
further require measures that enable relevant stakeholders to identify and address the 
reasons behind certain women&#8217;s heightened inability to access adequate and timely health-
care interventions and services. Such measures include monitoring and assessment on the 
basis of disaggregated data, policy assessment and review, and legal reform as appropriate.

<p><b> B. Rights in focus: the right to life, the right to health and the right to 
education and information 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>22. International and regional guarantees of the right to life require States to take 
measures to protect individuals from arbitrary and preventable loss of life.53 The number of 
preventable maternal deaths suggests a systematic failure to provide services needed by 
women to survive childbirth, which may constitute a violation of the right to life. Various 
human rights bodies have recognized the obligation of States to protect women&#8217;s right to 
life in the context of pregnancy and childbirth, with the Human Rights Committee, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights characterizing preventable maternal 
mortality as a violation of women&#8217;s right to life.54 Several treaty bodies have more 
specifically underlined the link between unsafe abortion and high rates of maternal 
mortality and have asked States to ensure that women are not forced to undergo clandestine 
abortions that endanger their lives.55 
</p>
<p>23. In the context of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, the right to life is 
closely connected to the human rights to health, education and information, and equality in 
the exercise and enjoyment of all human rights. The ability of women to survive pregnancy 
and childbirth is contingent upon their access to quality reproductive and maternal health 
care, freedom from social, cultural, economic and legal discrimination, and autonomy over 
decisions relating to their reproductive lives. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>24. The right to health, including sexual and reproductive health, encompasses both the 
freedom to control one&#8217;s health and body as well as the right to enjoy a variety of facilities, 
goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable 
standard of health.56

</p>
<p>25. Specifically, the right to health requires that particular measures be taken in relation 
to pregnancy and childbirth, including the provision of reproductive and maternal health 
care. ICECSR states that &#8220;special protection should be accorded to mothers during a 
reasonable period before and after childbirth&#8221; (art. 10, para. 2), and the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women establishes that &#8220;States Parties 
shall ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and 
the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as adequate nutrition 
during pregnancy and lactation&#8221; (art. 12, para. 2).57 ICECSR also requires the provision of 
reproductive and maternal (pre- as well as post-natal) health care.58 Numerous other 
international and regional human rights instruments and bodies have elaborated on States&#8217; 
obligations with respect to access to family planning, pre- and post-natal care, skilled 
delivery, emergency obstetric care and access to safe abortion and post-abortion care.59 
</p>
<p>26. Evidence shows that access to voluntary family planning can reduce maternal deaths 
by between 25 and 40 per cent.60 For example, contraception contributes to lowering 
teenage pregnancy rates.61 CEDAW has urged Governments to take measures to provide 
access to contraception and family planning services.62 
</p>
<p>27. Unsafe abortion is one of the five major direct causes of maternal deaths and can 
result in permanent injuries and death due to complications.63 Unsafe abortion accounts for 
13 per cent of maternal deaths, and 20 per cent of the total mortality and disability burden 
due to pregnancy and childbirth.64 Every year, there are 65,000 to 70,000 deaths and close 
to 5 million women with temporary or permanent disability due to unsafe abortion.65 
According to WHO, the degree of legal access to abortion co-determines the frequency and 
related mortality of unsafe abortion. Evidence also shows that women who seek abortion 
will do so regardless of legal restrictions. Where there are few restrictions on the 
availability of safe abortion, deaths and illnesses are significantly reduced.66 Treaty bodies

<p>have expressed concern over the impact of unsafe abortion-related deaths and disabilities 
not only on women&#8217;s right to life but also their right to health.67 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health maintains that women are entitled to 
reproductive health-care services, goods and facilities that are: (a) available in adequate 
numbers; (b) accessible physically and economically; (c) accessible without discrimination; 
and (d) of good quality.68 Other key criteria include acceptability and accessibility of 
information.69 Ensuring availability entails increasing care and improving human resources 
strategies, including increasing the number and quality of health professionals. Physical 
access to and the cost of health services often influence whether women are able to seek 
care. Ensuring women&#8217;s access to maternal health and other sexual and reproductive health 
services may require addressing discriminatory laws, policies, practices and gender 
inequalities in health care and in society. Laws or policies that restrict women&#8217;s access to 
information on sexual and reproductive health have a direct impact on maternal mortality. 
Preventing maternal mortality includes scaling up technical interventions and making them 
affordable, but also ensuring that services are sensitive to the rights, cultures and needs of 
pregnant women, including those from indigenous peoples and other minority groups. 
Maternal health-care services must be medically appropriate, as quality of care often 
influences the outcome of interventions and a woman&#8217;s decision to seek care. 
</p>
<p>29. However, the right to health goes beyond access to health care, and maternal 
mortality and morbidity are affected by a number of underlying social, economic, cultural 
and political determinants of health and structural barriers.70 These determinants include 
nutrition, water and sanitation, information on sexual and reproductive health, economic 
exclusion and discrimination, non-discrimination and gender equality. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Rights to education and information 
</b></p>
<p>30. The realization of the right to education is essential to women&#8217;s ability to enjoy the 
full range of human rights. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of sexual and 
reproductive health is imperative to ensuring individuals&#8217; ability to protect their health and 
make informed decisions about sexuality and reproduction. Women&#8217;s low rates of literacy 
and education worldwide correlate strongly to high rates of maternal mortality and 
adversely to other indices of maternal health, including fertility rate, utilization of prenatal 
care, met need for contraception and higher age at first birth. Lack of education affects 
women&#8217;s health by limiting their knowledge of nutrition, birth spacing and contraception. 
Additionally, in some countries, education can be a key determinant of quality of care, with 
less-educated women facing greater discrimination within health-care facilities. 
</p>
<p>31. The rights to information and the benefits of scientific progress are firmly rooted in 
the most fundamental human rights, including the rights to life, health, education and non-
discrimination. Access to information is a necessary part of women&#8217;s ability to make 
informed choices with respect to their sexual and reproductive lives and to access health 
services needed to ensure healthy pregnancy and delivery. In article 16, paragraph 1 (e), of

<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it is 
established that States must provide &#8220;access to the information, education, and means&#8221; to 
enable women to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasized that States &#8220;should provide 
adolescents with access to sexual and reproductive information, including on family 
planning and contraceptives, the dangers of early pregnancy, the prevention of HIV/AIDS 
and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases&#8221;.71 The right to the 
benefits of scientific progress, as explicitly recognized in ICESCR (art. 15, para. 1), is 
particularly salient in the maternal mortality and morbidity context, as numerous low-cost 
health interventions, to which women are entitled access, could substantially reduce 
maternal death and disability.72 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights-based approach to maternal mortality and morbidity 
</b></p>
<p>32. The practical implications of the human rights values of dignity and non-
discrimination result in a set of working principles that form the basis of a human rights 
approach. The treaty bodies and United Nations experts have clarified the importance of 
seven such principles: accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, 
sustainability, international cooperation and non-discrimination.73 These principles have 
particular application when examining a human rights-based approach to addressing 
maternal mortality and morbidity as discussed in this section. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>33. Accountability is at the core of the enjoyment of all human rights and has two main 
components: addressing past grievances and correcting systemic failure to prevent future 
harm. Accountability is sometimes narrowly understood to mean blame and punishment, 
whereas it is more accurately regarded as a process to determine what is working (so it can 
be repeated) and what is not (so it can be adjusted).74 
</p><p>34. The Human Rights Committee has articulated State obligations regarding 
accountability in the context of the right to life, in the form of a State obligation to prevent, 
investigate or redress harm caused by acts of private persons or entities.75 In this 
connection, the Committee emphasized the need for administrative mechanisms to give 
effect to the obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly, 
effectively and impartially.76 
</p>
<p>35. CESCR has clarified that States must establish mechanisms and institutions that can 
effectively address both the individual and the structural nature of harm caused by 
discrimination in the enjoyment of rights.77 It has also specified that strengthening

<p>important elements in ensuring the right to health.78 The Special Rapporteur on the right to 
health has defined accountability as &#8220;ensuring that health systems are improving, and the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health is being progressively realized, for all, 
including disadvantaged individuals, communities, and population&#8221;.79 
</p>
<p>36. Regular monitoring of the health system and the underlying physical and socio-
economic determinants of health that affect women&#8217;s health and ability to exercise their 
rights is a critical component of accountability. Without monitoring, systemic failures in 
reducing maternal mortality and morbidity cannot be corrected. When States adopt and 
implement a national public health strategy and plan of action,80 they should also develop 
&#8220;appropriate indicators to monitor progress made, and to highlight where policy 
adjustments may be needed&#8221;.81 Monitoring helps States parties develop a better 
understanding of the &#8220;problems and shortcomings encountered&#8221; in realizing rights, 
providing them with the &#8220;framework within which more appropriate policies can be 
devised&#8221;.82 Data based on appropriate indicators should be disaggregated on the basis of the 
prohibited grounds of discrimination to monitor the elimination of discrimination83 as well 
as to ensure that vulnerable communities are benefiting from health-care schemes. 
</p>
<p>37. As an accountability measure designed to reduce maternal mortality, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health has strongly recommended that all States introduce, as a 
matter of urgency, a comprehensive, effective registration system, as well as a system of 
maternal death audits, in order to find out why the deaths occurred. Such maternal death 
audits, the Special Rapporteur notes, should be a non-judicial review that goes beyond 
medical reasons to identify the social, economic and cultural reasons that led or contributed 
to the death.84 
</p>
<p>38. The principle of accountability is closely linked to the right of victims to remedy 
including reparation.85 Effective access to remedies and reparation contributes to a 
constructive accountability framework by focusing on system failures and encouraging 
repair. The components of remedies and reparation were articulated through the Basic 
Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law approved by the General Assembly in 2005.86 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>39. Participation is an operational principle of a rights-based approach that has come to 
be recognized as a right in itself. At the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 
Almaty in 1978, 134 Governments and 67 international organizations agreed that &#8220;the 
people have the right and duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning 
and implementation of their health care&#8221;.87 Participation in the context of maternal mortality 
and morbidity means granting women access to relevant information and including them in 
the decision-making processes which affect their pregnancy and childbirth. The Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health has noted, in the context of reducing maternal mortality

<p>and morbidity, that the &#8220;right to health includes an entitlement to participate in health 
policymaking &#8230; [because this] will help develop more effective and sustainable 
programmes, reduce exclusion and enhance accountability&#8221;.88 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Transparency 
</b></p>
<p>40. Without transparency, there cannot be meaningful accountability or participation. 
The State is obligated to provide transparent accountability processes to enable citizens to 
participate fully in the review and refocusing of public policies.89 CESCR has pointed out 
that health strategies and plans of action need to be devised and reviewed &#8220;on the basis of a 
participatory and transparent process&#8221;.90 The Special Rapporteur on the right to health 
emphasizes that although States have some discretion in choosing appropriate monitoring 
and accountability mechanisms, &#8220;all mechanisms must be effective, accessible and 
transparent&#8221;.91 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>41. As mentioned in the section on equality and non-discrimination above, preventable 
mortality and morbidity is closely linked to inequitable access to health resources, 
information and other human rights. Conversely, gender equality and empowerment play a 
key role in preventing maternal mortality because they lead to greater demand by women 
for family planning services, antenatal care and safe delivery.92 In addition, the 
effectiveness of accountability mechanisms, which in turn render health policies more 
effective, depends on the use made of these mechanisms. Therefore, CESCR has called for 
the provision, where possible, of legal aid to victims of potential human rights violations in 
order for accountability mechanisms to be effective.93 In the context of maternal mortality 
and morbidity, access to information, and the education to take advantage of this 
information, is crucial to women and girls being able to take advantage of existing mortality 
reduction schemes. Empowerment therefore becomes the precursor for effective policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>42. Reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity requires a long-term 
investment in health policies and programmes to further the empowerment of those women 
who are particularly at risk. Such sustainability has been highlighted as key to successful 
initiatives to guarantee both the underlying physical determinants of health, such as water, 
and health-care access itself.94 
</p>
<p><b> 6. International assistance 
</b></p>
<p>43. While the prevention of maternal mortality and morbidity in some cases depends on 
the provision of relatively economical and simple interventions, deaths cannot be fully 
prevented without an overall functioning health system and a stable infrastructure for 
transportation of implements and patients, as well as a system for education, the provision

<p>of information, and accountability.95 The strengthening of these systems is beneficial to all 
citizens, not just women. It is, however, also costly, and illustrates clearly the interlinkages 
among development, human rights and public health. 
</p>
<p>44. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health has emphasized that: 
&#8220;The right to health gives rise to a responsibility of international assistance and cooperation 
on developed States to assist developing States to realize the right to health. Developed 
States should support developing States&#8217; efforts to reduce maternal mortality. This 
responsibility is reflected in Millennium Development Goal 8, which is a commitment to 
develop a global partnership for development.&#8221;96 Thus, donor countries have a 
responsibility to provide international cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Overview of initiatives and activities within the United 
Nations system and beyond to address all causes of 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity 
</b></p>
<p>45. An exhaustive overview of all major existing global initiatives and activities to 
address preventable maternal mortality and morbidity would be overwhelming in length. A 
preliminary analysis of the types of activities, roughly categorized under normative and 
policy development, service provision, and accountability, confirms the significant number 
of existing initiatives but also highlights the need for coherence and enhanced action in 
specific areas. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Normative and policy development 
</b></p>
<p>46. The elaboration on human rights law by human rights mechanisms referred to 
extensively in the present report has not been done in isolation, but alongside commitments 
made by States in international conferences and global initiatives. In 1994 the Cairo 
International Conference on Population and Development adopted a Programme of Action, 
identifying as objectives, among others, the promotion of women&#8217;s health and safe 
motherhood, the achievement of a rapid and substantial reduction in maternal morbidity and 
mortality, and the reduction in the differences observed between and within developed and 
developing countries. Recognizing the impact of unsafe abortion as &#8220;a major public health 
concern&#8221;, the Programme of Action urges Governments to spare no effort in preventing 
high-risk pregnancies and births, particularly those of adolescents, as well as unwanted 
pregnancies and &#8220;to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family 
planning services&#8221;.97 The Programme of Action further states in paragraph 8.25 that: &#8220;in 
circumstances where abortion is not against the law, such abortion should be safe. In all 
cases, women should have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion&#8221;. At the United Nations five-year review of the Programme of Action, 
it was agreed that &#8220;in circumstances where abortion is not against the law, health systems 
should train and equip health-service providers and should take other measures to ensure 
that such abortion is safe and accessible&#8221;.98

</p>
<p>47. In the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), States resolved to 
strengthen and reorient health services in order to ensure universal access to quality health 
services for women and girls, reduce ill health and maternal morbidity and achieve 
worldwide the agreed upon goal of reducing maternal mortality by at least 50 per cent of 
the 1990 levels by the year 2000 and a further one half by the year 2015. Commitments 
were made to ensure that the necessary services are available at each level of the health 
system, and to make reproductive health care accessible, through the primary health-care 
system, to all individuals of appropriate ages (para. 107 (i)). The Beijing Declaration and 
Platform for Action further recognized the health impact of unsafe abortion as a major 
public health concern (para. 107 (j)), confirming the position taken in the International 
Conference on Population and Development, and Governments agreed to consider 
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal 
abortion (para. 107 (k)). 
</p><p>48. At the Millennium Summit in 2000, States resolved to reduce maternal mortality by 
three quarters by the year 2015. This commitment is encapsulated in the Millennium 
Development Goals, which derive from the Millennium Summit commitments, and which 
have come to play a defining role in international development efforts. Specifically Goal 5 
concerns improving maternal health and ensuring universal access to reproductive health 
care. 
</p>
<p>49. The World Health Assembly has confirmed a global consensus around cornerstone 
interventions: family planning, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric and newborn 
care.99 WHO is currently revising its publication <i>Safe Abortion: Technical and Policy 
Guidance for Health Systems</i> and producing new clinical practice guidelines for health 
providers in order to further assist countries in providing safe abortion care. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Services 
</b></p>
<p>50. UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank and WHO have recently joined efforts to 
accelerate progress in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity, with the right to health as 
a central principle, and through a human rights approach to United Nations country 
programming. The joint initiative is collectively known as the &#8220;Health 4&#8221; or &#8220;H4&#8221;. During 
the coming year, the four agencies will enhance their support to the countries with the 
highest maternal mortality, starting with 6, scaling up to 25, with an expansion to 60 
countries.100 Through the &#8220;H4&#8221;, in partnership with other stakeholders, the organizations 
are, inter alia: costing national plans and rapidly mobilizing required resources; scaling up 
quality health services to ensure universal access to reproductive health, especially with 
respect to family planning, skilled attendance at delivery and emergency obstetric and 
newborn care; ensuring linkages with HIV prevention and treatment; and addressing the 
urgent need for skilled health workers, particularly midwives. 
</p>
<p>51. Other joint initiatives include: the International Planned Parenthood Federation (East 
and South-East Asia and Oceania Region) initiative entitled &#8220;SPRINT&#8221; aimed at increasing 
access to sexual and reproductive health information and services for populations surviving 
crisis and living in post-crisis situations;101 and the joint International Confederation of 
Midwives/UNFPA Global Programme on Midwifery promoting the professionalization of 
the midwifery practice in 12 African countries, supporting national efforts to improve

<p>national midwifery standards and helping countries to scale up community-based 
midwifery practice.102 
</p>
<p>52. United Nations programmes and agencies also continue to assist countries in this 
area. UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO support nationally owned initiatives on maternal health 
in more than 90 countries. At the request of the Governments, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO 
support these countries in taking the lead to strengthen their health-care systems and scale 
up efforts to deliver better health outcomes, particularly for persons living in poverty or in 
situations of vulnerability. UNFPA and WHO work with countries to ensure that sexual and 
reproductive health is fully integrated and prioritized into national frameworks and plans, 
and that corresponding resources are made available. UNFPA and WHO include maternal 
health as part of a package of interventions in the area of sexual and reproductive health, 
along with family planning. In 2008, UNFPA established the Maternal Health Thematic 
Fund aimed at increasing available funding to support the capacities of health systems to 
provide a broad range of quality maternal health services, reduce health inequities and 
empower women to exercise their right to maternal health. Assistance under this initiative 
has included technical and financial support to high maternal mortality countries to 
accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5. 
</p>
<p>53. Other service-related initiatives directly target risk factors, such as early marriages, 
female genital mutilation/cutting or HIV. The Berhane Hewan programme in Ethiopia&#8217;s 
Amhara region, where rates of child marriage and maternal mortality rates are among the 
highest in the world, follows a conditional cash transfer model by encouraging families to 
allow their girls to participate in the programme rather than to marry them off. Both 
married and unmarried girls in the programme develop functional literacy, life skills, 
livelihood skills and reproductive health education. Upon successful completion, the girls 
and families receive modest rewards. In Guatemala, the UNFPA-sponsored <i>Abriendo 
Oportunidades</i> programme also works with marginalized girls at risk of child marriage. 
Through the programme, the girls gain leadership, entrepreneurial and life skills, as well as 
information about gender equality and reproductive health. 
</p>
<p>54. In the context of its programme on Child and Adolescent Health and Development, 
WHO is working to strengthen the response of reproductive health programmes to 
adolescents in order to put in place a complementary set of actions aimed at preventing too 
early and often unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and mortality resulting from it, and 
mortality during childbirth and the post-natal period. To this end, the organization is 
generating evidence, developing methods and tools, building capacity and consensus and 
strengthening collaboration. 
</p>
<p>55. In 2007, UNICEF and UNFPA launched a joint programme entitled &#8220;Female Genital 
Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change&#8221; with the objective of contributing to a 40 per 
cent reduction of the practice among girls aged 0&#8211;15 years, with at least one country 
declared free of female genital mutilation/cutting by 2012. The two agencies are also 
working with WHO, especially on stemming the trend of the medicalization of this harmful 
practice.103 Through a culturally sensitive approach, the joint programme fosters 
partnerships with government authorities both at decentralized and national levels, religious 
authorities and local religious leaders, the media, civil society organizations and the 
education and reproductive health sectors.

<p>56. UNAIDS, UNFPA, WHO and other entities provide technical support to scale up 
comprehensive prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV, which includes (a) integration 
of HIV counselling and testing and other services such as safe delivery and infant feeding 
in maternal health-care settings, (b) advocacy to meet the sexual and reproductive health 
and reproductive rights of women living with HIV (including information on their right to 
determine the number and spacing of their children) and (c) access to family planning and 
other sexual and reproductive health services.104 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>57. The human rights mechanisms represent a developed framework to ensure 
accountability at the international level, including through complaints mechanisms 
established through optional protocols to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women and ICESCR. In the context of measuring State 
compliance with international, regional and national human rights standards, WHO and the 
Program on International Health and Human Rights, Harvard School of Public Health, have 
developed a tool that provides a method for countries to use a human rights framework to 
identify and address legal, policy and regulatory barriers to peoples&#8217; access to, and use of, 
maternal health services, and to the provision of quality services. The tool has been field 
tested and used in more than 10 countries.105 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>58. <b>In its resolution 11/8, the Human Rights Council specifically calls for 
recommendations on how the Council can add value to existing initiatives through a 
human rights analysis, including efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5 
on improving maternal health, and options for better addressing the human rights 
dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the United 
Nations system. With the adoption of the resolution, the Human Rights Council has 
explicitly requested States to &#8220;redouble their efforts to ensure the full and effective 
implementation of their human rights obligations&#8221; (para. 3) in the context of 
eliminating preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. While the work of the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, international and regional actors has 
progressively elaborated on the human rights dimensions of maternal mortality, as 
well as on the human rights violations that need to be addressed, prevented or 
remedied in this area, the value of a collective commitment to a human rights 
approach cannot be overestimated. In particular, the existence of maternal mortality 
and morbidity is fundamentally linked to violations of the human rights &#8220;to life, to be 
equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, receive and impart information, to 
enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from discrimination, and to enjoy 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and 
reproductive health&#8221;</b>106 <b>and &#8220;requires the effective promotion and protection of the

</b></p>
<p>59. <b>It is clear that human rights have an important role to play in developing 
effective approaches to addressing this global problem through public health schemes. 
A number of steps that are essential to effectively address maternal mortality and 
morbidity have been identified as part of human rights standards, including the 
establishment of accessible, transparent and effective mechanisms of monitoring and 
accountability and of ensuring women&#8217;s rights to participate in decision-making 
processes that affect their pregnancy and childbirth. Related State obligations, which 
also include procedural obligations, are underpinned by several specific human rights 
principles: accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, 
international cooperation and non-discrimination. Giving effect to these principles is 
the core of a human rights-based approach to the eradication of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity. While maternal mortality and morbidity is global in nature, 
States and other actors giving international assistance and technical cooperation need 
also to approach their work to address maternal mortality and morbidity from a 
human rights-based perspective. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Council has called for the integration of consideration of the human rights 
dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity into its mechanisms, 
particularly the universal periodic review and special procedures, by encouraging 
States and other actors to give increased attention to this issue in their engagement 
with the United Nations human rights system.</b>108<b> In answering this call of the Council, 
Member and Observer States could give additional attention to systematically 
addressing the human rights dimensions of maternal mortality and morbidity in their 
reporting under the universal periodic review processes as well as to considering this 
issue when reviewing other States. The Council could also consider requesting States 
to report on certain human rights aspects of addressing preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity during the universal periodic review. Another important 
part of this would be for the Council to invite United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes that are undertaking initiatives and activities in relation to maternal 
mortality and morbidity to systematically contribute information for consideration in 
the universal periodic review. As the above discussion shows, the issue of maternal 
mortality and morbidity is not simply a matter of the right to health but cuts across a 
number of rights and thematic human rights issues. Thus, special procedures could 
also be encouraged by the Council to integrate consideration of the human rights 
dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity within the scope of their 
respective mandates.</b> 
</p>
<p>61. <b>How the substantive human rights framework applies to the context of 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity has been laid out thoroughly within the 
work of treaty bodies as well as that of other international experts and regional 
bodies. However, what is missing is the operationalization of a human rights-based 
approach to maternal mortality and morbidity. That is, many questions remain 
unanswered, such as: What are specific steps that can be taken to implement/adopt a 
human rights-based approach to eliminating preventable maternal mortality and 
morbidity? How can States ensure that constructive accountability mechanisms 
developed are consistent with human rights principles? What is the range of 
constructive accountability mechanisms that can be used to ensure effective reduction 
of maternal mortality and morbidity? What is needed to ensure that a constructive 
accountability mechanism is participatory, effective and transparent?

<p><b>22</b> GE.10-12949 
</p>
<p>62. <b>This operationalization is inherently a large process requiring systematization 
and is currently without a clear lead within the United Nations system. Without 
doubt, there is much good practice that States and other actors can helpfully share, 
ensuring that such good practice relates specifically to the implementation of a human 
rights-based approach to maternal mortality and morbidity. While the universal 
periodic review is one forum for such sharing, there is much scope at this time for 
good practice to be collected in a systematic and thorough fashion. Implementation 
and monitoring of such an operational framework are also necessary; however, they 
have not been a priority at the international level. The Council could spearhead 
efforts to move forward on such implementation and monitoring activities. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>As discussed earlier, of all the Millennium Development Goals, Goal 5 is the 
furthest from being realized. Despite efforts to reduce maternal mortality globally, 
very little progress has actually been made in the last 20 years. Given this, there is 
clearly much scope for the Council to make constructive and effective contributions to 
the global effort to eliminate maternal mortality and morbidity through its mandate 
to promote and protect human rights. There are a number of recommended options 
for the Council&#8217;s consideration relating to promoting a human rights-based approach 
to addressing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. The options presented 
below are not mutually exclusive, but rather reinforce one another. In the short term, 
such steps could include making a contribution in relation to the human rights 
dimensions of maternal mortality and morbidity to the High-level Plenary Meeting of 
the General Assembly in September 2010 reviewing the progress made towards 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals and forwarding the present study for 
the attention of the Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly. Such steps would be 
consistent with the Council&#8217;s mandate of mainstreaming human rights within the 
United Nations system.

<p>64. <b>Additional steps the Council could take would be to further the 
operationalization of a human rights-based approach to maternal mortality and 
morbidity. This could involve, as an initial step, the collection of good practices from 
States and other actors as to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity from a 
human rights perspective. Such a compilation of good or effective practice would be 
an important and necessary contribution or foundation for an expert consultation co-
hosted by relevant United Nations agencies that would look at the operational aspects 
of a rights-based approach to maternal mortality and morbidity in greater detail. The 
outputs of such a large-scale consultation could be presented to the Council for its 
consideration.

<p>65. <b>As a final step, while there is already much ongoing inter-agency dialogue and 
collaboration within the United Nations (and Bretton Woods) systems on the issue of 
maternal mortality and morbidity, there is further scope for work on the human 
rights dimensions of this topic to be strengthened through the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) participation in this dialogue and 
collaboration, particularly with UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank. Such 
participation would allow OHCHR to assist this collaboration by offering human 
rights expertise and at the same time would also allow for the building of OHCHR 
capacity in this area through the interaction with agencies having a range of 
specialized technical expertise in maternal mortality and morbidity.
