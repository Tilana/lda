<p><b>  </b>22/&#8230;<b> Situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council,  
</i></p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 66/176 of 19 December 2011, 66/253A of 
</p>
<p>16 February 2012, 66/253B of 3 August 2012 and 67/183 of 20 December 2012, Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions S-16/1 of 29 April 2011, S-17/1 of 23 August 2011, S-18/1 of 2 
</p>
<p>December 2011, 19/1 of 1 March 2012, 19/22 of 23 March 2012, S-19/1 of 1 June 2012, 
</p>
<p>20/22 of 6 July 2012 and 21/26 of 28 September 2012, and Security Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>2042 (2012) of 14 April 2012 and 2043 (2012) of 21 April 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> all resolutions of the League of Arab States relating to the situation 
</p>
<p>in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular its resolution 7595 of 6 March 2013, in which the 
</p>
<p>League reviewed the very serious situation in the Syrian Arab Republic due to the 
</p>
<p>escalating violence and killings in most of the Syrian territory, and the continuation of 
</p>
<p>grave violations of human rights by the Syrian regime using heavy weapons, warplanes and 
</p>
<p>Scud missiles to bomb neighbourhoods and populated areas, which has seriously increased 
</p>
<p>the number of victims, caused human displacement inside the Syrian Arab Republic and an 
</p>
<p>influx of thousands of Syrians to the neighbouring countries fleeing  violence, which targets 
</p>
<p>even children and women who have been subjected to frightful massacres, threatening thus 
</p>
<p>to lead to the collapse the Syrian State, and endangers the security, peace and stability of the 
</p>
<p>region, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the outcome on the Syrian Arab Republic of the twelfth session of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Summit Conference, held in Cairo from 2 to7 February 2013, where the 
</p>
<p>Organization of Islamic Cooperation strongly condemned the ongoing bloodshed in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, underlined the primary responsibility of the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic for the continued violence and destruction of property, and expressed 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>grave concern over the deteriorating situation, the increasing frequency of killings, which 
</p>
<p>claim the lives of thousands of unarmed civilians, and the perpetration of massacres in 
</p>
<p>towns and villages by the Syrian authorities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> all meetings of the Group of Friends of the Syrian People, in 
</p>
<p>particular the fourth Ministerial Meeting held in Marrakech on 12 December 2012, where 
</p>
<p>the participants acknowledged the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and 
</p>
<p>Opposition Forces as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>deep concern</i> at the growing number of refugees and internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons fleeing the violence, and welcoming the efforts by neighbouring countries to host 
</p>
<p>Syrian refugees while acknowledging the socioeconomic consequences of the presence of 
</p>
<p>large-scale refugee populations in these countries, and also welcoming the valuable 
</p>
<p>contribution of other countries in facing this humanitarian challenge, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly</i> <i>condemning</i> the shelling as well as the shooting by the Syrian armed forces 
</p>
<p>into neighbouring countries, which led to casualties and injuries of the civilians of those 
</p>
<p>countries as well as of Syrian refugees, and underlining that such incidents violated 
</p>
<p>international law and highlighted the grave impact of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>on the security of its neighbours and on regional peace and stability, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its support for the mission of the Joint Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the League of Arab States, Lakhdar Brahimi, and expressing its full 
</p>
<p>support for his efforts towards the peaceful transition to a pluralistic, democratic civil State 
</p>
<p>with equality in citizenship and freedoms and full respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights before the Human Rights Council and the Security Council, and by the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes against humanity are likely to 
</p>
<p>have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and noting the repeated encouragement 
</p>
<p>by the High Commissioner to the Security Council to refer the situation to the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the independent international commission of inquiry 
</p>
<p>on the Syrian Arab Republic submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>21/26;1 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Deeply</i> <i>regrets</i> the lack of cooperation of the Government of the Syrian Arab

</p>
<p>members of the commission to the Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>

</p>
<p>comes from, including terrorist acts and sectarian violence; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Strongly</i> <i>condemns</i> the continued widespread and systematic gross violations 
</p>
<p>of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities and the government-

</p>
<p>missiles, the use of heavy weapons and force against civilians, unlawful killings, 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrest and detentions, massacres, enforced 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>disappearances, widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, the use of 
</p>
<p>torture and other forms of ill-treatment, sexual violence against women, men and children, 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardment on civilian gatherings, and mass killings, as 
</p>
<p>well as any human rights abuses by armed opposition groups, while noting that abuses 
</p>
<p>committed by anti-Government armed groups did not reach the intensity and scale of the 
</p>
<p>violations committed by government forces and its affiliated militia; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> all massacres taking place in the Syrian 
</p>

</p>
<p>personnel and United Nations and associated personnel; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Notes</i> <i>with grave concern</i> that violations of the rights of the child are being 
</p>
<p>committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict, to 
</p>
<p>which the Syrian Arab Republic is a party, and urgently calls for refraining from recruiting 
</p>
<p>and involving children in the conduct of hostility; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Condemns</i> the widespread sexual violence committed against women, men 
</p>
<p>and especially children, which constitutes an attack against human dignity, and underlines 
</p>
<p>that perpetrators must be held accountable; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Expresses</i> <i>deep</i> <i>concern</i> at the ongoing destruction of the diverse cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage of the Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all parties to put an end to all forms of violence; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Also</i> <i>calls</i> <i>upon</i> all parties to respect fully international law applicable to the

</p>
<p>and peace processes; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Urges</i> the Syrian authorities to release immediately all persons arbitrarily

</p>
<p>comply with applicable international law, and to allow immediately access of independent 
</p>
<p>monitors to all detention facilities; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> upon the Syrian authorities to meet its responsibility to 
</p>
<p>protect the Syrian population; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Stresses</i> the imperative need to follow up on the report of the commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry and to conduct an international, transparent, independent and prompt investigation 
</p>
<p>into all abuses and all violations of international law, with a view to hold to account those 
</p>
<p>responsible for violations and abuses, including those that may amount to crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity and war crimes; </p>

</p>
<p>provided by international law, the process and mechanisms to achieve reconciliation, truth 
</p>
<p>and accountability for gross violations, as well as reparations and effective remedies for 
</p>
<p>victims; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Stresses</i> its support for the aspirations of the Syrian people for a peaceful, 
</p>
<p>democratic and pluralistic society, in which there is no room for sectarianism or

</p>
<p>since March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including massacres, to establish the facts 
</p>
<p>and circumstances that may amount to such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and,
