Million </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Vancouver, August 12, 2016 &#150; </B>B2Gold Corp.
(&#147;<B>B2Gold</B>&#148; or the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;) (TSX: BTO, NYSE 
MKT: BTG, NSX: B2G)
announces that it has entered into an equity distribution agreement dated August

&#147;<B>HSBC</B>&#148;, and together with Canaccord, the 
&#147;<B>Agents</B>&#148;). Under the
Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company will be entitled, at its discretion
and from time-to-time during the term of the Equity Distribution Agreement, to
sell, through the Agents, such number of common shares of the Company (the
&#147;<B>Common Shares</B>&#148;) having an aggregate gross offering price of up
to
US$100,000,000 (the &#147;<B>Offering</B>&#148;). Sales of Common Shares will be
made
through &#147;at the market distributions&#148; as defined in National 
Instrument 44-102,

Shares in
the United States or Canada. The Common Shares will be distributed either (i) at
the market prices prevailing at the time of the sale; or (ii) at prices to be
negotiated with purchasers. As a result, prices may vary as between purchasers
and during the period of distribution. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company has filed a prospectus supplement dated August 11,
2016 to the Company&#146;s existing U.S. shelf registration statement on Form F-

11, 2016.
The Canadian prospectus supplement (together with the Base Shelf Prospectus) is
available on the SEDAR website maintained by the Canadian Securities
Administrators at www.sedar.com. The U.S. prospectus supplement (together with
the related U.S. base shelf prospectus and the Registration Statement) is
available on the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Agents 
will
send the Canadian or U.S. prospectus supplement (together with the applicable

<P align=justify>The TSX has conditionally approved the listing of the Common
Shares offered hereunder, subject to the Company fulfilling all of the listing
requirements of the TSX. The NYSE MKT has approved the listing of the Common
Shares offered hereunder. </P>
<P align=justify>To the extent certain insiders of the Company, including
existing shareholders holding 10% or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding 
Common
Shares, purchase Common Shares under the Offering, such purchases would
constitute a &#147;related party transaction&#148; under Multilateral Instrument
61-101 &#150;
<I>Protection of Minority Shareholders in Special Transactions</I>(&#147;<B>MI 
61-101</B>&#148;). Although the extent of any such purchases is not known
at this time, the potential participation by insiders in the Offering would be
exempt from the requirements to obtain a formal valuation report and minority
shareholder approval under Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101 as the
fair market value of the entire Offering represents less than 25% of the
Company&#146;s market capitalization. </P>
<P align=justify>This news release shall not in any circumstances constitute an
offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale
of these securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the
applicable securities laws of any such jurisdiction.</P>
<P align=justify>The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a
prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates.
Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement
and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete
information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for
free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the
issuer, any Agent or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to
send you the prospectus if you request them by calling toll-free 877-429-7459 or
by sending an email to ecm@canaccordgenuity.com or

<P align=justify><B>About B2Gold Corp. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp. is one of the
fastest-growing intermediate gold producers in the world. Since its inception in
2007, B2Gold has evolved into an international gold mining company, with four
operating mines, one mine under construction and numerous exploration projects
across four continents in various countries, including Nicaragua, the
Philippines, Namibia, Mali and Burkina Faso. Construction of B2Gold&#146;s 
Fekola
mine in southwest Mali is on schedule and on budget, and is projected to
commence production at the end of 2017. As a result, B2Gold is well positioned
to maintain its low-cost structure and growth profile. </P>
<P align=justify>Based on current assumptions and updates to the Company&#146;s
long-term mine plans, the Company is projecting gold production in 2016 of
between 510,000 to 550,000 ounces; 540,000 to 580,000 ounces in 2017; and
significantly increasing to between 900,000 to 950,000 ounces in 2018, with the
planned first full year of production from the Fekola Project. </P>
