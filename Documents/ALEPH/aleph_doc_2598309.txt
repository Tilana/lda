 Significant progress to address previously announced cash shortfall:
o A 10% reduction and deferral in wage rates accepted by employees,
o South Australian Government concessions, and
o Secured $4.0 million working capital loan provided by South Australian Government.
 No change to full year guidance for production and costs.
Half year financial performance
 A net loss after tax of $102.7 million which includes impairment charges of $67.1 million after tax for
Kanmantoo and a $19.2 million write down of deferred tax asset, with an underlying loss after tax of
$16.4 million.
 Underlying EBITDA of $19.5m was up $7.0 million from the corresponding half year
 C1 cost for the half of USD1.39/lb, driven by the high proportion of capitalised pre-strip.

HILLGROVE RESOURCES LIMITED
Hillgrove Resources Limited (ASX:HGO) announces revenue generated in the six months to 30 June
2016 from the sale of copper concentrate of $58.8 million, a decrease of $13.2 million from the
comparative period revenue of $72.0 million. The revenue was generated at an average realised price of
$6,731 per tonne (30 June 2015: $7,380 per tonne).
A net loss after tax of $102.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is reported (30 June 2015:
loss $44.9 million). The underlying loss after tax was $16.4 million with non-underlying items comprising
a Kanmantoo asset impairment write down of $67.1 million and derecognition of deferred tax asset of
$19.2 million.
Underlying EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was $19.5 million, a $7.0 million increase
from the comparative period (30 June 2015: $12.5 million).

During the period, 30,369t of dry copper concentrate containing 6,756t copper was produced (30 June
2015: 39,896t of dry copper concentrate containing 9,151t copper). The continuing weaker copper price
has resulted in an impairment of Kanmantoo operations by $67.1 million, which has reduced its carrying
value to $61.4 million.
Outlook
The most critical issue confronting the company this year has been to ensure there is adequate liquidity
in place for the Kanmantoo mine site to sustain operations and unlock shareholder value through to
2020. As can be clearly seen in the Events Subsequent to the Balance Date, there has been significant
progress on a broad range of fronts. These are the preliminary outcomes from strategies to simplify
funding arrangements, better define the quantum and timing of any shortfall, defer expenditure, reduce
costs, achieve production targets and maintain support of business partners which will allow Hillgrove to
achieve its objectives.
With the balance sheet now lightly geared, restrictions on access to cash now removed, and significant
progress having been made in reducing the creditor position since the start of 2016, the Board is
confident that the company is now in a sound position to raise any capital required to fund operations for
the remaining mine life.
Having reviewed the performance to date and taking into account all material to hand, the Directors
have left the annual guidance range unchanged for both production and costs.

The Directors present their report on the consolidated entity consisting of Hillgrove Resources Limited
(“Hillgrove” or the “Company”) and its controlled entities (the “Group” or the “Consolidated Entity”) for the
six month period to 30 June 2016.
Directors

 Philip Baker
 Steven McClare
Principal Activities
Hillgrove is an Australian mining company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX: HGO)
focused on copper production from its Kanmantoo Copper Mine in South Australia and developing value
from its exploration tenements in Australia.
Kanmantoo Copper Mine
The Kanmantoo Copper Mine in South Australia is located 55 kilometres from Adelaide. A main highway
passes close to the project and being approximately 90 kilometres by road to Port Adelaide enables the
trucking of copper concentrate to the port. The mine site is connected to the electricity grid and has
process water supplied by the District Council of Mount Barker’s treated waste water program with
additional water capacity from the Murray River which provides 100% redundancy if required. Hillgrove’s
direct workforce is approximately 190 employees, along with some 55 specialised mining contractors for
equipment supply and maintenance, blast hole drilling and explosives supply.
The Kanmantoo Copper Mine is an open-cut operation with a Mineral Resource of 35.2 million tonnes
(10.6Mt Measured, 10.9Mt Indicated, 13.7Mt Inferred) grading 0.6% copper and 0.1g/t gold (based on the
most recent Mineral Resource Estimate refer About Hillgrove at end of report). Following construction of
the plant
in late 2011, capital enhancements and continuous improvements have increased plant
throughput capacity from a nominal 2.4Mtpa to between 3.0Mtpa and 3.5Mtpa capable of producing up to
90,000 dry metric tonnes of copper concentrate per annum, containing approximately 20,000tpa copper
and associated gold and silver over the current life of mine. Sales of copper concentrate are made to
Freepoint Metals and Concentrates LLC under a 100% copper concentrate offtake agreement.
Operating and Financial Review
By the end of the half year to 30 June 2016, the 12 month Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR)
was 15.0 (30 June 2015: 19.2) after reaching a lowest point of 11.0 during May 2016. The company has
made considerable progress towards the implementation of its integrated risk management system.

Operations – Mining
ACN 004 297 116
Mining continued in the Giant cutback, focussing on the development of the ore bearing benches in the
southern end of the pit and waste stripping on the Western wall. All mining activity is now in primary
sulphide material, and no further oxide/transitional material is scheduled to be mined or processed. For the
twelve months to 30 June 2016 the stripping ratio was 5.4 tonnes of waste for every tonne of ore, with the
remaining three stages of the Giant Pit being;
 Remainder 2016 – relatively high strip ratio of 4.3:1


FY2017 – reduced strip ratio of 2.6:1 improves cash generation
FY2018 and beyond – very low strip ratio 1.2:1 and reduced mining costs can drive strong cash flow
Since the February update of the Mineral Resource Estimate, the areas mined during 2016 returned more
ore tonnes at higher grade than predicted in this estimate. The first quarter of 2016 reconciled positively by
13%, and the second quarter has lifted the outperformance to 16% for the half year. Backfilling of the
Nugent pit has provided a short haul option for the waste, and this cost efficiency has assisted in managing
cash flow constraints during the half year.
Total material moved for the half year to 30 June 2016 was 8,104kt (30 June 2015: 10,935kt), and total ore
mined was 1,260kt (30 June 2015: 2,039kt). The decrease in mining movements over the last half year
has been a result of a number of factors, including confined mining areas, prioritizing ore bearing zones,
one of the wettest winters recorded in Adelaide and managing cash constraints following a lender impasse
restricting access to hedge proceeds during a period of lower spot copper prices.
Operations – Processing
Mill throughput for the half year to 30 June 2016 was 1,624kt at 0.55% copper head grade (30 June 2015:
2,000kt at 0.53% Cu). This included processing 142kt of oxide and transitional material through the CPS
circuit. This was the final parcel of this stockpiled ore and as anticipated, it was the most difficult to treat
yielding 282 tonnes of copper in concentrate at a recovery of 32.2%. The copper recovery from primary
sulphide ore processed during the half remained in line with expectations at 91% with the tailings grade
also in line with plan.
Total production for the half to 30 June 2016 was 30,369dmt of concentrate containing 6,756 tonnes of
copper metal (30 June 2015: 9,151 tonnes copper metal).
Of particular note during the first half of 2016 was the elevated level of gold produced as a by-product from
the ore mined from areas near the old Spitfire pit. Total gold produced was 7,015 ounces (30 June 2015:
2,756 ounces) which was the equivalent of over 1,600 copper metal tonnes in value.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Operating and Financial Review (continued)
ACN 004 297 116
Despite the lower copper production in 2016, the C1 unit cost for the half year to 30 June 2016 decreased
to US$1.39 per lb copper produced (A$1.89 per lb) which compares to the half year to 30 June 2015 C1
unit cost of US$2.12 per lb ($2.71 per lb). Mining costs have decreased with shorter hauls and the credit
for costs temporarily deferred to the balance sheet has increased reflecting the stripping activity in the
upper levels of the Giant cutback. The value of by-product credits increased from US$0.20 per lb in 2015
to US$0.54 per lb due to the extra gold produced in 2016.
Hillgrove has a 100% life of mine offtake agreement with Freepoint Metals and Concentrates LLC
(“Freepoint”). Copper concentrate is trucked from the mine site to Port Adelaide, and is then sold on a CIF
basis (cost, insurance, freight) to Freepoint. In the half year to 30 June 2016, three shipments totalling
31,493wmt of copper concentrate were loaded, all of which went to smelters in China.
Commodity Price Hedging
At the commencement of 2016 Hillgrove had 16,476 tonnes of copper hedging at an average price of
A$7,758 per tonne ($3.52/lb). Hedge contracts closed out in the half year to 30 June 2016 totalled 4,477
tonnes and hedge gains added over $6.7 million to sales revenue making up considerably for the lower
prevailing copper prices during 2016.
Post balance date the hedge contracts remaining as at 30 June 2016 have been closed out – refer Events
Subsequent to Balance Date.
Environment and Community
Hillgrove continues to actively engage with local communities and landowners around the Kanmantoo
mine, along with key groups in the immediate regional centres. The Kanmantoo Callington Community
Consultative Committee (KCCCC), being the local communities’ primary interaction with the mine, held two
formal meetings during the half year.
In recognition of the approach taken with community and social
responsibilities, Hillgrove and the KCCCC were winners of the South Australian Premier’s Award for
excellence in supporting communities.
Hillgrove continues to progressively rehabilitate the Mining Lease and improve its areas containing off-set
rehabilitation. The encapsulation of mine waste and the store and release cover have been placed on
southern slopes of the Tailings Storage facility (TSF) awaiting revegetation in the second half of 2016. The
backfilling of the Nugent pit to ground level is complete and re-construction of McFarlane Hill on its surface
is continuing, this landform will also be available for revegetation in the second half of 2016.
Funding
During March 2016 and based on the then current production, Hillgrove determined that the life of mine
plan (“LOM plan”), which required intensified mining on a smaller footprint, was too aggressive and that as
a consequence of these operational issues, the Group revised its LOM plan.
The revised LOM plan indicated that there were cash flow funding gaps over the ensuring 15 month period.
As a consequence, Hillgrove, with the approval of its financiers, undertook a number of initiatives aimed at
reducing costs and improving future cash flows. By June 2016 significant progress had been made
towards addressing the predicted cash shortfall including;
 A 10% reduction and deferral in wages to December 2017 was accepted by employees
 Agreements reached with key suppliers to reduce rates and extend payment terms
 A secured working capital loan of $4 million was provided by the South Australian Government
Post balance date further funding initiatives resulting from a debt restructure and the sale of containers
were announced - refer Events Subsequent to Balance Date.

Exploration
ACN 004 297 116
Hillgrove has exploration tenements adjacent to the Kanmantoo Copper Mine which are the subject of an
exploration program to extend the mine life.
following a thorough management review of
In February 2016,
the resource model, a new Mineral
Resource Estimate for Kanmantoo copper mine was released which contained an additional 11,080 tonnes
of copper compared to the 2013 resource model. The next stage of mine life extension involves an
exploration programme which is planned to commence in earnest during 2017 when cash flows improve
with the lower strip ratio and higher production from the Giant Pit. The detailed ground gravity survey
undertaken as part of the initial phase of this programme identified a target several hundred metres to the
east of the historic aeromagnetic information. This target was modelled to remove the impact of the open
pit void and the near surface interference. During 2015 a 433m long reverse circulation hole (KTRC995)
was successfully drilled to intercept the target. The results identified 28m @ 0.61% Cu, 0.14g/t Au and
2.6g/t Ag. The second phase will test both the up and down dip extent of mineralisation and also determine
the lateral extent from the Giant Pit through the areas to the North.
Post balance date a confirmatory drilling programme was carried out in the South West corner of the pit -
refer Events Subsequent to Balance Date.
In addition, Hillgrove has two exploration projects in the Indonesian archipelago, Sumba Island, where low-
sulphidation epithermal gold mineralisation within a series of large hydrothermal alteration systems has
been identified, and Bird’s Head in West Papua where copper–gold mineralisation associated with an
interpreted porphyry complex and associated extensive hydrothermal alteration system has been identified.
Hillgrove continues to maintain its ownership interests in the Indonesian assets at Bird’s Head in West
Papua and Sumba Island and has retained minimal exploration care and maintenance teams at the project
offices. The Company will continue to pursue options with third parties to realise future value from these
exploration interests.
Review of consolidated financial results
For the six months ended 30 June 2016, the net loss after tax was $102.7 million compared to a net loss of
$44.9 million in the comparative period. The loss includes an impairment charge of $67.1 million for
Kanmantoo assets and a $19.2 million write down of the deferred tax asset from carried forward tax losses.
Before these items, the underlying EBIT result was a net loss of $20.8 million compared to an underlying
net loss of $5.4 million for the corresponding period last year.
Underlying EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $19.5 million compared with $12.5 million last year but
pre-stripping and other deferred costs were $21.9 million this year (30 June 2015: $12.9 million).

Directors’ Report (continued)
Operating and Financial Review (continued)
Income Statement (continued)
ACN 004 297 116
The increase in net loss after tax by $57.8 million on the previous period, resulting in a loss of $102.7
million in the current period was primarily due to:



Impairment of non-current assets
In accordance with accounting standards and internal accounting policies, regular impairment testing is
carried out to ensure assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amount. As the recoverable
amount can vary with market conditions particularly the future estimated price of copper, impairment
testing is done at a point in time to reflect those market conditions. At 30 June 2016 the consensus
range of future copper prices had decreased significantly from the last time the recoverable amount
was estimated at 31 December 2015. After applying these lower copper prices to the recoverable
amount, a further impairment charge of $67.1 million was taken against the Company’s Kanmantoo
assets, which has reduced Kanmantoo’s carrying value to $61.4 million. Hillgrove has elected to use a
value in use methodology to estimate the recoverable amount at 30 June 2016, rather than the fair
value less cost of disposal method as the value in use methodology better aligns with Kanmantoo’s
current life of mine plan.
Income tax
During the period, the Company derecognised a portion of the deferred tax asset, totalling $19.2m. In
assessing the probable criteria for recognising deferred tax assets, the Company has used a taxable profit
forecast consistent with the cash flows used to assess the recoverable value of the Company’s non-current
assets. As a result, the current half year has a net income tax expense of $12.8 million in spite of the
underlying loss for the period and no income tax benefit was booked for impairments of assets.
Lower production
Revenue generated in the six months to 30 June 2016 from the sale of copper concentrate of $58.8
million was a decrease of $13.2 million on the comparative period (30 June 2015: $72.0 million). This
mainly reflects the lower volume of concentrate sold (31,148 dmt sold for half year June 2016 vs 39,818
dmt sold to 30 June 2015) as the current half year was almost entirely dependent on ore sourced from
restricted areas in the upper benches of the Giant Pit, supplemented by only one relatively small and
final CPS campaign. As a result payable copper metal sold was about 22% down in volume to 7,121t
from 9,151t and the average realised price achieved (including gains from forward sale contracts) was
$6,731 per tonne (30 June 2015: $7,380/t). Lower copper production was partly mitigated by higher
gold and silver by-product revenue reflecting the higher grades of precious metals contained within ore
from the Southern end of the pit. Gold produced for the six months to 30 June 2016 was 7,015 ounces
(30 June 2015: 2,756 ounces) with gold revenue of $9.9 million, up from $3.6 million in 2015.
Total cash costs of production decreased by $20.2 million on the previous corresponding half year due to a
combination of factors:
 Mining costs were $33.8 million in the six months to 30 June 2016 compared to $40.7 million for the
same period last year. The decrease in costs of 17% mainly reflects less mining activity due to
constraints from abnormally wet weather in 2016, digging rates slowed to stay within the confines of
available cash funds and reduced charges negotiated with key mining suppliers and contractors.
 A higher proportion of mining costs were deferred to the balance sheet in 2016 under the Company’s
policy of pre-strip capitalisation for areas in excess of a 10:1 waste strip ratio. This was because
mining in the current half year was concentrated in the Giant Pit cutback whereas in 2015 mining was
spread over three different areas including Nugent and Emily Star pits which had lower waste strip
ratios.


Transport and shipping costs were $1.0 million lower as there were three ships loaded in the first half of
2016 compared to four in the previous corresponding period. Treatment and refining charges were
$3.2 million lower reflecting the lower volume of concentrate sold, negotiated reduced offtake charges
and lower penalties incurred for bismuth which was at significantly lower levels in the concentrate
produced in 2016.
 Other direct costs were $3.0 million for the current half year (30 June 2015: $4.8 million). This
decrease reflects lower site administration costs from deferred environmental works and lower salary
charges following absorption of corporate positions transitioned to Adelaide as part of the closure of the
Sydney head office. Site administration costs in 2015 also included once-off legal costs relating to
settlement of the dispute with the Kanmantoo plant construction contractor.
Depreciation and amortisation increased significantly in the first half of 2016 to be $40.6 million compared
to $17.4 million for the previous corresponding period. This was caused by a change in the useful life
estimation of the Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”). Prior to January 2016, successive TSF lifts were
amortised on a life of mine basis. As from January 2016, each individual TSF lift will be amortised as it
becomes full. Owing to the fact that progressively higher TSF lifts cost less to construct due to decreasing
height increments, as well as having incurred write downs for impairment, depreciation and amortisation
charges are not expected to continue at this level in future periods.

Net cash inflows from operating activities for the six months ended 30 June 2016 were $9.5 million, which
is $2.2 million higher than the prior period cash flow of $7.3 million. Receipts from the sale of copper
concentrate reduced by $10.6 million due to lower production and spot prices. This was slightly more than
offset by a $12.8 million reduction in payments to suppliers, employees and contractors compared to the
same period last year.
Investing activities cash flow
Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to $11.8 million in the current six months compared to an
outflow of $15.1 million in the previous corresponding period. The majority of expenditure in 2016 relates
to pre-strip mining costs which will decrease going forward as the Giant cut-back approaches completion
by the end of 2016. TSF capital expenditure has naturally decreased with progressively higher lifts and
there have been few sustaining capital projects in 2016 compared to 2015.

Financing activities cash flow
ACN 004 297 116
In the six months to 30 June 2016 there were net cash inflows of $2.9 million from financing activities. This
included $4.0 million in a new secured loan received from the South Australian Government Financing
Authority. There was $1.2 million in principal and interest repayments on pre-existing loans.
In the
previous corresponding period in 2015 there were net cash inflows of $7.5 million due to capital raising via
a rights issue of net $9.3 million, proceeds from borrowings of $17.2 million reduced by repayment of $18.9
million of debt and interest.
Statement of financial position
Total equity has decreased by $107.4 million from 31 December 2015 reflecting the net underlying loss of
$16.4 million, the impairment loss of $67.1 million, the derecognition of deferred tax asset of $19.2 million
and the decrease in reserves of $4.7 million after the revaluation of the unexpired hedging position as at 30
June 2016.
Property, plant and equipment
During the six month period the carrying value of property, plant and equipment decreased by $84.2 million
to $61.4 million, which was the estimated recoverable amount. The decrease is therefore inclusive of the
impairment of the carrying value of the Kanmantoo mine by $67.1 million, a depreciation charge for the
period of $40.6 million offset by additions of $23.4 million which included the cost of capitalising material to
the TSF ($16.8 million) and expenditure on deferred waste stripping of the Giant Pit ($5.1 million).
Borrowings
As at 30 June 2016 the Company was in breach of certain undertakings made under the debt finance
facility agreements. On 3 August 2016 a notice was received from the Intercreditor Agent indicating a
review event had occurred and it was reserving its rights. As a consequence, the Pre-Export Facility
borrowing of US$13.65 million was re-classified as a current borrowing on the statement of financial
position in accordance with AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements which requires the non-current
portion of a debt to be re-classified as a current liability until the breach can be remedied. New items in
borrowings are the $4.0 million loan from the South Australian Government Financing Authority and a $2.5
million promissory note formed out of a pre-existing creditor’s balance.
Post balance date the US$13.65 million Pre-Export Facility has been paid out in full – refer Events
Subsequent to Balance Date.
Events subsequent to balance date
The Company announced on 28 June 2016 it had reached agreement in principle with its financiers and the
South Australian Government to restructure its debt, subject to documentation, as follows:


The bank guarantee issued by Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) which provides coverage of
the
Company’s obligations under the Mining Act 1971 was to be released and the Company’s obligations
secured directly to the South Australian Government on a first ranking basis;
 Hedging positions (Australian Dollar copper swaps) were to be closed out;

The Company would use the hedge close out proceeds and part of the restricted cash (A$6.1 million) to
repay the senior debt of US$13.65 million owed to Ventures Australia LLC; and
The South Australian Government Finance Authority would provide the Company with a $4.0 million
medium term secured loan facility [the $4.0 million loan was received on 28 June 2016].

On 10 August 2016 the Company announced the hedge book had been closed out raising proceeds of
$16.5 million and formal documentation had been executed with the Company’s financiers under which the
debt restructure could be implemented and the $1.6 million performance bond issued by MBL to South
Australian electricity infrastructure supplier Electranet would remain in place. The Company would be
required to cash back 50% of the Electranet bond in December 2016 and the remaining 50% in March
2017, or earlier in the event the Company raises new debt.
On 22 August the Company announced the sale and leaseback of its 450 containers to Flinders Logistics

Outlook
The most critical issue confronting the company this year has been to ensure there is adequate liquidity in
place for the Kanmantoo mine site to sustain operations and unlock shareholder value through to 2020. As
can be clearly seen in the note above on events subsequent to the balance date, there has been significant
progress on a broad range of fronts. These are the preliminary outcomes from strategies to simplify funding
arrangements, better define the quantum and timing of any shortfall, defer expenditure, reduce costs,
achieve production targets and maintain support of business partners which will allow Hillgrove to achieve
its objectives.
With the balance sheet now lightly geared, restrictions on access to cash now removed, and significant
progress having been made in reducing the creditor position since the start of 2016, the Board is confident
that the company is now in a sound position to raise any capital required to fund operations for the
remaining mine life.
The recent closure of the hedge book increases the company’s exposure to movements in the copper price
and the Australian dollar exchange rate. However, the cash costs of copper production at Kanmantoo are
projected to fall significantly by [the second half of next year] with completion of the cut-back and access to
deeper, higher grade primary ore. Cash outlays remain relatively high whilst the cut-back continues and
access to ore is restricted. There are three key areas of focus at the mine which collectively affect cash
generation:
1. Stripping ratio (ore:waste tonnage ratio),
2. Grade per tonne, and
3. Mining rate.

ACN 004 297 116
For the twelve months to 30 June 2016 the stripping ratio was 5.4:1 but the remaining three stages of the
Giant Pit are progressively lower as follows;

Grade per tonne increases considerably at depth, as the orebody is opened up.
In addition, the recent
drilling programme targeted a near-immediately accessible area of the pit to determine whether this area
can be upgraded from the existing inferred resource category to become a viable ore source. The initial
visual and early assay results, in combination with the last six months production outperforming the MRE,
are encouraging but these results are yet to be assessed, validated and factored into the life of mine plan
and near term outlook.
The mining rate this calendar year has been constrained by both footprint and restrictions on cash
expenditure. The significant restrictions within the Giant Pit associated with extracting ore around existing
pits, which required numerous inefficient single lane ramps, are now being removed and multiple working
areas will be added over the next six months. The initiatives both implemented and underway are aimed at
removing any financial impediments to achieving the mine plan and once again increasing efficiency.
Having reviewed the performance to date and taking into account all material to hand, the Directors have
left the annual guidance range unchanged for both production and costs.
Rounding of amounts
The Company is of a kind referred to in Class Order 98/100 issued by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission, relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the financial report. Amounts in the
financial report have been rounded in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest thousand dollars.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the half year ended 30 June 2016
1. Basis of preparation
ACN 004 297 116
This condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half year reporting period ended 30 June 2016
has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the
Corporations Act 2001.
This condensed consolidated interim financial report does not include all the notes of the type normally
included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual
report for the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by Hillgrove Resources
Limited during the interim reporting period in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the
Corporations Act 2001.
a. Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the
Group will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. At 30
June 2016, the Group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $23.7 million (31 December 2015:
$13.5 million).
In March 2016, Hillgrove determined that the life of mine plan (“LOM plan”), which required intensified
mining on a smaller footprint, was too aggressive and that as a consequence of these operational issues,
the Group revised its LOM plan. The revised LOM plan indicated that there were cash flow shortfalls
forecast over the 15 month period to June 2017, particularly in the last quarter of the 2016 financial year,
which could not be bridged without additional debt and/or equity funding, higher revenue and additional cost
savings initiatives.
During the second quarter of 2016 Hillgrove made significant progress to address these cash flow shortfalls,
including:
 Employees accepting a 10% reduction and deferral in wage rates until December 2017,
 Obtaining South Australian Government concessions, and
 Securing $4.0 million working capital loan provided by the South Australian Government.
On 22 August 2016 the Company announced a sale and leaseback of $2.5 million of sea containers to
Flinders Logistics and will realise the benefit through increased liquidity and future cost reductions.
On 25 August 2016 the Company confirmed the debt restructure it had reached with its financiers and the
South Australian Government had been completed which includes:


The Macquarie bank guarantee has been released and the Company’s obligations are now secured
directly by the South Australian Government on a first ranking basis;
 Hedge contracts (Australian Dollar copper swaps) have been closed out,


The senior debt of US$13.65 million owed to Ventures Australia LLC Company has been repaid,
The $1.6 million performance bond issued by MBL to Electranet will remain in place and the
Company will need to cash back 50% of the bond in December 2016 and the remaining 50% in
March 2017 or earlier in the event the Company raises new debt, and
Favourable offtake terms have been successfully negotiated, namely anticipated price participation
charges to be paid by the Company were deferred until 2018, and the precious metals royalty
reduced by 65%.
19.
Hillgrove Resources Limited
and its Controlled Entities
As a result of these initiatives Hillgrove has:
ACN 004 297 116
 Repaid all senior debt on its balance sheet and this has been replaced with the South Australian
Government loan of $4 million,
 Removed all of the loan covenants including access to restricted cash,
 Removed the obligation to maintain a cash backed security for the $9.18 million bond in 2017/2018,

 Deferred expected price participation payments of approximately $5.8 million under the offtake
Increased its liquidity through access to the restricted cash and container sale proceeds,
agreement until 2018, and
 Reduced its operating cost structure into the future.
The Directors believe the impact of these initiatives has improved Hillgrove’s financial position.
In addition, there has been a 17% positive reconciliation of the ore produced from the South West corner of
the pit for the first six months of 2016 and this area will provide the primary feed for the next nine months.
The recent Reverse Circulation drilling programme results need to be assessed to determine the planning
model impact in the near term, and the cash flow benefit of any future positive reconciliation has not been
included in current cash flow forecasts.
The Directors remain confident that significant value remains in the project. Based on Hillgrove’s improved
financial position, it is now in a better position to raise the funding that is required in order to finance the
Company for the remainder of the mine life and be able to continue as a going concern and, in doing so be
able to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Notwithstanding the initiatives referred to above, in order for the consolidated entity to continue as a going
concern, the consolidated entity must achieve the following:
the total
 Achieve the continuing financial support of the Company’s largest mining contractors (representing
approximately 70% of
trade creditors balance), and in respect of which outstanding
balances are outside normal payment terms, through reaching agreement which will have a positive
effect on the Group’s cash flow
 Negotiating additional debt and equity funding of $15 million with a view to realising at least $5
million by mid-October 2016, $5 million by the end of November 2016 and the balance of $5 million
by the end of February 2017.
 At the date of signing this report, the Group has a large number of trade creditors (excluding the
largest mining contractors) with balances outstanding which are outside normal payment terms.
The continued support of these trade creditors in managing the Group’s cash balance throughout
2016 is required.
If the consolidated entity is unable to achieve the outcomes noted above then there is material uncertainty
that may cast significant doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and
therefore the consolidated entity may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the
normal course of business.
The financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the
Group be unable to continue as a going concern.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the half year ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
b. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Recoverability of property, plant and equipment
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is assessed for impairment whenever there is an
indicator that the asset may be impaired. As the carrying amount of the net assets of the Company is
greater than its market capitalisation and the copper price continued to fall during the period, management
has determined that
impairment. Determining whether property, plant and
equipment is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable value of the cash generating unit (“CGU”)
to which property, plant and equipment has been allocated. Impairment is recognised when the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
these are indicators of
In its impairment assessment, the Company determined the recoverable amount based on a Value in Use
(“VIU”) calculation. The VIU assessment was undertaken using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash
flow projections are based on the CGU’s life of mine plan.
In assessing the VIU, the estimated future post-
tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects the current
market assessment of the time value of money and business risk. Certain key assumptions are used for
CGU impairment testing and these are disclosed in Note 5.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
At 30 June 2016, the Group has recognised a net deferred tax benefit of $4.9 million in respect of unused
tax losses and research and development tax credits. Based on the most recent life of mine plan, an
impairment write down was necessary to reduce the value of the recognised tax assets to the amount
considered probable to be utilised through generation of future taxable income.
Tailings Storage Facility amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation requires estimates to be made of the useful lives of various assets including
costs capitalised in respect of the multi-stage construction of the mine site Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”).
Prior to January 2016, successive TSF lifts were amortised on a life of mine basis. Commencing 1 January
2016, each lift will be fully amortised as it becomes full of tailings. This means the unamortised value of the
TSF in the future will only be in respect of the cost of the lift being used and the next lift under construction.
This change in accounting estimate has resulted in a depreciation and amortisation charge during the
current half year of about $26 million higher than it would otherwise have been because of the wide footprint
and high cost of early lifts. Assuming no change to the current TSF design for the current approved mine
permit, the impact beyond this half year period will not be material.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are consistent with those of the
previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting periods.

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) or area of interest to which the asset belongs.
The Group’s CGU and areas of interest at 30 June 2016 are as follows:
CGU/area of Interest
Kanmantoo (CGU)
Wheal Ellen (area of interest)
Kitticoola (area of interest)
Kanmantoo regional (area of interest)
Birds Head (area of interest)
Sumba Island (area of interest)
In accordance with the Consolidated Entity’s accounting policies and processes, the Company evaluated
its Kanmantoo CGU at 30 June 2016, to determine whether there were any indications of impairment.
As reported in the Company’s 2015 Annual report, the carrying value is sensitive to the copper price and
the continued decline in copper prices during the first six months of 2016 was determined to be an indicator
of impairment, and accordingly an estimate of the recoverable amount was performed.
The projected cash flows used in recoverable amount valuations are subject
to variability in key
assumptions including, but not limited to, the forward profile and long-term view of copper and precious
metal prices; currency exchange rates; discount rates; production profiles; and operating and capital costs.
A change in one or more of the assumptions used in these estimates could result in a change in an asset’s
recoverable amount.
The last recoverable amount assessment for the Kanmantoo CGU was at 31 December 2015 based on
Bloomberg consensus prices. For the 30 June 2016 assessment the Company has used the average
market price of a deep set of analyst forecasts (refer Table below) and elected to change its recoverable
amount methodology from a fair value less costs of disposal method to a value in use method which better
aligns with its current life of mine plan.
Based on the assessment of
the Board concluded an
impairment charge of $67.1 million should be recognised as at 30 June 2016. This impairment charge was
predominantly driven by a 15% drop in the June 2015 consensus copper price for the period from 2016 –
2018, compared to the December 2015 consensus prices, which can be seen in the table below.

The AUD:USD forward curve in June 2016 (beginning at 0.744 in July 2016) as well as a real pre-tax
discount rate of 8.96% were also used. A salvage value related to the CGU’s processing plant and
associated assets of $14.9 million has been included in the recoverable value estimate and is based on
independent third party valuation.
The Company considers the above assumptions remain reasonable in a period of high volatility, but any
sustained change in market prices and rates that are materially different from the above assumptions could
result in a different set of assumptions applied to future valuations for impairment testing. By way of
example, a +/- 5% movement in the AUD copper prices will increase or decrease the Kanmantoo carrying
value by approximately $17 million.
The ultimate recoupment of costs carried forward for exploration and evaluation phases is dependent on
successful development and commercial exploitation, or sale of the respective areas.
The costs carried forward for exploration projects is shown in Note 10 and at 30 June 2016 relates entirely
to Kanmantoo regional areas of interest. The exploration projects located in Indonesia at the Birds Head
and Sumba Island areas of interest remain in care and maintenance.
In the prior period to 30 June 2015
an impairment loss of $29.9 million was recognised in respect of the recoverable value of both the Birds
Head and Sumba Island areas of interest based on the Company’s decision to focus on its Kanmantoo
operations, given no future expenditure has been budgeted to be spent on these projects, and in the
absence active third party interest.

Income Tax
During the period, the Company derecognised a portion of the deferred tax asset, totalling $19.2m. In
assessing the probable criteria for recognising deferred tax assets, the Company has used a taxable profit
forecast consistent with the cash flows used to assess the recoverable value of the Company’s non-current
assets.

Deferred mining costs represent the mining costs which are normalised for the impact of strip ratios and
copper grades over the life of specific pits. Deferred mining costs at 30 June 2016 relate to the Giant Pit
and are classified as non-current because allocation to operating costs is not expected to occur within the
next 12 months.

As at 30 June 2016 the Company was in breach of certain financial undertakings in respect of the
Common Terms Deed which applied to the Pre-Export finance facility and the environmental bond guarantee.
Therefore the debt is disclosed as due and payable in less than one year from 30 June 2016. These
breaches were not waived by the financier as at the balance date, but in any case arrangements were made
subsequent to 30 June 2016 for the facility to be repaid. Post balance date the US$13.65 million Pre-Export
Facility has been paid out in full – refer Events Subsequent to Balance Date.

Changes to the Corporations Law abolished the authorised capital and par value concept in relation to
share capital from 1 July 1998. Therefore, the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised
capital and issued shares do not have a par value.
14. Financial reporting by segment
Through its ownership of the Kanmantoo copper mine, the Group has one operating segment being in the
resources industry, in Australia. The Group also has exploration tenement interests overseas, but these
tenements are fully written down, under minimal care and maintenance and therefore are considered to be
immaterial, not requiring separate segment disclosure.
Information about major customers
The Kanmantoo Copper Mine has an offtake agreement for the life of the mine with Freepoint Metals &
Concentrates LLC (formerly known as JP Morgan Metals & Concentrates LLC) for 100% of the copper
concentrate produced. This provides the Company with certainty with regard to the sale of its product,
along with reduced counterparty risk as the offtake agreement is supported by a Freepoint guarantee for the
performance of the agreement.

16. Events subsequent to balance date
Subject to documentation, the Company announced on 28 June 2016 it had reached agreement in principle
with its financiers and the South Australian Government to restructure its debt as follows:


The bank guarantee issued by Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) which provides coverage of the
Company’s obligations under the Mining Act 1971 was to be released and the Company’s
obligations secured directly to the South Australian Government on a first ranking basis;
 Hedging (Australian Dollar copper swaps) were to be closed out;

The Company would use the hedge close out proceeds and part of the restricted cash (A$6.1
million) to repay the senior debt of US$13.65 million owed to Ventures Australia LLC; and
The South Australian Government Finance Authority would provide the Company with a $4.0 million
medium term secured loan facility [the $4.0 million loan was received on 28 June 2016].
On 10 August 2016 the Company announced the hedge book had been closed out raising proceeds of
$16.5 million and formal documentation was executed with the Company’s financiers under which the debt
restructure could be implemented and the $1.6 million performance bond issued by MBL to Electranet
would remain in place. The Company would be required to cash back 50% of the Electranet bond in
December 2016 and the remaining 50% in March 2017, or earlier in the event the Company raises new
debt.
On 22 August the Company announced the sale and leaseback of its 450 containers to Flinders Logistics
allowing the Company to unlock the $2.5m value in the containers and receive the benefit through
increased liquidity and future cost reductions.
On 24 August 2016, the Company confirmed the debt restructure, with its financiers and the South
Australian Government, had been completed.
As a result of these transactions the Company has:

Increased its liquidity by $4.5 million through access to the remaining restricted cash and container
proceeds
 Repaid in full its US$13.65 million senior debt with Ventures Australia LLC,
 Eliminated the obligation to cash back the $9.18 million environmental bond in 2017/18, and
 Closed out all of its copper hedging.
