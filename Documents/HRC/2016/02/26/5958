</p>
<p>&#8727;  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on the institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 
18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance 
with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted 
by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance, which constitutes a solid foundation for the elimination of all scourges and 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the successful implementation of the Programme of Action requires 
</p>
<p>political will and adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels and 
international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the significant role played by the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action follow-up mechanisms and stressing the importance of creating the necessary synergies 
between them and of avoiding duplication and overlapping, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes and acknowledges</i> the importance and significance of the work of the 
Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent in examining the current situation and 
conditions and the extent of racism against Africans and people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> consideration of the recommendations of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action follow-up mechanisms contained in General Assembly and Council 
resolutions, 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Recommends</i> that States take measures to ensure adequate representation of people of 
African descent in the judiciary and other areas of the justice system, without prejudice to the 
principle of meritocracy, and calls upon States to identify factors that have resulted in the 
disproportionate number of arrests, sentencing and incarceration of Africans and people of 
African descent, particularly young men, and to take immediate and appropriate measures to 
eliminate those factors and to adopt crime-prevention strategies and programmes that include 
alternatives to incarceration; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes </i>the need to establish methods by which disaggregated information may 
be collected effectively on health, education, access to housing, employment, treatment in the 
criminal justice system, political participation and representation, with regard to, inter alia, 
Africans and people of African descent, and that such information provide the basis for the 
creation and monitoring of policies and practices that address any discrimination found; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also emphasizes </i>the importance of collecting disaggregated information and urges 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide support to the 
States that request it for the collection of such information; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Underscores</i> the importance that States and international and regional organizations 
ensure that existing mechanisms for complaints for discrimination are accessible to Africans and 
people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to compile a series of best practices in 
areas such as access to housing, education, health, employment and institutional and legal 
frameworks pertaining to Africans and people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Working Group on People of African Descent 
for three years with the following mandate, to meet for two sessions of five working days each in 
closed and public meetings: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To study the problems of racial discrimination faced by people of African descent

meetings with them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To propose measures to ensure full and effective access to the justice system by 
people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To submit recommendations on the design, implementation and enforcement of 
effective measures to eliminate racial profiling of people of African descent; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To make proposals on the elimination of racial discrimination against Africans and 
people of African descent in all parts of the world; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To address all the issues concerning the well-being of Africans and people of African 
descent contained in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To elaborate short-, medium- and long-term proposals for the elimination of racial 
discrimination against people of African descent, bearing in mind the need for close 
collaboration with international and development institutions and the specialized agencies of the 
United Nations system to promote the human rights of people of African descent through, 
inter alia, the following activities: 
</p>
<p>(i) Improving the human rights situation of people of African descent by devoting 
special attention to their needs through, inter alia, the preparation of specific 
programmes of action; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Designing special projects, in collaboration with people of African descent, to 
support their initiatives at the community level and to facilitate the exchange of 
information and technical know-how between these populations and experts in 
these areas; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Liaising with financial and developmental institutional and operational 
programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations, with a view to 
contribute to the development programmes intended for people of African 
descent by allocating additional investments to health systems, education, 
housing, electricity, drinking water and environmental control measures and 
promoting equal opportunities in employment, as well as other affirmative or 
</p>
<p>positive measures and strategies within the human rights framework; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to submit reports on progress in the elaboration of its 
mandate to the Council; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Urges</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take measures 
within the framework of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, including by highlighting the plight of victims and 
initiating consultations with various international sporting and other organizations, enabling 
them to contribute to the struggle against racism and racial discrimination; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests </i>States, non-governmental organizations, relevant human rights treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, special procedures and other mechanisms of the commissions, national institutions, 
international, financial and development institutions, and specialized agencies, programmes and 
funds of the United Nations to collaborate with the Working Group by providing it with the 
necessary information and, where possible, reports in order to enable the Working Group to 
carry out its mandate; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Stresses</i> the need to ensure adequate financial and human resources, including 
through the regular budget of the United Nations, for the Office of the High Commissioner to 
carry out its responsibilities efficiently in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Recalls</i> the establishment of a voluntary fund to provide additional resources for, 
inter alia, the participation of people of African descent, representatives of developing countries, 
especially the least developed countries, non-governmental organizations and experts, in the 
open-ended sessions of the Working Group, and invites States to contribute to that fund.
