MEMORANDUM FOR COUNSEL

I heard argument today and reserved my ruling. In the course of argument I noted that Mr Patel who was appearing for the Plaintiffs had left the Court. I raised with Ms Muir the question whether she was entitled to appear alone. I continued with the hearing and this situation will not interfere with the ruling that I will shortly issue.

I am however unable to find the authorities which govern the situation covering Ms Muirs appearance and I invite her to file with the Court and serve on Ms Punja a brief statement of the authorities. Argument was heard in Chambers and that may affect the matters.

I shall issue the ruling after that has been filed.
