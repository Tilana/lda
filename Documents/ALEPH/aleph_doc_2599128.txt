SUMMARY
www.innovexplo.com
On  May  14,  2013,  InnovExplo  Inc.  (“InnovExplo”)  was  retained  by  Mr.  Michel 
Bouchard,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo.,  MBA,  President  and CEO  of  Clifton  Star  Resources Inc. 
(“Clifton  Star”  or  “the  issuer”)  to  produce  a  Technical  Report,  an  Updated  Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  and  a  Prefeasibility  Study  for  the  Duparquet  Project  in 
accordance  with  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1.  The  updated 
Mineral Resource Estimate has been published in an earlier report titled “Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Duparquet Project (according 
to Regulation 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 
2013b). The Mineral Resource Estimate covers the Duparquet Project, defined here 
as  the  amalgamation  of  the  Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet  and  Dumico 
properties, as well as the historical Beattie mine tailings. The Duparquet Project (“the 
Project”) is located just north of the Town of Duparquet in the Province of Québec. 
 
This Technical Report (“the Report”) presents the results of the Prefeasibility Study 
(“the  PFS”)  on  the  Duparquet  Project  using  the  August  2013  updated  resource 
estimate as its basis.  
 
The  PFS  was  prepared  by  InnovExplo,  Tenova  Mining  &  Minerals–Bateman 
Engineering  Pty  Ltd  (“Tenova-Bateman”),  Roche  Ltd  Consulting  Group  (“Roche”), 
and Dreisinger Consulting Inc. (“Dreisinger Consulting”). 
 
The  Report  is  addressed  to  Clifton  Star  Resources  Inc.,  a  Canadian  mineral 
exploration  company  trading  publicly  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  in  Canada 
(TSX-V: CFO). InnovExplo is an independent mining and exploration consulting firm 
based in Val-d’Or (Québec). 
 
The  qualified  persons  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  Report  included  the 
principal  authors  Sylvie  Poirier,  Eng.  (InnovExplo),  Karine  Brousseau,  Eng. 
(InnovExplo)  and  Laurent  Roy,  Eng.  (InnovExplo),  as  well  as  David  Dreisinger, 
B.Sc.,  PhD,  P.Eng.  (Dreisinger  Consulting  Inc),  Philippe  Coté,  Eng.  (Roche  Ltd), 
David Sims P.Geo. (Roche Ltd), and Martin Magnan, Eng. M.Sc.A (Roche Ltd). 
 
The authors believe the information used to prepare the Report and to formulate its 
conclusions and recommendations is valid and appropriate considering the status of 
the Project and the purpose for which the Report is prepared. The authors, by virtue 
of  their  technical  review  of  the  Project’s  production  potential,  affirm  that  the  work 
program  and  recommendations  presented  herein  comply  with  National  Instrument 
43-101 and CIM technical standards. 
 
Property description and location 
 
The  Duparquet  Property  (“the  Property”)  is  located  just  north  of  the  Town  of 
Duparquet, partly overlapping the municipal boundary, in the Duparquet Township of 
Québec, NTS map sheet 32D/11. The coordinates for the approximate centre of the 
Project are 48º30’34”N, 79º12´34”W (UTM projection: 5374410N, 631517E, NAD 83 
Zone  17).  The  Property  covers  an  area  of  1033.6  ha,  and  consists  of  the 
amalgamation  of  two  (2)  mining  concessions  and  twenty  (20)  claims,  all  in  good 
standing. The Beattie property (MC#292) accounts for approximately 383.6 ha; the 
Donchester property (MC#384) is about 322.6 ha. The Central Duparquet property
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star
20
www.innovexplo.com
(18 claims) and the two (2) Dumico claims cover the remaining 293.4 ha and 34 ha 
respectively.  Both  the  Beattie  and  Donchester  properties  contain  past-producing 
mines. Historical underground workings and a shaft were developed at the Central 
Duparquet property but no gold was produced. The Duparquet Project is defined in 
this report as the Beattie, Donchester, Central Duparquet and Dumico properties, as 
well as the tailings pond area straddling the southwest limit of the Beattie property.  
 
Geological setting 
 
The Duparquet Property lies within the Archean Superior Province, which forms the 
core  of  the  North  American  continent  and  is  surrounded  by  provinces  of 
Paleoproterozoic  age  to  the  west,  north  and  east,  and  the  Grenville  Province  of 
Mesoproterozoic age to the southeast. A first-order feature of the Superior Province 
is  its  linear  subprovinces,  or  “terranes”  of  distinctive  lithological  and  structural 
character, accentuated by subparallel boundary faults. 
 
The Property is located within the Abitibi terrane. The Abitibi terrane hosts some of 
the richest mineral deposits of the Superior Province, including the giant Kidd Creek 
massive  sulphide  deposit  (Hannington  et  al.,  1999)  and  the  large  gold  camps  of 
Ontario and Québec (Robert and Poulsen, 1997; Poulsen et al., 2000). 
 
The  local  geological  setting  and  property  geology  is  represented  by  the  Kinojevis, 
Timiskaming,  and  Blake  River  groups.  The  Duparquet  Property  straddles  syenitic 
plutons and the Kinojevis, Duparquet and Mont-Brun formations. The Property area 
is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  two syenitic  plutons  oriented  east-west.  These 
syenitic intrusions are bounded by E-W trending major faults, which are interpreted 
as  splays  of  the  main  SE-trending  Destor-Porcupine-Manneville  Fault  Zone,  which 
clips  the  southwest  corner  of  the  Property.  According  to  Bevan  (2011),  the  “main” 
type of gold mineralization in the Duparquet deposit generally occurs within shears 
or  fracture  zones  along  or  within  the  adjacent  intrusive  syenitic  masses,  and  is 
associated with finely disseminated pyrite and minor arsenopyrite replacement. 
 
Data verification 
 
New data added to the previously compiled and verified master database comprise 
drill  holes  from  the  last  part  of  the  2012  program  and  the  first  part  of  the  2013 
program,  as  well  as  new  samples  collected  from  previously  drilled  holes  in  the 
Beattie,  Donchester  and  Central  Duparquet  areas  (Williamson  et  al.,  2013b).  The 
new data also include a series of holes drilled on the Dumico property in 2008-2009. 
 
A statistical analysis of the QA/QC data provided by Clifton Star did not highlight any 
significant analytical issues. InnovExplo is of the opinion that the sample preparation, 
analysis,  QA/QC  and  security  protocols  used  by  Clifton  Star  for  the  Duparquet 
Project follow generally accepted industry standards and that the data is valid and of 
sufficient quality to be used for mineral resource estimation. 
 
Following  the  additions,  corrections  and  modifications  made  to  the  databases, 
InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  final  diamond  drill  hole  (DDH)  and  channel 
sample database, as well as the tailings pond database, are adequate to support a 
mineral  resource  estimate  for  the  Duparquet  Project,  including  the  Beattie, 
Donchester, Central Duparquet, Dumico properties, and the Beattie Mine tailings.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
The cut-off date for the DDH and channel sample database used by InnovExplo for 
the current Mineral Resource Estimate is May 6, 2013. 
 
Mineral Resource Estimate 
 
An  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate for  the Duparquet  Project  was  prepared  in 
2013 by InnovExplo and presented in a report titled “Technical Report and Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation 
43-101 and Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 2013b). 
 
The  August  2013  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update  presented  herein  was 
performed by Kenneth Williamson, B.Sc., P.Geo. and Karine Brousseau, Eng. under 
the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo., using all available results. The main 
objective  was  to  update  the  results  of  InnovExplo’s  previous  Mineral  Resource 
Estimate  for  the  Duparquet  Project,  dated  February  28,  2013  (Williamson  et  al., 
2013a).  The  updated  estimate  includes  additional  new  and  re-sampled  drill  holes 
that were not included in the previous resource estimate. The Dumico area drill holes 
were also added to this update.  
 
An exception to the above statement is the resource estimate for the tailings pond 
component, which was not modified during the August 2013 update. The results for 
this component, also presented herein, are taken directly from InnovExplo’s earlier 
estimate of July 5, 2012 (Brousseau et al., 2012). 
 
Given the density of data, the search ellipsoid criteria, and the specific interpolation 
parameters,  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  current  In-pit  Mineral  Resource 
Estimate  can  be  classified  as  measured,  indicated  and  inferred  resources,  the 
Underground Mineral Resource Estimate can be classified as indicated and inferred 
resources  whereas  the  Tailings  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  can  be  classified  as 
measured  and  indicated  resources.  All  Mineral  Resource  Estimates  are  compliant 
with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves. The 
overall  results  of  the  current  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  are  presented  in  the 
table below.

Mineral Reserve Estimate 
 
The reserves for the detailed pit design have been calculated in accordance with the 
definitions  and  guidelines  adopted  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy 
and  Petroleum  (CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves)  in  August 
2000.  
 
The effective date of the Mineral Reserve Estimate is March 26, 2014, the date on 
which the latest processing cost estimation was concluded.  
 
The PFS is based on an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled “Technical Report 
and  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to 
Regulation 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013.  
 
The  mineral  resource  block  model  developed  by  InnovExplo  was  imported  into 
Whittle™  software  from  Dassault  Systèmes  GEOVIA  (formerly  Gemcom  Software 
International).  Design  parameters,  such  as operating  costs,  mine recovery,  dilution 
and gold price, were used to generate an optimal pit shell.  
 
InnovExplo  evaluated  dilution  and  mine  recovery  by  performing  an  analysis  of 
mineable  blocks  on  typical  cross-sections  at  the  mill  cut-off  grade.  After  a  cross-
sectional evaluation, average dilution was estimated at 10% at a grade of 0 g/t, and 
mine  recovery  was  estimated  at  95%  assuming  good  blasting  and  dilution  control 
practices.  
 
To integrate dilution in Whittle, an initial 5% dilution factor was used when performing 
reblocking and merging the original small blocks (5x5x5) into grade bands (high and
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
low).  This  feature  defines  a  maximum  number  of  parcels  per  reblock  blocks.  This 
action regroups the smaller blocks of 5x5x5 into larger parcels, by grade interval. In 
this  evaluation,  two  parcels  were  considered.  The  resulting  parcel  includes  blocks 
lower than the cut-off grade that are considered internal dilution. If the average grade 
of the parcel is higher than the cut-off grade, it is considered as ore and sent to the 
mill. This dilution was estimated at 5%. An additional 5% dilution factor was added to 
the Whittle parameters for a total dilution factor of 10%. 
 
Iterations were performed to generate a pit design that fits the selected pit shell. To 
do  so,  the  pit  design,  including  a  ramp  and  catch  bench,  is  made  in  the  selected 
pitshell.  For  the  Duparquet  Project,  the  initial  pit  wall  angle  was  too  steep  to 
accommodate the ramp. The slope angle was smoothed until a ramp could fit in the 
Whittle  pit  shell.  Numerous  iterations  were  needed  before  finding  an  adequate  pit 
wall angle.  
 
Pit slopes were set at 29° in the overburden, 45° on the north side of the pits, and 
48° on the south side of the pit. The ramp was designed on the north side of the pit 
due to the constraints imposed by the golf course and houses on the south side and 
due to the location of the mill.  
 
The  concurrent  prefeasibility  work  allowed  InnovExplo  and  Roche  Ltd  Consulting 
Group (“Roche”) to better quantify the operating costs. These costs were used for a 
final  pit  optimization  in  Whittle.  These  parameters  are  presented  in  the  following 
table.

The mining cost of $1.93/t represents the initial cost to mine the rock present at the 
surface of the open pit. An incremental hauling cost of $0.21 per kilometre of ramp 
was added, depending on pit depth. 
 
The open pit production is supplemented by 4.1 Mt of available old tailings. The old 
tailings  will  be  processed  during  the  beginning  of  the  Project  at  a  rate  of  750,000 
tonnes per year.  
 
The  global  In-pit  and  Tailings  Proven  and  Probable  Reserves  total  39,363,000 
tonnes  at  an  average grade  of  1.50 g/t (1,895,530  contained  ounces  of gold). The 
Whittle pit shell selected for this PFS generates 35,238,429 tonnes of ore, including 
dilution  and  losses.  Another  4,124,600  tonnes  from  the  old  tailings  completes  the 
resources  for  a  total  of  39,363,029  tonnes  of  ore  from  which  0.5%  is  Proven 
Reserves  and  99.5%  is  Probable  Reserve.  A  cut-off  grade  of  0.45  g/t  has  been 
considered  for  the  tailings  material  and  0.51  for  the  pit.  The  Mineral  Reserve 
Estimate for the Duparquet Project is presented in the following table.

Mining 
 
Mining of the Duparquet deposit has been designed as an open pit with a planned 
production of 3,650,000 tonnes per year (3.65M tpy) or 10,000 tonnes per day (tpd), 
365 days per year of mill operation and 360 working days operation for the pit. The 
open  pit  production  is  supplemented  by  4.1  Mt  of  available  old  tailings.  The  old 
tailings  will  be  processed  during  the  beginning  of  the  Project  at  a  rate  of  750,000 
tonnes per year.  
 
The  Duparquet  Project  pit  optimization  for  the  present  PFS  generates  35,238,429 
tonnes of ore. Another 4,124,600 tonnes from the old tailings complete the resource 
for a total of 39,363,029 tonnes of ore. The pit also generates 291,213,881 tonnes of 
waste and 23,398,085 tonnes of overburden resulting in an LOM strip ratio of 8.26 to 
1. Taking into account the overburden, the LOM strip ratio is 8.92 to 1.

The estimated LOM average grade is 1.50 g/t including the ore from the pit and the 
old tailings. A total of 1,682,968 ounces of gold would be recovered over the mine 
life. An average of 173,000 ounces per year would be recovered for the first 5 years, 
and an average of 158,000 ounces per year over the 11 years of production studied. 
A  stockpile  will  be  used  to  vary  the  cut-off  grade  in  order  to  optimize  project 
economics.  The  ore,  waste  and  tailings  production  plan  is  presented  in  the  table 
below on a yearly basis.  
 
The Duparquet Pit life of mine (LOM) was based on supplying the mill with 3,650,000 
tonnes of ore per year. Initially, 4.1 Mt of tailings would be reserved to supplement 
the mill when necessary, but it was later decided to process the tailings at a rate of 
750,000  tonnes  per  year  right  from  the  start  in  order  to  clean  the  tailings  area  to 
make room for the waste stockpile.  
 
The  Duparquet  Pit  LOM  will  be  spread  over  11  years,  preceded  by  a  4-year  pre-
production period. This schedule will yield a yearly production of 3,650,000 tonnes.

For  the  Project,  three  (3)  6030FS  shovels  have  been  selected,  as  well  as  one  (1) 
994H front-end loader, and it has been determined that 785D trucks will be used. A 
total of 14 trucks will be necessary during the production peak, which covers Years 2 
to 7. Sanvik recommended two types of drill for the Project: one DR540 for the pre-
shear  drilling  which  will  drill  140  mm  holes,  and  four  (4)  D55SP  drills  for  the 
production drilling which will drill 215 mm holes. 
 
A total of 339 employees will be needed for the Duparquet Project. This assumes the 
operation will run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year. 
 
The  working  schedule  for  most  yearly  compensated  employees  will  be  a  standard 
40-hour week at 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday to Friday. Some yearly 
compensated employees will be  working 12-hour shifts, equivalent to 84 hours per 
two weeks, as part of a two-week repeating schedule: the first week working 4 days 
followed by 3 days off, the second week working 3 days followed by 4 days off. The 
hourly workers will be working 12-hour shifts as part of the same two-week repeating 
schedule.  Most  activities  require  24-hour  per  day  operation,  which  is  split  into  4 
shifts. 
 
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
Bench scale and pilot plant metallurgical testwork programs have been  carried out 
for  the  Duparquet  Property  of  Clifton  Star  by  SGS  Canada  and  Outotec.  The 
preliminary metallurgical testwork was carried out in 2012 by SGS in support of the 
Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (“PEA”).  In  2013,  SGS  carried  out  further 
flotation,  pressure  oxidation,  cyanidation,  rheology,  and  environmental  testwork 
including a pilot plant for the current PFS. 
 
The testwork and pilot plant test performed in 2013 included a series of grindability 
tests  conducted  on  12  t  composite  bulk  sample  selected  by  InnovExplo.  The  pilot 
plant  sample  was  characterized  as  very  hard  with  respect  to  both  resistances  to 
impact  (Axb)  and  abrasion  breakage  (ta),  as  well  as  in  terms  of  the  Bond  rod  mill 
work index (RWI). The sample was hard with respect to the Bond ball mill work index

(BWI)  and  High-Pressure  Grinding  Rolls  (HPGR)  test,  and  was  also  found  to  be 
abrasive. 
 
Pilot  plant  flotation  tests  have  also  been  conducted  on  the  bulk  sample.  The  pilot 
plant was operated to generate a bulk sulphide flotation concentrate with 15-18% S 
for a subsequent pressure oxidation (POX) pilot plant to recover gold, as well as to 
generate  60-80  kg  of  a  higher  grade  flotation  concentrate  assaying  greater  than 
40 g/t Au for direct sale market evaluation. 
 
In  the  flotation  pilot  plant,  the  ore  was  ground  to  a  P80  of  100  µm  and  a  rougher 
concentrate was recovered with the addition of collectors. The rougher concentrate 
was reground in a ball mill, operating in closed circuit with a cyclone. Pilot plant tests 
PP-01 to PP-06 were conducted with one cleaning stage to generate the POX pilot 
plant feed. Pilot plant tests PP-07 to PP-09 were conducted with two cleaning stages 
to generate the high grade concentrate. 
 
With  one  cleaning  stage  the  recovery  of  gold  was  91.7%  in  a  concentrate  which 
assayed  26.8 g/t  Au  and  16.1%  S.  The  results  of  the  PP-09  indicated  that  a 
concentrate with 47.8 g/t Au could be produced at 86.5% gold recovery. 
 
Flotation  tailings  were  leached  with  cyanide  to  recover  the  gold  remaining  in  this 
product.  The  recovery  of  gold  from  the  PP-05  tailings  and  the  PP-09  tailing  were 
45.1% and 40.2%, respectively. 
 
The  overall  gold  recovery  by  flotation  and  cyanidation  of  the  flotation  tailings  is 
shown in the following table.

oxygen overpressure of 700 kPa, with residual sulphide levels averaging 0.13%. A 
60  minute  retention  time  appeared  sufficient  to  achieve  a  high  level  of  oxidation. 
Recycling a portion of the acidic hot cure thickener overflow allows for neutralization 
of  carbonates  present  in  the  feed  concentrate.  The  autoclave  discharge  was 
predominately  a  jarosite  product  with  little  hematite  formed.  The  POX  liquor 
contained 47 g/L free acid, 11 g/L Fe (>95% as ferric iron) and ~1 g/L As. No work 
has been carried out in the pilot plant to optimize the POX operating conditions apart 
from retention time. 
 
The hot cure was operated at 95 °C with autoclave discharge product having a total 
retention  time  of  either  4  or  5  hours  to  promote  the  conversion  of  any  basic  iron 
sulphate formed during pressure oxidation. There appeared to be little evidence of 
re-dissolution  of  basic  ferric  sulphate  in  the  hot  cure  circuit  with  the  majority  of 
conversion having taken place within the autoclave flash letdown. The re-dissolution 
that  did  occur  happened  relatively  quickly.  Overall  iron  in  solution  increased  from

~11 g/L in the autoclave discharge to ~17 g/L in the first hot cure stage and up to 
~20 g/L through the hot cure circuit. Arsenic content remained consistent throughout 
at  an  average  of  ~1.7  g/L.  Optimization  of  the  size  of  the  hot  cure  circuit  in 
conjunction  with  further  pressure  oxidation  studies  is  required.  The  cyanidation 
testwork  program  has  demonstrated  that  high  gold  and  silver  recoveries  are 
obtainable for cyanidation of pressure oxidation residues. The recovery of gold from 
the pilot plant hot cure discharge from batch testwork ranged from 94.7% to 96.5% 
with average residue assay from 0.96 g/t to 1.21 g/t Au. 
 
Lime boil tests on thickened hot cured discharged material were effective in breaking 
down jarosite and increased silver recovery from 9.2% to 95.5%, and gold recovery 
from  95.5%  to  98.1%.  Reducing  the  lime  dosage  below  75  kg/t  resulted  in  a 
reduction in gold and silver extraction, with optimum conditions appear to favour 75 
kg/t of lime. Promoting conditions favourable for hematite formation over jarosite in 
the pressure oxidation would undoubtedly reduce lime consumption in the lime boil 
step. 
 
A  rheometallurgical  testwork  of  the  flotation  tailings  flotation  concentrate,  hot  cure 
discharge and combined leached tailings that were produced as part of the pilot plant 
test  program  was  conducted.  The  preliminary  static  settling  result  indicated  that 
samples  settled  in  presence  of  20  to  36  g/t  of  non-ionic  flocculant  producing  a 
underflow between 36% w/w and 66% w/w with an overflow slightly cloudy after 60 
minutes  of  elapsed  settling  time.  An  exception  is  the  hot  cure  discharge  which 
required  92 g/t  of flocculant  and  producing  an  underflow  at  30% w/w  and  a  cloudy 
supernatant. 
 
The results of the tests conducted on cyanide flotation tailing and hot cure discharge 
showed  that  the  cyanide  was  effectively  destroyed  with  an  SO2  with  a  copper 
addition  as  copper  sulphate.  Reducing  the  copper  addition  by  half  resulted  in  an 
increase  in  the  CNT  (Total  Cyanide)  although  the  CNWAD  (Weak  Acid  Dissociable 
Cyanide) remained similar. 
 
Recovery Methods 
 
Based on the previous testwork results, two processing options were selected for the 
recovery  of  the  gold  from  the  Duparquet  Project;  the  Pressure  Oxidation  option 
(“POX option”) and the Concentrate option. While gold doré would be produced on 
site  with  the  POX  Option,  the  Concentrate  option  would  produce  a  sulphide 
concentrate product for sale.  
 
The Concentrate processing option uses a jaw crusher followed, by one 5,670 kW 
(7,200 hp) SAG Mill and of a secondary grinding stage using a 6,410 kW (8,600 hp) 
ball mills operating in a closed loop, coupled with a flotation circuit including rougher 
cells, 1st cleaner cells, 2nd cleaner cells, and a 1.119 kW (1,500 hp) regrinding ball 
mill of the rougher concentrate, as well as cyanidation of the flotation tails with CIL 
recovery of the gold. The gold will be recovered from the carbon by elution, followed 
by  electrowinning  and  doré  smelting.  The  flotation  concentrate  would  be  sold  for 
further processing. 
 
The  POX  option  uses  the  same  crushing  and  grinding  circuits  as  the  Concentrate 
option. The flotation circuit includes a: rougher flotation stage, a rougher concentrate
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
regrind stage and a cleaner flotation stage After thickening, the flotation concentrate 
will pass through the pressure oxidation circuit (POX) to be oxidized in the autoclave 
(4.1 m Ø x 21.0 m long) followed by a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit for cyanidation and 
adsorption for gold recovery. The flotation tailings will be considered as final tailings. 
In the CIP circuit, gold will be cyanide leached and adsorbed on the carbon and then 
recovered from the carbon by an elution circuit, followed by electrowinning and doré 
smelting. 
 
In  the  POX  option  the  flotation  circuit  is  operated  to  maximize  gold  recovery  to 
flotation  concentrate  instead  of  maximizing  the  gold  concentrate  grade  as  in  the 
Concentrate  option.  With  much  less  gold  being  rejected  in  the  flotation  tailings, 
cyanidation of the tailings is currently not economically feasible. 
 
The  plant  is  designed  to  operate  24 hrs/day,  365 days/yr,  and  process  3.65 Mt  of 
mineralized material (dry) annually, at a plant availability of 92%. The nominal daily 
throughput  will  be  10,000  tonnes  of dry  material. The  overall  gold  recovery  for  the 
POX option is 90.1% and 92.8% for the Concentrate option. Details are shown in the 
table below.

Infrastructure 
 
Off-Site Infrastructure 
 
Electric power will be provided by Hydro-Québec through a new 15 km long 120 kV 
power  line  which  could  be  available  in  36  months.  The  total  power  capacity  is 
established  at  50 MW  and 
to 
approximately 35 MW. 
The  Duparquet  Property  partly  overlaps  the  municipal  boundary  of  the  Town  of 
Duparquet,  located  45  km  northwest  of  Rouyn-Noranda,  Abitibi-Temiscamingue, 
Québec.  The  future  mine  site  is  easily  accessible  using  the  already  existing 
provincial highway, Route 393, and no access road other than a connection between 
the site facilities and Route 393 will be required for project development. 
 
On-Site Infrastructure 
 
Tailings Storage Facility and Water Management 
 
Two options are considered:
1.  A Concentrate option where all tailings will result from a CIL circuit; and
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star
31
www.innovexplo.com
2.  A  POX  option  where  approximately  6%  of  the  tailings  will  have  passed 
through the CIP process and 94% from the flotation tailings. The two types of 
tailings  will  require  separate  handling  and  disposal  at  the  tailings  storage 
facility.
Since  the  CIL  and  CIP  circuit  involves  cyanidation,  the  tailings  and  process  water 
resulting from these circuits will need to be stored in a lined or impermeable tailings 
cell to prevent seepage into groundwater aquifers. 
 
Concentrate option 
 
The  tailings  storage  facility  (TSF)  for  the  Concentrate  option  is  conceived  as  a 
staged construction with two separate cells: cell 1 in the southwest and cell 2 in the 
north.  Both  cells  will  be  lined.  The  tailings  dams  will  be  constructed  in  stages  to 
minimize  the  initial  capital  construction  costs.  The  TSF  was  designed  to  be 
constructed in 3 phases. 
 
POX option 
 
The  POX  option  involves  treating only  approximately  6%  of  the tailings with  a  CIP 
circuit. Since only the tailings of the CIP circuit need to be stored in a lined cell, less 
membrane  is  required  in  construction  than  the  Concentrate  option,  and  water 
management  and  treatment  is  simplified.  The  TSF  layout  is  similar  to  that  of  the 
Concentrate option, except a third smaller lined cell is added to handle tailings from 
the CIP circuit. The large northern and southwest cells are unlined in this scenario 
since the early geochemical results indicate that the tailings are not acid generating, 
nor are they treated by cyanide as was the case for the Concentrate option.  
 
The TSF is conceived as a staged construction with three separate cells: cell 1 in the 
southwest for low-risk tailings (unlined); the POX cell in the southeast for cyanidation 
of the process tailings (fully lined); cell 2 in the north for low-risk tailings (unlined). As 
was  the  case  for  the  Concentrate  option,  the  tailings  dams  will  be  constructed  in 
three stages to minimize the initial capital construction costs. 
 
The  current  conceptual  plan  is  a  centreline  dam  configuration,  predominantly 
constructed using waste rock from the open pit mining operation. 
 
Site road 
 
Site roads will be used to access the various industrial sites and services. The on-
site roads will give access to: the process plant facility and surrounding buildings; the 
open pits; the ore stockpile; the waste dumps and overburden dump; the explosives 
storage; pumping stations; and the tailings disposal area. A total of about 13 km of 
mine  roads  will  be  required.  All  roads  will  be  equipped  with  the  appropriate 
information,  regulatory  and  warning  signs.  The  work  that  will  be  performed  at  the 
industrial  and  service  sites  include:  land  clearing  and  grubbing;  topsoil  stripping; 
excavation  and  backfilling  with  appropriate  material  to  reach  the  infrastructure 
elevation; and construction of work platforms.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
Site buildings 
 
Provisions  have  been  made  for  ancillary  buildings  and  facilities,  such  as  a  mine 
equipment maintenance facility and warehouse, an administrative building, an assay 
laboratory, a water pumping station, a fuel farm and an explosives plant and storage. 
 
Power  distribution  will  be  provided  to  the  administration  building,  garage,  pump 
houses, laboratory and crushing area through 4160/600V pad mounted transformers 
with  the  proper  capacity  installed  near  each  building.  Inside  of  these  buildings, 
electricity will be distributed through 600/120/208V transformers and panels. 
 
Project Infrastructure 
 
The plan in the present study is to build an overhead polled mounted 4.16 kV power 
line  approximately  5 km  long  from  the  main  substation  to  distribute  power  to  the 
remaining site facilities and infrastructures. 
 
A 120 kV substation will be installed in close proximity to the process plant for the 
electrical distribution. A single oil-filled transformer will provide power to the process 
plant’s main electrical room. A 5 MW diesel generator will also be installed on-site to 
provide backup power to critical process equipment’s and essential services. 
 
Site telecommunication will be supported by an optical fiber network backbone with 
an IT network subsystem. A supervisory control system installed in the control room 
will allow the operator to monitor and control all the process related equipment. VoIP 
type telephones will be installed. 
 
Environment 
 
The Duparquet Project is subject to the environmental assessment provisions of the 
provincial  Environment  Quality  Act  and  the  federal  Canadian  Environmental 
Assessment Act. The requirements for each of these processes are well understood. 
The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment that is required pursuant to these 
Acts will be initiated as soon as a Project Notice and a Project Description are tabled 
with  the  provincial  and  federal  authorities,  respectively.  A  schedule  for  the 
environmental assessment and permitting has been developed. Environmental and 
social  baseline  studies  have  been  and  will  be  conducted  and  reports  either  have 
been  or  will  be  prepared.  Permitting  requirements  are  also  well-defined  and  have 
been considered in the project plan.  
A  tailings  and  water  management  strategy  has  been  defined  at  a  prefeasibility 
design  level.  A  siting  study  was  undertaken  and  an  appropriate  area  has  been 
determined  and  located  on  the  site  plan,  taking  into  account  environmental  and 
social considerations and constraints. Water in the polishing pond will be recycled to 
the mill, within the constraints of both water availability in the polishing pond, on the 
one  hand,  and  concentrator  water  demand  on  the  other.  Water  in  excess  of  mill 
requirements  will  be  released 
the  environment,  meeting  all  regulatory 
requirements. 
 
Overburden  and  waste  rock  stockpiles  have  also  been  designed  at  a  prefeasibility 
level, and locations are defined on the site plan. The identified areas do not contain
to

any  significant mineralization  and  make  use  of the  natural  topography. Discharges 
from  the  stockpiles  will  be  routed  to  a  series  of  sedimentation  ponds  to  ensure 
adequate treatment and to meet required regulatory requirements prior to release to 
the environment. 
 
A Mine Rehabilitation and Closure Plan will be prepared for the Project. The Plan will 
describe measures planned to restore the Property as close as reasonably possible 
to its former use or condition, or to an alternate use or condition that is considered 
appropriate  and  acceptable  by  Québec’s  Department  of  Energy  and  Natural 
Resources(MERN).  The  Plan  will  outline  measures  to  be  taken  for  progressive 
rehabilitation, closure rehabilitation and post-closure monitoring and treatment. It will 
also help refine the evaluation of restoration costs completed as part of this Report. 
 
Capital and Operating Cost 
 
The estimate is expressed in Canadian dollars unless specified otherwise. 
 
Capital cost 
 
The  pre-production  capital  costs  for  the  POX  option  are  estimated  at  $394M  and 
sustaining  capital  is  estimated  at  $118M.  The  capital  costs  include  various  added 
contingencies  depending  on  the  sector.  In  the  base  case  estimate,  contingencies 
and indirect costs total $98.7M of the pre-production costs and represent 26% of the 
costs.  Indirect  costs  (owner’s  costs;  engineering,  procurement  and  construction 
management  (EPCM);  and  detailed  engineering)  of  37%  have  been  applied  to  the 
process  plant  and  to  other  surface  infrastructure.  The  average  contingency  for  all 
environmental items is 20%.  
 
The total capital expenditure of $512M for the Duparquet Project is broken down into 
five  (5)  cost  components  (see  table  below):  mining;  surface  installation  and 
equipment; processing facilities; tailings storage facilities; and environmental. 
The  tailing  storage  facilities  item  in  the  table  below  includes  the  reclaim  pumping 
station and pipeline.  The remainder of the tailings dam infrastructure is included in 
the environmental pre-production and sustaining costs.

Operating Cost 
 
The  OPEX  cost  breakdown  for  the  PFS  is  divided  into  five  (5)  main  categories: 
general  and  administration 
(G&A);  processing;  mining;  environmental;  and 
overburden removal. The G&A category includes the costs of technical services and 
administration.  Open  pit  mining  costs  include  drilling,  blasting,  loading,  hauling, 
auxiliary,  and  general  mine  maintenance.  The  processing  category  includes 
manpower,  the  cost  to  process  ore  from  the  pit,  and  the  cost  to  process  the  old 
tailings. The environmental category includes manpower and departmental costs.

Pre-tax and after-tax cash flow projections were generated from the LOM schedule 
according to the capital and operating cost estimates. It was done in constant 2013 
money terms and in Canadian currency unless stated otherwise, with no allowance 
for inflation or escalation. The net cash flow has been discounted for the purposes of 
calculating  NPV.  A  base  discount  rate  of  5%  per  year  has  been  selected  as  most 
likely  to  represent  a  low  capital  expense  gold  project  in  a  mining-friendly 
environment. Future annual cash flow estimates are based on grade, gold recoveries 
and cost estimates. 
 
The  PFS  considered  two  possible  processing  scenarios.  Cash  flow  models  were 
created for both options. The POX option generated the highest financial return and, 
as a result, the POX process is favoured and used as the base case of the present 
PFS. 
 
Financial Analysis 
 
The undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $493.19M over the 11-year mine life and 
the payback period is 4.3 years. 
 
A summary of the base case cash flow model is given in the table below. LOM totals 
for undiscounted and discounted cash flows are also provided. The table shows that 
the pre-tax NPV of the project cash flow at a discount of 5% per year is evaluated at 
approximately $222M and a pre-tax internal rate of return of 15.11%. The average 
cash cost of production equates to US$775/oz gold.

•  There is a risk that Hydro-Québec might not have the capacity to supply the 
Duparquet  Project,  depending  on  other  power  consumptions.  Further  study 
and discussion should be initiated with Hydro-Québec.
•  There is a risk that the MERN will not allow Clifton Star to recover the portion 
of  the  Mineral  Resources  in  the  tailings  that  are  outside  the  Property 
boundary. If this were to happen, the authors wish to point out that this very
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 25, 2014 – Clifton Star
36
www.innovexplo.com
small portion of the total Mineral Resources would only have a minor impact 
and would not affect the potential viability of the Project.
•  There  is  a  risk  that  the  CAPEX  to  develop  the  project  will  be  higher  than 
estimate. Not all recent projects have achieved the expected cost anticipated 
to  reach  production.  To  limit  the  risk,  Clifton  Star  should  put  considerable 
effort  into  assembling  a  highly  qualified  and  experienced  team  for  project 
development.
•  The  foundations  cost  could  be  higher  or  lower  depending  on  the  results  of
•
future geotechnical studies. 
 
If  development targets  are  not  achieved  during  the  preproduction  and  early 
production  periods,  the  ramp-up  schedule  to  full  production  may  be 
compromised.
•  There  is  a  risk  that  the  Québec  Ministry  of  Transport  will  not  allow  heavy 
equipment  to  travel  across  Route  393,  or  will  require  a  larger  buffer  zone 
between the highway and the pit edges.
•  The  social  and  economic  effects  in  developing  a  by-pass  for  the  portion  of
highway 393 that passes over the mineralized zone should be investigated.
•  The risk related to metallurgical issues are that:
o  variations in mineralogy could cause fluctuations in mill recovery; 
o  grinding characteristics may differ from test results; 
o
thickening and filtration testwork may not be representative of the ore 
deposit;
•  As  with  all  mining  projects  in  the  Province  of  Québec  or,  more  largely,  in 
Eastern Canada and also elsewhere in the world, there is always a risk that 
the mining company may not be successful in obtaining a “social licence to 
operate”.  In  the  present  case  however,  the  “social  acceptability”  risk  is 
relatively  mitigated  in  part  because  the  Project  is  located  in  an  area  with  a 
long history of mining development (when compared with other regions). Still, 
for any mining project located close to urban areas, there is always a risk of 
developing a project that is not acceptable for the local, regional or provincial 
communities.
Opportunity
•  The project is located in located in the vicinity of the town of Duparquet and 
close  to  major  center  of  Rouyn-Noranda  and  La  Sarre.  Both  skilled  and 
general  workforces  are  readily  available.  Suppliers,  contractors,  consulting 
firms and competent workers are available locally.
•  The  inferred  Mineral  Resource  blocks  as  well  as  all  blocks  having  at  least 
0.01% of their volume contained within stope solids that fall within the pit limit 
have been treated as waste and have been assigned a zero grade. If these 
blocks are incorporated in the mine schedule, it should translate in a tonnage 
and grade increase.

•  The additional 47 drill holes and channel samples that were completed after 
current  resource  cut-off  date  (May  6th,  2013)  could  be  included  in  a  new 
resource calculation and thus increase the current resource.
•  Additional definition drilling could convert the current Inferred Resources into
Indicated Resource and Reserves.
•  Additional  exploration  drilling  could  expand  the  known  mineralized  zones
along strike and at depth.
•  Geotechnical drilling along the proposed pitwalls may allow steeper pitwalls
and hence reduce the waste to ore strip ratio.
•  The economic effects in developing a by-pass, for the portion of highway 393
that passes over the mineralized zone, that would permit mining a single 
larger pit, should be investigated.
•  Future mining potential of the Duparquet Project, below the current pit shell, 
by an underground bulk mining method will need to be assessed and could 
provide an extension of the mine life.
•  The  province’s  mining  industry  is  well  established.  The  hydro-electricity  is 
affordable  and  offers  competitive  advantage  for  companies  operating  in 
Quebec. Mining companies also enjoy relatively stable mining legislation.
•  The  historical  Beattie  Mine  site  surface  area  will  be  cleaned  up  and  the 
current  buildings  demolished  and  removed  prior  to  the  development  of  the 
open-pit  mining.  The  old  tailing  area  will  be  reclaimed  as  part  of  the  mine 
closure plan.
InnovExplo,  Roche  and  Dresinger  Consulting  conclude  that  this  PFS  allows  the 
Duparquet Project to advance to a feasibility study stage. InnovExplo believes that 
more advanced engineering work is necessary to support a feasibility study and to 
reduce the risk to the Duparquet Project. 
 
InnovExplo  considers  the  present  PFS  to  be  reliable  and  thorough,  and  based  on 
quality data, reasonable hypotheses and parameters compliant with NI 43-101 and 
CIM standards regarding mineral resource estimations. 
 
Recommendation 
 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  and  the  positive 
outcome  of  the  PFS,  InnovExplo,  Roche  and  Dreisinger  Consulting  recommend 
advancing the Duparquet Project to the next phase, which would consist of preparing 
a  feasibility  study.  The  recommended  work  program  is  summarized  in  the  table 
below.  The  estimated  cost  for  the  work  program  would  amount  to  approximately 
$8.8M,  and  would 
include  exploration,  definition  and  condemnation  drilling, 
metallurgical, geotechnical and hydrogeological testwork, and a final feasibility study

INTRODUCTION
On  May  14,  2013,  InnovExplo  Inc.  (“InnovExplo”)  was  retained  by  Mr.  Michel 
Bouchard,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo.,  MBA,  President  and CEO  of  Clifton  Star  Resources Inc. 
(“Clifton  Star”  or  “the  issuer”)  to  produce  a  Technical  Report,  an  Updated  Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  and  a  Prefeasibility  Study  for  the  Duparquet  Project  in 
accordance  with  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1.  The  updated 
Mineral Resource Estimate has been published in an earlier report titled “Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Duparquet Project (according 
to Regulation 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 
2013b). The Mineral Resource Estimate covers the Duparquet Project, defined here 
as  the  amalgamation  of  the  Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet  and  Dumico 
properties, as well as the historical Beattie mine tailings. The Duparquet Project (“the 
Project”) is located just north of the Town of Duparquet in the Province of Québec. 
 
This Technical Report (“the Report”) presents the results of the Prefeasibility Study 
(“the  PFS”)  on  the  Duparquet  Project  using  the  August  2013  updated  resource 
estimate as its basis.  
 
The  PFS  was  prepared  by  InnovExplo,  Tenova  Mining  &  Minerals–Bateman 
Engineering  Pty  Ltd  (“Tenova-Bateman”),  Roche  Ltd  Consulting  Group  (“Roche”), 
and Dreisinger Consulting Inc. (“Dreisinger Consulting”). 
 
The  Report  is  addressed  to  Clifton  Star  Resources  Inc.,  a  Canadian  mineral 
exploration  company  trading  publicly  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  in  Canada 
(TSX-V: CFO). InnovExplo is an independent mining and exploration consulting firm 
based in Val-d’Or (Québec). 
 
Terms of Reference 
The  issuer  requested  an  update  of  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  to  include  new 
and  re-sampled  drill  holes  and  some  additional  historical  holes.  The  Mineral 
Resource Estimate for the tailings pond has not been modified, and the results for 
this component, as presented herein, are taken directly from InnovExplo’s NI 43-101 
compliant report released July 5, 2012 (Brousseau et al., 2012).  
 
The global objectives of the PFS, as requested by the issuer, are to:
•  Determine  the  best  project  design  by  comparing  a  concentrate  production
option and a pressure oxidation (POX) option;
•  Optimize  a  mining  plan  that  takes  into  account fixed  physical  constraints  in 
order  to  minimize  any  effect  on  the  Town  of  Duparquet  or  provincial 
infrastructures;
•  Optimize the potential economic viability of exploiting the Duparquet deposit; 
•  Estimate a Mineral Reserve for the Duparquet Project; and 
•  Propose  a  strategy  and  preliminary  timetable  to  further  develop  the
Duparquet Project.
The PFS evaluates and/or provides the following items:
•  An optimized pit design and schedule;

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
Location 
The  Duparquet  Project  is  located  just  north  of  the  Town  of  Duparquet,  partly 
overlapping  the  municipal  boundary,  in  the  Duparquet  Township  of  Québec,  NTS 
map  sheet  32D/11.  The  coordinates  for  the  approximate  centre  of  the  Project  are 
48º30’34”N, 79º12´34”W (UTM projection: 5374410N, 631517E, NAD 83 Zone 17). 
Figure 4.1 is a location map of the Duparquet Project in the province of Québec.
Figure 4.1 – Location map for the Duparquet Property
The  Duparquet  Property,  as  defined  herein,  consists  of  the  amalgamation  of  four 
contiguous  properties  (from  west  to  east):  Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet 
and Dumico) (Fig. 4.2).

The Duparquet Property covers an area of 1033.6 ha. The Beattie property accounts 
for approximately 383.6 ha; the Donchester property covers about 322.6 ha; and the 
Central Duparquet property and Dumico claims account for the remaining 293.4 ha 
and  34  ha  respectively.  Both  the  Beattie  and  Donchester  properties  contain  past-
producing mines. Historical underground workings and a shaft were developed at the 
Central  Duparquet  property  but  no  gold  was  produced.  The  Duparquet  Project  is 
defined  in  this  report  as  the  Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet  and  Dumico 
properties,  as  well  as  the  tailings  pond  area  straddling  the  southwest  limit  of  the 
Beattie property. Beattie mine tailings boundaries were outlined by Fillion (2009). 
 
Mining Rights in the Province of Québec 
The following discussion on the mining rights in the province of Québec was mostly 
taken from Guzon (2012) and from an Act to amend the Mining Act (Bill 70) assented 
on December 10, 2013 (National Assembly, 2013). 
 
In  the  Province  of  Québec,  mining  is  principally  regulated  by  the  provincial 
government.  The  Department  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resources(MERN)  is  the 
provincial agency entrusted with the management of mineral substances in Québec. 
The  ownership  and  granting  of  mining  titles  for  mineral  substances  is  primarily 
governed  by  the  Mining  Act  (the  Act)  and  related  regulations.  In  Québec,  land 
surface  rights  are  distinct  property  from  mining  rights.  Rights  in  or  over  mineral 
substances  in  Québec  form  part  of  the  domain  of  the  State  (the  public  domain), 
subject to limited exceptions for privately owned mineral substances. Mining titles for 
mineral substances within the public domain are granted and managed by the MNR. 
The  grant  of  mining  rights  in  privately  owned  mineral  substances  is  a  matter  of 
private  negotiations,  although  certain  aspects  of  the  exploration  for  and  mining  of 
such  mineral  substances  are  governed  by  the  Act.  This  section  provides  a  brief 
overview  of  the  most  common  mining  rights  for  mineral  substances  within  the 
domain of the State. 
 
A  claim  is  the  only  exploration  title  for  mineral  substances  (other  than  surface 
mineral substances, petroleum, natural gas and brine) currently issued in Québec. A 
claim gives its holder the exclusive right to explore for such mineral substances on 
the  land  subject  to  the  claim  but  does  not  entitle  its  holder  to  extract  mineral 
substances,  except for  sampling  and  in  limited quantities. In  order  to  mine  mineral 
substances,  the  holder  of  a  claim  must  obtain  a  mining  lease.  The  electronic  map 
designation  is  the  most  common  method  of  acquiring  new  claims  from  the  MNR 
whereby an applicant makes an online selection of available pre-mapped claims. In 
rare territories, claims can be obtained by staking. As of December 10th 2013, claim 
holders  must  notify  the  municipality  and  the  landowner  concerned  within  60  days 
after  registering  a  claim  of  the  fact  that  they  have  obtained  the  claim,  and  must 
inform the municipality and the landowner at least 30 days before performing work. 
They  must  also  submit  an  annual  report  on  all  work  performed  to  the  Minister  of 
Natural Resources. 
 
A  claim  has  a  term  of  two  years,  which  is  renewable  for  additional  periods  of  two 
years,  subject  to  performance  of  minimum  exploration  work  on  the  claim  and 
compliance with other requirements set forth by the Act. In certain circumstances, if 
the work carried out in respect of a claim is insufficient or if no work has been carried 
out  at  all,  it  is  possible  for  the  claimholder  to  comply  with  the  minimum  work
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
49
4.3
www.innovexplo.com
obligations by using work credits for exploration work conducted on adjacent parcels 
or by making a payment in lieu of the required work. As of December 10th 2013, the 
holder of a claim where the work has not been performed will have to pay double of 
the value of the work to renew his claim. Moreover, it is no longer possible to apply 
all or a part of amounts spent to perform work in respect of a mining lease or mining 
concession against a claim to be renewed. 
 
Mining leases and mining concessions are extraction (production) mining titles which 
give their holder the exclusive right to mine mineral substances (other than surface 
mineral substances, petroleum, natural gas and brine). A mining lease is granted to 
the holder of one or several claims upon proof of the existence of indicators of the 
presence of a workable deposit on the area covered by such claims and compliance 
with other requirements prescribed by the Act. A mining lease has an initial term of 
20 years but may be renewed for three additional periods of 10 years each. Under 
certain  conditions,  a  mining  lease  may  be  renewed  beyond  the  three  statutory 
renewal periods.  
 
Mining concessions were issued prior to January 1, 1966. After that date, grants of 
mining  concessions  were  replaced  by  grants  of  mining  leases.  Although  similar  in 
certain respects to mining leases, mining concessions granted broader surface and 
mining rights and are not limited in time.  
 
As of December 10 2013, a mining lease cannot be granted until a rehabilitation and 
restoration  plan,  regarding  which  the  certificate of  authorization  required  under  the 
Environment  Quality  Act  has  been  issued,  and  a  scoping  and  market  study  as 
regards  processing  in  Québec  are  submitted  to  the  Minister.  Moreover,  when 
granting  a  lease,  the  Government  may,  on  reasonable  grounds,  require  that  the 
economic spinoffs within Québec of mining the mineral resources authorized under 
the  lease  be  maximized  and  may  require  the  lessee  to  establish  and  maintain  a 
monitoring committee to foster the involvement of the local community in the Project 
as a whole. 
 
The  claims,  mining  leases  and  concessions,  exclusive  leases  for  surface  mineral 
substances and the licences and leases for petroleum, natural gas and underground 
reservoirs  obtained  from  the  MNR  may  be  sold,  transferred,  hypothecated  or 
otherwise  encumbered  without  the  MNR’s  consent.  However,  a  release  from  the 
MNR is required for a vendor or a transferee to be released from its obligations and 
liabilities  owing  to  the  MNR  related  to  the  mine  rehabilitation  and  restoration  plan 
associated  with  the  alienated  lease  or  mining  concession.  Such  release  can  be 
obtained  when  a  third‑party  purchaser  assumes  those  obligations  as  part  of  a 
property transfer. For perfection purposes, the transfers of mining titles and grants of 
hypothecs and other encumbrances in mining rights must be recorded in the register 
of  real  and  immovable  mining  rights  maintained  by  the  MNR  and  other  applicable 
registers. 
 
Mining Titles and Claims Status 
The claim list was supplied by Michel Bouchard, president and CEO of Clifton Star 
Resources Inc. InnovExplo has verified (as of July 1, 2013) the current status of all 
claims  using  GESTIM,  the  Québec  government’s  claim  management  system

Clifton  Star  signed  mineral  property  option  agreements  with  the  current  owners  of 
the  Beattie,  Donchester  and  Dumico  properties  on  May  6,  2008.  The  initial 
agreement  has  been  amended  several  times:  July  22,  2008;  November  24,  2008; 
and  April  8,  2009.  In  a  news  release  dated  September  12,  2012,  Clifton  Star 
announced that these agreements had been amended once again (source: CFO – 
Press Release and agreements on SEDAR website).  
 
Clifton Star signed a mineral property option agreement with the owner of the related 
Central Duparquet claims in December of 2008 (source: CFO – Press Release and 
agreements on SEDAR website). 
 
In  December  of  2009,  Clifton  Star  entered  into  a  mineral  property  option  and  joint 
venture agreement with Osisko Mining Corporation (“Osisko”), which was terminated 
on  June  16,  2011.  Clifton  Star  Resources  is  under  the  legal  opinion  that  it  is  still 
entitled  to  a  loan  of  $22.5  M  from  Osisko,  which  was  to  be  used  to  facilitate  the 
payment to the underlying property owners. 
 
Beattie, Donchester and Dumico Properties 
 
The  option  agreements  related  to  the  Beattie,  Donchester  and  Dumico  properties 
involve five (5) other companies. 
 
Beattie Gold Mines Ltd (“Beattie Mines”), having its registered office at 2147 Portage 
Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, is the legal and beneficial owner of a 100% undivided 
interest in the mineral mining rights of the Beattie mining concession (MC#292 of the 
Beattie property). 
 
2588111  Manitoba  Ltd  (“2588111”),  having  its  registered  office  at  2147  Portage 
Avenue,  Winnipeg,  Manitoba,  owns,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  173714 
Canada  Inc  (“173714”),  the  mineral  mining  rights  of  the  Donchester  mining 
concession  (MC#384  of  the  Donchester  property),  the  mineral  mining  and  surface 
rights of the Hunter mining concession (MC#442 of the Hunter property) and mining 
rights on the Dumico Claims (C003231 and C003232). 
 
2699681  Canada  Ltd  (“2699681”),  having  its  registered  office  at  2147  Portage 
Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, owns, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Eldorado 
Gold  Mines  Inc.  (“Eldorado”),  the  surface  rights  to  the  Beattie  mining  concession 
#292, including the concentrate roasters located thereon, but excepting land that has 
been  sold  for  the  golf  course,  the  houses  near  the  golf  course  with  their 
accompanying land, and the northeast part of the MC#292. Eldorado also owns part 
of the surface rights to the Donchester mining concession #384, excepting land that 
has  been  deeded  to  the  church  for  the  cemetery,  and  the  northwest  part  of  the 
MC#384.  Eldorado  owns  the  surface  rights  to  the  Dumico  property.  Eldorado  also 
owns  the  mine  tailings  that  originated  from  the  original  Beattie,  Donchester, 
Duquesne and Hunter mines. 
 
On  May  1,  2008,  Clifton  Star  signed  mineral  property  option  agreements  with  the 
three  companies  presented  above,  with  similar  terms.  The  initial  agreements  have 
been amended three times (July 22, 2008, November 24, 2008, and April 8, 2009). 
On October 26, 2009, Clifton Star signed a Letter of Intent with the optionors. Clifton
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
53
www.innovexplo.com
Star  then  renegotiated  with  the  optionors  to  terminate  the  aforementioned  mineral 
property option agreements and enter new agreements, which resulted in payments 
of $600,000 to Beattie Mines, $300,000 to 2699681, and $600,000 to 2588111 under 
the old option agreements (Clifton Star, MD&A, May 29, 2012). 
 
On  September  12,  2012,  Clifton  Star  announced  in  a  new  release  that  new  terms 
had been negotiated with the optionors.  
 
The following terms of the new agreement will earn Clifton Star the remaining 90% of 
the issued and outstanding shares of the optionors:
•  Cash payments of $3,400,000 to Beattie Mines, $1,700,000 to 2699681, and 
$3,400,000  to  2588111  by  the  end  of  the  2011  fiscal  year,  which  will  earn 
Clifton Star 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of the optionors;
•  A cash payment of $2,000,000 and 250,000 shares of Clifton to the optionors
on December 1, 2012; and
•  A cash payment of $10,000,000 to the optionors on December 1, 2014;  
•  A cash payment of $10,000,000 to the optionors on December 1, 2015;  
•  A cash payment of $15,000,000 to the optionors on December 1, 2016;  
•  A cash payment of $15,200,000 to the optionors on December 1, 2017.
In the event of a change of control in Clifton Star or an assignment of the mineral 
property option agreement prior to the expiry of the aforementioned options, Clifton 
Star would be obligated to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the optionors for 
a total payment of $52,200,000 if the event occurred after June 1, 2010, but prior to 
December  1,  2012,  or  a  total  payment  of  $30,000,000  if  the  event  occurs  after 
December 1, 2012, but prior to December 1, 2017. 
 
As of September 30, 2013, Clifton Star had paid $4,800,000 to Beattie, $2,400,000 
to 2699681 and $4,800,000 to 2588111 under the option agreements and now owns 
10%  of  the  shares  of  the  optionors.  In  connection  with  the  September  2012 
agreement, Clifton Star has also issued in October 4, 2013, a further 100,000 shares 
of  the  Company  to  Beattie,  50,000  shares  to  2699681  and  100,000  shares  to 
2588111.  
 
These payments will permit Clifton Star to earn the remaining 90% of the issued and 
outstanding  shares  of  the  optionors.  There  shall  be  no  increase  in  the  share 
ownership  of  each  of  the  optionor  companies  unless  all  payments  for  each  of  the 
companies, as specified above, are satisfied. 
 
In the event of a change of control in Clifton Star or an assignment of the mineral 
property option agreements prior to the expiry of the aforementioned options, all the 
above conditions vest two years in advance. 
 
The  optionors  have  retained  a  2%  Net  Smelter Royalty  (“NSR”) for  the duration of 
the option period. However, upon the exercise of Clifton Star’s option to earn 100%, 
this 2% NSR will be eliminated.

Central Duparquet Property 
The  Central  Duparquet  property  is  defined  as  a  group  of  eighteen  (18)  claims 
totalling 327.4 ha, registered to Lizette Grenier. On December 15, 2008, Clifton Star 
signed an option agreement whereby it may acquire a 100% interest in the Central 
Duparquet  property.  To  earn  its  100%  interest,  Clifton  Star  paid  $400,000  on 
January 13, 2009. 
 
During the five-year (5-year) period following the date of execution of the agreement, 
Clifton Star may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of its interest 
in the property. A term of this disposition will be a payment to the optionor of shares 
of any company acquiring an interest in the property at a deemed value or in cash of 
$1,900,000. 
 
On  February  26,  2010,  Clifton  Star  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  2% 
NSR  from  the  Gesmalar,  the  original  owner  of  the  Central  Duparquet  property.  As 
consideration for the acquisition of the NSR, Clifton Star paid $155,000 and issued 
10,000 common shares, valued at $57,400, to Gesmalar. 
 
Mineral Property Option and Joint Venture Agreement with Osisko 
On  December  10,  2009,  Clifton  Star  entered  into  a  four-year  (4-year)  mineral 
property option and joint venture agreement with Osisko regarding a joint venture on 
the  Duparquet  Project,  comprised  of  the  Central  Duparquet,  Duquesne,  Beattie, 
Donchester  and  Dumico  properties.  However,  on  June  16,  2011,  Osisko  notified 
Clifton Star of its decision to terminate its participation in the Duparquet Project. 
 
Under the terms of this mineral property option and joint venture agreement, Osisko 
could have earned a 50% interest in the joint venture by contributing, as operator, a 
total of $70,000,000 to the joint venture over the period of four (4) years. As of June 
16, 2011, Osisko had incurred $15,000,000 on the project. 
 
Although the agreement with Osisko has been terminated, Clifton Star still has the 
right, under the initial terms, to access a loan of $22,500,000 from Osisko to cover 
the payments to the property vendors that are due on or before December 1, 2012. If 
Clifton Star were to access the funds, Clifton Star would have the right to retire the 
loan, at a 5% interest rate, based on the issuance of shares of Clifton Star to Osisko 
at a set price of $3.12 per share for the principal and at market price for the interest. 
 
At the time this report was being prepared, Clifton Star had requested from Osisko 
the  loan  as  described  above.  InnovExplo  is  not  aware  of  any  other  information 
regarding the ongoing discussions between both parties. 
 
Environment 
As  far  as  exploration  and  mining  activities  are  concerned,  the  Beattie  mining 
concession (MC#292) is affected by regulations regarding the presence of an “Urban 
Perimeter”  (Fig.  4.3).  The  restriction,  as  documented  on  GESTIM,  is  one  of 
“Exploration Prohibited” (see Bill 70, 2013, chapter 32, section a124). According to 
the Bill 70, any mineral substance forming part of the domain of the State and found 
in an urban perimeter shown on maps kept at the registrar’s office, except mineral 
substances found in a territory subject to a mining right obtained before December
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
55
www.innovexplo.com
10, 2013, is withdrawn from prospecting, mining exploration and mining operations 
as of that date, until the territories provided for in section 304.1.1 of the Mining Act 
are determined (as of December 10 2013, the Act to amend the Mining Act: Bill 70). 
According to section 304.1.1, any mineral substance forming part of the domain of 
the State and found in a parcel of land on which a claim may be obtained and that is 
included in a mining-incompatible territory delimited in a land use and development 
plan  in  accordance  with  the  Act  respecting  land  use  planning  and  development 
(chapter  A-19.1)  is  withdrawn  from  prospecting,  mining  exploration  and  mining 
operations from the time the territory is shown on the maps kept at the office of the 
registrar. A mining-incompatible territory is a territory in which the viability of activities 
would be compromised by the impacts of mining. 
 
The  Beattie  mining  concession  (MC#292)  corresponds  to  a  mining  right  obtained 
before December 10, 2013 and thus exploration is permitted on this concession. 
 
As  of  December  10,  2013,  claim  holders  must  notify  the  municipality  and  the 
landowner  concerned  within  60  days  after  registering  a  claim  of  the  fact  that  they 
have obtained the claim, and must inform the municipality and the landowner at least 
30 days before performing work. According to Clifton Star, the company has already 
advised the municipality of their work program on the mining concession and claims, 
and the municipality has agreed in writing to the proposed exploration program. 
 
The  initial  location  of  the  desulphurized  tailing  and  waste  rock  management  is 
located  on  the  MERN  property  (verified  with  Bryan  Goulet  of  the  Abitibi-Ouest 
Regional  County  Municipality,  Feb.  26  2013).  Presently,  there  are  clearing  rights. 
Clifton Star would have to purchase the surface rights from the MERN if they want all 
desulphurized  tailings  to  be  recovered.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  MERN  will  not  allow 
Clifton  Star  to  recover  the  portion  of  the  Mineral  Resources  in  the  tailings  that  are 
outside  the  property  boundary;  if  this  were  to  happen,  the  authors  wish  to  point  out 
that  this  very  small  portion  of  the  total  Mineral  Resources  will  only  have  a  minor 
impact and will not affect the potential viability of the Project. 
 
InnovExplo is not aware of any environmental liabilities, permits or municipality social 
issues with respect to the Duparquet Project. All exploration activities conducted on 
the Duparquet Project comply  with relevant environmental permitting requirements. 
To  InnovExplo’s  knowledge,  Clifton  Star  has  obtained  the  appropriate  permits  and 
authorizations to use the surface rights.

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
Accessibility 
The  Duparquet  Project  is  located  just  north  of  the  Town  of  Duparquet,  which  is 
accessible  by  paved,  two-lane,  all-season  provincial  highways  from  the  towns  of 
Rouyn-Noranda (53 km to the south; Route 393 and Route 101) and La Sarre (about 
33 km to the north; Route 393) (Fig. 5.1). Access to the Duparquet Property from the 
Town of Duparquet is by gravel road. 
 
Climate 
The  climate  is  continental  with  cold  dry  winters  and  warm  summers.  Winter 
temperatures average -17°C with lows down to -40°C in January, whereas summer 
temperatures  average  17°C  with  highs  up  to  35°C  in  July.  Annual  precipitation  is 
around 900 mm. Snow falls from mid-November to mid-April. 
 
Mining  and  drilling  operations  can  be  conducted  year-round,  whereas  surface 
exploration work (mapping, channel sampling) can take place from mid-April to mid-
November. 
 
Local Resources 
The Town of Rouyn-Noranda, 53 km by road to the south and easily accessible via 
provincial  highways  393  and  101,  is  the  nearest  major  city  with  a  specialized 
workforce  and  facilities  for  obtaining  mining/exploration  repairs  and  supplies.  The 
Town of Duparquet currently has a population of about 675 residents, most of which 
are family members and descendants of workers at the past-producing Beattie and 
Donchester  mines.  Skilled  workers  and  housing  are  available  in  the  municipality. 
Water is available from the town’s supply or from surface water on the Property. 
 
Electric  power  is  available  at  the  Beattie  mine  site.  In  2013,  Hydro-Québec 
completed an exploratory study to verify its capacity to supply electric power to the 
Duparquet Project (Williamson et al., 2013a). It is possible to feed the Project from 
the Renaud substation, but a new 120 KV line of 14.5 km should be made to connect 
the Project. Hydro-Québec would require 36 months to complete the power supply. 
 
Infrastructure 
Most  of  the  mine  buildings  have  been  demolished  and  the  shafts  capped  and 
allowed to naturally flood. The existing glory hole is also flooded. The only remaining 
buildings are on the Beattie mine site: the roaster building, smoke stack and water 
tower. Although they are essentially in working order, Québec laws do not allow the 
roaster to operate. 
 
Parts of the roaster building are currently used as an office, core shack and pulp and 
reject storage by Clifton Star. The yard holds numerous core racks and now serves 
as a core, pulp and reject storage area. Access to these facilities is restricted by a 
locked gate.

the  Duparquet  Project  (preliminary  pit  position)
Physiography 
The  Duparquet  Project  lies  in  moderately  rolling  terrain  just  south  of  a  flat  belt  of 
glacial till deposits and farmland. Outcrop density generally varies from 20% to 50%, 
but  up  to  80%  in  specific  areas.  The  area  is  covered  with  an  immature  to  semi-
mature forest of poplar with some birch, balsam, spruce and jack pine interspersed 
on  well-drained  higher  ground.  The  properties  are  also  characterized  by  a  very 
dense  and  thick  undergrowth  of  mainly  tag  alders,  scrub  maple  and  willow.  The 
overburden  consists  of  sandy  soil  or  till,  with  occasional  portions  of  gravel.  Some 
boulders of granitic composition, up to 3 m in diameter, are scattered here and there. 
 
The  mean  elevation  of 
approximately 300 metres above sea level (masl). 
 
As described by Fillion (2009), the mine tailings are contained within a well-defined 
naturally occurring topographic basin that prevents them from spreading, except on 
the side of Lake Duparquet. The tailings have spread over a distance of 300 m into 
the  lake  along  a  very  gentle  slope.  The  tailings  overlie  lacustrine  clay.  A  cover  of 
organic  matter,  sometimes  containing  fire  residue,  is  often  present  between  the 
tailings and the lacustrine clay. Many intermittent creeks appear and then drain out 
over the course of the year in the general area of the tailings. One main trail crosses 
the entire area up to the lake and can be used all year long. Vegetation grows slowly 
on  the  tailings  surface  and  consists  of  several  species  of  trees,  including  birch, 
poplar  and  spruce.  A  marsh  is  present  in  the  northwest  part  of  the  Property.  A 
permanent waterway isolates the west part of the tailings area. Several beaver dams 
allow access to the site as well as a number of cross-country ski trails, which enter 
from the west.

HISTORY
www.innovexplo.com
The  following  chronological  overview  of  historical  work  on  the  former  properties 
comprising the Duparquet Property was taken mainly from Bevan (2011) and Dupéré 
et  al  (2011)  and  reviewed  by  InnovExplo.  There  is  a  summary  of  historical  work 
carried out on the Duparquet Property (refer to Table 6.1). 
 
1910 Gold is first discovered in Duparquet Township by John Beattie.  
 
1923  The  first  claims  for  the  Beattie  property,  included  in  Mining  Concession  292, 
are staked by John Beattie, for whom the property is named.  
 
1924 The Victoria Syndicate options the Beattie property and carries out extensive 
trenching, but results are not encouraging. 
 
1925-1927  Prospecting  of  the  Beattie  property  claims  continues.  Consolidated 
Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd options the claims. The company 
continues exploration by trenching and carries out some diamond drilling. 
 
1930  Consolidated  Mining  and  Smelting  drops  the  option.  In  the  same  year,  John 
Beattie discovers the Main (or North) deposit and options the property to Ventures 
Limited  and  Nipissing  Mining  Company  Ltd.  These  two  (2)  companies  advance 
capital to develop the Beattie mine. The North deposit is diamond drilled and a two-
compartment shaft is sunk to 67 m. During the sinking of the shaft, another deposit is 
encountered, called the "A" mineralized material zone. 
 
1931-1945  Exploration  and  development  is  carried  out  on  the  Central  Duparquet 
property  by  Dumico  Gold  Corporation,  then  Central  Duparquet  Mines  Limited. 
Contemporaneous  with  the  start  of  production  at  the  Beattie  mine,  further  west, 
Dumico drills 52 surface holes to define the mineralized zone. This work justifies the 
sinking of an exploration shaft and the driving of five (5) levels. 
 
1932 The operator of the Beattie mine, Beattie Gold Mines Limited, is formed. A six-
compartment (6) shaft is sunk to a depth of 442 m and nine (9) levels are established 
at 46-metre intervals, with the first level at 61 m below the shaft collar.  
 
1933  A  2,000-ton-per-day  flotation  process  plant  is  erected  and  production 
commences,  with  concentrates  being  shipped  to  Asarco's  smelter  in  Tacoma, 
Washington.  
 
1934-1937 A cyanidation plant is installed in 1935 and, due to the sulphide content in 
the mineralized material, a roaster is added in 1937 to improve recoveries. Initially, 
the production rate is 800 tons per day, gradually building up to 1.500 tons per day in 
1935 to a maximum of 1,900 tons per day. 
 
1937 A three-compartment (3) winze or internal shaft is sunk from the 5th (244 m) 
level some 274 m east of the main shaft down to the 9th (427m) level. This winze is 
later deepened to 625 m with the 13th (610m) level established.  
 
1939  Beattie  Gold  Mines  Limited  is  re-organized,  becoming  Beattie  Gold  Mines 
(Québec) Ltd.

1938-1940  Mine  development  is  carried  out  in  the  Beattie  mine  toward  the 
Donchester  property.  The  Donchester  property  is  immediately  east  of  the  Beattie 
property.  A  drift  from  the  third  level  within  the  Beattie  mine  is  driven  across  the 
boundary with the Donchester property for exploration purposes.  
 
1933-1940 From the start of production in 1933 until the end of 1940, the mill treated 
3,921,281 tons of ore and recovered 471,085 ounces of gold and 73,214 ounces of 
silver,  an  average  of  0.120  oz/t  Au  and  0.019  oz/t  Ag  (Dresser  and  Denis,  1949). 
This tonnage came from the North and A zones.  
 
1941  Diamond  drilling  from  underground  stations  at  152-metre  intervals  outlines 
several  ore-shoots  91  m  below  surface  within  the  Donchester  boundary.  Nine  (9) 
holes intersect values varying from 0.15 to 0.40 oz/t Au over widths ranging from 0.3 
to 4 m. Beattie Gold Mines acquires the Donchester mine, for stock considerations. 
On  the  strength  of  these  results,  a  drift  on  the  6th  level  (330  m  below  surface)  is 
driven  from  the  Beattie  shaft  over  to  the  Dumico  shaft  of  the  Central  Duparquet 
property,  cutting  across  Donchester  ground.  Cross-drilling  from  this  drift  outlines  a 
vein  792  m  in  strike  length  and  grading  0.28  oz/t  Au  over  a  2  metre  width  on 
average. Peak production at the Beattie mine is reached in 1941 and 1942 at 1,900 
tons per day. 
 
1943-1944 A shaft is sunk on Donchester ground to the 6th level and connected to 
the previously driven drift.  
 
1943 A cave-in at the Beattie mine caused by failure of the main crown pillars results 
in an inrush of about one million cubic yards of clay, sand and broken rock into the 
mine workings. Rehabilitation work starts immediately and continues until 1950.  
 
1943-1950 During this period, mining exploration in the original Beattie mine suffers 
and operations are conducted at a loss. Much of the production slack is taken up by 
tonnage from the Donchester section which is brought on-stream sooner because of 
the  cave-in  at  Beattie.  Production  losses  are  accentuated  during  the  war  years  by 
the shortage of labour and supplies, and after 1946, by rising costs and a fixed price 
for gold. Only with a government cost aid program (the Emergency Gold Mining Act, 
E.G.M.A.)  are  gold  mines  such  as  Beattie  mine  able  to  stay  open  in  the  post-war 
years.  
 
1945  The  Donchester  shaft  is  deepened  to  the  9th  level  (457  m  vertical). 
Development is carried out above and below the 6th level resulting in seven (7) new 
levels  from  the  2nd  to  the  9th  on  the  “South  Zone”  deposit.  At  least  four  levels  are 
driven across to the “North Zone” deposit: the 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th levels. The 3rd level 
is also driven across from Beattie to inter-connect with the North Zone. 
 
1946-1956  The  company  again  re-organizes  and  becomes  Consolidated  Beattie 
Mines  Ltd.  Operations  continue  on  the  Beattie  property  until  1956  when,  after  23 
years  of  almost  continuous  production,  the  mine  closes.  During  its  lifetime,  the 
Beattie  mill  treated  9,645,000  metric  tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of  4.01  g/t  Au 
and  0.99  g/t  Ag  from  the  North  zone  of  the  Beattie  mine  and  Donchester  mine 
(Lavergne, 1985).

1956-1987  Except  for  a  small  surface  exploration  program  in  1966,  the  Beattie 
property  remains  dormant  from  1956  to  1987.  The  1966  program  consists  of  line 
cutting, an electro-magnetic survey and two (2) diamond drill holes totalling 259 m, 
drilled to test an EM anomaly which is found to be caused by graphite. Unfortunately, 
some of the old mine records are destroyed by fire and affected by water damage. 
The  latest  complete  records  of  reserves  and  production  (stope  outlines)  are  now 
those on a January 1, 1954, longitudinal section. 
 
1981 The first period of activity on the Central Duparquet property takes place with 
SOQUEM Inc. SOQUEM performed a drilling program totalling thirteen (13) diamond 
drill holes.  
 
1987 The second period of activity on the Central Duparquet property takes place, 
Inc,  both  companies  mainly 
first  with  SOQUEM 
concentrating 
the  property.  Mapping, 
lithogeochemical  and geophysical  surveys  are  carried  out  as  well  as  eighteen  (18) 
surface trenches and three (3) drilling programs. The aim of this work is to define the 
mineralized  zone  more  accurately  than  Dumico  Gold  Corporation  following  their 
discovery of the zone. The first two (2) drilling programs carried out by SOQUEM in 
1981 lead to the re-definition of property reserves (see below). The 3rd program is a 
drilling  program  conducted  by  Cambior  in  an  attempt  to  define  a  near-surface 
mineralized zone. Various feasibility studies suggest that the deposit could be mined 
by open pit methods.  
 
Reserve  estimates  of  the  Beattie  mine,  as  carried  out  by  C.W.  Archibald  Limited 
(1987) and Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl (1987), appear to be based on a 1950 
longitudinal  section  (see  reference  in  Bevan,  2011).  The  following  reserves  are 
quoted in a 1987 Prospectus:
followed  by  Cambior
Inc
their  efforts  on
the  western  part  of
449,800 tons averaging 0.095 oz/t Au (A Zone west of the glory hole) 
450,000 tons averaging 0.120 oz/t Au (broken muck in the glory hole) 
636,000 tons averaging 0.122 oz/t Au (DMBW east of the glory hole) 
264,075 tons averaging 0.120 oz/t Au (below 9th level)

upon.  It  is  unlikely  they  conform  to  current  NI 43-101  criteria  or  to  CIM  Standards 
and  Definitions,  and  they  have  not  been  verified  to  determine  their  relevance  or 
reliability. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and should

1988  A  diamond  drilling  program  is  carried  out  by  Beattie  Gold  Mines,  comprising 
twelve (12) holes for a total of 1,939.4 m. The holes target the “A”, South and North 
Zones. 
 
1989-1990  Forbex  Mining  Resources  Inc.  re-vamps  the  reserves  from  the  Central 
Duparquet property and undertakes an 11-hole drilling program in the eastern part of 
the property, off the known mineralized zones to the west.  
 
1989 Beattie Gold Mines drills ten (10) holes for a total of 401.7 m. These holes are 
drilled under a stripped area of the South Zone and to the west of the stripping.

2009 Genivar is contracted to produce a Mineral Resource Estimate for a portion 
of the mine tailings area (Fillion, 2009), but the report was never published. 
 
2010  Under  the  terms  of  a  joint  venture  agreement  with  Osisko,  the  latter 
becomes the operator of a drilling program comprising 314 drill holes for a total 
of 102,529 m on the Beattie and Donchester properties. Osisko also carries out 
a channel sampling program consisting of 220 channels (460 m of cut channels) 
to complement the drilling program. 
 
2010  Osisko  Mining  Corporation  contracted  SGS  Mineral  Service  (Lakefield, 
Ontario)  to  conduct  testwork  on  Beattie  Duparquet  Project  samples.  The 
program 
testwork  and  preliminary  cyanidation  and 
flotation tests to investigate the recovery of gold. 
 
2011 During December and January 2011, Geophysics GPR International Inc. flew a 
helicopter-borne magnetic and time-domain electromagnetic geophysical survey for
included  comminution

Osisko  Mining  Corporation’s  Duparquet  Project. The  survey  was  composed  of  one 
(1) single block and covers all Duparquet Project.  
 
2011  Osisko  Mining  Corporation  contracted  SGS  Canada  Inc.  (Geostat)  to 
prepare a NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate on the Beattie sector 
only. 
 
2011  Clifton  Star  continued  drilling  the  Beattie  and  Donchester  properties  and 
starts  drilling  the  Central  Duparquet  property.  A  total  of  46  holes  and  28  hole 
extensions are drilled for a total of 17,565 m. 
 
2012 Clifton Star completed surface outcrop stripping on and in the vicinity of the 
RWRS Zone, South Zone and the North Zone. A total of nineteen (19) outcrops 
on Beattie, nine (9) on Donchester and one (1) on Central Duparquet properties 
were mechanically stripped and then sampled  using a conventional channelling 
technique. The  primary  goal for the  stripping and  channel  sampling was  to  test 
and verify the gold mineralization continuity up to surface. 
 
2012 Clifton Star decided to resample fifty (50) of the company’s previous holes that 
had  been  selectively  sampled  at  the  time  of  drilling.  The  selective  nature  of  the 
sampling resulted in untested shoulders adjacent to mineralized zones. 
 
2012 From January to the end of August 2012, Clifton Star drilled a total of thirty-five 
(35) new holes and eight (8) extensions of older holes. Overall, the drilling program 
produced 12,471 m of NQ-size core during this period. From September 2012 until 
January 2013, Clifton Star continued drilling the Duparquet properties. A total of fifty-
three  (53)  drill  holes  and  ten  (10)  drill  hole  extensions  were  completed  during  this 
period, for a total of 22,675 m of NQ-size core. 
 
2012  Clifton  Star  contracted  InnovExplo  to:  (i)  prepare  a  NI 43-101  compliant 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  on  the  Duparquet  Project,  combining  the  resources 
of all three (3) adjacent properties (Beattie, Donchester, Central Duparquet); and 
(ii)  audit  Genivar’s  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  of  the  tailing  ponds  in  order  to 
incorporate the results into the “global” mineral resource estimate. 
 
2012  Clifton  Star  contracted  InnovExplo  to:  (i)  prepare  a  NI 43-101  compliant 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (new  update)  on  the  Duparquet  Project,  combining 
the  resources  of  all  three adjacent  properties  (Beattie,  Donchester,  Central 
Duparquet);  and  (ii)  prepare  a  NI 43-101  compliant  Preliminary  Economic 
Assessment (PEA) for the Duparquet Project. The PEA Study was prepared as an 
open  pit  mining  project  relating  solely  to  the  mineral  resources  located  on  the 
Duparquet Project. 
 
2012 Clifton Star contracted Tenova Mining & Minerals – Bateman Engineering 
Pty  Ltd  (“Tenova-Bateman”)  to  develop  preliminary  capital  and  operating  costs 
for the construction and operation of a mineral processing plant to process from 
the  Duparquet  Project  to  produce  gold  doré.  The  purpose  of  the  Study  was  to 
assess the viability of the Total Pressure Oxidation, Albion ProcessTM and Biox® 
Leaching  technologies  to  treat  gold  rich  concentrate  from  the  Duparquet  mine 
deposits, in order to produce gold doré bar and to provide capital and operating 
cost estimates to a level of accuracy of ±35% for the proposed three flowsheets.

2012  Clifton  Star  contracted  SGS  Canada  Inc.  (Lakefield,  Ontario)  to  conduct 
testwork on Duparquet Project samples. The program included flotation, pressure 
oxidation and cyanidation testwork to investigate the recovery of gold from ore and 
tailing  samples.  Preliminary  comminution  and  environmental  tests  were  also 
conducted.  
 
2012  In  fall,  fifteen  (15)  of  the  nineteen  (19)  holes  of  the  Dumico  property  were 
entirely resampled and/or downhole surveyed by Clifton Star. Down-hole orientation 
surveys were done using a Gyroscope instrument. 
 
2013 Clifton Star sent to SGS Minerals a 12 tonne composite bulk sample of the 
Duparquet  Project  mineralized  zones,  from  large  diameter  drill  core,  for 
metallurgical  and  environmental  pilot  tests.  The  planned  testwork  included  a 
continuous  pilot  plant  test  for  POX  and  also  for  high  grade  gold  concentrates 
production.  Results  received  in  September  2013  confirmed  previous  recoveries 
and will be incorporated into the current Prefeasibility Study. 
 
2013 Clifton Star began a surface outcrop stripping program on and in the vicinity of 
the RWRS Zone, South Zone and the North Zone during spring. A total of five (5) 
outcrops on Beattie property were mechanically stripped and then sampled using a 
conventional channelling technique. The primary goal for the stripping and channel 
sampling was to test and verify the gold mineralization continuity up to surface. The 
2013  channel  sampling  program  was  not  included  in  the  most  recent  mineral 
resource estimate. 
 
2013 Clifton decided to resample eight (8) of the company’s previous holes that had 
been selectively sampled at the time of drilling. The selective nature of the sampling 
resulted  in  untested  shoulders  adjacent  to  mineralized  zones.  Clifton  Star’s  re-
sampling  program  successfully  filled  in  the  gaps  in  these  holes.  Of  the  eight  (8) 
resampled  holes,  397  samples  have  been  added  to  the  last  updated  Mineral 
Resource Estimate.  
 
2013  Clifton  Star  contracted  InnovExplo  to  prepare  a  NI 43-101  compliant 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  on  the  Duparquet  Project,  combining  the  resources 
of  all  four (4)  adjacent  properties  (Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet, 
Dumico) including Genivar’s mineral resource estimate of the tailing ponds in order 
to incorporate the results into a “global” mineral resource estimate.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION
Regional Geological Setting 
Archean Superior Province 
The  Archean  Superior  Province  (Fig.  7.1)  forms  the  core  of  the  North  American 
continent and is surrounded by provinces of Paleoproterozoic age to the west, north 
and  east,  and  the  Grenville  Province  of  Mesoproterozoic  age  to  the  southeast. 
Tectonic  stability  has  prevailed  since  approximately  2.6  Ga  in  large  parts  of  the 
Superior  Province.  Proterozoic  and  younger  activity  is  limited  to  rifting  of  the 
margins, emplacement of numerous mafic dyke swarms (Buchan and Ernst, 2004), 
compressional reactivation, large-scale rotation at approximately 1.9 Ga, and failed 
rifting  at  approximately  1.1  Ga. With  the  exception  of  the  northwest  and  northeast 
Superior margins that were pervasively deformed and metamorphosed at 1.9 to 1.8 
Ga, the craton has escaped ductile deformation. 
 
A first-order feature of the Superior Province is its linear subprovinces, or “terranes”, 
of  distinctive  lithological  and  structural  character,  accentuated  by  subparallel 
boundary faults (e.g., Card and Ciesielski, 1986). Trends are generally east-west in 
the south, west-northwest in the northwest, and northwest in the northeast. In Figure 
7.1,  the  term  “terrane”  is  used  in  the  sense  of  a  geological  domain  with  a  distinct 
geological  history  prior  to  its  amalgamation  into  the  Superior  Province  during  the 
2.72  Ga  to  2.68  Ga  assembly  events,  and  a  “superterrane”  shows  evidence  for 
internal amalgamation of terranes prior to the Neoarchean assembly. “Domains” are 
defined as distinct regions within a terrane or superterrane. 
 
The Duparquet Property is located within the Abitibi terrane. The Abitibi terrane hosts 
some of the richest mineral deposits of the Superior Province (Fig. 7.1), including the 
giant Kidd Creek massive sulphide deposit (Hannington et al., 1999) and the large 
gold  camps  of  Ontario  and  Québec  (Robert  and  Poulsen,  1997;  Poulsen  et  al., 
2000).

7.1.2
The Abitibi Terrane (Abitibi Subprovince) 
The Abitibi Subprovince (Abitibi Greenstone Belt) is located in the southern portion of 
the Superior Province (Fig. 7.1). The Abitibi Subprovince is divided into the Southern 
and  Northern  volcanic  zones  (SVZ  and  NVZ;  Chown  et  al.  1992)  representing  a 
collage  of  two  (2)  arcs  delineated  by  the  Destor-Porcupine-Manneville  Fault  Zone 
(DPMFZ;  Mueller  et  al.  1996).  The  SVZ  is  separated  from  the  Pontiac  Terrane 
sedimentary rocks, an accretionary prism (Calvert and Ludden 1999) to the south, by 
the Cadillac−Larder Lake Fault Zone (CLLFZ). The fault zones are terrane “zippers” 
that display the change from thrusting to transcurrent motion as documented in the 
turbiditic  flysch  basins  unconformably  overlain  by,  or  in  structural  contact  with, 
coarse  clastic  deposits  in  strike-slip  basins  (Mueller  et  al.  1991,  1994,  1996; 
Daigneault  et  al.  2002). A  further  subdivision  of the  NVZ  into  external  and  internal 
segments  is  warranted,  based  on  distinct  structural  patterns  with  the  intra-arc 
Chicobi sedimentary sequence representing the line of demarcation. Dimroth et al.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
72
www.innovexplo.com
(1982, 1983a) recognized this difference and used it to define internal and external 
zones (Fig. 7.2) of the Abitibi greenstone belt. Subsequently, numerous alternative 
Abitibi  divisions  were  proposed  (see  Chown  et  al.,  1992),  but  all  models  revolved 
around a plate tectonic theme. The identification of a remnant Archean north-dipping 
subduction zone by Calvert et al. (1995) corroborated these early studies. 
 
The 2735-2705 Ma NVZ is ten (10) times larger than the 2715-2697 Ma SVZ, and 
both granitoid bodies and layered complexes are abundant in the former. In contrast, 
plume-generated  komatiites,  a  distinct  feature  of  the  SVZ,  are  only  a  minor 
component of the NVZ, observed only in the Cartwright Hills and Lake Abitibi area 
(Daigneault  et  al.  2004).  Komatiites  rarely  constitute  more  than  5%  of  greenstone 
sequences  and  the  Abitibi  is  no  exception  (Sproule  et  al.  2002).  The  linear 
sedimentary  basins  are  significant  in  the  history  because  they  link  arcs  and  best 
chronicle the structural evolution and tempo of Archean accretionary processes. The 
NVZ  is  composed  of  volcanics  cycles  1  and  2,  which  are  synchronous  with 
sedimentary cycles 1 and 2, whereas the SVZ exhibits volcanic cycles 2 and 3, with 
sedimentary  cycles  3  and  4  (Mueller  et  al.  1989;  Chown  et  al.  1992;  Mueller  and 
Donaldson 1992; Mueller et al. 1996). 
 
The  Abitibi  Subprovince  displays  a  prominent  E-W  structural  trend  resulting  from 
regional E-trending folds with an axial-planar schistosity that is characteristic of the 
Abitibi belt (Daigneault et al. 2002). The schistosity displays local variations in strike 
and dip, which are attributed to either oblique faults cross-cutting the regional trend, 
or deformation aureoles around resistant plutonic suites. Although dominant steeply-
dipping  fabrics  are  prevalent  in  Abitibi  Subprovince,  shallow-dipping  fabrics  are 
recorded in the Pontiac Subprovince and at the SVZ-NVZ interface in the Preissac-
Lacorne area. 
 
The  metamorphic  grade  in  the  Abitibi  Subprovince  displays  greenschist  to  sub-
greenschist facies (Joly, 1978; Powell et al., 1993; Dimroth et al., 1983b; Benn et al., 
1994)  except  around  plutons  where  amphibolite  grade  prevails  (Joly,  1978).  In 
contrast, two (2) extensive high-grade zones coincide with areas of shallow-dipping 
fabrics. They are as follows: (1) the turbiditic sandstone and mudstone of the Pontiac 
Subprovince at the SVZ contact, which exhibit a staurolite-garnet-hornblende-biotite 
assemblage  (Joly,  1978;  Benn  et  al.,  1994);  and  (2)  the  Lac  Caste  Formation 
turbidites  at  the  SVZ-NVZ  interface  (Malartic  segment)  with  sandstone  and 
mudstone  metamorphosed  to  biotite  schist  with  garnet  and  staurolite.  Feng  and 
Kerrich (1992) suggested that the juxtaposition of greenschist and amphibolite grade 
domains  indicates  uplift  occurred  during  the  compressional  stage  of  collisional 
tectonics.

Local Geological Setting 
The  local  geological  setting  and  property  geology  is  represented  by  the  Kinojevis, 
Timiskaming, and Blake River groups (Fig. 7.3). The Blake River Group is located to 
the south of the Destor-Porcupine fault. This group is characterized by a 2706-2696 
Ma  volcanic  sequence  4  to  7  km  thick  belonging  to  the  southern  volcanic  zone 
(SVZ).  The  Blake  River  Group  is  composed  of  mafic  volcanic  rocks  with  several 
felsic  volcanic  centres  (Pearson  and  Daigneault,  2009),  and  is  interpreted  as  a 
mega-caldera complex representing a multi-stage collapse structure occupying most 
of  the  present  Blake  River  Group  surface  area  (Pearson  and  Daigneault,  2009). 
Several  arguments  support  a  mega-caldera  complex,  including:  (1)  the  mafic-
intermediate  swarm  pattern;  (2)  the  overall  geometry;  (3)  the  fault  pattern;  (4)  the 
distribution of volcaniclastic rocks; and (5) the distribution pattern of carbonate-rich 
hydrothermal alteration (Pearson and Daigneault, 2009).  
 
The  Kinojevis  Group  is  located  north  of  the  DPMFZ  and  is  subdivided  into  two  (2) 
units:  the  Deguisier  Formation,  composed  of  massive  to  pillowed  tholeiitic  basalt 
associated with some amounts of andesite, felsic pyroclastic rocks and gabbro, and 
the Lanaudière Formation, consisting of basalts, andesites, rhyolites, komatiites and 
multiple mafic to ultramafic intrusions (Goutier and Lacroix, 1992).  
 
The Duparquet Formation, part of the Timiskaming group, is a sedimentary unit that 
occurs  within  a  small  structurally  controlled  basin,  herein  named  the  Duparquet 
Basin (Mueller et al., 1991). Development of the Duparquet basin at a late orogenic 
stage (of the Kenoran orogeny) classifies it as a successor basin (pull-apart basin). 
The  wedge-shaped  basin,  delineated  by  bounding  faults,  may  be  compared  to 
divergent fault-wedge basins in the Cenozoic basins of southern California (Crowell, 
1974). Mueller et al. (1991) suggested a late Archean dextral strike-slip movement 
within a regime dominated by north-south compression.  
 
Detailed stratigraphic mapping in the Duparquet Formation led to the recognition of 
three  (3)  mutually  transitional  facies  associations  (Mueller  et  al.,  1991).  Based  on 
predominant  lithology,  grain  size  and  sedimentary  structures,  the  facies  end 
members are as follows: (1) conglomerate-sandstone facies association (CSFA); (2) 
sandstone-argillite  facies  association  (SAFA);  and  (3)  argillite-sandstone  facies 
association (ASFA).The CFSA, up to 100 m thick, predominates near faulted basin 
margins and can be divided into subfacies in which the porphyry clast component is 
either dominant or negligible. The SAFA is characterized by a set of coarse-grained 
to very coarse-grained trough cross-beds 5 to 100 cm thick; planar to wavy, medium- 
to  coarse-grained  beds  5  to  20  cm  thick;  and  argillite  beds  1  to  30  cm  thick.  The 
ASFA  is  distinguished  by  laterally  continuous,  well-laminated  argillite  interstratified 
with fine- to coarse-grained sandstone beds 2 to 10 cm thick.

Property Geological Setting 
This  section  is  a  slightly  modified  version  of  the  property  geology  description 
provided  in  the  technical  report  by  Bevan  (2011).  The  authors  have  reviewed  and 
compared Bevan’s geological description to other such accounts in publicly available 
documents and consider it accurate to the best of their knowledge. 
 
The Duparquet Property straddles syenitic plutons and the Kinojevis, Duparquet and 
Mont-Brun formations (Fig. 7.4). The Duparquet Project area is characterized by the 
presence of two (2) syenitic plutons oriented east-west. These syenitic intrusions are 
bounded by E-W trending major faults, which are interpreted as splays of the main 
SE-trending  DPMFZ,  which  clips  the  southwest  corner  of  the  Property.  The 
geological  formations  strike  generally  E-W  and  dip  steeply  (80°-85°)  to  the  north. 
The  grade  of  metamorphism  is  low  (greenschist  facies)  with  local  alteration 
represented  by  chloritization,  silicification  and  sericitization.  Most  of  the  known 
mineralization  appears  to  be  related  to  the  late  intrusions  of  syenite  and  feldspar 
porphyry in the Keewatin mafic flows and tuffs, along zones of weakness adjacent to 
or coincident with the E-W trending major faults. 
 
Stratigraphy 
The rocks underlying the Duparquet Property are generally made up of intercalated 
felsic  (rhyolitic  to  dacitic)  and  mafic  (basaltic  to  andesitic)  metavolcanic  flows,  with 
felsic flows being the oldest. Metasedimentary layers are also present, consisting of 
arkosic sandstones, greywackes, argillites, crystal tuffs and conglomerates, and are 
generally more prevalent on the south side of the DPMFZ. All the units have been 
intruded by syenite porphyry units, which appear to be concordant with the location 
of  the  major  fault  zones.  Quartz  feldspar  and  lath  porphyries  have  been  injected 
along minor faults affecting the syenite intrusions. 
 
Structure 
The  predominant  structures  on  the  Property  are  the  E-W-trending  splays  of  the 
DPMFZ. The Beattie Fault Zone (BFZ) is located along the north contact of the main 
syenite body, whereas the Donchester Fault Zone (DFZ) is located along the south 
contact.  The  Central  Duparquet  Fault  Zone  (CDFZ)  is  located  along  the  south 
contact  of  the  second  smaller  syenite  intrusive  to  the  east.  The  syenite  porphyry 
generally plunges to the east. 
 
The  Beattie  and  Donchester  fault  zones  dip  steeply  to  the  south  and  north 
respectively,  thus  suggesting  that  the  contacts  of  the  syenite  porphyry  converge 
within the central portion of the complex at depth. The Central Duparquet fault has 
an orientation subparallel to the Donchester fault. Strike-slip offset along these major 
structures  is  not  significant.  Neither  the  downdip  component  of  movement  nor  the 
slip vector could be determined. 
 
Late  crosscutting  faults  interpreted  in  plan  view  (Fig.  7.4)  are  likely  to  have  some 
impact  on  displacing  the  gold-bearing  zones,  although  InnovExplo  was  unable  to 
verify their existence while modelling the mineralized material solids. It is assumed 
that  displacement  along  such  crosscutting  faults  is  minimal  and  without  significant 
consequences  at  the  scale  of  InnovExplo’s  interpretation.  Minimal  degree  of 
horizontal displacement can be seen from the drift mapping and drilling of the mine 
level plans.

Alteration 
Gold-bearing quartz veins within the DPMFZ have historically been associated with 
sericite-carbonate-ankerite-chlorite alteration haloes and late-stage quartz-carbonate 
veins with ankerite haloes. 
 
Gold-bearing mineralization within the Duparquet deposit (including the Beattie and 
Donchester  mines,  as  well  as  the  Central  Duparquet  deposit)  is  associated  with 
carbonate, chlorite, fuchsite, and sericite alteration as a product of hydrothermal fluid 
injection  within  sheared  and  brecciated  sections  of  the  syenite  porphyries. 
Silicification  of  fractures  and  chert-calcite-rich  accumulations  along 
fractures 
accompanied  by  pyrite-arsenopyrite  host  rock  replacement  have  been  observed 
within  the  mineralized  zones.  The  chert  is  dark  grey  due  to  its  potassic-rich 
composition and the hematite and tourmaline content of the hydrothermal fluids.  
 
Mineralization 
Gold mineralization at the Beattie mine was historically associated with silicified and 
brecciated  zones  containing  a  low  percentage  of  very  fine-grained  pyrite  and 
arsenopyrite (Goutier and Lacroix, 1992). According to Bevan (2011), the “main” type 
of  gold  mineralization  in  the  Duparquet  deposit  generally  occurs  within  shears  or 
fracture  zones  along  or  within  the  adjacent  intrusive  syenitic  masses,  and  is 
associated  with  finely  disseminated  pyrite  and  minor  arsenopyrite  replacement. 
Sulphide content is generally low (0.5 to 4%), although it can be up to 10% in cases. 
Higher  gold  grades  appear  to  be  related  to  the  finer  grained  sulphides  (Bevan, 
2011).  Historically,  gold  production  at  the  Beattie  mine  was  accompanied  by 
extraction  of  arsenic  trioxide  and  silver  as  by-products.  The  “breccia”  type  of 
mineralized  material  is  found  within  the  metavolcanic  rocks  (lavas  and  tuffs)  and 
consists  of  well-mineralized,  siliceous,  brecciated,  grey-coloured  and  bleached 
zones. The porphyry mineralized material type consists of fine-grained and strongly 
silicified  mineralized  zones  hosted  by  the  porphyry  intrusives.  The  latter  generally 
has  lower  gold  grades  than  other  types  of  mineralized  zones  within  the  deposit 
(Bevan, 2011).  
 
The typical mineral assemblage found within mineralized material zones of all types 
is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  feldspar,  quartz,  sulphides  (pyrite  and 
arsenopyrite), sericite, chlorite and other secondary minerals. Mill tests suggest that 
some  35%  of  the  gold  is  in  a  free  state,  with  the  remainder  associated  with 
sulphides.  According  to  Bevan  (2011),  three  (3)  phases  of  gold  enrichment  or 
remobilization  can  be  interpreted  from  cross-cutting  relationships  of  gold-bearing 
veins.  Bevan  (2011)  also  states  that  higher  gold  contents  are  found  along  cross-
cutting faults, along the nose of folds and within the lath porphyry dyke intrusion as a 
consequence of remobilization processes. 
 
At the Beattie mine, the main mineralized lens is hosted by a shear zone (BFZ) at 
the north contact of the syenite intrusion (Fig. 7.4). In this report, the main zone  is 
referred to as the North Zone. A second gold-bearing lens, also hosted by a shear 
zone (DFZ) but occurring at the south contact of the syenite body, is also known at 
the Beattie mine and is referred to as the South Zone herein. Gold mineralization at 
the  Donchester  mine  was  higher  grade  and  associated  with  an  E-W  shear  zone 
cutting across some volcanic rocks and syenitic dykes (Goutier and Lacroix, 1992). 
This zone has been interpreted herein as the east extension of the South Zone. At

both  the  Beattie  and  Donchester  mines,  the  South  Zone  can  be  subdivided  into 
several  mineralized  “lenses”,  modelled  herein  as  ten  (10)  individual  sub-zones. 
Six (6)  other  major  striking  mineralized  zones  occurring  within  the  Beattie-
Donchester area have been interpreted by InnovExplo for the purpose of the current 
Mineral Resource Estimate. 
 
Mineralization at the Central Duparquet is hosted by the CDFZ, and is  of a similar 
nature as the South and North zones (Bevan, 2011). At Central Duparquet, three (3) 
mineralized zones have been interpreted by InnovExplo.  
 
The Dumico property corresponds to the eastern extension of the Central Duparquet 
property.  At  Dumico,  five  (5)  mineralized  zones  have  been  interpreted  by 
InnovExplo.  Three  (3)  of  these  mineralized  zones  are  striking  E-W  and  are 
interpreted as the “natural” extension of the CD Zones found at Central Duparquet. 
The  two  (2)  other  zones  are  striking  NW-SE  occur  on  the  eastern  portion  of  the 
Dumico  property.  Based  on  the  current  interpretation,  the  two  (2)  latter  zones  are 
considered  to  be  associated  to  a  subsidiary  structure  sub-parallel  to  the  regional 
DPMFZ. 
 
A total of thirty-four (34) secondary mineralized zones have been interpreted within 
the previously defined “inter-zone” mineralized envelope. The interpretation of these 
secondary mineralized zones, which are in majority striking SW-NE, is based on field 
observations  as  well  as  grade  continuity  throughout  the  samples  point  set.  These 
SW-NE  striking  mineralized  zones  are  interpreted  to  be  hosted  by  subsidiary 
structures associated with the BFZ and DFZ. 
 
The geometry, size and structural context of these zones are presented on Figures 
7.4 to 7.9. The interpreted zones show continuous mineralization occurring within a 
4.5  km  strike-length  corridor  measuring  1  km  wide  and  extending  to  about  1  km 
below surface. This mineralized corridor contains a relatively complex system of E-W 
and SW-NE striking structures hosting mineralized lenses, mainly confined between 
the BFZ and DFZ. Details on InnovExplo’s interpretation of the mineralized zones at 
the  Duparquet  Project  can  be  found  in  Section  14.1.1.2  –  Interpretation  of 
Mineralized Zones.

DEPOSIT TYPES

in  a
fine-grained
The standard orogenic gold model characterizes the majority of gold deposits within 
the Abitibi belt. However, several examples of late mineralization are disseminated 
and  associated  with  alkaline  intrusions  (Robert,  2001),  thus  differing  from  the 
standard orogenic gold model. Syenite-associated disseminated gold deposits in the 
Abitibi  greenstone  belt  consist  of  disseminated  sulphide  zones  with  variably 
developed quartz stockworks, which are intimately associated with Timiskaming-age, 
monzonitic to syenitic porphyry intrusions (Robert, 2001). Like quartz-carbonate vein 
deposits,  all  known  syenite-associated  disseminated  gold  deposits  in  the  southern 
Abitibi  belt  occur  along  a  major  fault.  As  a  result  of  their  distribution  along  major 
faults,  these  deposits  commonly  occur  at  or  near  boundaries  between  contrasting 
lithological domains. Examples of these deposits are Young-Davidson, Matachewan 
Consolidated, Ross, Holt-McDermott, and Lightening in Ontario; and Beattie, Douay, 
Canadian Malartic, East Malartic, and Barnat-Sladen in Québec.  
 
The Timiskaming-type sedimentary rocks occur along restricted segments of a major 
fault  zones,  where  they  are  preserved  as  synclinal  keels  (Muller  et  al., 1991). The 
syenite intrusions form small stocks, commonly elongated subparallel to the overall 
structural  trend  and  generally  surrounded  by  numerous  satellite  dykes  (Robert, 
2001). Although some intrusive phases are equigranular, most are porphyritic, with 
K-feldspar  phenocrysts 
to  aphanitic  groundmass.  Both 
Timiskaming-type  sedimentary  rocks  and  syenitic  intrusions  have  been  overprinted 
by  at  least  one  generation  of  structural  fabrics  and  folds  (Corfu  et  al.,  1991).  The 
sedimentary rocks are folded into tight synclinal structures, which probably accounts 
for  their  preservation,  subparallel  to  the  trace  of  the  major  faults  along  which  they 
occur  (Muller  et  al.,  1991).  A  related  penetrative  foliation,  best  developed  in 
sedimentary  rocks,  parallels  the  regional  penetrative  east-west,  subvertical  S2 
foliation.  This  foliation  is  absent  to  only  weakly  developed  in  the  larger  syenitic 
intrusions,  except  where  they  have  been  sericitized.  Overprinted  fault  and  shear 
zones are also common in these deposits (Robert, 2001). They range from relatively 
ductile  shear  zones  to  narrow  brittle  faults.  The  older  faults  are  parallel  to  the 
regional foliation overprinting the Timiskaming-type sedimentary rocks.  
 
Syenite-associated  disseminated  gold  deposits  consist  of  zones  of  disseminated 
sulphides with variably developed stockworks in intensely altered wallrocks (Robert, 
2001).  They  have  sharp  diffuse  limits,  defined  by  a  decrease  in  sulphide  content, 
gold  grades,  and  intensity  of  stockwork  fracturing.  Owing  to  the  abundance  of 
microveinlet  stockworking  and  fracturing,  many  orebodies  take  on  a  breccia 
appearance. The morphology of the deposits ranges from overall tabular to pipe-like, 
although  many  have  rather  irregular  outlines.  Most  mineralized  zones  are  steeply 
dipping  or  steeply  plunging,  but  examples  of  moderately  to  shallowly  dipping 
orebodies, discordant to lithological units, are also known (Robert, 2001).  
 
The  total  sulphide  mineral  content  of  the  orebodies  is  typically  less  than  10%  by 
volume,  and  commonly  a  few  percent  (Robert,  2001).  Disseminated  sulphides  are 
fine-  to  very  fine-grained  and  consist  dominantly  of  pyrite,  with  significant 
arsenopyrite  in  a  few  deposits.  Associated  stockworks  consist  of  millimeter-  to 
centimeter-thick  veinlets  of  grey  to  cherty  quartz,  with  subordinate  amounts  of 
carbonate  (Fe-dolomite  and  calcite),  albite,  and  pyrite.  In  addition  to  pyrite  and 
arsenopyrite,  ore-related  metallic  minerals  include  minor  to  trace  amounts  of
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
86
www.innovexplo.com
chalcopyrite  and  hematite.  Telluride  minerals,  molybdenite,  and  magnetite  are 
common  associates  of  this  type  of  mineralization,  whereas  galena,  tennantite,  and 
bismuthinite occur at few deposits. Accordingly, orebodies are generally enriched in 
Cu, As, Te, with common, but variable, enrichments in Pb, o, W, Zn, and locally Sb. 
The gold:silver ratios of the ores generally range from about 1:1 to 5:1. 
 
Zones of hydrothermal alteration are spatially coincident with zones of disseminated 
sulphide minerals and veinlet stockworks, and most intense alteration corresponds in 
a  general  way  to  economic  mineralization  (Robert,  2001).  Carbonatization  and 
albitization are significant alteration types at nearly all deposits; K-feldspar alteration 
and sericitization are also present in several deposits. 
 
The  disseminated  gold  orebodies  occur  in  a  variety  of  positions  relative  to  syenite 
intrusions,  ranging  from  proximal  to  distal  (Robert,  2001).  A  conceptual  model  is 
proposed  by  Robert  (2001)  for  occurrence  of  disseminated  gold  mineralization  as 
part of large, syenite-centred hydrothermal systems (Fig. 8.1). This system is shown 
in its interpreted primary configuration, prior to post-Timiskaming folding and faulting. 
A  composite  syenite  stock  is  shown  intruding  along  a  pre-Timiskaming  fault  zone 
juxtaposing contrasted lithological domains. The early phase of intrusion is truncated 
by the unconformity; whereas the younger phase intrudes sedimentary rocks.

Figure 8.1 – Schematic geological model showing the distribution of 
disseminated-stockwork orebodies relative to a composite syenite 
stock intruded along a major fault zone, near the base of the 
Timiskaming unconformity (from Robert, 2001).
The  Beattie  Syenite  is  an  Archean  porphyry  intrusion  emplaced  along  the  major 
Porcupine-Destor-Manneville Fault Zone (Fig. 7.4). The syenite is aligned along an 
east-west  axis;  it  is  hosted  by  mafic  and  intermediate  volcanic  rocks  and  is 
penecontemporaneous  with  the  Timiskaming  sedimentary  rocks  deposition.  The 
main gold mineralization is associated with a network of east-west dextral strike-slip 
faults dipping steeply to the north. Syenitic intrusions indirectly control the location of 
gold deposits by their effect on the development of potentially mineralized structures 
during diapirism. The current structures hosting the mineralization are shear zones 
and folds. The Duparquet Formation is characterized by folding (Goutier and Lacroix, 
1992). Gold deposits in the Duparquet area are genetically related to these intrusive 
rocks.  The  gold  deposits  tend  to  occur  in  concentric,  normal  and  radial  strike-slip 
faults  and  shears.  Lateral  ballooning  and  forceful  intrusion  may  also  generate 
concentric  compressional  structures 
faults  and 
compressional fabrics). Gold deposits in the Duparquet area tend to occur close to 
the  syenite-sedimentary  and/or  volcanic  rock  contacts.  This  is  attributed  to  the 
competency  contrasts  between  the  syenitic  rocks  and  the  Duparquet  Formation 
lithologies  during  deformation,  resulting  in  favourable  structural  traps  for  gold 
mineralization.

In  the  Duparquet  area,  the  main  alteration  observed  is  silicification.  Sericitization, 
ankeritization  and  chloritization  are  other  types  of  alteration  associated  with  gold 
mineralization  (Goutier  and  Lacroix,  1992).  The  main  sulphide  is  pyrite  (<10%) 
accompanied  by  arsenopyrite  (Davidson  and  Banfield,  1944).  Gold  is  hosted  in 
arsenopyrite  and  arsenian  pyrite  (Bigot  and  Jébrack,  2012).  Gold  grains  are  less 
than  micron-sized.  The  association  with  arsenian  minerals  and  the  very  small  size 
suggests that gold was incorporated into the crystalline structure of arsenopyrite and 
arsenian pyrite in solid solution or as nanoparticles (Bigot and Jébrack, 2012).  
 
The metallic assemblage in Beattie syenite is polyphased (Bigot and Jébrack, 2012): 
(1) a primary phase enriched in iron-titanium appears to have produced martite in a 
more  oxidizing  environment;  (2)  several  subsequent  sulphidation  phases  were 
marked  by  the  presence  of  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite,  some  rich  in  gold,  suggesting 
crystallization under more reducing conditions and at lower temperatures. During the 
sulphidation phases, three generations of pyrite are identified; the first generation is 
arsenian and gold-bearing, whereas the second and third are arsenic-poor and gold 
free.  (3)  A  late  silica-enriched  hydrothermal  phase  remobilized  the  gold  and  is 
marked by cataclasis. Gold migrated into the fractures developed in the cataclastic 
pyrite, where it crystallized with silver in the form of electrum. 
 
According  to  Bigot  and  Jébrack  (2012),  several  petrological  characteristics  in  the 
Beattie  gold  deposit,  including  gold  appearances,  metallic  mineralogy,  type  of 
alterations, and ore control, suggest a shallow magmatic deposit.

EXPLORATION
www.innovexplo.com
Since  the  most  recent  resource  cut-off  date  (May  6,  2013),  Clifton  Star  has 
completed  47  diamond  drill  holes  totalling  7,422.5  metres  of  drilling.  The  2013 
diamond drill program was complete as of August 14th, 2013. 
The 2013 outcrop stripping and surface channel sampling program, which was not 
included  in  this  report,  or  the  most  recent  resource  calculation,  was  completed  in 
November  of  2013.  During  this  surface  sampling  program,  a  total  of  41  outcrops 
were mechanically stripped and channel sampled, which resulted in the collection of 
1,001 samples.

DRILLING
www.innovexplo.com
Information in this section was obtained from the Clifton Star exploration team and 
combined with InnovExplo’s database compilation work.  
 
Clifton  Star  contracted  Foramex  to  operate  two  (2)  diamond  drill  rigs  capable  of 
recovering NQ size core on the Duparquet Project. The drilling was done using NQ 
rods.  Clifton  Star  has  been  positioning  its  drill  hole  collars  using  a  hand-held  GPS 
unit. Once the holes are drilled, a more accurate DGPS survey is used on the collar 
to  measure  its  location  (x,y,z)  as  well  as  the  collar  azimuth  and  dip.  Down-hole 
orientation surveys are done using a Reflex-Shot instrument. Rock on the Duparquet 
Project is of a really good quality and the recovery is high. The samples taken from 
that  core  is  then  representative  and  of  a  good  quality.  Clifton  Star  uses  the  core 
shack  facility  at  the  Beattie  mine  site  for  core  handling,  core  logging  and  storage. 
Once  delivered  to  the  core  shack,  the  core  boxes  were  opened.  The  core  was 
measured  for  recovery  and  RQD  as  well  as  photographed.  RQD  measurements 
indicated  excellent  recoveries.  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  core  samples 
from those drilling programs are valid and of sufficient quality to be used for mineral 
resource estimation. 
 
The vast majority of the holes are drilled from the hanging wall to the footwall of the 
mineralized zones, mainly perpendicular in azimuth to the east-west trending of the 
mineralized zones but with variable angles in dip. Downhole lengths of mineralized 
zones do not represent true thicknesses of the given zones. 
 
Drill  core  samples  were  taken  along  the  entire  length  of  the  holes.  The  sample 
lengths  varied  from  typically  1.0  metre  length  in  the  mineralized  sections  to  1.5  m 
length  in  the  more  barren  sections.  Limit  of  individual  samples  respected  the 
contacts of the geological units and the visible mineralization. The true thicknesses 
of the intersections in the mineralized  zones are typically 60% of the core lengths, 
but  can  be  as  low  as  30%  due  to  structural  variations  in  the  dip  and  strike.  The 
mineralized  zones are typically sub-vertical  with the holes drilled at -50 degrees to 
the horizon.  
 
Drill holes are divided into two (2) groups: those that were completed prior to the last 
mineral  resource  cut-off  date  of  May  6,  2013  performed  by  Williamson  et  al., 
(2013b),  and  thus  included  in  this  update  (“Phase  1”),  and  those  that  were  drilled 
after the resource database cut-off date of May 6, 2013 (“Phase 2”). 
 
Phase 1: 2012-2013 drilling program – included in the last resource estimate update 
From  September  2012 to  May  2013,  Clifton  Star  drilled  a  total  of  ninety  eight  (98) 
new holes. Overall, the 2012-2013 drilling program produced 25,253 m of NQ-size 
core during this period. 
 
Table 10.1 provides details on drilling carried out from September 2012 to May 2013 
on the Beattie, Donchester and Central Duparquet properties. To summarize, a total 
of 25,253 m of new core has been produced across the three (3) properties: 7,758 m 
on Beattie; 11,974 m on Donchester; and 5,521 m on Central Duparquet.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY
The following paragraphs describe Clifton Star’s sample preparation, analyses, and 
security  procedures  during  the  diamond  drill  hole  (DDH)  program  carried  out 
between  September  15,  2012  and  May  6,  2013  on  the  Duparquet  Project 
(Williamson et al., 2013b).  
 
Techni-Lab  S.G.B.  Abitibi  Inc.  (“Techni-Lab”),  an  ISO  17025  accredited  facility  in 
Sainte-Germaine-Boulé,  Québec,  was  used  for  assaying  samples  from  the  DDH 
program performed between September 15, 2012 and May 6, 2013 on the Beattie, 
Donchester  and  Central  Duparquet  properties.  Techni-Lab 
is  a  commercial 
laboratory independent of Clifton Star and has no interest in the Duparquet Project. 
 
The  2012  drill  cores  were  shipped  to  the  laboratory  in  batches  containing  variable 
numbers of samples. Regardless of the number of samples per batch, one (1) blank 
and  one  (1)  certified  material  reference  (standard)  were  inserted  for  every  twenty 
(20)  samples.  At  the  request  of  Clifton  Star,  the  laboratory  assayed  one  (1)  pulp 
duplicates every twenty (20) samples.  
 
For each 100 samples sent to Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc., numbers ending in the 
following digits were selected for the QA/QC samples:
•  15, 35, 55, 75, or 95 = standard; 
•  17, 37, 57, 77, or 97 = pulp duplicate of preceding sample; 
•  20, 40, 60, 80, or 00 = blank.
Sample Preparation (Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc.) 
The  drill  core  was  boxed,  covered  and  sealed  at  the  drill  rigs,  and  transported  by 
Foramex  drilling  employees  to  the  core  logging  facility  at  the  Beattie  mine  where 
Clifton Star personnel would take over the core handling. The core was logged and 
sampled by, or under the supervision of, Clifton Star geologists, all members in good 
standing of the OGQ (Québec Order of Geologists). Each sample was tagged with a 
unique number. 
 
Drill core samples were sawed by technicians and then bagged and sealed before 
being grouped in batches. The sample batches, and the shipping manifest listing all 
samples  included  in  the  batch,  were  shipped  directly  to  Techni-Lab  by  Clifton 
employees  where  they  were  prepared  according  to  the  laboratory’s  sample 
preparation protocol for the given analytical procedure. 
 
At Techni-Lab, each sample was crushed in its entirety using either an oscillating jaw 
crusher or a roll crusher, with the specification that more than 85% of the crushed 
material must pass a 2.4 mm (8 mesh) screen. A 250- to 300-gram fraction derived 
from the crushing process was then pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing 106 
µm (150 mesh).

Sample Preparation (Accurassay) 
Furthermore,  10%  of  samples  having  a  content  of  gold  superior  to  0.3  g/t  Au  are 
randomly selected and sent to another laboratory. First, selected pulp samples were 
sent to Accurassay Laboratory, an ISO 17025 accredited facility in Thunder Bay in 
Ontario.  
 
The sample preparation was the same as Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc. If no pulp 
was  available  for  the  second  assaying,  the  reject  of  the  sample  was  used  for 
assaying. In the case where no pulp and no reject was available, a quarter-split of 
the core was sent to the laboratory. 
 
Gold Analysis (Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi Inc.) 
For  the  drill  core,  gold  was  analyzed  by  fire  assay  with  AAS  (atomic  absorption 
spectroscopy)  finish  using  a  50-g  nominal  sample  weight.  For  the  fusion  process, 
only  twenty-four  (24)  samples  can  be  assayed  together.  Twenty  (20)  samples  of 
Clifton Star and four (4) quality control samples added by Techni-Lab S.G.B. Abitibi 
Inc form a single batch of twenty-four (24) samples. For each batch, Clifton Star thus 
ensures  that  each  of  their  quality  control  samples  (1 analytical  blank,  1  certified 
reference materials and 1 pulp duplicate) are present during the fusion process. To 
these  batches,  the  laboratory  randomly  added  four  (4)  additional  quality  control 
samples  that  correspond  to  one  (1) analytical  blank,  two  (2)  certified  reference 
materials and one (1) pulp duplicate). 
 
For grades over 5.0 g/t Au obtained by fire assay, samples were re-assayed with a 
gravimetric  finish.  If  the  assay  result  from  gravimetric  finish  is  over  10  g/t  Au,  the 
sample is again assayed by metallic sieve method. 
 
Gold Analysis (Accurassay) 
The  analytical  method  was  the  same  as  Techni-Lab  S.G.B.  Abitibi  Inc. For  grades 
over 5.0 g/t Au obtained by fire assay, samples were re-assayed with a gravimetric 
finish. If the assay result from gravimetric finish is over 10 g/t Au, the sample is again 
assayed by metallic sieve method. 
 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedure 
Blanks 
 
The field blank used for the drilling (DDH) program performed between September 
15,  2012  and  May  6,  2013  was  a  crushed  sample  of  gold-barren  marble.  One  (1) 
field blank was inserted for every twenty (20) field samples. 
 
Clifton Star’s quality control protocol stipulates that if any blank yields a gold value 
above  0.03  g/t  Au,  all  samples  that  precede  the  failed  blank  up  to  the  previous 
passed blank and all samples that follow the failed blank up to the next passed blank 
should be re-analyzed.  
 
A total of 1226 blanks were assayed during the period between September 15, 2012 
and May 6, 2013. Only one blank did not pass the quality control procedure of Clifton 
Star, which represents less than 0.08%.

Pulp Duplicates 
At the request of Clifton Star, the laboratory assayed one (1) pulp duplicates every 
twenty (20) samples. The precision of the pulp duplicates can be used to determine 
the  incremental  loss  of  precision  for  the  pulp  pulverizing  stage  of  the  process, 
thereby establishing whether a given pulp size taken after pulverization is adequate 
to ensure representative fusing and analysis. 
 
Clifton Star used a graph generated by GeoticLog software to validate the data from 
pulp  duplicate.  On  graph,  the  gold  values  were  plotted  with  a  confident  interval  of 
90%. All pulp duplicate, with each sample reference, located outside of the confident 
interval were re-analyzed. 
 
A total of 1111 pulp duplicates was assayed during the period between September 
15,  2012  and  May  6,  2013.  Only  thirty-two  (32)  pulp  duplicates  did  not  pass  the 
quality control procedure of Clifton Star, which represents less than 2.88%.  
 
Certified Reference Materials (standards) 
For the drilling (DDH) program performed between September 15, 2012 and May 6, 
2013,  one  (1)  certified  reference  material  (CRM)  standard  was  inserted  for  every 
twenty (20) samples. The assigned grades for the nine (9) CRM standards used for 
the drilling program ranged from 0.263 g/t Au to 2.360 g/t Au. Table 11.1 presents 
details on the CRMs used by Clifton Star for the 2012-2013 drilling program.

The accuracy of the result (as a percentage) is measured as the difference between 
the average of the standard’s samples and the value assigned for the standard. For 
a  laboratory,  a  good  accuracy  constitutes  of  the  ability  to  give  results  as  near  as 
possible  to  the  expected  value.  The  precision  of  the  result  (as  a  percentage)  is 
represented by the dispersion of the standard’s samples versus their average. For a 
laboratory, a good precision constitutes the ability to repeat results with the smallest 
standard  deviation  possible.  The  difference  between  accuracy  and  precision  is 
illustrated by Figure 11.1.

Samples
LAB A with Standard Deviation of 0.62 g/t Au = 12.4%
LAB B with Standard Deviation of 0.07 g/t Au = 1.4%
Figure 11.1 – Two laboratories (LAB A and LAB B) have analyzed the same standard 
grading 5.0 g/t Au using the same number of samples (n=20) to produce the same 
final average (5.0 g/t Au). Accuracy is perfect (0%) for both, but the precision of LAB 
B is better (1.4%) than the precision of LAB A (12.4%).
Clifton  Star’s  quality  control  protocol  stipulates  that  if  any  standard  yields  a  gold 
value above three standard deviations (Table 11.1), the standard is failed. But, if the 
gold  values  obtained  for  two  consecutive  standards  are  between  two  and  three 
positive  standard  deviation  or  between  two  and  three  negative  standard  deviation, 
these two standards are failed. All samples that precede the failed standard up to the 
previous passed standard and all samples that follow the failed standard up to the 
next passed standard should be re-analyzed.  
 
A total of 1241 standards were assayed during the period between September 15, 
2012  and  May  6,  2013.  Fifty-two  (52)  standards  did  not  pass  the  quality  control 
procedure of Clifton Star, which represents less than 4.2%.  
 
Duplicate Analyses by Two Different Laboratories 
Ten percent of samples having a content of gold superior to 0.3 g/t Au are randomly 
selected  and  sent  to  another  laboratory.  A  total  of  164  samples  were  sent  to  the 
Accurassay  laboratory  in  Thunder  Bay,  Ontario.  Of  these,  four  (4)  are  considered 
outliers.  
 
Figure 11.2 plots the duplicate gold analyses for 164 samples from the two different 
laboratories.  The  green  circles  represent  gold  results  with  a  field  of  relative 
difference  of  about  ±20%.  Two  green  lines  illustrate  this  interval  of  relative 
difference.  Both  laboratories  produced  generally  similar  gold  results  with  relatively

Figure 11.2 – Plots duplicate analyses from two different laboratories. Green 
circles represent results with a field of relative difference of about ±20%. Red 
triangles are outliers
For the current drilling program, only fifteen (15) results among 164 plotted outside 
the ±20% field of relative difference, representing 9.1% of the total population. These 
outliers  are  represented  by  red  triangles  on  Figure  11.2.  The  observation  of  some 
outliers  on  Figure  11.2  suggests  the  presence  of  a  nugget  effect  in  some  of  the 
Duparquet Project gold results.

falling  between  the  two  green  lines.  The  linear  regression  slope  corresponds  to 
0.969 with a correlation coefficient of 99.31%. The correlation coefficient (%) is given 
by  square  root  of  R²  and  represents  the  degree  scatter  of  data  around  the  linear 
regression  slope.  The  results  obtained  indicate  an  excellent  reproducibility  of  gold 
values.

Conclusions 
A statistical analysis of the QA/QC data provided by Clifton Star did not outline any 
significant analytical issues.  
 
InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  sample  preparation,  analysis,  QA/QC  and 
security protocols of Clifton Star for the drilling (DDH) program carried out between 
September  15,  2012  and  May  6,  2013  on  the  Duparquet  Project  generally  follow 
accepted industry standards.  
 
Based  on  these  results,  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  following  the  addition  of 
new drilling data, the compiled resource database is valid and of sufficient quality to 
be used for mineral resource estimation. 
 
Bulk Sampling Drilling 
Clifton  Star  hired  SGS  Lakefield  (“SGS”),  in  Ontario,  to  carry  out  the  metallurgical 
testwork. SGS requires a minimum of 10 tonnes of rock and Clifton Star selected the 
representative sample from the resource area defined inside the pit-shell referred to 
in  the  2013  Technical  Report  by Williamson  et al.  (2013b). The  sample  comprises 
material from six (6) mineralized zones. Clifton Star decided to sample the entire drill 
core of mineralized intervals using large-diameter diamond drill holes (HQ-diameter) 
(“HQ-holes”).  The  HQ-holes  were  twins  (i.e.,  in  close  proximity)  of  the  reference 
diamond drill holes, labelled master holes. The master holes were of NQ-diameter. 
Clifton Star decided to extract 12 tonnes of material in anticipation of possible loss of 
material during drilling activities.  
 
Forty-six (46) large HQ-holes were completed on the Duparquet Project for a total of 
3,894.9  m,  including  1,467.7  m  of  sampled  mineralized  zones  for  a  total  weight  of 
11,991 kg (Table 11.2). One to two drill rigs were operating during the program from 
January 23 to March 6, 2013. Drilling was carried out by Foramex Diamond Drilling 
Inc. 
 
The  collar  positions  of  HQ-holes  (Fig.  11.3)  were  determined  from  the  casings  of 
master holes and/or from HQ-holes already drilled with an initial spacing of 0.5 m in 
the N-S direction and of 1.0 m in the E-W direction. Note that the selected master 
holes are oriented in a general North-South direction except for master hole BD11-
339 (Table 11.3), which is oriented 71° north. 
 
InnovExplo and Clifton Star were both responsible for defining the sampling protocol 
described below (Servelle and Pelletier, 2013). Daily follow-up of bulk sample drilling 
was realized using Clifton Star’s reports of information on vertical cross sections.

The  drill  core  was  boxed,  covered  and  sealed  at  the  drill  rig  and  then  moved  by 
Foramex’s drilling staff to the Clifton Star logging and sample preparation facilities in 
Duparquet.  The  area  was  exclusively  dedicated  to  the  bulk  sample  program.  Core 
was  immediately  checked  by  Clifton  Star’s geologists  to  validate  drill  progress  and 
lithologies. Geologists had access to the complete master hole as reference for the 
associated HQ-holes. 
 
Drill  core  measurements  were  validated  by  field  workers  from  Clifton  Star  and 
consisted  of  correcting  any  significant  discrepancies  in  the  down  hole  distance 
measurements (wooden block depth markers placed every 3 m along the core) as 
well  as  checking  core recovery.  Rock  quality  designation  (RQD)  using a  reference 
spacing  of  3  m  and  discounting  core  pieces  less  than  10  centimetres  long  was 
measured. The core was systematically photographed by the field workers. 
 
Logging  and  quick  descriptions  of  the  drill  core  of  HQ-holes  were  completed  by 
qualified professionals from Clifton Star who are members, in good standing, of the 
OGQ (Québec Order of Geologists) or the OIQ (Québec Order of Engineers). Core 
logging  and  data  entry  was  done  using  a  laptop  with  Geotic  Log®  software.  Core 
logging protocols required the following to be documented and described:
•  Principal lithologies with colours, textures and contacts; 
•  Secondary lithologies were described according to the same parameters; 
•  Alteration style and intensity; 
•  Mineralization,  generally  determined  by  sulphide
type  and  sulphide
concentration in total core volume; 
•  Vein type, density and orientation;
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
103
www.innovexplo.com
•  Structural parameters, such as fractures, fault angles, hydrothermal breccias,
folds, kink bands, etc.
The  master  hole  was  used  as  reference  for  core  logging  and  for  the  selection  of 
zones  to  be  sampled.  Zone  selection  was  carried  out  by  Clifton  Star’s  geologists 
under  the  supervision  of  Louis  Martin,  P.Geo.  Identification  of  zones  was  done  by 
direct  comparison  between  the  master  hole  and  the  HQ-holes.  Independent 
verification of each zone to be sampled was carried out by Guilhem Servelle, MSc, 
P.Geo., of InnovExplo Inc. The verification was carried out with the collaboration of 
Clifton Star’s geologists. 
 
After being validated by InnovExplo, whole drill core zones were sampled and put in 
large white rice bags (Fig. 11.4) according to the following protocol.
Figure 11.4 – Rice bags completely filled and sealed
The  full  core  of  zones  selected  in  the  twin  drill  holes  was  inserted  in  rice  bags 
specifically manufactured for bulk sampling. The rice bags were 1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m 
and were rated to handle 1000 kilograms of material. Made by Manyan Inc., they had 
never been used. To optimize integrity of loaded rice bags, they were put on wooden 
pallets and re-enforced with a plastic tarp lining. The rice bags were filled up to 900 
or 950 kilograms of core, numbered and stored in a secure area. Each filled rice bag 
is  sealed  by  Clifton  Star  personnel  with  a  numbered  tie-wrap  in  the  presence  of 
InnovExplo (Fig. 11.5).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
104
www.innovexplo.com
For each sampled zone, before insertion in rice bags, a weight check was conducted 
to identify hypothetical bias with the initially expected weight. For this purpose, whole 
drill  core  zone  was  subdivided  in  intervals  of  equal  length  of  approximately  6.0  m. 
Weight  measurement  for  intervals  of  whole  drill  core  was  determined  with  a 
mechanical  balance.  A  secondary  check  with  an  electronic  balance  returned  the 
same weight, with <2% variation. Weight checks were continuously followed on site 
by InnovExplo. Whole drill core recuperation is documented in Servelle and Pelletier 
(2013), and no critical loss of material was noted. During the program, no additional 
drilling was required due to recuperation discrepancy.
Figure 11.5 – Numbered tie-wrap used to seal filled rice bags
All rice bags were filled on site in the presence of InnovExplo. For rice bags partially 
filled  between  site  visits,  a  temporary  seal  was  affixed  for  security  purposes.  The 
seal  was  checked  before  commencing  and  broken  by  InnovExplo.  Complete  and 
sealed rice bags were stored at the roaster facility of the Beattie Mine in Duparquet 
pending final shipment to SGS. Before shipping to SGS, the rice bags were wrapped 
in  plastic  cling  wrap  with  their  respective  weight  chart  prepared  by  InnovExplo 
enclosed. 
 
The  rice  bags  left  Duparquet  on  March  11,  2013  and  were  delivered  to  SGS  on 
March  14,  2013  by  Transport  Manitoulin  Inc.  All  drill  core  not  sampled  from  twin 
holes is stored and categorized for future reference at the Clifton Star core storage 
facility. The core is currently kept in good condition in roofed outdoor core racks near 
the  roaster  facility  of  the  Beattie  Mine  in  Duparquet.  All  remaining  core  boxes  are 
labelled and properly stored. 
 
According to Servelle and Pelletier (2013), there is no indication of anything in the 
drilling, core handling, selection of samples and sampling procedures, methods and 
approach that could have had a negative impact on the reliability of the integrity of 
material destined to SGS.

DATA VERIFICATION
www.innovexplo.com
This  section  presents  the  verification  of  all  new  data  added  to  the  previously 
validated  database  used  by  InnovExplo  to  prepare  an  update  of  the  Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  dated  December  31,  2012  and  presented  in  the  “Technical 
Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Duparquet Project (according 
to  Regulation  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1)”,  released  on  February  28,  2013 
(Williamson et al., 2013a). 
 
The  new  data  includes  drill  holes  from  the  last  portion  of  the  2012  and  the  first 
portion  of  the  2013  drilling  programs  (Williamson  et  al.,  2013b),  as  well  as  new 
samples collected along previously drilled holes, for Beattie, Donchester and Central 
Duparquet  areas.  New  data  also  includes  a  series  of  holes  drilled  on  the  Dumico 
property in 2008-2009. Thirteen (13) of the nineteen (19) Dumico holes have been 
entirely resampled by Clifton Star in 2012. InnovExplo created the final database in 
Geotic format and transferred it into GEMS software for the purposes of the resource 
estimation. 
 
The  database  cut-off  date  for  the  last  updated  resource  estimate  is  May  6,  2013. 
Holes that were incomplete at the cut-off date and recent channel samples were not 
included in the compilation. 
 
For  the  last  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  InnovExplo  has  verified  a 
representative  portion  of  the  new  data  provided  by  Clifton  Star  for  the  Beattie, 
Donchester and Central Duparquet portion of the dataset. The Dumico related holes 
have  been  submitted  to  full  data  verification  where  all  collar  locations  and  assays 
certificates have been checked and validated prior to the import in the final database. 
 
The  following  are  the  details  of  the  data  verification  conducted  by  InnovExplo  and 
presented  in  the  “Technical  Report  and  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update for the 
Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1)”,  dated 
August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 2013b). 
 
Drill Hole Data 
A total of 117 new holes have been added to the previously compiled  and verified 
master database (Williamson et al., 2013b). The addition comprises thirty-four (34) 
holes from the Beattie property, thirty-eight (38) holes from Donchester, and twenty-
six (26) holes from Central Duparquet. Nineteen (19) holes from Dumico properties 
were also added to the master database. Eight (8) pre-existing holes have been re-
sampled by Clifton Star and were updated within the database. A total of seven (7) 
holes, drilled for the purpose of metallurgical testing in 2011, have been rejected and 
recent metallurgical twin holes (see Section 11.7) were not taken into consideration 
for  the  purpose  of  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate.  The  updated  master  database 
used for the last Mineral Resource Estimate thus contains a total of 849 diamond drill 
holes  totalling  260,948.4  m  and  168,555  sampled  intervals  (Williamson  et  al., 
2013b). 
 
Drill Hole Collar Locations and Downhole Surveys 
Collar position coordinates and azimuths are presented using the UTM system (NAD 
83, Zone 17). All new drill holes, including the Dumico holes, incorporated into the

master  database  have  been  surveyed  by  Patrick  Descarreaux,  and  the  data  used 
herein is as at May 6, 2013. 
 
In a small number of cases, there was a difference between the collar azimuth and 
the first valid downhole survey. In these cases, InnovExplo systematically used the 
first valid downhole survey azimuth for the collar azimuth. 
 
Downhole surveys’ azimuths obtained by any other methods than Gyro are giving a 
bearing  relative  to  geographical  north.  These  azimuths  were  corrected  by  -1.3334 
degrees in order to obtain UTM azimuths.  
 
Assay Verification 
For  the  Beattie,  Donchester  and  Central  Duparquet  drill  holes,  InnovExplo  verified 
the assay certificates for about 5% of the new drill holes received, corresponding to a 
full  verification  of  five  (5)  holes.  The  holes  were  selected  based  on  their 
representativeness, both in terms of the drilling program they were part of (i.e. 2012 
and  2013)  and  their  geographical  position  with  respect  to  the  mineralized  zones 
interpretation.  Table  12.1  presents  the  details  of  the  drill  holes  selected  by 
InnovExplo.

For these selected drill holes, 100% of the assays were reviewed by comparing the 
data  provided  by  Clifton  Star  and  the  raw  data  obtained  directly  by  the  assay 
laboratory  (Techni-Lab  in  Sainte-Germaine-de-Boulé).  In  all  five  (5)  cases,  no 
correspondence errors were found between the raw assays table provided by Clifton 
Star and the assay certificates obtained from the laboratory. 
 
For  the  nineteen  (19)  Dumico  drill  holes,  100%  of  the  assays  have  been  verified 
against the assay certificates.  
 
Table 12.2 presents the details of the assay verification done by InnovExplo for the 
Dumico drill holes. Minor correspondence errors, less than the 5% threshold used by 
InnovExplo as a failure criteria, have been corrected in three (3) drill holes. Ninety-
three  (93)  missing  assay  results  have  been  entered  from  the  assay  certificate  by 
InnovExplo for hole DUM09-08.

InnovExplo also randomly verified approximately 5% of the laboratory QA/QC checks 
and did not uncover any significant failures in the dataset. 
 
Channel Sample Data 
A total of 2,371 samples coming from 892 channels (for a total of 1,827 m in length) 
had already been entered and validated in the master database (Williamson et al., 
2013b). As no new channel samples have been provided by Clifton Star before the 
effective  date  of  May  6,  2013,  since  then,  no  further  verification  of  the  channel 
sample  data  was  deemed  required  by  InnovExplo.  The  2013  channel  sampling 
program  carried  out  by  Clifton  Star  was  not  included  in  the  last  mineral  resource 
estimate.  
 
Field Visits 
Kenneth Williamson of InnovExplo visited the Duparquet Project on July 4, 2013. 
 
This  field  visit  provided  an  opportunity  to  verify  the  new  data  integrated  into  the 
master database. In particular, key intervals of a few of the new drill holes and re-
sampled  drill  holes  were  reviewed  to  ensure  the  drill  hole  logs  accurately 
corresponded  to  sample  positions.  Special  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  Dumico 
property  as  this  series  of  drill  holes  had  never  been  integrated  into  the  master 
database by InnovExplo prior to the current Mineral Resource Estimate.  
 
Several outcrops and drill sites were visited and manual checks, using a hand-held 
GPS unit, were performed to verify the location of some selected drill hole collars.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

12.4
www.innovexplo.com
Visits to outcrops provided an opportunity to confirm the interpretation of several new 
zones added to the current Mineral Resource Estimate by performing a preliminary 
structural analysis of areas where the new zones crop out. This analysis showed that 
structures related to these new zones are present on the outcrops, strengthening the 
geometrical interpretation of the zones.  
 
The tailings area was revisited to ensure that the site had remained intact since the 
last visit, and most of the sampling sites were still in good condition. 
 
Database Integrity 
Following 
InnovExplo 
considers the  results to be  adequate for  calculating mean gold  values for  intervals 
containing multiple assays, regardless of the sample source or assay method used. 
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the final in-pit and underground drill hole database 
is  adequate  to  support  a  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  for  the  Duparquet  Project, 
including the Beattie, Donchester, Central Duparquet and Dumico properties.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
Introduction 
Bench scale and pilot plant metallurgical testwork programs have been  carried out 
for the Duparquet Project. The preliminary metallurgical testwork was carried out in 
2012 by SGS to support the Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA"; Willamson 
et  al.,  2013a).  In  2013,  SGS  carried  out  further  flotation,  pressure  oxidation, 
cyanidation,  rheology  and  environmental  testwork  including  a  pilot  plant  for  the 
current PFS. Outotec was also mandated in 2013 to carry out filtration testwork. The 
following is a list of reports from these test programs:

Previous testwork 
SGS Project Reference No. 13054-001 Final Report, May 24, 2012 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-001  Final  Report  includes  the  results  of  the 
flotation,  pressure  oxidation,  and  cyanidation  testwork  performed  in  order  to 
investigate  the  recovery  of  gold  from  ore  and  tailings  samples.  Preliminary 
comminution tests and environmental tests were also conducted during this program. 
 
The testwork was conducted on six ore samples and two in-situ tailing samples. The 
gold grade of the ore samples ranged from 1.3 to 3.5 g/t Au. The sulphide content 
ranged from 0.5% to 2.0% S. 
 
The Bond Work Index of the ore samples varied from 17.2 to 20.2 kWh/t, classifying 
them as hard to very hard ore. 
 
The  preliminary  gravity  separation  testwork  on  ground  ore  samples  indicated  low 
gold  recovery  ranging  from  3.7%  to  14.9%  and  averaging  8.6%.  Hence,  gravity 
separation was not pursued. 
 
As shown in Table 13.1 the recovery of gold to concentrate by flotation was greater 
than  90% for  most  samples.  The  Central  Duparquet  Main  sample  is  the  exception 
with 84.6% gold recovery, increasing to 87.9% with finer grinding. Gold recovery by 
pressure  oxidation  and  cyanidation  treatment  of  the  flotation  concentrate  was  also 
investigated and was consistently high. 
 
Samples  of  the  flotation  tailings  were  leached  under  conventional  cyanidation 
conditions. Standard bottle roll tests were conducted at 40% solids and pH 10.5 with 
0.5  g/L  NaCN  for  48  hours.  These  tests  gave  poor  gold  extractions  varying  from 
26.2% to 56.3%, confirming the refractory nature of the ore. 
 
The overall gold results from flotation concentrate, pressure oxidation (POX) and CIL 
circuit as well as flotation tail cyanidation for the ore are summarized in Table 13.1. 
The overall recovery of gold was ranging from 91.9% to 95.4%

Testwork was also performed on two samples of existing tailings on the Duparquet 
Property.  The  overall  results  for  the  flotation-POX/CIL  flowsheet  for  both  tailing 
samples are summarized in Table 13.2. The overall recovery of gold was 83.5% for 
sample T-1 and 93.3% for sample T-2.

SGS Project Reference No. 13054-002 – Report 1 – September 27, 2012 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-002  –  Report  1  includes  the  metallurgical 
testwork  that  was  conducted  on  six  flotation  concentrate  samples  produced  in  the 
previous 13054 – 001 test program. 
 
The  first  objective  of  this  program  was  to  attempt  to  reduce  costs  of  the  pressure 
oxidation  (POX)  and  carbon-in-leach  (CIL)  process  by  optimizing  conditions  and 
reducing 
lime 
consumption  in  CIL  which  was  attributed  to  the  slow  breakdown  of  basic  iron 
sulphates  produced  during  pressure  oxidation.  To  address  this  problem,  the  POX 
products  were  kept  at  95°C  for  4  hours  in  what  is  known  as  a  hot  cure  process 
allowing the precipitated basic iron sulphate to solubilise back into solution. By this 
approach, the lime consumption in the CIL circuit was reduced by up to 95%.  
 
Acid additions in the pre-acidulation stage before pressure oxidation  were reduced 
by approximately half (by 60 kg/t H2SO4) from the initial tests while maintaining the 
high degree of sulphide oxidation and high gold recoveries. In addition, the hot cure 
product solution was successfully used as the source of acid in the pre-acidulation 
step,  eliminating  the  fresh  acid  requirement  and  the  cost  of  neutralizing  the  POX 
product. Furthermore, the testwork showed similar gold recovery values in the range 
of  96-99%  at  a  lower  POX  temperature  of  210°C  compared  to  225°C  applied  in 
previous testwork. This would result in additional savings in pressure oxidation costs. 
 
The second objective was to generate final products for environmental studies. This 
included the flotation tailings, detoxified CIL pulp and hot cure neutralization sludge 
with each sample to be evaluated separately as well as a combined tailing product 
which included all three tailing streams. 
 
The  results  of  the  POX  and  CIL  tests  in  terms  of  sulphide  oxidation  and  gold 
recovery as well as reagent consumption are presented in Table 13.3.

The  pressure  oxidation  tests  were  carried  out  in  a  2  L  Parr  autoclave.  For  initial 
testing,  the  concentrates  were  pre-acidulated  at pH  1.8  with  sulphuric  acid for  120 
minutes as in the previous work. The POX temperature was lowered to 210°C from 
225°C. The oxygen overpressure was 100 psi during the 90 minute residence time. 
As per established practice, the pulp density used for each sample was calculated 
based  on  its  sulphide  content.  The  autoclave  discharge  was  filtered  and  washed. 
The  residue  was  repulped  to  40%  solids  and  cyanide  leached  for  24  hours 
maintaining 0.5 g/L NaCN and pH 10.5 with lime in the presence of 10 g/L activated 
carbon. The results are summarized in Table 13.4..

The results showed that lowering the POX temperature to 210°C did not significantly 
affect  gold  recovery.  All  further  pressure  oxidation  testwork  was  performed  at  this 
reduced temperature. 
 
Subsequent  testing  was  conducted  to  reduce  reagent  costs  for  the  POX-CIL 
flowsheet. The high lime consumption for most of the samples was indicative of the 
formation  of  basic  iron  sulphate  (BFS)  during  the  oxidation  process.  BFS  slowly 
breaks  down  at 
the  high  pH  during  CIL,  generating  acid  which  requires 
neutralization.  In  order  to  overcome  this,  a  hot  cure  stage  was  added.  In  the  hot 
cure,  the  autoclave  discharge  was  maintained  at  95°C  to  allow  the  basic  iron 
sulphate to re-dissolve at a much faster rate. After 4 hours, the pulp was filtered and 
washed  and  the  solids  were  repulped  for  CIL  as  before.  A  test  was  conducted  on 
each sample with the addition of the hot cure stage. 
 
Additional tests were performed to reduce the acid requirement in the pre-acidulation 
stage. In tests POX33 and POX34 conducted on the A Zone concentrate, the fresh 
acid  addition  was  reduced.  Then  the  effect  of  recycling  acid  from  the  hot  cure 
solution to replace the fresh acid requirement was investigated. Based on the results 
of POX-CIL33, the addition of acid was reduced by 50% up to a maximum of 60 kg/t
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

and  the  required  acid  addition  was  provided  by  recycling  hot  cure  solution  from  a 
previous  test  on  the  same  sample. The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  13.5  and 
Table 13.6. 
 
The addition of the hot cure stage was effective in reducing the lime requirement in 
CIL.  Lime  consumption  was  decreased  by  as  much  as  95%  (A  Zone)  after  hot 
curing. The recovery of gold remained essentially the same and ranged from 95.5% 
to 98.5% (based on concentrate). 
 
Sulphide oxidation was high in all tests except POX34. Reducing the acid addition by 
50%  up  to  60  kg/t  did  not  significantly  affect  gold  recovery.  Using  the  hot  cure 
solution  as  the  source  of  acid  for  pre-acidulation  was  effective  for  all  samples 
eliminating  the  need  for  fresh  acid.  Reducing  acid  addition  further  to  75%  in  test 
POX34 conducted on the A Zone concentrate did not result in adequate destruction 
of  carbonates  during  pre-acidulation  so  that  oxidation  of  the  sulphides  was  not 
achieved under the conditions applied. 
 
The recovery of gold from the pilot plant hot cure discharge ranged from 94.7% to 
96.5%  with  gold  recovery  slightly  higher  for  tests  conducted  after  90  minute  POX 
time (96.2%, Au in residue 0.96 g/t) than those tests conducted after the 60 minute 
POX time (95%, 1.21 g/t Au in residue). No testwork was conducted to determine the 
nature of the gold losses in the pilot plant residue samples. 
 
Lime boil was conducted at 95°C for 4 hours with the addition of 120 kg/t CaO for 
two  tests (CN15,  24)  and  at  75 kg/t  CaO  in  a third  test (CN25)  to  break  down  the 
jarosite  and  render  silver  recoverable  by  cyanidation.  The  addition  of  the  lime  boil 
resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  silver  recovery  from  9.2%  to  95.5%  as  well  as  an 
increase in gold recovery from 95.5% to 98.1%. Reducing the lime dosage below 75 
kg/t resulted in a reduction in gold and silver extraction. Optimum dosage appeared 
to be 75 kg/t of lime. 
 
Cyanidation  of  batch  pressure  oxidation  tests  (e.g.,  CN5-6)  yielded  better  gold 
recovery of ~98% and sulphur oxidation >99% than the pilot plant operation. Visual 
observations indicated that the pilot plant product contained more basic iron sulphate 
and jarosite and less hematite than the lab tests. The reason for the slightly  lower 
gold  recovery  in  the  tests  conducted  on  the  pilot  plant  product  may  be  due  to 
differences  in  the  precipitate  produced  in  the  pilot  plant  compared  to  the  batch 
pressure oxidation tests. The acidity of the solution and the concentration of cations 
such  as  Na+,  and  K+  will  impact  whether  hydrolysis  reactions  favour  haematite  or 
jarosite formation.  
 
There  is  insufficient  data  to  determine  the  relationship  between  sulphide  oxidation 
and  gold  recovery  and  whether  full  sulphide  oxidation  is  required  to  recover  the 
majority  of  the  gold.  Earlier  batch  testwork  showed  a  direct  relationship  between 
sulphide  oxidation  and  gold  extraction.  Hence,  a  high  overall  sulphide  oxidation 
target was maintained.

Gold leaching and carbon adsorption testwork
www.innovexplo.com
Leach  kinetic  tests  were  carried  out  to  determine  the  rate  of  gold  leaching  on  a 
washed hot cure thickener underflow composite. The leach testwork was conducted 
by bottle roll tests. The leach was conducted at 35% solids density as directed by 
Clifton Star. The NaCN concentration was maintained at 0.5 g/L and the pH at 10.5 
with lime. Each test was carried out for 48 hours with kinetic subsampling at 1, 2, 4, 
8, 12 and 24 hours.  
 
To  obtain  absorption  loading  kinetics  and  capacity  data  the  cyanided  leach  pulps 
that  were  generated  during 
testing  were  contacted  with 
predetermined  amounts  of  activated  carbon  in  batch  tests  and  bottle  rolled  for  72 
hours. Solution samples were taken for gold analysis at specific time intervals. The 
data  were  modelled  using  an  SGS  in  house  program  which  uses  semi-empirical 
models  developed  by  Mintek  in  the  1980s  to  predict  operation  and  plant 
performance.  Equilibrium  isotherms  for  gold  cyanide  loading  on  activated  carbon 
were generated and fitted to a Freundlich isotherm non-linear regression.  
 
Leaching kinetics were fast with gold leaching largely complete within the first two 
hours as illustrated in Figure 13.1.

The  gold  adsorption  isotherm  plot  with  the  predicted  curve  fit  is  shown  in  Figure 
13.2.  The  adsorption  equilibrium  constant  (Freundlich  constant  ‘a’)  determined  for 
the Duparquet washed solids hot cure thickener underflow was high at 13,513 and is 
attributed to the high gold grade of the residue and purity of the water.

Figure 13.2 - Gold adsorption isotherm 
 
 
SGS  modelled  the  leaching  and  adsorption  kinetics  for  gold  and  proposed  a 
leaching and carbon in pulp configuration for recovering the gold based on the data 
from  the  testwork  sample,  but  no  data  were  provided  for  silver  leaching  or 
adsorption kinetics. Based on the test results listed in Table 13.7 above, extractable 
gold and silver yields are expected to increase following lime boil from 95% to 98% 
for gold and from 9% to ≥89% for silver.  
 
The increased extraction of silver  will  impact the precious metal loading rates and 
capacity on carbon. Silver loads onto carbon more slowly than gold but elutes and 
electrowins  more  rapidly.  Hence  it  will  also  impact  carbon  in  pulp,  elution  and 
electrowinning design. 
 
The  leaching  and  carbon  in  pulp  circuit  were  remodelled  by  Tenova  Mining  & 
Minerals–Bateman  Engineering  Pty  Ltd  (“Tenova-Bateman”)  using  the  SIMCIL 
program  developed  in  the  AMIRA  P420  project  to  take  into  account  silver.  The 
throughput and pulp density have also been adjusted in the SIMCIL model to reflect 
expected  conditions  in  the  commercial  plant.  Both  SGS  and  SIMCIL  model 
conditions are presented in Table 13.8. 
 
Gold  and  silver  leach  rates  were  assumed  to  be  similar  at  0.8  t/h.g,  and  an 
adsorption  rate  of  0.010/hour.  Silver  leaching  rates  are  normally  slower  than  gold 
but as the silver is liberated from jarosite following lime boil it may be assumed that 
leaching will take place at a similar rate to gold. The Freundlich exponent constant 
‘a’  of  13,513  determined  by  SGS  was  used  and  the  ‘b’  value  set  at  1.0  for  silver 
modelling. The SIMCIL modelled output is shown in Table 13.9. The configuration of 
two leach tanks followed by six stages of carbon contacting was used in the SIMCIL 
model,  similar  to  that  utilised  in  the  SGS  model.  The  increased  precious  metal 
loadings on carbon necessitated almost doubling the carbon transfer rate from 1.5 
tpd to 2.5 tpd.

Further  work  is  required  to  investigate  leaching  and  adsorption  kinetics  on  lime 
boiled  samples  to  determine  the  impact  of  liberated  silver  on  precious  metal 
leaching  and  adsorption  kinetics  to  ensure  cyanidation  extraction  and  recovery 
circuit configurations are correctly designed.

A combination of limestone and lime successfully reduced the arsenic and iron level 
in solution to below 0.1 mg/L. The limestone used in this study was classified as a 
mine  site  limestone  with  a  grade  of  38%  carbonate  content.  Assuming  all  the 
carbonate is available for dissolution this is equivalent to between 176.7 and 220 kg 
of pure calcium carbonate per t. of hot cure discharge solids. For the final test (NT-
7)  where  a  combination  of  mine  site  limestone  and  reagent  grade  limestone  was 
used,  a  higher  consumption  was  observed  and  was  equivalent  to  258  kg  of  pure 
calcium carbonate per t. of hot cure discharge solids.  
 
A  combination  of  flotation  tailing  and  lime  additions  (NT  2  and  NT5)  was  also 
investigated but it was found to be an ineffective method for neutralizing the CCD
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

overflow liquor due to the large quantity of flotation tailing required to reduce the pH 
to 4.0. In addition, slightly elevated concentrations of As, Mn and Sr were observed 
in the final effluent neutralized with flotation tailings and lime. 
 
More  testwork  is  required  and  should  be  carried  out  on  limestone  sourced  for  the 
Project. In particular, tests should be performed to determine optimum particle size 
of the limestone, reaction kinetics and required dosage rates. 
 
After filtering the hot cure product, the solutions for each sample were neutralized 
using  limestone  and  lime.  The  purpose  was  to  prepare  the  neutralized  pulp  for 
subsequent environmental studies. CaCO3 was initially added to increase the pH to 
4.5.  The  slurry  was  conditioned  for  60  minutes.  Hydrated  lime  was  then  added  to 
increase the pH to 8. The test data are shown in Table 13.11.

The  sequential  neutralization  testwork  with  limestone  and  lime  successfully 
demonstrated that the arsenic and iron levels in thickener overflow solutions can be 
reduced  to  below  0.1  mg/L.  The  Fe3+/As  ratio  in  the  hot  cure  discharge  liquor  is 
suitably  high  to  favour  the  effective  stabilisation  of  arsenic  as  an  arsenate  upon 
neutralization.  
However  the  dosage  and  source  of  limestone  need  to  be  re-evaluated.  The 
neutralization  capacity  of  flotation  tailings  is  insufficient  to  be  used  as  a  first  step 
neutralization  agent  and  hence  was  not  included  as  a  neutralizing  agent  in  the 
process design. 
 
Cyanide destruction testwork
13.2.5
The SO2/air method was used to destroy the cyanide in the CIL tailings. Batch tests 
were conducted at pH 8.5 to lower the weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNWAD) level 
in  the  pulp  to  approximately  1  mg/L.  The  required  amount  of  copper  as  copper 
sulphate  was  added  to  catalyse  the  cyanide  oxidation  reaction  at  the  start  of  the 
test. SO2 was added continuously as a sodium metabisulphite solution. After 1 hour, 
the barren solution was sampled to determine the CNWAD level by picric acid. If the 
analysis  was >1 mg/L, the test was continued. The results are presented in Table 
13.12.

Although the CNWAD level was reduced to<1 mg/L, the total cyanide (CNT) level was 
significantly higher for the A Zone and Donchester N samples due to the presence 
of ferrocyanide. It should be noted that batch tests generally require higher reagent 
additions  than  required  in  continuous  operation.  Continuous  testing  is  required  to 
optimize the cyanide destruction conditions. 
 
Preparation of samples for environmental characterization 
Four  samples  were  prepared  for  environmental  characterization.  Three  of  the 
samples  represented  the  individual  tailing  streams  namely  the  flotation  tailing,  the 
cyanide  destruction  barren  pulp  and  the  POX  neutralized  liquor  and  sludge.  The 
fourth sample represented the combined tailing. It was prepared by combining the 
individual  streams  in  the  appropriate  relative  amounts  based  on  the  metallurgical 
test results. The details of sample preparation and the results of the environmental 
tests will be presented and discussed in a separate report and are presented below. 
 
SGS Project Reference No. 13054-002 – Report 2 – November 29, 2012 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-002  –  Report  2  includes  the  environmental 
characterization  of  the  flotation  rougher  tailings,  cyanide  destruction  barren  pulp, 
neutralization sludge, and the combined tailings products from the six ore samples. 
Environmental  tests  were  conducted  on  the  twenty-four  pulp  samples  from 
metallurgical  testwork  programs  (SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054  –  002 
Report 1). 
 
Test Methods 
 
The following sections provide a brief overview of the test methods included in the 
environmental characterization program. 
 
X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Whole Rock Analyses 
 
Whole  rock  analyses  were  completed  on  the  samples  using  XRF  in  order  to 
determine the elemental concentrations of the major rock forming constituents. This 
method quantifies major elements present and reports them as oxides to permit a 
mass balance assessment against the component of a sample that is amenable to 
oxidization (loss on ignition).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
125
www.innovexplo.com
ICP-OES/MS Strong Acid Digest Elemental Analyses 
 
The samples were digested using an acid mixture of HNO3, HF, HCIO4, and HCI to 
obtain a near total dissolution of the elements being analyzed. ICP-OES/MS trace 
metal  scans  were  performed  to  provide  quantitative  analyses  of  the  elemental 
components of the sample material. Analyses requested included: Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, 
Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, 
Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, and Zn. Mercury analyses were completed by cold vapour 
atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS). 
 
Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP- US EPA Method 1311) 
 
The TCLP was used to determine the mobility of inorganic contaminants present in 
the  waste  materials  which  would  be  chemically  stable  and  insoluble  under  the 
aggressive pH environment imposed by the method. 
 
A brief assessment of the sample's neutralization capacity determines the leachant 
used in the test. In cases where the sample has limited acid neutralization capacity, 
TCLP extraction fluid #1 is used. Extraction fluid #1 is a combination of glacial acetic 
acid and deionised water buffered by sodium hydroxide (resulting pH 4.93 ± 0.05). 
In  cases  where  the  residues  have  sufficient  acid  neutralization  capacity,  TCLP 
extraction  fluid  #2  is  used.  This  extraction  fluid  provides  2  eq/kg  of  acid  through 
addition  of  glacial  acetic  acid  to  deionised  water  (resulting  pH  2.88  ±  0.05).  The 
leachant  is  added  to  the  sample  at  a  20:1  liquid-to-solids  ratio  and  the  sample 
container is rotated end over end at 29 ± 2 rpm for 18 hours. The resultant slurry is 
then filtered on 0.7µm filter, the extract pH is determined and the extract is analyzed 
for total metals (including Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, 
Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, and Zn). 
 
Modified Acid Base Accounting 
 
The modified ABA test provided quantification of the total sulphur, sulphide sulphur, 
and sulphate concentrations present and the potential acid generation (AP) related 
to the oxidation of the sulphide sulphur concentration. The test method determined 
the neutralization potential (NP) of the samples by initiating a reaction with excess 
acid  and  then  identified  the  quantity  of  acid  neutralized  by  the  samples,  NP,  by 
back-titrating to pH 8.3 with NaOH. The balance between the AP and NP assists in 
defining  the  potential  of  the  sample  to  generate  acid  drainage.  In  addition, 
quantification  of  the  carbonate  mineral  content  permitted  calculation  of  the 
theoretical carbonate NP. 
 
Net Acid Generation Testing 
 
The  net  acid  generation  (NAG)  test  facilitates  a  reaction  between  the  sample  and 
concentrated hydrogen peroxide in order to force complete oxidation and reaction of 
the acidity produced with the neutralizing minerals present within the sample. This 
test  provided  confirmation  of  data  obtained  in  the  ABA  test.  It  also  indicated  the 
quantities  of  acid  produced,  and  thus  the  amount  of  additional  alkalinity,  if  any, 
needed to neutralize this acidity.

Decant Solution Analysis 
 
The  supernatants  were  decanted  from  the  settled  pulp  slurries  and  analyzed  to 
quantify  contaminant  concentrations  that  may  report  to  surface  or  ground  water 
systems  in  a  tailings  pond  setting. The  solutions  were  collected  and  submitted for 
chemical  analysis  of  the  following  parameters:  pH,  alkalinity,  acidity,  conductivity, 
Eh, TDS, TSS, F-, ammonia (NH3+NH4
-, total thiosalts, and 
total and dissolved metals as per the previously noted suite of parameters plus total 
hardness.  In  addition,  only  the  cyanide  destruction  (CND)  decant  solutions  were 
analyzed for total cyanide, weak acid dissociable cyanide, cyanate, and thiocyanate. 
 
In conclusion

1.  Whole rock and elemental analyses determined that the flotation, CND, and 
combined  tailings  samples  were  predominantly  comprised  of  silicate  with 
minor  amounts  of  aluminium,  iron,  potassium,  and  calcium,  while  the 
neutralization  samples  were  predominantly  calcium  and  iron  with  very  little 
silica, due a predominant gypsum composition.
2.  Analysis  of  the  Duparquet  TCLP  leachates  reported  all  Directive  019
parameters were at concentrations within the prescribed limits.
3.  Modified ABA testing classified the Duparquet flotation and combined tailings 
samples NPAG due to a readily available carbonate source of alkalinity and 
insignificant sulphide content, while the CND tailings had sufficient sulphide 
content to indicate that acid generation would be expected.
4.  NAG  testing  confirmed  the  NPAG  designation  provided  by  the  ASA  for the 
flotation  and  combined  tailings  samples.  The  NAG  analysis  also  suggests 
that the CND samples would not generate PAG conditions.
5.  The  Duparquet  flotation  tailings  decant  solutions  were  all  found  to  have
concentrations of contaminants that were within the regulatory limits.
6.  All CND decant solutions, with the exception of the RW-39 CND Decant and 
Dup-41  CND  Decant,  had  total  cyanide  concentrations  in  excess  of  the 
regulatory limit (1 ppm).
7.  Each  of  the  CND  decant  solutions  were  found  to  have  dissolved  arsenic 
concentrations  an  order  of  magnitude  above  the  regulatory  limit,  while 
elevated iron levels were due to suspended solids.
8.  The neutralization decants showed elevated arsenic and iron values but only 
exceeded  the  regulatory  limits  as  total  values  indicating  the  contaminants 
were associated with the suspended solids and would be expected to settle 
out of the water column over time.
9.  The  combined  tailings  decant  solutions  also  showed  elevated  arsenic  and 
iron  concentrations  in  the  total  solution  analyses,  with  arsenic  generally 
being above the Directive 019 limits.

SGS Project Reference No. 13054-003 – Final Report – February 5, 2013 
SGS Project Reference No. 13054-003 – Final Report summarizes the results of the 
flotation  testwork,  conducted  to  investigate  the  recovery  of  gold  from  six  (6)  ore 
samples. This program also included detailed concentrate analysis and cyanidation 
tests on the flotation tailings samples. 
 
Cleaner flotation  tests  were  conducted to  investigate  the  recovery  of the  gold  in  a 
saleable  sulphide  concentrate.  The  rougher  concentrate  with  P80  of  ~100  µm  was 
cleaned twice and a scavenger stage was applied following the first cleaner tailings. 
The  results  of  the  locked  cycle  tests  conducted  on  each  sample  are  presented  in

The gold recovery ranged from 75.5% (Central Duparquet Main sample) to 88.5% (A 
Zone sample). The cleaner concentrate gold grade ranged from 39.0 to 83.6 g/t Au 
and the sulphur grade ranged from 20.9% to 35.9% S. 
 
The  rougher  tailings  and  cleaner  scavenger  tailings  from  each  locked  cycle  test 
were leached separately to investigate the gold extraction. Table 13.14 indicates the 
leaching efficiency of cyanidation of the flotation tailings. Depending on the sample, 
between  3.9%  and  11.5%  additional  gold  was  leached  by  cyanidation  of  flotation 
tailings.

The  characterization  of  the  composite  sample  included  the  following  grindability 
tests:
•  Bond low-energy impact test 
•  JKTech drop-weight test 
•  SMC test 
•  Bond rod mill grindability test (RWI) 
•  Bond ball mill grindability test (BWI) 
•  Bond abrasion test 
•  HPGR test
The  Pilot  Plant  Feed  sample  was  characterized  as  very  hard  with  respect  to  both 
resistance to impact (Axb) and abrasion breakage (ta), as well as in terms of RWI. 
The  sample  was  characterized  as  hard  with  respect  to  the  BWI  and  HPGR  tests. 
The sample was also found to be very abrasive. All the results were in line with the 
six (6) previous samples, tested as part of SGS Project 13054-02. 
 
SGS Project Reference No. 13054-004 – Report 1 – June 20, 2013 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-004  –  Report  1  summarizes  the  results  of  the 
flotation tests conducted on a pilot plant (PP Feed) sample. The head sample was 
analyzed at 1.84 g/t Au, 1.16% S, 0.055% As and 7.61% CO3. The pilot plant was 
operated to generate bulk sulphide flotation concentrate containing 15-18% S for a 
subsequent pressure oxidation pilot plant to assess gold recovery and to generate 
60-80 kg of a higher grade flotation concentrate assaying over 40 g/t Au for direct 
sale market evaluation. 
 
In  the  flotation  pilot  plant,  the  ore  was  ground  to  a  P80  of  100  µm  and  a  rougher 
concentrate was recovered with addition of PAX and R208 collectors. The rougher
13.3.3

concentrate  was  reground  in  a  ball  mill,  operating  in  closed  circuit  with  a  cyclone. 
Pilot  plant  tests  PP-01  to  PP-06  were  conducted  with  one  cleaning  stage  to 
generate  the  pressure  oxidation  pilot  plant  feed.  Pilot  plant  tests  PP-07  to  PP-09 
were  conducted  with  two  cleaning  stages  to generate  the  high  grade  concentrate. 
Tests  PP-05  and  PP-09  were  operated  over  more  than  8  hours  under  relatively 
stable conditions. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 13.17.  
 
With one cleaning stage (PP-05) the recovery of gold was 91.7% in a concentrate 
containing  26.8  g/t  Au  and  16.1%  S.  The  results  of  PP-09  indicated  that  a 
concentrate  with  47.8  g/t  Au  could  be  produced  at  86.5%  gold  recovery.  Flotation 
tailings were leached with cyanide to recover the gold remaining in this material. The 
recovery  of  gold  from  the  PP-05  tailings  and  the  PP-09  tailing  were  45.1%  and 
40.2%,  respectively.  The  overall  gold  recovery  by  flotation  and  cyanidation  of  the 
flotation tailings is shown in Table 13.18.

Pressure oxidation feed (flotation concentrate)
SGS Project Reference No. 13054-004 – DRAFT- Report 2 – August 26, 2013 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-004  –  DRAFT  –  Report  2  summarizes  the 
pressure  oxidation  pilot  test  results  which  consist  of  feed  preparation,  pressure 
oxidation, a hot curing stage and thickening of the final hot cured autoclave residue.
The feed for the pressure oxidation testwork was produced from a blended mixture 
of  concentrate  produced  from  an  earlier flotation  pilot  plant  program  (SGS  Project 
13054-004  Report  1,  A  Flotation  Pilot  Plant  Investigation  into  the  recovery  of  gold 
from  Duparquet  Samples,  June  20,  2013).  The  composition  of  the  concentrate  is

The  flotation  concentrate  was  generated  from  a  composite  sample  produced  from 
drill core from across the deposit. The drill core selected and the average flotation 
feed ore grade (Au) were selected to be as representative as possible. The details 
of  sample  selection  are  summarized  in  the  SGS  report.  The  head  grade  of  the 
blended concentrate is 25.4 g/t gold, 32 g/t silver with sulphide grade at 16.8%. The 
sulphide  content  is  sufficient  to  operate  the  pressure  oxidation  process  under 
autothermal  conditions without  the requirement for  extra  heat. The  high  carbonate 
content  (4.35%)  necessitates  an  acid  pre-treatment  process  to  remove  carbonate 
before  pressure  oxidation  to  ensure  no  build-up  of  carbon  dioxide  pressure  in  the 
autoclave. 
 
No  mineralogy  of  the  concentrate  feed  was  reported  but  based  on  the  chemical 
composition the feed was calculated to have the mineralogical composition listed in 
Table 13.20.

Pressure oxidation pilot plant tests
The  pressure  oxidation  tests  were  carried  out  using  the  SGS  Lakefield  40L 
horizontal  high  pressure  titanium  vessel.  The  autoclave  was  operated  and 
maintained  at  a  temperature  and  oxygen  overpressure  of  210°C  and  700  kPa 
respectively. The operating conditions at 60 and 90 minutes residence times were 
evaluated. The oxygen addition rate equated to 0.45 and 0.48 t of O2/tconc for 90 and 
60  minutes  runs  respectively  (i.e.  2.7  and  2.9  t/t  of  sulphur  in  the  feed)  which  is 
~40% in excess of the stoichiometric amount.  
 
The feed density was maintained at 18% solids by premixing the concentrate with 
recycled acid solution. Recycled solution from the hot cure stage at 0.55 L/kg solid, 
containing  20  g/L  Fe3+  and  40  g/L  free  sulphuric  acid,  was  used  and  found  to  be 
sufficient to neutralize the carbonate in the feed concentrate. The carbonate content 
in the feed concentrates reporting to the autoclave ranged from <0.05 to 0.64%. 
A summary of the conditions and results are shown in Table 13.21. The increase in 
concentration  from  the  final  autoclave  chamber  to  the  autoclave  discharge  was 
attributed to concentration in the evaporation/flashing stage and some basic iron salt 
redissolution.

The reaction profile through the autoclave showed a similar trend for both 90 and 60 
minute retention times but with higher sulphide oxidation taking place earlier in the 
autoclave  for  the  slower  throughput  (90  minutes).  In  both,  sulphide  oxidation  was
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
largely complete after the third chamber of the 6-chambered autoclave. The majority 
of ferrous iron was converted to ferric after the sixth chamber. Overall, a 60-minute 
retention time appears to be sufficient to achieve a high level of oxidation. 
 
The  autoclave  discharge  liquor  had  on  average  47  g/L  free  sulphuric  acid  and 
contained ~11-12 g/L iron (>95% as Fe3+). Arsenic in solution was on average < 1 
g/L. The Fe/As ratio is sufficiently high in the POX liquor for stabilisation of arsenic 
as a ferric arsenate product following neutralization. The POX liquor also contained 
on average 1.7 g/L Al, 1.1 g/L Mg and 0.7 g/L Si. There appeared to be no obvious 
dissolution of chloride from the concentrate to cause any detrimental effect on both 
pressure oxidation reactions and gold deportment, with levels reported in the liquor 
of  23  mg/L  largely  from  the  Lakefield  river  water  used  to  pulp  the  concentrate. 
Comparisons  of  the  feed  and  autoclave  residue  are  provided  in  Table  13.22  and 
Table 13.23. 
 
X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the beige, yellowish autoclave discharge product 
was predominately a jarosite product with little haematite formed. The high free acid 
accompanied  by  the  dissolution  of  some  phyllosilicate  and  framework  silicate 
minerals promoted jarosite/alunite formation. The autoclave internals were generally 
clean indicating scaling was not a major issue. 
 
No  work  was  carried  out  to  optimize  the  pressure  oxidation  operating  conditions 
apart from retention time. The merits and amount of acid recycled to neutralize the 
carbonate in the feed to the autoclave needs to be investigated where lowering the 
free acidity in the autoclave may promote precipitation of hematite and control the 
amount  of  jarosite  formed.  The  trade-off  of  this  approach  will  be  that  increased 
carbonate in the feed to the autoclave will yield more carbon dioxide and reduce the 
oxygen partial pressure in the autoclave and increase the autoclave venting rate. An 
increased venting rate will lead to lower oxygen efficiency and higher rates of heat 
(steam) loss and hence are to be avoided if possible.

Hot cure
The autoclave discharge slurry was pumped directly to the first of four insulated hot 
cure  tanks.  The  hot  cure  was  initially  operated  with  four  tanks  providing  a  total 
retention time of 4 hours. The latter half of the pilot operated with five tanks having a 
total retention time of 5 hours. 
 
The operating conditions, iron species content, as well as free acid assays for hot 
cure  feed  (AC  Flash)  and  hot  cure  discharge  (HC#4),  are  summarised  in  Table 
13.24.  The  target  temperature  was  maintained  at  95  °C  with  steam  heated 
submerged heating coils within tanks.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

Iron in the hot cure discharge was ~17 g/L during the 90 minute autoclave retention 
time period and then increased to ~20 g/L when the retention time was reduced to 
60 minutes. Arsenic content remained consistent throughout at an average of ~1.7 
g/L. The total sulphur grade of the hot cure solids was consistently about 6% and 
close to the autoclave discharge slurry average of 6.4%. 
 
For the basic ferric sulphate dissolution, free sulphuric acid is consumed and soluble 
ferric iron concentration would be expected to increase. However there appeared to 
have been little evidence of re-dissolution of basic ferric sulphate, with the majority 
of  conversion  having  taken  place  within  the  autoclave  flash  let  down.  Changes  in 
concentrations between autoclave discharge and hot cure discharge appear largely 
related  to  the  flash  letdown  redissolution  of  basic  iron  salts  and  some  loss  of 
solution through evaporation.

Hot cure discharge thickening
The  hot  cure  discharge slurry  was  diluted  to  ~5-10%  solids  by  recycling  thickener 
overflow  and  injected  in-line  with  flocculant  Magnafloc  455.  Delivery  into  the 
thickener  allowed  for  a  suitable  mixing  and  contact  time  with  the  flocculant  agent. 
The hot cure thickener appeared to operate well with the solids settling rate reported 
to be fast.

Batch cyanidation test for extracting gold and silver
The  recovery  of  gold  and  silver  from  the  pilot  plant  hot  cure  discharge  was 
determined in bottle roll leach tests. A summary of results, including results from two 
batch  pressure  oxidation  laboratory  tests  carried  out  before  the  pilot  plant,  are 
shown in Table 13.7. Pulp samples from the hot cure discharge were taken from the 
pilot plant every 6 hours. The collected pulp was filtered, washed and then repulped 
with fresh water for cyanidation. The cyanide concentration was maintained at 0.5 
g/L  NaCN  and  the  pH  maintained  at  10.5-11  with  lime  addition  over  the  24  hour 
leach period. 
 
The recovery of gold from the pilot plant hot cure discharge ranged from 94.7% to 
96.5%  with  gold  recovery  slightly  higher  for  tests  conducted  after  90  minute  POX 
time (96.2%, Au in residue 0.96 g/t) than those tests conducted after the 60 minute 
POX time (95%, 1.21 g/t Au in residue). No testwork was conducted to determine 
the nature of the gold losses in the pilot plant residue samples. 
 
Lime boil was conducted at 95 °C for 4 hours with the addition of 120 kg/t CaO for 
two tests (CN15, 24) and at 75 kg/t CaO in a third test (CN25) to break down the 
jarosite  and  render  silver  recoverable  by  cyanidation. The  addition  of the  lime  boil 
resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  silver  recovery  from  9.2%  to  95.5%  as  well  as  an 
increase in gold recovery from 95.5% to 98.1%. Reducing the lime dosage below 75 
kg/t resulted in a reduction in gold and silver extraction. Optimum dosage appeared 
to be 75 kg/t of lime. 
 
Cyanidation of the products of batch pressure oxidation tests (e.g., CN5-6) yielded 
better  gold  recovery  of  ~98%  and  sulphur  oxidation  >99%  than  the  pilot  plant 
operation. Visual observations indicated that the pilot plant product contained more 
basic iron sulphate and jarosite and less hematite than the lab tests. The reason for 
the slightly lower gold recovery in the tests conducted on the pilot plant product may 
be due to differences in the precipitate produced in the pilot plant compared to the 
batch pressure oxidation tests. The acidity of the solution and the concentration of 
cations such as Na+, and K+ will impact whether hydrolysis reactions favour hematite 
or jarosite formation. The continuous autoclave operation is also “seeded” with iron 
precipitates whereas the batch test is unseeded. 
 
There is insufficient data from the pilot plant operation to determine the relationship 
between sulphide oxidation and gold recovery and whether full sulphide oxidation is 
required to recover the majority of the gold. Earlier batch testwork showed a direct

Conclusions

relationship  between  sulphide  oxidation  and  gold  extraction.  Hence,  a  high  overall 
sulphide oxidation target was maintained.
A  preliminary  pilot  test  program  investigated  pressure  oxidation  and  hot  curing 
processing  of  a  Duparquet  flotation  concentrate  to  render  precious  metals 
extractable by cyanidation.  
 
The  pilot  plant  operated  for  48  hours  with  no  significant  problems.  The  16.8% 
sulphide sulphur concentrate feed was oxidized efficiently in the autoclave at 210 °C 
and oxygen overpressure of 700 kPa, with residual sulphide levels averaging 0.13%. 
A 60 minute retention time appeared sufficient to achieve a high level of oxidation. 
Recycling a portion of the acidic hot cure thickener overflow allows for neutralization 
of  carbonates  present  in  the  feed  concentrate.  The  autoclave  discharge  was 
predominately  a  jarosite  product  with  little  hematite  formed.  The  POX  liquor 
contained 47 g/L free acid, 11 g/L Fe (>95% as ferric iron) and ~1 g/L As. No work 
has been carried out in the pilot plant to optimize the pressure oxidation operating 
conditions apart from retention time. 
 
The merits and amount of acid recycled to neutralize the carbonate in the feed to the 
autoclave needs to be investigated. The lowering of the free acidity in the autoclave 
may promote precipitation of hematite and control the amount of jarosite formed. 
 
The hot cure was operated at 95 °C with autoclave discharge product having a total 
retention  time  of  either  4  or  5  hours  to  promote  the  conversion  of  any  basic  iron 
sulphate formed during pressure oxidation. There appeared to be little evidence of 
re-dissolution  of  basic  ferric  sulphate  in  the  hot  cure  circuit  with  the  majority  of 
conversion having taken place within the autoclave flash letdown. The re-dissoution 
that  did  occur  happened  relatively  quickly.  Overall  iron  in  solution  increased  from 
~11 g/L in the autoclave discharge to ~17 g/L in the first hot cure stage and up to 
~20 g/L through the hot cure circuit. Arsenic content remained consistent throughout 
at  an  average  of  ~1.7  g/L.  Optimization  of  the  size  of  the  hot  cure  circuit  in 
conjunction  with  further  pressure  oxidation  studies  is  required.  The  cyanidation 
testwork  program  has  demonstrated  that  high  gold  and  silver  recoveries  are 
obtainable for cyanidation of pressure oxidation residues. The recovery of gold from 
the pilot plant hot cure discharge from batch testwork ranged from 94.7% to 96.5% 
with average residue assay from 0.96 g/t to 1.21 g/t Au. Lime (CaO) consumptions 
ranged from 4 to 8 kg/t with NaCN consumptions between 0.05 and 0.24 kg/t.  
 
Lime boil tests on thickened hot cured discharged material, conducted at 95ºC for 4 
hours with the addition of 120 kg/t CaO, were effective in breaking down jarosite and 
increased  silver  recovery  from  9.2%  to  95.5%,  and  gold  recovery  from  95.5%  to 
98.1%. Reducing the lime dosage below 75 kg/t resulted in a reduction in gold and 
silver extraction, with optimum conditions appear to favour 75 kg/t of lime. Promoting 
conditions favourable for hematite formation over jarosite in the pressure oxidation 
would undoubtedly reduce lime consumption in the lime boil step. 
 
Precious metal leaching kinetics, carbon adsorption testwork and process modelling 
were  limited  to  investigating  cyanidation  and  recovery  of  gold  from  hot  cured 
discharge samples. No detailed tests were carried out to determine the leaching and 
carbon  adsorption  kinetics  for  both  gold  and  silver  following  lime  boil  processing. 
The leaching and carbon in pulp circuit was remodelled by Tenova-Bateman using

the  SIMCIL  program  (developed  in  the  AMIRA  P420  project)  to  take  into  account 
and estimate silver loadings to enable designing the whole precious metal leaching, 
recovery, elution and electrowinning circuits. The cyanidation circuit was configured 
with two leach tanks followed by six stages of carbon contacting, similar to the SGS 
model,  with  carbon  transfer  rate  increased  from  1.5  t/day  to  2.5  tpd  to  take  into 
account  silver  loading.  Further  work  is  required  to  investigate  leaching  and 
adsorption kinetics on lime boiled samples to determine the impact of liberated silver 
on precious metal leaching and adsorption kinetics to establish the final cyanidation 
extraction and recovery circuit configuration. 
 
Overall the current design for the process plant is limited to one test program on one 
concentrate  sample.  The  concentrate  was  obtained  from  a  blend  of  samples  from 
across  the  Duparquet  Project.  It  is  recommended  that  the  impact  of  concentrate 
variability be investigated with respect to the mine plan and flotation feed variations. 
Mineralogical  characterization  and  deportment  of  gold  and  silver  should  also  be 
verified.  Following  further  optimization  tests  on  each  unit  operation,  an  integrated 
pilot plant for the main elements of the circuit should be operated for an extended 
period  of  time  to  confirm  the  results  and  also  test  other  unit  operations  within  the 
proposed flowsheet.

SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-004  –  DRAFT  –  Report  3  summarizes  the 
rheometallurgical  responses  (i.e.,  solid-liquid  separation  and  rheology)  of  the 
flotation tailings (PP-05 Ro Tail), flotation concentrate (PP CI Conc (POX Feed)), hot 
cure  discharge  (HC-4  Discharge),  and  combined  leached  tailings  (Comb  CND  +

after 1 hour of elapsed settling was 625 mg/L. 
 
Preliminary static settling test results for the combined leached tailing, identified as 
"Comb CND+Neut Solids", indicated that the sample settled well in the presence of

The  results  of  the  preliminary  static  settling-thickening  were  used  for  reagent 
selection,  optimization  of  thickener  feed  solid  density  and  flocculant  dosage.  The 
flocculant screening and selection tests were conducted at 5% w/w solids. Five (5) 
different  BASF  Magnafloc  products  were  tested  with  the  best  response  from  the 
non-ionic flocculant Magnafloc 333. The settling rate was fast but produced a cloudy 
supernatant.  Using  a  combination  of  coagulant  BASF  Magnafloc  1687  with 
Magnafloc 333 did not improve liquor clarity. 
 
The  optimized  dynamic  settling  conditions  for  PP-05  Ro  Tail  predicted  0.100  and 
0.011  m2/tpd  for  thickener  underflow  (TUFUA)  and  hydraulic  (THUA)  unit  areas, 
respectively.  This  corresponded  to  86.5  m3/m2/day  net  rise  rate,  0.415  Um%  net 
solids  loading,  and  3.60  m3/m2/h  net  hydraulic  loading.  The  overflow  TSS  was  43 
mg/L and the underflow solids density at 65.2% w/w solids under these conditions. A 
30  min  extended  thickening  increased  the  underflow  density  to  69.3%  w/w  solids 
yielding about 23 Pa un-sheared vane yield stress. These results were produced at 
10% w/w solid density at a dosage of ~25 g/t BASF Magnafloc 333 flocculant and 
1.11 hours residence time. 
 
The  optimized  dynamic  settling  conditions  for  PP  Cl  Conc.  (POX  Feed)  predicted 
0.100  and  0.025  m2/t/day  for  thickener  underflow  (TUFUA)  and  hydraulic  (THUA) 
unit  areas,  respectively.  This  corresponded  to  35.9  m3/m2/day  net  rise  rate,  0.415 
t/m2/h net solids loading, and 1.496 m3/m2/h net hydraulic loading. The overflow TSS 
was  53  mg/L  and  the  underflow  solids  density  at  61.8%  w/w  solids  under  these

conditions. A 30 min extended thickening increased the underflow density to 65.5% 
w/w solids  yielding about 36 Pa un-sheared vane yield stress. These results were 
produced  at  20%  w/w  solid  density  at  a  dosage  of  ~40  g/t  BASF  Magnafloc  333 
flocculant and 1.28 hours residence time. 
 
The  overflow  stayed  cloudy  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  test  run  with  TSS 
consistently  exceeding  ~1500  mg/L.  The  thickener  underflow  unit  area  (TUFUA) 
started  at  0.401  and  decreased  to  0.331  m2/t/day;  thickener  hydraulic  unit  area 
(THUA)  started  at  0.039  and  decreased  to  0.037  m2/t/day.  The  net  rise  rate 
increased from 72.0 to 87.2 m3/m2/day. The net solids loading increased from 0.104 
to 0.126 t/m2/h. The net hydraulic loading increased from 3.00 to 3.64 m3/m2/h. The 
underflow solids density reached 41.2% w/w solids at the end of run 1 and 30 min 
extended  thickening  increased  the  underflow  density  to  42.6%  w/w  solids  yielding 
about 25 Pa un-sheared vane yield stress. These results were produced at 3% w/w 
solid density at a dosage of -100 g/t BASF Magnafloc 333 flocculant. 
 
The optimized dynamic settling conditions for Comb CND+Neut predicted 0.22 and 
0.011  m2/t/day  for  thickener  underflow  (TUFUA)  and  hydraulic  (THUA)  unit  areas, 
respectively.  This  corresponded  to  145.2  m3/m2/day  net  rise  rate,  0.190 t/m2/h  net 
solids loading and 1.496 m3/m2/h net hydraulic loading. The overflow TSS  was 73 
mg/L and the underflow solids density at 42.3% w/w solids under these conditions. 
30  min  extended  thickening  increased  the  Run  1  underflow  density  to  43.2%  w/w 
solids  yielding  about  29  Pa  un-sheared  vane  yield  stress.  These  results  were 
produced  at  3.0%  w/w  solid  density  at  a  dosage  of  ~40  g/t  BASF  Magnafloc  333

The  Critical  Solids  Density  (CSD1)  of  the  PP-05  Ro  Tail  sample  was  ~70%  w/w 
solids,  which  corresponded  to  a  yield  stress  of  52  Pa  under  un-sheared  flow 
conditions and 22 Pa under sheared conditions. The CSD of the PP Cl Conc. (POX 
Feed)  thickened  underflow  sample  was  -65%  w/w,  which  corresponded  to  a  yield 
stress  of  38  Pa  under  un-sheared  flow  conditions  and  29  Pa  under  sheared 
conditions.  The  CSD  of  the  HC-4  Discharge  thickened  underflow  sample  was 
~41.5% w/w, which corresponded to a yield stress of 24 Pa under un-sheared flow 
conditions,  and  8  Pa  under  sheared  conditions.  The  CSD  of  the  HC-4  Discharge-
Washed Solids thickened underflow sample was ~36% w/w., which corresponded to 
a yield stress of 29 Pa under un-sheared flow conditions and 12 Pa under sheared 
conditions.  The  CSO  of  the  Combined  CNO+Neut.  solids  thickened  underflow 
sample was ~43.8% w/w, which corresponded to a yield stress of 30 Pa under un-
sheared flow conditions and 17 Pa under sheared conditions.
13.3.5.1
Conclusions
Overall,  the  aforesaid  rheometallurgical  test  data  materially  reflect  the  liquid-solid 
separation  and  flow  behaviours  of  the  process  samples  tested,  rendering  them 
suitable  to  be  used  as  design  criteria.  A  possible  exception  to  this  assessment 
involves the hot cure stream which displayed a relatively complex rheometallurgical 
response. To overcome the high overflow total suspended solids content a further 
clarification step to remove fine solids from the supernatant may be required.  
 
Further work is still required to carry out specific CCD washing tests and model the 
process.  The  wash  ratio  and  washing  efficiency  through  testwork  and  modelling 
needs to be evaluated to accurately design the counter current decantation circuit.
1 The Critical Solids Density (CSD) value is predictive of the maximum underflow solids density achievable in a 
commercial thickener and of the underflow solids density and pump-ability ranges achievable in practice and with 
reasonable friction pressure losses for an economically feasible operation.

SGS Project Reference No. 13054-004 – Report 4 – September 12, 2013 
SGS  Project  Reference  No.  13054-004  –  Report  4  describes  the  bench-scale 
testwork program that was conducted to examine various process options relating to 
the recovery of gold by carbon adsorption from washed hot cure thickener underflow 
product. The program also investigated neutralization of hot cure thickener overflow 
solution  and  cyanide  destruction  of  the  cyanide  leach  product  of  the  pilot  plant 
flotation tailing and hot cure thickener underflow. 
 
The recovery of gold from washed hot cure thickener underflow product by carbon 
adsorption  and  neutralization  of  the  hot  cure  thickener  overflow  solution  were 
discussed  in  13054-002  report  1.  The  cyanide  destruction  testwork  and  its  results 
are described below. 
 
Cyanide  destruction  using  the  SO2/air  process  was  examined  briefly  for  the 
cyanidation  product  of  PP-05  and  PP-09  flotation  tailings.  All  of  the  samples 
responded well to the SO2/air method of cyanide destruction with moderate reagent 
consumptions. 
 
The  results  of  the  tests  conducted  on  the  PP-05  rougher  tailings  showed  that  the 
cyanide was effectively destroyed with an SO2 addition of 5.7 g/g CNWAD (Weak Acid 
Dissociable  Cyanide)  with  a  copper  addition  as  copper  sulphate  of  0.1  g  Cu/g 
CNWAD.  Reducing  the  copper  addition  by  half  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  CNT 
(Total Cyanide) although the CNWAD remained similar. The SO2 addition in the bulk 
test was slightly higher than targeted because the feed rate was slightly lower than 
the  target.  A  polishing  stage  is  required  to  achieve  a  CNT  analysis  of  less  than  1 
mg/L bringing the total copper addition back to 0.1 g Cu/g CNWAD.  
 
Similar conditions were applied to the PP-09 rougher tailing. The testwork indicated 
that this tailing needs a higher copper addition of 0.2 g Cu/g CNWAD to achieve the 
target CNT analysis. The SO2 requirement to achieve the target was 5.2 g/g CNWAD.  
The results of the cyanide destruction test are summarized in the Table 13.28.

for the ball mill circuit to achieve a final product size of 100 µm. One 20.0’ x 30.0’ ball 
mill, with internal dimensions of 5.94 x 8.99 m and assumed 0° cone angle (square 
mill equivalent), operating with a ball charge of about 32% was selected. The SAG 
and  ball  mill  installed  power  should  be  4,551  kW and  5,674 kW,  respectively.  The 
SAG mill motor was selected to allow a ball charge increase up to 15% as well as an 
increase to 78% of critical speed.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE
www.innovexplo.com
An  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate for  the Duparquet  Project  was  prepared  in 
2013 by InnovExplo and presented in a report titled “Technical Report and Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation 
43-101 and Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 2013b). 
 
The  August  2013  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update  is  presented  herein.  It  was 
performed  by  Kenneth  Williamson,  B.Sc.,  P.Geo.,  and  Karine  Brousseau,  Eng., 
under the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo., using all available results. The 
main objective was to update the results of InnovExplo’s previous Mineral Resource 
Estimate  for  the  Duparquet  Project,  dated  February  28,  2013  (Williamson  et  al., 
2013a).  The  updated  estimate  includes  additional  new  and  re-sampled  drill  holes 
that were not included in the previous resource estimate. The Dumico area drill holes 
were also added to this update.  
 
An exception to the above statement is the resource estimate for the tailings pond 
component, which was not modified during the August 2013 update. The results for 
this component, also presented herein, are taken directly from InnovExplo’s earlier 
estimate of July 5, 2012 (Brousseau et al., 2012). The reader is referred to Figure 
14.9  for  the  location  of  the  tailings  pond  with  respect  to  the  Duparquet  Property 
boundary. 
 
The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral reserves since they have no 
demonstrable  economic  viability.  The  result  of  the  update  was  a  single  Mineral 
Resource Estimate for sixty (60) mineralized zones, an envelope zone containing the 
remaining isolated gold intercepts (see below for details), and four (4) tailings zones. 
The Mineral Resource Estimate includes measured, indicated and inferred resources 
for  both  a  Whittle-optimized  in-pit  volume  and  a  complementary  underground 
volume. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is June 26, 2013. 
 
In-Pit and Underground Mineral Resource Estimate 
Methodology 
The  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  presented  herein  was  made  using  3D  block 
modelling and the inverse distance square interpolation (ID2) method for a corridor 
of the Duparquet Project with a strike-length of 4.5 km and a width of approximately 
1 km,  down  to  a  vertical  depth  of  1,050  m  below  surface.  Sixty  (60)  mineralized 
zones  have  been  interpreted  in  cross-sections  spaced  25  m  apart  (locally  12.5  m 
where the drill hole density was high enough to allow it).
14.1 
14.1.1
14.1.1.1
Drill hole and channel sample database
The Geotic / MS Access diamond drill hole database for the Duparquet Project was 
transferred into GEMS software. It contains 849 surface diamond drill holes and 892 
channels with conventional analytical gold assay results, as well as coded lithologies 
from  the  drill  core  logs  and  channel  descriptions.  The  849  drill  holes  cover  the 
4.5-km strike-length of the Project at a fairly regular drill spacing of 50 m. The 892 
channels are centered mostly on two (2) mineralized zones (the South and RWRS 
zones), with the remaining channels unevenly distributed in the eastern part of the 
Beattie  property  and  on  the  Central  Duparquet  property.  The  database  contains  a
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
147
14.1.1.2
www.innovexplo.com
total of 168,555 sampled intervals taken from 260,948.4 m of drilled core, and a total 
of 2,371 analyses taken from 1,827 m of channels. 
 
In addition to the basic tables of raw data, the Gemcom database contains several 
tables  with  the  drill  hole  and  wireframe  solid  intersection  composite  calculations 
required for the statistical evaluation and resource block modelling. 
 
Interpretation of mineralized zones 
In  order  to  conduct  accurate  resource  modelling  of  the  Duparquet  Project, 
InnovExplo  updated  the  mineralized-zone  wireframe  model  to  delineate  the 
geologically defined extent of the mineralized zones within the defined Project area: 
a 4,500-metre strike-length corridor measuring 1,000 m wide and extending to 1,050 
m below surface. 
 
The  nine  (9)  previously  defined  mineralized  zones,  once  considered  as  the  “main 
zones”, have been re-interpreted using the new geological and analytical information 
available. 
 
In particular, the West Zone and the South Zone have been subdivided into several 
“sub-zones”  based  on  geometrical  and  geological  continuity  parameters.  Such 
subdivision  was  deemed  necessary  by  InnovExplo  in  order  to  better  reflect  the 
structural style of the mineralization found within the Duparquet deposit and which is 
now better understood based on the new information available. 
 
The West Zone has been subdivided into three distinct sub-zones: West 1, West 2 
and West 3. The West 1 and West 3 sub-zones show a NE orientation with moderate 
and steep dips, respectively. The West 2 sub-zone is orientated slightly more NNE 
with a steep dip. 
 
The  South  Zone  has  been  re-modeled  as  ten  (10)  individual  mineralized  lenses, 
namely,  from  west  to  east,  South  Zone  1  to  South  Zone  10.  The  updated 
interpretation  shows  an  “en  echelon”  stacking  of  ENE  oriented  mineralized  lenses 
into a broader E-W striking mineralized corridor. This interpretation better reflects the 
internal  geometry  of  the  Donchester  Fault  Zone  (DFZ)  where  mineralized  lenses 
appear  to  be  associated  to  second  order  slightly  oblique  sigmoidal  structures 
developed within the DFZ itself. 
 
Several  other  new  zones  have  been  interpreted  for  this  mineral  resource  update. 
The  addition  of  these  new  zones  was  required  at  Central  Duparquet,  Dumico  and 
within the unconstrained “inter-zone” mineralized envelope. 
 
In the Central Duparquet area, new drill hole information has led to the interpretation 
of another mineralized zone (CD S2) to the south of the CD South Zone. The CD S2 
Zone is subparallel to the CD and CD South zones and is located about 25 m in the 
footwall of CD South Zone. 
 
Interpretation of the mineralized zones found at Dumico is based on discussions with 
Louis Martin from Clifton Star, on grade continuity within the assays point set, and by 
taking into account the regional geological context of the Dumico property. A total of 
five  (5)  zones  have  thus  been  modelled  at  Dumico.  Three  (3)  zones  showing  a

similar  geometry  as  the  zones  at  Central  Duparquet  have  been  interpreted  as  the 
“natural”  extensions  of  the  latter.  Two  (2)  SE-striking  zones  have  also  been 
interpreted based on grade continuity and their regional structural context.  
 
A total of thirty-four (34) secondary mineralized zones have been interpreted within 
the previously defined “inter-zone” mineralized envelope. The interpretation of these 
secondary  mineralized  zones  is  based  on  field  observations  as  well  as  grade 
continuity throughout the sample point set.  
 
The mineralized zones of the Duparquet Project can be grouped in three (3) groups 
based  on  their  geometry:  1)  a  dominant  E-W  trending  group  with  very  steep  to 
vertical dips, 2) a NE to ENE-trending group for which the dip varies from moderate 
to steep, and 3) an ESE-trending group having moderate to steep dips.  
 
Figure 14.1 shows a 3D isometric view of all the mineralized material zones including 
Group 2, in yellow and Group 3, in magenta. The geometry defined by these three 
(3)  groups  of  mineralized  zones  can  be  observed  on  the  several  outcrops  of  the 
Duparquet Project (Figs. 14.2 and 14.3). Crosscutting relationships observed in the 
field  suggest  the  contemporaneous  development  of  these  different  groups  of 
structures.  Such  observations  are  compatible  with  the  interpreted  protracted 
structural evolution of the DPMFZ as presented in sections 7.1 and 7.3.4.
Figure 14.1 – General isometric view showing the main and secondary interpreted 
mineralized material zones
The  following  summarizes  the  changes  and  additions  made  to  the  mineralized 
material zone wireframe model.
1.  The South Zone has been redesigned in such a way that it now presents a
series of ten (10) “en-echelon” sub-zones associated with the DFZ; 
2.  The West Zone has been remodeled into three (3) distinct lenses; 
3.  A new zone, CD S2, has been created at Central Duparquet; 
4.  Five (5) mineralized zones have been created at Dumico; 
5.  Thirty-four  (34)  new  zones  have  been  created  within  the  “inter-zone”
mineralized envelope.
The  wireframe  solids  of the  mineralized  zone  model  were  created  and updated  by 
digitizing  an  interpretation  onto  sections  spaced  25  m  apart,  or  12.5  m  where  drill

www.innovexplo.com
holes density was higher, for a total strike length of 4,500 m, and then using tie-lines 
between sections to complete the wireframes for each solid.  
 
For  the  main  mineralized  zones,  the  interpretation  pushes  their  extent  up  to  a 
distance  of  100  m  away  from  the  last  known  occurrence  of  mineralization,  unless 
negative  intersects  were  encountered,  in  which  case  the  mineralized  zones  were 
interpreted up to mid-distance between the last known occurrence of mineralization 
and  the  negative  hole.  For  the  secondary  mineralized  zones,  a  50  m  extension 
around the zones has been used. 
 
The envelope zone was defined as the parts of the rectangular volume delimiting the 
block  model  that  are  not  included  in  any  of  the  mineralized-zone  solids.  The 
envelope  zone  contains  “floating”  gold  intersects  for  which  continuity  has  not  yet 
been demonstrated or interpreted.

High grade capping and compositing
www.innovexplo.com
Drill  hole  assays  and  channel  assay  intervals  that  intersect  interpreted mineralized 
zones were automatically coded in the database from 3D solids, and these two (2) 
databases  were  used  to  analyze  sample  lengths  and  generate  statistics  and 
composites. 
 
High Grade Capping 
 
Basic univariate statistics were performed on the overall assay data and on datasets 
grouped  by  zones  using  point  area files  containing raw  analytical  assay  data for  a 
total of 168,555 diamond drill hole (DDH) samples and 2,371 channel samples. High 
grade  capping  was  established  at  25  g/t  Au  for  all  zones,  including  the  envelope 
zone (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5).

Within  the  overall  database,  a  total  of  twenty-two  (22)  DDH  samples  and  one  (1) 
channel  sample  were  capped  at  the  25  g/t  Au  capping  limit  (Table  14.1).  The 
capping of high assays represented a total loss of 2.77% of the gold metal factor for 
the DDH population. Table 14.2 presents a summary of the statistical analysis for the 
zones where high grade samples were capped.

Compositing 
 
In order to minimize any bias introduced by the variable sample lengths, the capped 
gold  assays  of  the  DDH  data  were  composited  to  1  metre  equal  lengths  (“1m 
composites”)  within  all  intervals  that  define  each  of  the  mineralized  zones.  Among 
the  composites  generated  within  the  assayed  interval  of  the  DDH  population 
(257,712  composites),  there  were  938  (0.36%)  tails  less  than  0.25  m  long  which 
were removed from the block model interpolation and variography. The total number 
of composites used in the DDH dataset is thus 256,774. A grade of 0.00 g/t Au was 
assigned to missing sample intervals.  
 
No  composites  were  filtered  out  of  the  channel  sample  dataset  due  to  the  small 
amount of data and the fact that such filtering would be statistically meaningless. A 
total  of  2,298  equal-length  1m  channel  composites  were  used.  There  were  no 
missing sample intervals.

Search ellipsoids
www.innovexplo.com
Each  zone  and  the  envelope  were  estimated  separately  with  their  own  search 
ellipsoid.  The  size  of  each  search  ellipsoid  was  created  according  to  the  available 
geological and geostatistical information.  
 
Panel subdivisions of the geometrically irregular mineralized zones 
 
Eight (8) of the mineralized zones have been subdivided into panels on the basis of 
variations  of  their  internal  geometry.  The  criteria  used  for  determining  if  a  zone 
required  a  subdivision  are  the  intensity  of  the  along  strike  or  down-dip  curvature 
and/or presence of “splays” associated to the given zone. Cutting planes have been 
created in order to give each of these panels a “panel blockcode” to which specific 
research  ellipsoids  could  be  attributed.  Table  14.3  shows  a  listing  of  the  zone’s 
panels  as  well  as  their  “panel  blockcode”  and  mean  orientation.  Figure  14.6 
illustrates  the  panel’s  subdivision  of  the  North  Zone  as  well  as  the  cutting  planes 
used, and thus represents the methodology used for all of the eight zones that have 
been sub-divided.

Figure 14.6 – NNE vertical section showing the panels subdivision of the North 
Zone 
 
 
Taking  into  consideration  the  panels  defined  above,  seventy-two  (72)  distinct 
mineralized zones and sub-zones have been considered for the characterization of 
the search ellipsoids. 
 
Based on the mean azimuth and dip of each zone and sub-zones, a total of twenty-
three  (23)  different  search  ellipsoids  were  produced,  regrouping  zones  of  similar 
geometry  together.  For  the  envelope  zone  the  best  results  were  obtained  using  a 
N090/90  orientation,  which  corresponds  to  the  mean  orientation  of  the  structural 
grain on the Duparquet Property.  
 
Ellipsoid  radiuses  were  established  using  a  combination  of  the  ranges  determined 
from the geostatistical analysis of the main zones and the interpretation of the true 
thickness  of  each  zone.  The  radius  of  the  third  axis  (Z)  varies  from  15  to  30  m 
reflecting  the  data  density  available  for  each  zone  and  the  confidence  level  of  the 
geological interpretation.  
 
Table 14.4 summarizes the parameters of the final ellipsoids used for interpolation.

Bulk density
www.innovexplo.com
For the current 2013 Mineral Resource Estimate update, no new density data were 
retrieved from the database. Therefore, based on the analysis of 3,633 bulk density 
values  performed  by  InnovExplo  for  a  previous  study  (Brousseau  et  al.,  2012),  a 
density of 2.73 g/cm3 (mean density of the syenite) is used to characterize all sixty 
(60)  mineralized  material  zones  as  well  as  the  envelope  zone.  A  density  of  2.00 
g/cm3 has been assigned to the overburden (OB), whereas a density of 1.00 g/cm3 is 
used  for  excavation  solids  (drifts  and  stopes)  that  are  considered  to  be  filled  with 
water.

A block model was established for the sixty (60) mineralized zones (and their sub-
panels when applicable) and has been extended to cover an area sufficient to host 
an open-pit. The model has been pushed down to a depth of approximately 1,050 m 
below surface. The limits of the block model are as follows (UTM NAD83, Zone 17): 
 
Easting: 
  
Northing:    
Elevation:   
 
The block model has parallel orientation, with the Y-axis oriented along a north grid 
azimuth. The individual block cells have dimensions of 5 m long (X-axis) by 5 m wide 
(Y) by 5 m vertical (Z). The block dimensions reflect the dimension of the mineralized 
zones.  Table  14.5  shows  the  Duparquet  Project  block  model  with  its  interpolated 
zones  and  their  associated  folders.  The  table  also  provides  details  about  the 
corresponding naming convention for the GEMS solids, the rockcodes, blockcodes, 
and the precedence assigned to each individual solid.

14.1.1.7
Mineralized zone block model
A percent block model in the Zones folder “mineralization folder”, as well as for the 
Envelope  folder  “waste  folder”  (overburden,  envelope,  drift  and  stope),  was 
generated  reflecting  the  proportion  of  the  different  respective  solids  in  each  block 
using precedence of solids. In detail, all blocks with at least 0.01% of their volume 
falling  within  a  selected  solid  were  assigned  the  corresponding  solid  blockcode 
(Table 14.5) and its relative proportion (%) in their respective folder.  
 
As a result, all blocks having at least 0.01% of their volume contained within stope 
solids  were  rock-coded stope. InnovExplo  deemed  such  conservative  manipulation 
necessary  in  order  to  compensate  for  the  risk  that  blocks  near  stopes  are  either 
mined out or inaccessible due to safety factors. 
 
The  multi-folder  percent  block  model  thus  generated  was  used  in  the  mineral 
resource estimation.
14.1.1.8
Grade block model
A  grade  model  was  interpolated  using  the  1m  composite  derivates  from  the 
conventional capped assay grade data to produce the best possible grade estimate 
for the defined resources in the Duparquet Project. The interpolation has been done 
on a point area combining the DDH and channel datasets. 
 
A  set  of  two  (2)  interpolation  profiles  was  established  for  grade  estimation.  The 
interpolation  profiles  were  customized  to  estimate  grades  separately  within  the 
Zones  and  the  Envelope  folders  for  the  combined  DDH  and  channel  composite

www.innovexplo.com
populations.  The  method  retained  for  the  final  resource  estimation  was  inverse 
distance square (ID2). 
 
The composite points were assigned rock codes and block codes corresponding to 
the mineralized zone or the mineralized panel in which they occur. The interpolation 
profiles  specify  a  single  target  and  sample  rock  code  for  each  mineralized-zone 
solid,  thus  establishing  hard  boundaries  between  the  mineralized  zones  and 
preventing  block  grades  from  being  estimated  using  sample  points  with  different 
block  codes  than  the  block  being  estimated.  The  search/interpolation  ellipse 
orientations  and  ranges  defined  in  the  two  interpolation  profiles  used  for  grade 
estimation  correspond to  those  developed  in  Table  14.4  in  Section  14.1.1.4 of this 
Report (Search ellipsoids).  
 
Other specifications to control grade estimation are as follows: 
 
For the Zones folder corresponding to the sixty (60) mineralized zones:
inverse distance square interpolation method for data points;
• 
•  minimum of two (2) and maximum of twelve (12) sample points in the search
ellipse for interpolation;
•  maximum of four (4) sample points from any one DDH or channel; 
•  high-grade values capped.
For the Envelope folder (Envelope zone):
inverse distance square interpolation method for data points;
• 
•  minimum  of  two  (2)  and  maximum  of  six  (6)  sample  points  in  the  search
ellipse for interpolation;
•  no limit on sample points from any one DDH or channel; 
•  high-grade values capped.
Following the interpolation step, the grade of all the blocks rock-coded stopes was 
initialized  to  zero  (0)  for  the  Zones  and  the  Envelope  folders  using  “rocktype” 
selection.
14.1.1.9
Resource Category Block Model
Classification  to  a  Measured  category  was  done  for  blocks  having  a  volume  of  at 
least 25% within an envelope built at a distance of 10 m around existing channels.  
 
Classification to an Indicated category was done for blocks meeting at least one (1) 
of the conditions below:
•  Blocks falling within a 15-m-wide halo surrounding existing stopes 
•  Blocks for which the average distance to composites is less than 45 m.
A clipping polygon was generated for each of the sixty (60) zones using the criteria 
described  above  and  the  blocks  were  coded  accordingly.  All  remaining blocks that 
were interpolated were classified as Inferred category. Figures 14.7 and 14.8 show 
the resource category for two typical zones out of the sixty (60) mineralized zones, 
as  well  as  the  Whittle-optimized  pit  shell  delimiting  the  in-pit  and  underground

mineral resources. The reader should refer to sections 14.1.3 and 14.1.4 for further 
details about the Whittle-optimized pit shell.

confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability 
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough 
to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
 
Indicated Mineral Resource 
 
 that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape 
and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to 
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be 
reasonably assumed. 
 
Inferred Mineral Resource 
 
that  part  of  a  Mineral  Resource  for  which  quantity  and  grade  or  quality  can  be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 
limited  information  and  sampling  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
 
In-Pit Resource Estimation 
Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, and the specific 
interpolation  parameters,  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  current  (updated) 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  can  be  classified  as  Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred 
mineral resources. The estimate is compliant with CIM standards and guidelines for 
reporting  mineral  resources  and  reserves.  The  In-Pit  Mineral  Resources  were 
estimated  using  different  gold  cut-off  grades  and  a  minimum  width  of  3.0  m  (true 
width). The selected cut-off of 0.45 g/t Au allowed the mineral potential of the deposit 
to be outlined for the in-pit mining option.  
 
The final  selected Whittle  input  parameters  and the  cut-off grade  parameters  used 
for the In-Pit Mineral Resource Estimation are defined in Table 14.6.

The overall slope angle was set at 52°, which reflects the best approximation since 
little  geotechnical  information  has  been  provided.  The gold  selling,  processing  and 
transportation  costs,  as  well  as  the  mining  dilution,  were  based  on  InnovExplo’s 
recent experiences. The processing costs and recovery were estimated by Tenova-
Bateman (see sections 13 and 17 of this Report). 
 
A “mill” or “marginal” cut-off grade was used in Whittle. Using the parameters shown 
above in Table 14.6, a mill cut-off grade (MCoG) of 0.45 g/t Au was calculated for the 
Whittle pit shell optimization using the following formula: 
 
MCoG = (Processing + Transportation + Administration costs) x (1 + Mining dilution) x 31.1035
(Processing recovery) x (Net gold price)
Volumetrics for  the  In-Pit  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  have  been  constrained  using 
the topography as the top surface and the Whittle-optimized pit-shell as the bottom 
surface. The needling has been set to three (3) needles. 
 
Table 14.7 displays the results of the In Situ2 Mineral Resource Estimate for the In-
Pit Whittle-optimized  portion  of  the  Duparquet  Project  (the  60  mineralized  material 
zones and the envelope zone). Figures 14.7 and 14.8 present the Whittle-optimized 
pit-shell trace along each of the North Zone and the South 06 Zone respectively. The

Underground Resource Estimation 
Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, and the specific 
interpolation  parameters,  InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  current  Mineral 
Resource  Estimate  can  be  classified  as  Indicated  and  Inferred  resources.  The 
estimate  is  compliant  with  CIM  standards  and  guidelines  for  reporting  mineral 
resources and reserves. The Underground Mineral Resources were estimated using 
different gold cut-off grades and a minimum width of 3.0 m (true width). The selected 
underground cut-off of 2.0 g/t Au allowed the mineral potential of the deposit to be 
outlined for the underground mining option, outside the Whittle-optimized pit-shell. 
 
The  estimation  of  the  underground  cut-off  grade  (UCoG)  was  based  on  the 
parameters presented in Table 14.8.

The Underground Resource Estimate presented herein uses a rounded value of 2.00 
g/t Au for the underground cut-off grade. 
 
A  volumetric  analysis  of  the  Underground  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  carried 
out  using  a  constraining  surface  constructed  by  merging  the  Whittle-optimized  pit-
shell with the bedrock surface in order to calculate the volume of any mineralized or 
envelope  zone  material  contained  within  the  bedrock  but  extending  beyond  the  pit 
boundaries. 
 
Table  14.9  displays  the  results  of  the  In  Situ3  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  for  the 
underground  portion  of  the  Duparquet  Project  (60  mineralized  material  zones  and 
the  envelope  zone).  Figures  14.7  and  14.8  present  the  Whittle-optimized  pit-shell 
trace along the North Zone and South 06 Zone, respectively. The detailed results of 
the Underground Mineral Resource Estimate are presented by zone in Appendix III.

Tailings Mineral Resource Estimate 
In  August  2009,  Genivar  was  contracted  by  Clifton  Star  to  produce  a  NI 43-101 
compliant Mineral Resource Estimate for a portion of the tailings area (Fillion, 2009), 
but  the  report  was  never  published.  On  November  7,  2011,  Clifton  Star  assigned 
InnovExplo the mandate of auditing Genivar’s Mineral Resource Estimate in order to 
incorporate  the  results  into  a  consolidated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  which  was 
published as a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report on July 5, 2012 (Brousseau et 
al., 2012). Details about the Mineral Resource Estimate for the tailings component of 
the Duparquet Project can be found in the above report. 
 
The  only  change  with  respect  to  the  previous  estimate  of  July  5,  2012  is  that  the 
volumetrics have been re-calculated using a cut-off grade similar to the cut-off grade 
defined for the In-Pit Mineral Resource Estimate presented in Section 14.1.3 of this 
Report. 
 
Table  14.10  displays  the  results  of  the  In  Situ4  Resource  Estimate  for  the  tailings 
portion  of  the  Duparquet  Project  (4  mineralized  zones).  Detailed  results  of  the 
Tailings Mineral Resource Estimate are presented by zone in Appendix IV. 
 
A  portion  of  the  historical  tailings  pond  is  currently  located  outside  the  Duparquet 
Property  on  government  land  (MERN  property,  see  Figure  14.9).  This  portion  of 
tailings  was  originally  produced  from  the  historical  Beattie  mine  (located  on  the 
Duparquet  Property).  There  is  a  risk  that  the  MERN  will  not  allow  Clifton  Star  to 
recover  the  portion  of  the  Mineral  Resources  in  the  tailings  that  are  outside  the 
Property boundary; if this were to happen, the authors wish to point out that this very 
small portion of the total Mineral Resources will only have a minor impact and will not 
affect the potential viability of the Project. 
 
 Duparquet Mineral Resource Estimate Summary 
At  the  request  of  Clifton  Star,  InnovExplo  produced  an  updated  Mineral  Resource 
Estimate  for  the  Duparquet  Project.  The  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  presented 
herein includes:
•  An in-pit resource estimate, within a Whittle-optimized pit shell (Table 14.7) 
•  An  underground  resource  estimate,  outside  the  Whittle-optimized  pit-shell
(Table 14.9)
•  A tailings resource estimate, for four (4) of the five (5) Beattie mine tailings
ponds (Table 14.8)
Table 14.9 presents the combined resources by category for the Duparquet Project.
4 The term “in situ” is used to represent all the remaining mineral resources in place at the time of the updated
estimate herein.

In-Pit and Underground: A fixed density of 2.73 g/cm3 was used in the mineralized zones and in the envelope zone. 
In-Pit and Underground: A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed, or a value of zero when not assayed. 
Tailings: High grade capping was done on the raw data and established at 13.0 g/t Au for Zone 1, 3.5 g/t Au for Zone 2, 1.7 g/t Au for Zone 3 and 2.2 g/t Au for Zone 4. 
In-Pit and Underground: High grade capping was done on the raw data and established at 25.0 g/t Au for diamond drill hole assays and channel sample assays. 
Tailings: Compositing was done on drill hole sections falling within the mineralized zone solids (composite = 0.5 m). 
In-Pit and Underground: Compositing was done on drill hole and channel sample sections falling within the mineralized zone solids (composite = 1 m). 
Tailings: Resources were evaluated from drill hole and surface channel samples using an ID2 interpolation method in a block model. 
In-Pit and Underground: Resources were evaluated from drill hole and surface channel samples using an ID2 interpolation method in a multi-folder percent block model. 
Tailings: Measured and Indicated categories were defined based on the drill hole spacing (Measured: zones 1 and 2 = 30m x 30m grid; Indicated: zone 3 = 100m x 100m grid and zone 4 = 200m x 
200m grid). 
The In-Pit Measured category is defined by blocks having a volume of at least 25% within an envelope built at a distance of 10 m around existing channels. 
The In-Pit and Underground Indicated category is defined by the combination of blocks within a maximum distance of 15m from existing stopes and blocks for which the average distance to drill hole 
composites is less than 30 m. 
Ounce (troy) = Metric tons x Grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). 
The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101.

MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE
The reserves for the detailed pit design have been calculated in accordance with the 
definitions  and  guidelines  adopted  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy 
and  Petroleum  (CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves)  in  August 
2000.  
 
The effective date of the Mineral Reserve is March 26, 2014, the date on which the 
latest processing cost estimation was concluded.  
 
The PFS is based on an earlier report titled “Technical Report and Mineral Resource 
Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation  43-101  and 
Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013.  
 
The  mineral  resource  block  model  developed  by  InnovExplo  was  imported  into 
Whittle™  software  from  Dassault  Systèmes  GEOVIA  (formerly  Gemcom  Software 
International).  Design  parameters,  such  as operating  costs,  mine recovery,  dilution 
and gold price, were used to generate an optimal pit shell.  
 
InnovExplo  evaluated  dilution  and  mine  recovery  by  performing  an  analysis  of 
mineable  blocks  on  typical  cross-sections  at  the  mill  cut-off  grade.  After  a  cross-
sectional evaluation, average dilution was estimated at 10% at a grade of 0 g/t, and 
mine  recovery  was  estimated  at  95%  assuming  good  blasting  and  dilution  control 
practices.  
 
To integrate dilution in Whittle, an initial 5% dilution factor was used when performing 
reblocking and merging the original small blocks (5x5x5) into grade bands (high and 
low).  This  feature  defines  a  maximum  number  of  parcels  per  reblock  blocks.  This 
action regroups the smaller blocks of 5x5x5 into larger parcels, by grade interval. In 
this  evaluation,  two  parcels  were  considered.  The  resulting  parcel  includes  blocks 
lower than the cut-off grade that are considered internal dilution. If the average grade 
of the parcel is higher than the cut-off grade, it is considered as ore and sent to the 
mill. This dilution was estimated at 5%. An additional 5% dilution factor was added to 
the Whittle parameters for a total dilution factor of 10%. 
 
Iterations were performed to generate a pit design that fits the selected pit shell. To 
do  so,  a  pit  design,  including  a  ramp  and  catch  bench,  is  made  in  the  selected 
pitshell.  For  the  Duparquet  project,  the  initial  pit  wall  angle  was  too  steep  to 
accommodate the ramp. The slope angle was smoothed until a ramp could fit in the 
Whittle  pit  shell.  Many  iterations  were  needed  before  finding  an  adequate  pit  wall 
angle.  
 
Pit slopes were set at 29° in the overburden, 45° on the north side of the pits, and 
48° on the south side of the pit. The ramp was designed on the north side of the pit 
due to the constraints imposed by the golf course and houses on the south side.  
 
The  concurrent  prefeasibility  work  allowed  InnovExplo  and  Roche  Ltd  Consulting 
Group (“Roche”) to better quantify the operating costs. These costs were used for a 
final pit optimization in Whittle. These parameters are presented in Table 15.1.

Note: An additional 5% dilution factor is included in the reblocking for a total dilution factor of 10%.
The mining cost of $1.93/t represents the initial cost to mine the rock present at the 
surface of the open pit. An incremental hauling cost of $0.21 per kilometre of ramp 
was added, depending on pit depth. 
 
The open pit production is supplemented by 4.1 Mt of available old tailings. The old 
tailings  will  be  processed  during  the  beginning  of  the  Project  at  a  rate  of  750,000 
tonnes per year.  
 
The  global  In-pit  and  Tailings  Proven  and  Probable  Reserves  total  39,363,000 
tonnes  at  an  average grade  of  1.50 g/t (1,895,530  contained  ounces  of gold). The 
Whittle pit shell selected for this PFS generates 35,238,429 tonnes of ore, including 
dilution  and  losses.  Another  4,124,600  tonnes  from  the  old  tailings  completes  the 
resources  for  a  total  of  39,363,029  tonnes  of  ore  from  which  0.5%  is  Proven 
Reserves  and  99.5%  is  Probable  Reserves.  A  cut-off  grade  of  0.45  g/t  has  been 
considered  for  the  tailings  material  and  0.51  g/t  for  the  pit.  The  Mineral  Reserve 
Estimate for the Duparquet Project is presented in Table 15.2.

MINING METHODS
Introduction 
This section describes the results of the technical work undertaken by InnovExplo to 
produce  a  mine  plan  for  the  current  Prefeasibility  Study  (PFS)  for  the  Duparquet 
open  pit  project.  The  PFS  is  based  on  a  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  produced  by 
InnovExplo in an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled “Technical Report and 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to 
Regulation  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1)”,  dated  August  2,  2013.  The  PFS  is 
compliant with NI 43-101. 
 
Mining of the Duparquet deposit has been designed as an open pit with a planned 
production of 3,650,000 tonnes per year (3.65M tpy) or 10,000 tonnes per day (tpd), 
365 days per year of mill operation and 360 working days operation for the pit. The 
open  pit  production  is  supplemented  by  4.1  Mt  of  available  old  tailings.  The  old 
tailings  will  be  processed  during  the  beginning  of  the  project  at  a  rate  of  750,000 
tonnes per year.  
 
Geotechnical Study 
A  preliminary  geotechnical  review  was  prepared  by  Jane  Alcott,  M.Sc.,  Eng.  of 
InnovExplo  under  the  supervision  of  Sylvie  Poirier,  Eng.,  for  the  Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (“PEA”) study published on February 28, 2013. No additional 
geotechnical data was evaluated for the current study. The preliminary geotechnical 
assessment and design recommendations are shown below.  
 
Structural Data  
The  Duparquet  geotechnical  review  was  limited  to  a  review  of  existing  data. 
Following  discussions  with  Louis  Martin  (Vice-President  Exploration,  Clifton  Star), 
structural  data  was  taken  from  the  report  titled  Analyse  Structurale  de  Syenite  de 
Beattie  à  Duparquet,  Abitibi,  Canada  (Bigot,  2011).  This  study  was  conducted  by 
researchers at the Université de Montréal for Osisko Mining Corporation. The study 
intended to identify and map the faults, joints and tension structures associated with 
the  Duparquet  mineralization.  The  data  set  consisted  of  79  measurements 
representing faults (48), joints (16), and tension veins (15). All data measurements 
were taken from surface outcrops. The majority of the measurements correspond to 
N-S and E-W orientations with dips typically  in  excess of 60° (Bigot, 2011). Figure 
16.1 summarizes the pole plots, orientation rosettes, pole contours and major planes 
for the entire data set. The major planes are summarized in Table 16.1.

Duparquet Project Pit Slope Recommendations 
Based on the available structural data, the fault structures will control the proposed 
pit slope configurations. At this time there is not enough geotechnical data to permit 
zoning and zone specific pit slope configurations. Therefore, two (2) pit-wide slope 
configurations are proposed. These are summarized in Table 16.2 and Figure 16.2.

Figure 16.2 – Recommended slope configurations for the Duparquet Project
In order to advance to a feasibility study, it is recommended that the proposed slope 
configurations  be  verified.  This  involves  confirming  the  structural  data  over  the 
proposed  open  pit  footprint.  Ideally,  this  would  involve  a  geotechnical  drilling 
program with a minimum of one hole oriented perpendicular to each of the four pit 
walls (North, South, East and West).  
 
Open Pit Optimization Methodology 
The  objective  of  pit  optimization  and  mine  design  is  to  evaluate  the  mineable 
resource and use it as a basis for mine scheduling and economic analysis. 
 
The mineral resource block model developed by InnovExplo has been imported into 
Whittle™  software  from  Dassault  Systèmes  GEOVIA  (formerly  Gemcom  Software
16.3
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
181
16.3.1
International).  Design  parameters  such  as  operating  costs,  mine  recovery,  dilution 
and gold price were used to generate an optimal pit shell. 
The types of material included in the block model used in the optimization are:
www.innovexplo.com
•  Overburden; 
•  Waste host rock; 
•  Water filled-in mined area, including:
o  Glory Hole Lake (old mine breaking through at surface); 
o  Old stopes and drifts; 
Indicated and measured resources;
• 
•  Blocks coded according to their location east or west of Route 393
In the block model, all blocks having at least 0.01% of their volume contained within 
stope solids were rock-coded as stope. Following the interpolation step, the grades 
of all blocks rock-coded as stopes were set to zero (0). InnovExplo decided that such 
conservative  manipulation  was  necessary  in  order  to  compensate  for  the  risk  that 
blocks  near  stopes  are either  mined  out  or  inaccessible  due  to  safety factors. The 
optimization  in  Whittle  does  not  take  into  consideration  changes  in  productivity 
around the old underground workings.  
 
Whittle Parameters and Constraints 
In Whittle, reblocking was used at various levels of integration. The original resource 
block  model  has  a  block  size  (in  metres)  of  5x5x5.  A  first  reblocking  was  done  at 
20x20x10. The first reblocking was used to perform a dilution study by preserving the 
original small blocks (5x5x5) for mining selectivity and merging them in grade bands 
(high and low grade). The resulting dilution is estimated to be equivalent to about 5% 
of the original block model. An additional 5% dilution factor was added to the Whittle 
parameters for a total dilution factor of 10%.  
 
Another  reblocking  of  60x60x20  was  performed.  This  larger  reblocking  is  done  to 
smooth pit walls and floor bottoms, to make room for operating mining equipment, to 
make room for ramps, and for blast design optimization. It facilitates the pit design 
when integrating the ramps and berms using the GEOVIA pit design module.  
 
In order to generate multiple pit shells, the slope angle was set at 55°, as provided in 
the  geotechnical  section.  Preliminary  up-to-date  parameters  were  used  including 
economical,  production  and  variable  mining  costs  according  to  pit  depth.  Also,  a 
number of constraints were integrated:
•  A limit was added to constrain the pit size within the claim limit; 
•  A  constraint  of  30  m  was  added  on  each  side  of  Route  393  in  order  to
preserve the provincial highway.
•  A constraint was put on the golf property perimeter; 
•  A  constraint  was  added  to  preserve  the  access  road  leading  to  the  golf
course and to preserve the houses on the south side of this road;
Although pit shells produced by the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm are optimal from a 
financial  point  of  view,  in  many  cases  the  resulting  “onion  skin”  pits  it  produces 
cannot  be  practically  mined.  More  realistic  pits  can  be  achieved  using  mining 
direction  constraints  in  Whittle  by  specifying  or  forcing  the  mining  to  start  from  a 
particular direction in the pit shell.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
182
16.3.1.1
www.innovexplo.com
In order to develop a pit design for the Duparquet Project that is more practical to 
mine,  an  eastward  mining  direction  was  used  in  Whittle.  By  applying  a  mining 
direction it is possible to control pit development more efficiently to produce a more 
realistic  mining  scenario.  This  allowed  the  pit  to  start  on  the  west  side  and  to 
gradually expand towards the road. It allows a better use of equipment by reducing 
movements  as  a  result  of  more  centralized  mining  activities.  The  mining  direction 
also  reduced  the  size  of  the  waste  stockpiles  for  the  Duparquet  Project,  since  it 
makes  it  possible  to  dump  waste  from  the  east  pit  into  the  west  pit  once  it  is 
completed. 
 
Considering  all  parameters  and  constraints  listed  above,  an  optimal  preliminary  pit 
shell  was  selected  and used for further  optimization  to  serve  as  a  basis  of  a mine 
plan  for  the  current  Prefeasibility  Study.  At  this  point  in  the  process,  advanced 
optimization features were used to optimize the mining phases, the mine schedule 
(Milawa  NPV),  and  the  stockpiles  and  cut-off  grades  (SPCO).  Simultaneous 
Optimization  (SIMO)  was  also  used  but  this  analysis  was  not  successfully 
completed.  
 
Following  the  pit  shell  optimization,  mine  design  was  initiated.  The  mine  design 
process  converts  the  LG  shells  into  operational  open  pit  mine  designs.  This  is  an 
iterative process and once completed, the total contents of the designed pit should 
not differ considerably from the contents of the shell on which it is based.  
 
The first step in the iteration process is to make a pit design that fits the selected pit 
shell.  To  do  so,  a  pit  design,  including  a  ramp  and  catch  bench,  is  made  in  the 
selected pitshell. For the Duparquet Project, the initial pit wall angle of 55º was too 
steep to accommodate the ramp. The slope angle was smoothed until a ramp could 
fit in the Whittle pit shell. Many iterations were needed before finding an adequate pit 
wall angle.  
 
Pit slopes were set at 29° in the overburden, 45° on the north side of the pits, and 
48° on the south side of the pit. The ramp was designed on the north side of the pit 
due to the constraints imposed by the golf course and houses on the south side and 
due to the location of the mill. 
 
The mining sequence obtained from the Whittle pit shell that suited the pit designwas 
used to initiate cost estimation for the current PFS. 
 
Final Whittle Parameters  
The  concurrent  prefeasibility  work  allowed  InnovExplo  and  Roche  Ltd  Consulting 
Group (“Roche”) to better quantify the operating costs. These costs were used for a 
final pit optimization. These parameters are presented in Table 16.3.

The mining cost of $1.93/t represents the initial cost to mine the rock present at the 
surface of the open pit. An incremental hauling cost of $0.21 per kilometre of ramp 
was added, depending on pit depth. 
 
Final Optimization Results 
A series of potential pit shells were generated by Whittle for the Duparquet Project 
based  on  varying  revenue  factors.  The  pit  shells  were  generated  from  revenue 
factors ranging from 0.25 to 1.0. The revenue factors were applied to the base case 
gold price of C$1,417.50/oz. The results of the potential pit shells are summarized in 
Figure 16.3.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
184
www.innovexplo.com
Figure 16.3 – Whittle pit shell optimization results
For  each  pit  shell,  Whittle  calculated  a  base  case  scenario  assuming  that  every 
internal pit shell is mined out sequentially, and a worst case scenario assuming that 
mining takes place bench by bench. The best case scenario provides the upper NPV 
boundary limit while the worst case scenario provides the lower NPV boundary limit. 
The optimal pit selected usually ranges between the best and worst case boundary 
limits.  Based  on  the  analysis  of  the  Whittle  pit  shells,  pit  shell  11  with  a  revenue 
factor  of  0.8  was  chosen  as  the  base  case  pit  shell  for  further  phasing  and 
scheduling for the Duparquet Project. This pit shell has been chosen because it was 
the best case in the worst case scenario; this ensures that optimization remains on 
the conservative side and that a robust mine plan is proposed.  
 
Phasing of the pit was investigated by using smaller pit shells to determine project 
pushbacks.  Three  (3)  pushbacks  were  necessary  on  the  Beattie  pit  and  two  (2) 
pushbacks were necessary on the Donchester and Central Duparquet pit. 
 
The  Whittle  pit  shell  selected  for  this  PFS  generates  35,238,429  tonnes  of  ore. 
Another 4,124,600 tonnes from the old tailings completes the resources for a total of 
39,363,029  tonnes  of  ore  from  which  0.5%  is  Measured  Resources  and  99.5%  is 
Indicated  Resources.  The  pit  also  generates  291,213,881  tonnes  of  waste  and 
23,398,085 tonnes of overburden, resulting in a LOM strip ratio of 8.26 to 1. Taking 
into account the overburden, the LOM strip ratio is 8.92 to 1. The estimated life-of-
mine (LOM) average grade is 1.50 g/t, including the ore from the pit and from the old 
tailings. A total of 1,894,365 ounces of gold would be produced over the LOM. Table

Final Open Pit Mine Design 
From the selected Whittle optimized pit shell, a ramp was designed into the pit and 
the design was smoothed to remove irregularities that are inconsistent with operating 
practices. The detailed pit design work was carried out using the GEOVIA™ package 
software. The pit design includes a haulage ramp access to all benches, except the 
last two (2) benches that will only have temporary access ramp, as well as the pit 
slope  design  and  the  safety  berm  as  presented  in  the  previously  described 
geotechnical study. 
 
The designed pits are approximately 3,508 m long by 1,120 m wide and 360 m deep. 
 
Haul Road  
The  ramp  was  designed  for  double  lane  traffic  in  general,  except  for  the  Central 
Duparquet pit in the east. The northeast side of the Beattie pit is also designed for 
single-lane traffic (Fig. 16.3). The detailed open pit design is shown in Figure 16.4.

For the single lane traffic, the travel width should be not less than 2 times the width 
of the biggest equipment, with allowance for a bumper when a fall of more than 3 m 
is  possible.  For  the  double  lane  traffic,  the  travel  width  should  be  not  less  than  3 
times the width of the biggest equipment, with allowance for a bumper when a fall of 
more than 3 m is possible. The muck bumper needs to be at least half the height of 
the largest tire on any equipment hauling on the road. The berm slope was estimated 
at 35°, which is lightly less than the angle of repose. It must be placed on the edge of 
the haulage road whenever a drop is greater than 3 m. Ditches are included in the 
travel width. 
 
The biggest equipment in this project is the 136-tonne capacity off-road haul truck, 
and  road  widths  are  based  on  its  specifications.  The  136-tonne  rear-dump  truck 
operating width is 7.06 m and half the tire height is 1.5 m. Based on this truck, the 
haul road design is as follows:
•  Single lane traffic with one bumper: 18.5 m 
•  Single lane traffic with two bumpers: 23 m 
•  Double lane traffic with one bumper: 25.5 m 
•  Double lane traffic with two bumpers: 30 m
Based  on  the  productivity  rate  and  sensitivity  to  the  stripping  ratio,  it  was  decided 
that for the last five (5) benches, three would be served by a one-way ramp. In order 
to reduce the volume of waste to be stripped, the last two (2) benches will not have 
permanent ramp access. 
 
The  ramp  gradient  is  10%,  and  the  ramp  exit  is  on  the  north  side  of  the  pit  to 
minimize  the  haulage  distance  to  the  waste  dump,  stockpile  or  mill,  the  latter  of 
which presently located on the north side of the Beattie and Donchester pits. 
 
Bench Height 
The  Duparquet  pit  design  is  based  on  double  benching  with  10-m  single  benches. 
This  option  was  chosen  based  on  the  preliminary  geotechnical  assessment 
presented in Section 16.2 of the Report.  
 
Berm Width 
A  minimum  catch  bench  of  8.5  m  has  been  considered  in  the  preliminary 
geotechnical study when using double benches.  
 
Stockpile Design 
A stockpile is used in a way that optimizes the cut-off grade throughout the mining 
period. A maximum of 5.7 Mt of ore will be directed to the stockpile. The minimum 
cut-off of that stockpile is estimated at 0.51 g/t. 
 
Waste Management 
Three waste piles are planned, two on the west side Route 393 and one on the east 
side. This is meant to limit equipment traveling between each side of the road. Most 
of the waste generated from the west pit will remain on this side of the road and the 
same  for  the  waste  generated  on  the  east  side.  According  to  the  mine  plan 
sequence, it will be possible to send approximately 25 Mt of waste from the east pit

to the west pit once mining of the west pit is complete. This will allow the size of the 
waste pile to be reduced. 
 
Mine Dilution and Mine Recovery Estimation  
InnovExplo  evaluated  dilution  and  mine  recovery  by  performing  an  analysis  of 
mineable  blocks  on  typical  cross-sections  at  the  mill  cut-off  grade.  After  a  cross-
sectional evaluation, average dilution was estimated at 10% at a grade of 0 g/t, and 
mine  recovery  was  estimated  at  95%  assuming  good  blasting  and  dilution  control 
practices.  
 
To integrate dilution in Whittle, an initial 5% dilution factor was used when performing 
reblocking and merging the original small blocks (5x5x5) into grade bands (high and 
low).  This  feature  defines  a  maximum  number  of  parcels  per  reblock  blocks.  This 
action regroups the smaller blocks of 5x5x5 into larger parcels, by grade interval. In 
this  evaluation,  two  parcels  were  considered.  The  resulting  parcel  includes  blocks 
lower than the cut-off grade that are considered internal dilution. If the average grade 
of the parcel is higher than the cut-off grade, it is considered as ore and sent to the 
mill. This dilution was estimated at 5%. An additional 5% dilution factor was added to 
the Whittle parameters for a total dilution factor of 10%. 
 
Mine Production Schedule 
The  life-of-mine (LOM) for  the  Duparquet  Pit  was  based  on  supplying  the  mill  with 
3,650,000  tonnes  of  ore  per  year.  Initially,  4.1  Mt  of  tailings  would  be  reserved  to 
supplement the mill when necessary, but it was later decided to process the tailings 
at a rate of 750,000 tonnes per year right from the start in order to clean the tailings 
area to make room for the waste stockpile #2 for the west pit.  
 
The  mining  schedule  will  require  the  extraction  of  39,363,029  tonnes  of  ore  and 
291,213,881  tonnes  of  waste  rock,  resulting  in  a  LOM  strip  ratio  of  8.26  to  1.  The 
overburden consists of 23,398,919 tonnes. Taking into account the overburden, the 
LOM strip ratio is 8.93 to 1. The stripping ratio (waste to ore) will not necessarily be 
constant.  Stockpiles  will  be  used  to  vary  the  cut-off  grade  in  order  to  optimize  the 
economics of the Project. The ore, waste and tailings production distribution plan is 
presented in Table 16.5 on a yearly basis and in Table 16.7 on a daily basis. 
 
The LOM for the Duparquet Pit will be spread over 11 years, preceded by a 4-year 
pre-production  period.  This  schedule  will  yield  a  yearly  production  of  3,650,000 
tonnes (Table 16.6). 
 
In order to provide material for construction of road, foundations, dyke and tailings, 
waste  pre-stripping  work  will  be  initiated  in  PP2.  Also,  the  existing  pit  contains 
approximately 5.7 Mm3 of water. At the start of the projectProject, it is estimated that 
2 Mm3 need to be dewatered, and that it will take approximately six (6) months. 
 
The pre-production period is estimated at 4 years and identified as year PP1 to year 
PP4.  During  Year  PP4,  894,717  tonnes  of  ore  will  be  mined  from  which  400,000 
tonnes at an average grade of 1.14 g/t will be used for the mill start up and the rest 
will be send to the stockpile to help support the first year of production. Also 135,450 
tonnes at an average grade of 0.93 g/t from the old tailings will be processed during 
the  start-up  period.  A  total  of  16,608  ounces  of  gold  will  be  recovered  from  which
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
189
www.innovexplo.com
3,398  ounces  will  come  from  processing  the  old  tailings  with  a  recovery  factor  of 
83.95%, and 13,210 ounces will come from processing the mineralized pit material 
with a recovery of 90.1%.  
 
From  Year  1  to  Year  5,  2,900,000  tonnes  of  mineralized  material  processed  will 
come from the pit or the stockpile containing mineralized material from the pit, and 
750,000  tonnes  will  be  from  the  old  tailings.  During  these  years,  full  production  of 
3,650,000 tonnes is reached, producing an average of 173,000 ounces per year. 
 
During  Year  6,  the  rest  of  the  old  tailings  will  be  processed,  representing  239,150 
tonnes at a grade of 0.93 g/t. In addition, 3,275,400 tonnes of mineralized material 
from  the  pit  will  be  processed  at  an  average  grade  of  1.32  g/t.  A  total  of  131,004 
ounces of gold will be recovered during that year. 
 
From Year 7 to Year 10, all the ore will be provided from the pit or the stockpile. The 
yearly process rate will be constant and will be 3,650,000 tonnes. A total of 636,405 
ounces  of  gold  will  be  recovered.  Year  10  corresponds  to  the  final  year  of  pit 
operation,  and  manpower  requirements  will  gradually  decrease  over  the  course  of 
the year.  
 
During Year 11, only the stockpile will feed the mill, for a total of 2,463,029 tonnes at 
a grade of 0.70 g/t, producing 50,214 ounces of gold.

Mine operations 
Drilling  
The drilling pattern has been selected in order to control blast induced vibrations and 
airblast  overpressures  in  the  Town  of  Duparquet.  The  spacing  and  burden  for  the 
Project were estimated at 6.5 m and 6 m respectively. Percussion drills with 215 mm 
bit size will be used in ore and waste. A penetration rate of 22 m/hr was used when 
estimating  equipment  requirements.  A  total  of  four  (4)  drills  will  be  required  to 
achieve the production target. 
 
Pre-split blasting will be done in order to maximize stable bench face and inter-ramp 
angles along the final walls. The pre-split consists of a row of closely-spaced holes 
along the final excavation limit. One percussion drill with 140 mm bit size will be used 
for pre-shear and holes will be drilled at an interval of 1.5 m. 
 
Blasting 
An  explosives  supplier  will  provide  the  mine  with  explosives.  In  this  study,  it  was 
assumed  that  the  explosives  will  be  truck  to  Duparquet  from  the  supplier  plant 
located in Malartic.  
 
The  proximity  of  both  the  town  and  much  of  the  underground  and  surface  water 
requires  that  emulsion  be  used  as  an  explosive.  At  this  stage  of  the  Project,  only 
electronic  detonators  have  been  considered  in  the  cost  estimation.  Electronic 
detonators allow for more precise blasts and consequently provide better control on 
rock  projection  and  vibrations.  In  addition,  blasting  mats  will  be  used  as  a 
supplementary precaution to avoid any potential risk of rock projectiles.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The loading of explosives into the drill holes will be done by truck and the service will 
be  provided  by  the  supplier.  The  holes  will  be  stemmed  to  avoid  fly-rock  and 
excessive air blasts. A small loader will be used to dump the crushed rock into the 
drill holes.  
 
A powder factor of 0.31 kg/t was estimated considering the parameters presented in 
Table  16.8.  These  parameters  will  need  to  be  re-evaluated  in  a  future  detailed 
blasting study.
Table 16.8 – Blasting parameter assumptions
16.10.3
Loading 
The fleet recommendation is based on a Fleet Production and Cost (FPC) analysis 
performed by Hewitt Equipment Ltd on the basis of the mine plan data supplied by 
InnovExplo. The FPC analysis compared different hauler and loader combinations in 
order to minimize the cost per tonne while enabling sufficient flexibility and backup 
capacity for efficient mining operations. The outcome of the analysis showed that the 
6030FS  Electric  Hydraulic  Shovels  combined  with  the  785D  Mining  Truck  was  the 
best  combination  to  meet  that  objective.  Based  on  the  data  available  on  the  site 
physical characteristics, Hewitt believe that the 785D Mining Trucks are suitable for 
all material to be excavated from the mine site including the overburden.  
 
Electric  shovels  were  not  retained;  instead,  diesel  shovels  were  chosen  for  the 
Project.  Although  electric  shovels  are  more  economical, 
less 
manoeuvrability than diesel shovels, which is a key consideration for the Duparquet 
Project is as the pits are not uniform. A 6030 Backhoe Diesel shovel was added to 
the fleet for overburden removal and to serve as a backup loader for waste and ore 
production. 
 
Only  one  model  of  shovel  is  considered  in  this  study.  This  will  simplify  the  spare 
equipment requirements, thereby reducing the equipment capital. Three (3) 6030 FS 
shovels will be needed. Two (2) of them will be used for the production and one (1) 
6030 Backhoe Diesel shovel will be added to the fleet for overburden removal and to 
serve as a backup loader for waste and ore production. One (1) CAT 994H  wheel

loader will also be necessary in the loading fleet to load ore from the ore stockpile to 
the mill and as a backup. Table 16.9 presents parameters used in the fleet analysis.

Hauling 
The truck fleet  will  be  composed  of a  maximum  of fourteen (14)  136-tonne  trucks. 
The  ore  and  waste  will  be  hauled  in  those  trucks.  The  fleet  study  performed  by 
Hewitt Equipment determined the number of trucks required each year. InnovExplo 
provided information on rock movement quantities and travel distances on a yearly 
based, calculated from the centroid of excavated tonnage. This information was used 
to estimate the truck fleet and loading equipment requirements.  
 
For the current study, it is assumed that trucks will be crossing Route 393 to access 
the different parts of the Property. However, a detailed analysis of other options will 
need to be investigated in a future study.
16.10.5  Working Around Existing Underground Openings
In order to mitigate the risk of working around underground workings, it will be 
necessary to develop strict safety procedures prior to commencing operations. In the 
current study, it has been assumed that openings will be backfilled and that a crane 
will be used as an anchor for equipment and personnel when working around 
openings.  
 
Pit Maintenance 
Pit  maintenance  services  include  haul  road  maintenance,  waste  pile  construction, 
mobilizing operating supplies, and relocating equipment. Haul road maintenance is a
16.10.6
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

major  aspect  of  pit  maintenance  since  it  enhances  the  life  of  the  production 
equipment  (particularly  the  tires)  which  represents  a  significant  portion  of  the 
operating cost. Keeping haul roads in good condition also improves truck speed and 
thereby helps maintain production levels. 
 
 Mining Equipment 
Hewitt Equipment recommended the principal preliminary mining equipment for the 
PFS. Three (3) 6030FS shovels have been chosen for the Project as well as one (1) 
994H front-end loader. It has been determined that 785D trucks will be used for the 
Project.  A  total  of  14  trucks  will  be  necessary  during  the  production  peak,  which 
covers  Years  2  to  7.  Sanvik  recommended  two  types  of  drill  for  the  Project,  one 
DR540 for the pre-shear drilling, which will drill 140 mm holes, and four (4) D55SP 
drills for the production drilling, which will drill 215 mm holes. Crane operation will be 
contracted  when  required  for  safety  purposes  while  working  around  old  openings. 
InnovExplo created a list of the utility equipment required for the Project; these are 
presented in Table 16.10.

Manpower 
A total of 339 employees will be needed for the Duparquet Project. This assumes an 
operation that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year. 
  
The  working  schedule  for  most  yearly  compensated  employees  will  be  a  standard 
40-hour week at 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday to Friday. Some yearly 
compensated employees will be  working 12-hour shifts, equivalent to 84 hours per 
week,  as  part  of  a  two-week  repeating  schedule:  the  first  week  working  4  days 
followed by 3 days off, the second week working 3 days followed by 4 days off. The 
hourly workers will be working 12-hour shifts as part of the same two-week repeating 
schedule.  Most  activities  require  24-hour  per  day  operation,  which  is  split  into  4 
shifts. 
 
The  Duparquet  Project  is  close  to  a  number  of the  Abitibi  region’s  main  cities  and 
towns. From Year 10, manpower needs will gradually decrease until the end of the 
mine  during  Year  11.  Once  in  full  production,  the  workforce  will  consist  of  339 
employees.

RECOVERY METHODS
Based  on  the  testwork  described  in  Section  13,  two  processing  options  were 
selected  for  the  recovery  of  the  gold  from  the  Duparquet  Project  ores:  the 
Concentrate  option  and  the  pressure  oxidation  option  (“POX  option”).  While  gold 
doré would be produced on site with the POX option, the Concentrate option would 
produce a sulphide concentrate product for sale. 
 
Process Description – Concentrate Option 
The  Concentrate  option  would  produce  a  sulphide  rich  concentrate  having  the 
highest gold content possible. Maximizing the gold content in the concentrate has an 
impact  on  the  flotation  gold  recovery,  and  justifies  a  CIL  circuit  to  recover  the 
remaining gold from the flotation tailings. 
 
A  conventional  open  circuit  primary  crushing  stage  was  chosen  followed  by  two 
grinding  stages,  coupled  with  a  flotation  circuit  including  rougher,  1st  cleaner,  2nd 
cleaner  and  regrinding  of  the  rougher  concentrate,  as  well  as  cyanidation  of  the 
flotation  tails  with  CIL  recovery  of  the  gold.  The  gold  will  be  recovered  from  the 
carbon  by  elution, 
followed  by  electrowinning  and  doré  smelting.  Carbon 
regeneration  has  also  been  included.  A  simplified  flow  diagram  is  shown  in  Figure 
17.1. 
 
Process Flowsheets – Concentrate Option 
Thirteen (13) flowsheets have been developed for the Concentrate option. They are 
described  below.  A  simplified  flowsheet  of  the  overall  process  is  shown  in  Figure 
17.1 at the end of this section. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0002, Primary Crushing, Stockpile and Ore Handling Circuits, Area 
100 & 120 
 
The Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore will be crushed to P80 157mm, stockpiled, and fed to the 
plant at a constant rate of 453 t/h.  
 
104812-N-P-FS-0003, Grinding Circuit, Area 200 
 
The grinding circuit will further reduce the crushed ore from F80 157mm to P80 100µm 
and deliver the ground ore to the flotation circuit 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0004, Flotation and Regrind Circuit, Area 300 
 
The flotation  circuit  will  produce  a  sulphide  gold  concentrate  with  50  g/t  Au  grade, 
using rougher flotation, regrind of the rougher concentrate, and two stages of cleaner 
flotation.  The  rougher  tails  will  be  sent  to  the  CIL  circuit  for  the  recovery  of  the 
remaining gold. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0005, Concentrate Thickener and Filtration Circuit, Area 320 
 
The  concentrate  thickener  and  filtration  circuit  will  thicken  and  filter  the  flotation 
concentrate to 6.5% moisture, which is suitable for transport by truck or train.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
199
104812-N-P-FS-0006, Flotation Tails Pre-Leach Thickener, Area 500 
 
The  flotation  tails  pre-leach  thickener  will  thicken  the  flotation  tails  prior  to  their 
transfer  to  the  leach  and  CIL  circuit.  Water  recovered  will  be  recirculated  to  the 
process. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0007, Leach and CIL Circuit, Area 520 
 
The  leach  and  CIL  circuit  will  dissolve  the  gold  using  a  sodium  cyanide/caustic 
solution  and  adsorb  it  on  activated  carbon,  where  the  gold  will  be  stripped  from 
carbon in the elution circuit. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0008,  Final  Tailings  Thickener,  Cyanide  Destruction  and  Process 
Water Circuit, Area 600 and 800 
 
The  CIL  tailings  will  be  thickened  in  the  final  tailings  thickener  to  50-55%  solid 
density,  and then  be  sent to the  cyanide  destruction  tank to  destroy  the  remaining 
cyanide in the slurry. The final tailings are then transferred to the tailings pond.  
 
104812-N-P-FS-0009, Carbon Stripping Circuit, Area 540 
 
The carbon stripping circuit is designed to strip the gold from the loaded carbon and 
send the gold-pregnant solution to the refinery circuit. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0010, Carbon Reactivation Circuit, Area 540 
 
The carbon reactivation circuit uses an indirectly fired propane kiln to reactivate the 
stripped carbon for reuse in the process. 
 
104812-N-P-FS-0011, Refinery Circuit, Area 540 
 
In the refinery, gold is electrolytically plated from the pregnant carbon strip solution 
onto steel wool cathodes in the electrowinning cells. The gold laden steel wool will 
be smelted in a tilting furnace with the addition of fluxes and will be poured into the 
doré ingot moulds.  
 
104812-N-P-FS-0012-13, Reagents Circuit, Area 700 
 
The reagents  area  will  be  used to  prepare  and distribute the  required  reagents for 
the  flotation  circuit:  lime  (pH  Control),  MIBC  (frother),  PAX  (collector),  R208 
(collector); for the leach and CIL circuit: sodium cyanide (lixiviant), lime (pH control); 
and  for  the  cyanide  destruction  circuit:  sulphur dioxide  (oxidant),  lime  (pH  control), 
copper sulphate (catalyst), and flocculant for the thickening circuits.
104812-N-P-FS-0014, Air Services, Area 820 
 
The air services will provide the compressed air for the plant services as well as the 
leach,  CIL,  and  cyanide  destruction  circuits.  Moreover,  low  pressure  air  will  be 
produced by air blowers and will be delivered to the flotation circuit.  
104812-N-P-FS-0015, Water Services, Area 800
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

Concentrator Plant Design – Concentrate Option 
The  plant  is  designed  to  operate  24  h/d,  365  d/yr,  and  process  3.65  Mt  of 
mineralized material (dry) annually, at a plant availability of 92%. The nominal daily 
throughput will be 10,000 tonnes of dry material. 
 
The ROM ore will be trucked by mine haulage trucks to the crushing plant, dumped 
into  the  crusher  feed  hopper,  and  conveyed  by  apron  feeder  into  the  primary  jaw 
crusher. The crusher product will then be conveyed by two conveyors to the crushed 
ore  stockpile.  The  live  capacity  of  the  stockpile  will  be  10,000  tonnes  with  a  total 
capacity  around  36,000  tonnes.  Apron  feeders  will  then  draw  off  the  material  at 
452.9 t/h from below the stockpile and conveyors will deliver the material to the SAG 
mill feed chute. 
 
The SAG mill is driven by a 5,670 kW (7,200 hp) motor. The SAG mill product will be 
discharged to the SAG mill discharge screen; the coarse material (screen oversize) 
will  be  conveyed  to  the  pebble  crusher  driven  by  a  315  kW  motor  and  crushed 
pebbles will be recirculated to the SAG mill. The screen undersize will gravity-feed 
the  pump  box  and  mix  with  the  ball  mill  discharge.  The  secondary  grinding  circuit 
consists of one 6,410 kW (8,600 hp) ball mill which will operate in closed circuit with 
one  hydrocyclone  cluster.  The  hydrocyclone  underflow  will  return  into  the  ball  mill 
while the overflow with a P80 of 100 µm will gravity-feed to the trash screen prior to 
transfer to the conditioner tank of the flotation circuit. 
 
The flotation  circuit consists  of  one  (1)  conditioning tank,  eleven  (11)  rougher  tank 
cells, six (6) 1st cleaner cells, two (2) 2nd cleaner cells, and a rougher concentrate 
regrind mill. Reagents will be added to the conditioning tank and to different points of 
the rougher and cleaner flotation stages. The rougher flotation tails will be pumped to 
the flotation tailings pre-leach thickener feed tank ahead of the cyanidation and CIL 
circuits. The rougher flotation concentrate will be pumped to the regrind cyclone feed 
pump box. The regrind ball mill will operate in closed circuit with one cyclone cluster. 
The cyclone underflow will be returned to the regrind mill while the cyclone overflow 
with P80 of 35  µm will be pumped to the 1st cleaner cells. The 1st cleaner tails will 
return to the rougher feed while the concentrate will be pumped to the 2nd cleaner 
cells. The second cleaner tails will be pumped back to the 1st cleaner feed, while the
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
204
www.innovexplo.com
2nd  cleaner  concentrate  will  be  the  final  product  of  the  flotation  circuit  with  2.47% 
weight recovery (247 tpd concentrate), 50 g/t Au content, and 86.4% gold recovery. 
 
The flotation tails will be delivered to the pre-leach thickener. The thickener will raise 
the solid density of the slurry to approximately 60-65%. The thickener underflow will 
then be mixed with final tailings thickener overflow to achieve a slurry with 45-50% 
solid density that will feed the cyanidation tanks. Lime will be added to the thickener 
to  raise  the  pH  level  to  10.5,  which  will  ensure  that  no  hydrogen  cyanide  evolves 
from  the  first  leach  tank  following  the  addition  of  sodium  cyanide.  The  thickener 
overflow will be returned to the process and used as process make-up water.  
 
Lime and sodium cyanide will be added to the first leach tank and the third and fourth 
CIL tanks to maintain a constant extraction rate. The pulp will decant from first leach 
tank to the second tank and from the first CIL tank to the sixth tank over the course 
of 24 hours. The gold in solution in the CIL tanks will be adsorbed onto the activated 
carbon. 
 
The carbon will be contained by in-tank screens which will reverse the carbon flow 
counter-current to the incoming slurry. Fresh/reactivated carbon will be fed to the last 
tank in the CIL train, and a safety screen will extract any broken carbon that escapes 
through the in tank screens. The undersize (slurry) from the screen will be pumped 
to the final tailings thickener. 
 
The gold-loaded carbon will be pumped from the first CIL tank to the loaded carbon 
screen.  The  oversize  (carbon  fraction)  from  the  screen  will  be  discharged  into  the 
loaded  carbon  tank  and  will  then  be  pumped  to  the  elution  circuit,  while  the 
undersize will be recycled back into the cyanidation tank. 
 
In the elution circuit, the loaded carbon will be washed with recirculating hydrochloric 
acid in the acid wash vessel, neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), and 
then  washed  with  process  water  prior  to  being  pumped  to  the  carbon  stripping 
vessel. In the carbon stripping vessel the gold will be stripped from the carbon using 
a  hot caustic  cyanide  solution. The  solution  will  be  maintained  at  a  temperature of 
135 °C  and  an  internal  pressure  of  350  kPa.  The  stripping  solution  will  be  heated 
with  solution  heaters  and  heat  exchangers,  and  then  pumped  into  the  stripping 
vessel. The gold laden solution will exit the stripping vessel via the heat exchanger 
and flowing into the pregnant solution storage tank. 
 
The  pregnant  solution  will  be  pumped  into  the  electrolytic  (electrowinning)  cells 
where  the  gold  will  be  plated  out  of  solution  onto  the  steel  wool  cathodes.  The 
stripped  solution  will  exit  the  electrowinning  cells  and  will  gravity-feed  the  barren 
solution tank for reuse during the next elution cycle once the cyanide concentration 
is restored.  
 
The  gold  laden  steel  wool  will  be  smelted  in  a  tilting  furnace  with  the  addition  of 
fluxes,  typically  sodium  borate,  sodium  carbonate,  and  silica.  The  impurities  are 
slagged off and the gold will be poured into the doré ingot moulds. The slag will be 
recycled back to the jaw crusher feed to re-enter the process to minimize the gold 
losses. The gold recovery from the flotation tails CIL circuit will be 47.8% of the CIL 
feed or 6.5% of the plant feed.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
205
17.1.4
www.innovexplo.com
The  stripped  carbon  will  be  regenerated  at  650 °C  in  an  indirectly-fired  kiln  for  30 
minutes  in  the  absence  of  oxygen.  It  will  then  be  cooled  in  a  quench  tank.  The 
reactivated  carbon  will  be  pumped  into  the  carbon  attrition  tank,  where  the  fresh 
carbon will be added as make-up to replace attrited carbon. Prior to return into the 
CIL circuit, the reactivated carbon will be screened to remove any fine carbon which 
may adsorb gold. If the fines are allowed back into the CIL circuit, they would cause 
gold losses for the process.  
 
The final tailings will be  thickened in the final tailings thickener and detoxed  in the 
cyanide  destruction  circuit  (CND  circuit)  prior  to  transfer  to  the  tailings  pond.  The 
CND will be performed at 50-55% solid density using the SO2-air method.  
 
It is expected that approximately 417 m3/d of water enters in the plant as moisture in 
the  ore.  The  outgoing  water  will  be  the  water  content  in  the  products  of  the  plant: 
17 m3/d with the concentrate and 9,311 m3/d with the final tailings. The total process 
water  requirement  will  be  27,806  m3/d  which  will  be  recirculated  from  the  flotation 
concentrate  and  the  tailings  thickener  overflows,  as  well  as  tailings  pond  reclaim. 
The  total  fresh  water  requirement  for  the  reagents  and  flocculant  preparation  is 
estimated at 252 m3/d.

Process Description – POX Option 
The POX processing option also uses crushing, grinding, and flotation, but followed 
by pressure oxidation and cyanidation of the oxidized flotation concentrate. For the 
POX  option,  the  flotation  circuit  is  operated  to  maximize  gold  recovery  to  flotation 
concentrate instead of maximizing the gold concentrate grade as in the Concentrate 
option. With much less gold being rejected in the flotation tailings, cyanidation of the 
tailings  is  currently  not  economically  feasible  in  light  of  the  CAPEX  and  OPEX 
associated with a tailings CIL circuit, as well as the price of gold used ($1,350/oz).  
 
The  POX  option  uses  the  same  crushing  and  grinding  circuits  as  the  Concentrate 
option. The flotation circuit will include the rougher, regrind, and 1st cleaner circuits 
(2nd cleaner will not be needed). After thickening, the flotation concentrate will pass 
through  the  pressure  oxidation  circuit  to  be  oxidized  followed  by  a  carbon-in-pulp 
(CIP)  circuit  for  cyanidation  and  adsorption  for  gold  recovery.  The  flotation  tailings 
will  be  considered  as  final  tailings.  In  the  CIP  circuit,  gold  will  be  cyanide  leached 
and  adsorbed  on  the  carbon  and  then  recovered  from  the  carbon  by  an  elution 
circuit, followed by electrowinning and doré smelting as previously described for the 
Concentrate option tailings CIL circuit. Carbon regeneration has also been included. 
A simplified flow diagram is shown in the Figure 17.3.

NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The flotation circuit consists of one (1) conditioning tank, eleven (11) rougher cells, 
six  (6)  cleaner  cells,  and  a  rougher  concentrate  regrind  circuit.  Reagents  will  be 
added  to  the  conditioning  tank  and  to  several  points  of  the  rougher  and  cleaner 
flotation  stages.  The  rougher  flotation  tails  will  be  pumped  to  the  flotation  tailings 
thickener feed tank. The rougher flotation concentrate will be pumped to the regrind 
cyclone  feed  pump  box.  Regrind  ball  mill  will  operate  in  closed  circuit  with  one 
cyclone  cluster.  The  cyclone  underflow  will  be  return  to  the  regrind  mill  while  the 
cyclone  overflow  with  P80  of  35  µm  will  be  pumped  to  the  1st  cleaner  cells.  The 
cleaner tails will return to the rougher feed, while the cleaner concentrate will be the 
final product of the flotation circuit with 6.2% weight recovery (620 tpd concentrate), 
21.1 g/t Au content, and 91.7% gold recovery. 
 
The flotation tailings will be thickened by the flotation tailings thickener prior to being 
sent to the tailings pond. 
 
The  flotation  sulphide  concentrate  contains  ~7.2%  carbonate  minerals  which 
consume acid and release carbon dioxide. The build-up of carbon dioxide gas within 
the  pressure  oxidation  stage  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  controlling  the  partial 
pressure of oxygen required for the oxidation of sulphide minerals. Therefore a pre-
leach acidification step is used to limit the amount of carbonate material reporting to 
the autoclave. The acid required for the pre-leach is recovered from the solid-liquid 
separation stage following pressure oxidation in the CCD and neutralization circuit. 
This minimizes the amount of acid that has to be imported to the site. 
The concentrate pre-leach circuit consists of two agitated tanks with a total residence 
time  of  4  hours.  Thickened  concentrate  slurry  from  flotation  circuit  is  pumped  at  a 
rate  of  28.1  t/h  of  solids  to  the  first  of  the  two  pre-leach  tanks  where  acidic  liquor 
from the CCD overflow is added at a rate of 51 m3/h (acid at 50 g/L). 
 
The reactions associated with the decomposition of carbonates during the pre-leach 
are as follows:
CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2O + CO2
CaMg(CO3)2 + 2 H2SO4 → MgSO4 + CaSO4 + 2 H2O + 2 CO2
CaSO4 + 2H2O → CaSO4·2H2O 
CaFe(CO3) + 2 H2SO4 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O + FeSO4 + CaSO4
The acidified slurry is then pumped by one of two pumps to the autoclave feed tank 
at a rate of 92.3 t/h (27% solids). 
 
POX  is  used  to  oxidize  sulphides  in  the  concentrate  in  an  autoclave  to  enable 
treatment in a conventional oxide gold recovery treatment plant.  
 
Acidified  concentrate  slurry  from  the  pre-leach  passes  through  a  fixed  screen  to 
remove  any  oversize  material  before  reporting  to  the  autoclave  feed  tank.  The 
agitated  slurry  feed  tank  has  an  8  hour  buffer  of  sulphide  concentrate  before  the 
autoclave. The autoclave processes concentrate at a feed rate of 28 t/h with a solids 
content of 30%.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The POX autoclave design incorporates a large autoclave (4.1 m x 18.81 m tan-to-
tan)  consisting  of  five  agitated  compartments,  one  flash  tank  vessel  and  a  gas 
handling  system.  The  autoclave  will  operate  at  210 ºC  and  3,100  kPa  with  a 
retention time of approximately 60 minutes.  
 
A cryogenic oxygen plant supplies high pressure oxygen to the autoclave chambers 
at  98%  purity.  Process  water  is  used  as  quench  water  to  control  the  temperature 
within the autoclave.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The reactions that occur in the autoclave are as follows:
Sulphide oxidation and iron and arsenic precipitation reactions
4 FeS2 + 2 H2O + 15 O2 → 2 H2SO4 + 2 Fe2(SO4)3
CuFeS2 + 4 O2 → CuSO4 + FeSO4
2 FeAsS + 7 O2 + 2 H2O + H2SO4 → 2 H3AsO4 + Fe2(SO4)3
2 H3AsO4 + 4 H2O + Fe2(SO4)3 → 2 FeAsO4H4O + 3 H2SO4
Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 H2O → 2 Fe(OH)SO4 + H2SO4
3 Fe2(SO4)3 + 14 H2O → 2 H3O-Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 5 H2SO4
Fe2O3 + 3 H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 H2O
Phyllosilicate and framework silicate decomposition reactions
2 KAlSi3O8 + H2SO4 → H2O + K2SO4 + 6 SiO2 + Al2O3
2 NaAlSi3O8 + 4 H2SO4 → Al2(SO4)3 + Na2SO4 + 4 H2O + 6 SiO2
2 KMgAl3Si3 + H2SO4 + O2 → K2SO4 + 6 SiO2 + 3 H2O + 3 Al2O3 + 2 MgO
4 KFeAl3Si3 + 2 H2SO4 + 3 O2 → 6 H2O + 12 SiO2 + 2 K2SO4 + 6 Al2O3 + 2 
Fe2O3
Al2Si2O9H + 3 H2SO4 → 2 SiO2 + 5 H2O + Al2(SO4)3
Jarosite and alunite formation
K2SO4 + 3 Fe2(SO4)3 + 12 H2O → 2 KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 6 H2SO4
4 Ag + 6 Fe2(SO4)3 + 22 H2O + O2 → 4 AgFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 10 H2SO4
3 Al2(SO4)3 + K2SO4 + 12 aH2O → 6 H2SO4 + 2 KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6
Na2SO4 + 12 H2O + 3 Fe2(SO4)3 → 2 NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 6 H2SO4
Sulphide  minerals  are  fully  oxidized  with  jarosite  minerals  being  the  predominate 
product. The arsenic is precipitated as ferric arsenate. The overall POX process is 
exothermic and keeps the autoclave at operating temperature.

Leached  slurry  residue  from  the  autoclave  is  let  down  to  just  above  atmospheric 
pressure in a single stage flash vessel. This results in the removal of excess heat by 
the release of steam. The excess pressure in the flash vessel provides the driving 
force for the vent gas through the splash heater and venturi scrubber. The autoclave 
residue from the flash vessels is collected in the autoclave discharge holding tank. 
The autoclave discharge holding tank has a slurry residence time of 1 hour. 
The splash heater gas discharge is vented to a venturi scrubber, where the gas is 
scrubbed  using  raw  water  sprays  to  remove  entrained  liquor  and  solids.  The 
autoclave gas vent line and autoclave emergency pressure relief line also feed to the 
scrubber. The scrubber also services the hot curing circuit. Scrubbed residual gas is 
vented to the atmosphere.  
 
Autoclave residue from the autoclave discharge holding tank is treated through a hot 
cure  stage  consisting  of  two  agitated  tanks  in  series.  The  hot  curing  process  is 
required  to  convert  all  basic  ferric  sulphate  formed  during  the  pressure  oxidation 
process  to  ferric  sulphate  so  as  to  reduce  lime  consumption  during  neutralization. 
The reaction associated with hot curing is as follows:
2 Fe(OH)SO4 + H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 H2O
The hot curing of oxidized slurry is maintained at a temperature of 95 °C for 4 hours. 
The retention time can be shortened by reducing the number of tanks used in series 
through launders to bypass tanks. The slurry from the hot cure circuit is pumped via 
one of two pumps to the counter current decantation and neutralization circuit. 
The  hot  cured  autoclave  residue  is  washed  to  remove  acidic  liquor  and  soluble 
mineral components from the residue by Counter Current Decantation (CCD). Some 
of the acidic liquor is used in the concentrate pre-leach stage to remove carbonate 
minerals.  The  rest  of  the  acidic  liquor  is  neutralized  and  pumped  to  the  tails 
treatment facilities. 
The  CCD  circuit  consists  of  two  18-m  diameter  thickeners  in  series.  The  flow  of 
solids from the hot cure circuit proceeds in a direction counter current to the flow of 
the wash solution, with each stage composed of a mixing step followed by settling of 
the solids from the suspension. The wash ratio (wash water flow/slurry liquor flow) is 
1.2.  
The hot cured autoclave residue from the hot cure circuit is pumped to the CCD#1 
thickener. The slurry is mixed with overflow solution from the CCD#2 thickener in the 
thickener#1  feed  tank.  The  thickener#1  feed  tank  is  a  small  vessel  designed  to 
accept the autoclave residue stream and also thickener area sump pump material. 
The  slurry  gravitates  to  the  thickener  feed  well,  during  which  a  dilute  flocculating 
agent is contacted with the stream. The solid settles to the underflow and is pumped 
to CCD#2 thickener at a pulp density of 45% w/w solids. The solution overflow from 
CCD#1  thickener  reports  to  a  thickener  overflow  holding  tank  where  ~40%  of  the 
solution  is  recycled  to  the  pre-leach  circuit  (Area  400)  and  the  rest  pumped  to  the 
neutralization circuit. 
The  thickened  slurry  from  CCD#1  thickener  underflow  is  pumped  to  the  CCD#2 
thickener,  where  it  is  mixed  with  process  water  in  the  thickener  #2  feed  tank.  The 
slurry  gravitates  to  the  thickener  feed  well  where  dilute  flocculating  agent  is 
contacted with the stream. The solid settles to the underflow and is pumped to the 
lime  boil  circuit  at  a  pulp  density  of  45%  w/w  solids.  The  solution  overflow  from 
CCD#2 thickener gravitates to the thickener 1 feed tank above CCD#1 thickener.

The  extra  solution  not  used  for  pre  leach  acidification  reports  to  the  first  of  two 
neutralization  agitated  tanks  in  series  with  a  total  retention  time  of  4  hours.  The 
neutralization  circuit  is  used  to  neutralize  the  acid  and  promote  the  precipitation of 
residual arsenic and other cations from solution. Limestone is added to raise the pH 
to 5 followed by lime to further raise the pH to 8. The reactions taking place are: 
 
 
In the presence of limestone
FeSO4 + CaCO3 + H2O → Fe(OH)3 + CaSO4 + CO2
CuSO4 + CaCO3 + 1 H2O → Cu(OH)2 + CaSO4 + CO2
Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 CaCO3 + 3 H2O → 2 Fe(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + 3 CO2
Al2(SO4)3 + 3 CaCO3 + 3 H2O → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + 3 CO2
H2SO4 + CaCO3 → CaSO4 + H2O + CO2
2 H3AsO4 + Fe2(SO4)3 + 4 H2O → 2 FeAsO4.2H2O + 3 H2SO4
H2O + CaCO3 → Ca(OH)2 + CO2
In the presence of lime
H2SO4 + Ca(OH)2 → 2 H2O + CaSO4
CuSO4 + Ca(OH)2 → Cu(OH)2 + CaSO4
Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 2 Fe(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4
Al2(SO4)3 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4
Limestone is added to the first tank and lime added to the second tank. Provisions 
are also made to allow addition of limestone or lime into either of the two tanks. The 
resulting neutralized slurry with a pulp density of 18% w/w solids is then pumped via 
one of two pumps to the tails treatment facilities. 
 
The  argentojarosite  formed  during  pressure  oxidation  must  be  decomposed  to 
render the silver recoverable by cyanidation. The breakdown and liberation of silver 
from jarosite is carried out by the process known as lime boil at 95ºC for 4 hours with 
the addition of lime. 
 
The washed autoclave residue from the solid liquid separation circuit reports to the 
lime boil feed tank. The autoclave residue is preheated by heat exchange with the 
lime boil discharge stream. The autoclave residue then reports to the first of four lime 
boil  agitated  tanks  and  contacted  with  lime  slurry  to  raise  the  pH  to  10.5.  The 
temperature is maintained in the lime boil tanks via hot gases fed directly from the

autoclave discharge flash vessel. A scrubbing circuit is provided to remove vapours 
from the lime boil circuit. 
 
The reactions that take place in the lime boil circuit are as follows:
4 AgFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 8 Ca(OH)2 = 4 Ag + 6 Fe2O3 + 20 H2O + 8 CaSO4 + 1 O2
H2SO4 + Ca(OH)2 = 2 H2O + CaSO4
CuSO4 + Ca(OH)2 → Cu(OH)2 + CaSO4
Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 2 Fe(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4
FeSO4 + Ca(OH)2 = Fe(OH)2 + CaSO4
Al2(SO4)3 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4
MgSO4 + Ca(OH)2 → Mg(OH)2 + CaSO4
Fe(OH)SO4 + Ca(OH)2 → 1 Fe(OH)3 + 1 CaSO4
2 KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 6 Fe(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + K2SO4
H3O- Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 2 Ca(OH)2 → 2 CaSO4 + 3 Fe(OH)3 + 2 H2O
2 NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 3 CaSO4 + 6 Fe(OH)3 + Na2SO4
2 KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 6 Al(OH)3 + 3 CaSO4 + K2SO4
Provision  is  made  in  the  design  to  bypass  any  one  of  the  lime  boil  tanks  for 
maintenance or descaling purposes. The slurry in the last lime boil tank is pumped to 
one of two cooling towers to cool the slurry. The cooled slurry reports to the cooling 
tower  discharge  tank  to  be  pumped  and  treated  in  the  cyanidation  circuit.  The 
cooling  tower  is  operated  to  reduce  the  slurry  temperature from  95 °C  to  40 °C  by 
contacting  the  slurry  with  counter  current  flow  fan  forced  air.  The  cooling  tower 
discharge tank has a slurry retention time of 2 hours. 
 
The  cyanide  leach  circuit  consists  of  two  agitated  leach  tanks  and  six  agitated 
carbon  in  pulp  (CIP)  tanks  in  series.  The  two  leach  tanks  each  have  12  hours 
residence time, whereas the six CIP tanks each have 3 hours residence time. Each 
tank  is  baffled  with  a  downcomer  to  minimize  short  circuiting.  The  slurry  flows  by 
gravity from tank to tank with launders designed to allow the ability to bypass any of 
the tanks.  
 
Lime boiled autoclave residue in the cooling tower discharge tank is pumped directly 
to the first leach tank. Provisions are also made to pump to the second leach tank.

Oxygen used as the oxidant in the cyanide leaching process is introduced into the 
two leach tanks separately via a spear mounted in the side of each tank below the 
agitators.  Sodium  cyanide  solution  as  lixiviant  for  leaching  precious  metals  in  the 
autoclave residue and lime to maintain pH is also added to the first two leach tanks. 
The pH is monitored and maintained at a value of 10.5. The density of the feed to 
tanks  is  controlled  to  48  wt%  solids.  Cyanide  addition  points  (Tanks  1-2)  are 
controlled  by  an  online  cyanide  controller  that  measures free  cyanide  levels  in  the 
first, second and final CIP tanks. 
 
The simplified reactions occurring in the cyanide leach are:
4 Au + 2 H2O + 8 CN- + O2 → 4 Au(CN)2
- + 4 OH-
4 Ag + 2 H2O + 8 CN- + O2 → 4 Ag(CN)2
- + 4 OH-
Regenerated carbon is added to the last CIP tank 6 and pumped counter currently 
from CIP tank 6 to CIP tank 1 using vertical spindle pumps with recessed impellors. 
Fresh carbon is added to the circuit to replenish the carbon lost to fine size fractions. 
The carbon concentration in each tank is maintained at 25 g/L.  
 
Loaded  carbon  is  extracted  from  CIP  tank  1  and  pumped  to  the  loaded  carbon 
recovery screen for cleaning, before acid wash and elution. 
 
The  CIP  circuit  carbon  is  retained  in  the  adsorption  tanks  by  interstage  pumping 
screens  with  apertures  of  800  µm.  This  interstage  pumping  screening  method 
enables the height differential required between tanks to be minimized. An overhead 
gantry crane is available for cleaning and maintenance of all screens. 
 
Cyanide  leached residue is passed through one of two carbon safety screens to a 
hopper and then pumped to the cyanide detoxification circuit. Carbon fines from the 
linear screen overflow is collected for treatment later. 
 
Cyanide  gas  monitors  are  installed  at  location  points  over  the  tanks  to  monitor 
hydrogen cyanide gas concentrations. 
 
For recovering the gold and silver from loaded carbon the Zadra elution process is 
utilised  and  involves  stripping  of  gold  and  silver  from  the  carbon  with  a  hot 
caustic/cyanide solution (eluant) and electrowinning the gold/silver on cathodes in a 
closed loop 
 
Loaded carbon is transferred from the loaded carbon recovery screen to the loaded 
carbon hopper via a sieve bend. Excess water used to transfer the carbon is drained 
off. Water is introduced at the bottom of the loaded carbon hopper during the carbon 
transfer.  Material  entrained  in  the  carbon  bed  floats  to  the  top  of  the  tank  and 
overflows  to  the  spillage  pump.  The  carbon  in  the  loaded  carbon  hopper  is  then 
transferred  to  the  elution  column.  The  elution  circuit  is  designed  for  3 tonnes  of 
loaded carbon per day. 
 
The eluant used to strip the gold and silver off the loaded carbon is made up of 3% 
NaOH and 0.1% NaCN and stored in the eluant tank. The eluant is pumped from the
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
220
www.innovexplo.com
eluant tank, passing through two heat exchangers where the temperature is elevated 
to  140 °C,  before  flowing  upstream  through  the  carbon  bed  in  the  elution  column. 
The  solution  exits  the  strainer  located  at  the  top  of  the  column  into  the  primary 
recovery heat exchanger where waste heat is recovered by transferring the heat into 
incoming solution from the eluant tank. The solution is cooled to below 85 °C in the 
flash tank located in the gold room and flows through an electro-winning cell. In the 
electro-winning  circuit  gold  and  silver  is  deposited  onto  cathodes  and  the  eluant 
overflows from the cells and gravitates back to the eluant tank.  
 
The  eluant  heating system  consists  of  a  liquid petroleum gas (LPG) fuelled  heater 
and two heat exchangers, a primary and secondary heat exchanger. For the primary 
heat  exchanger,  a  plate  heat  exchanger  recovers  waste  heat  from  existing  eluant 
from the elution column and transfers the heat to the eluant entering the column. For 
the secondary heat exchanger, hot oil at a set temperature circulates through a shell 
and  tube  heat  exchanger,  elevating  the  eluant  temperature  to  140 °C.  The  eluant 
temperature is controlled by regulating the oil flow through the heat exchanger. The 
eluant  temperature  is  reduced  to  below  boiling  point  before  flowing  to  the  electro-
winning cells. 
 
The  eluted  carbon  is  hydraulically  transferred  to  the  kiln  feed  hopper  via  a 
dewatering sieve bend. The carbon regeneration kiln has a capacity for 3 t of carbon.  
 
Thermal  regeneration  of  the  carbon  is  carried  out  at  700 °C  in  a  LPG  fired  rotary 
horizontal  kiln.  Under  these  conditions,  the  organics  which  may  have  absorbed  on 
the carbon are removed. The presence of organics deactivates carbon and therefore 
must to be removed prior to returning to the cyanidation circuit. Carbon exiting the 
kiln is quenched with water in the quench pan. The object of quenching is to open up 
the micro pores in the carbon. Water and carbon overflows onto the carbon vibrating 
screen to remove water and fine carbon generated by thermal shock to the carbon. 
 
Carbon discharges from the screen into the acid wash tank. One bed volume of 3% 
dilute HCl is pumped from the acid make up tank into the acid wash tank to remove 
entrained calcium carbonate and acid soluble impurities from the carbon. The carbon 
is  soaked  in  dilute  acid  for  1  hour,  followed  by  a  caustic  neutralizing  and  a  water 
rinse cycle. The neutralized spent acid is pumped back as the process water.  
 
The  carbon  inventory  is  checked  before  the  carbon  is  pumped  back  to  the 
cyanidation circuit. When required fresh carbon is loaded onto the carbon vibrating 
screen  and  sprayed  with  water  to  wash  out  the  fines  from  the  fresh  carbon.  The 
regenerated  carbon  and/or  fresh  carbon  in  the  acid  wash  tank  are  pumped  to  the 
carbon return screen in the cyanidation circuit area (Area 440) for use in the carbon 
in pulp circuit.  
 
The  electro-winning  and  smelting  is  carried  out  in  the  high  security  area.  Electro-
winning is part of the Zadra elution cycle where eluate flows from the elution column 
via  the  recovery  heat  exchanger  into  the  electro-winning  cell.  The  solution  flows 
through  cathodes  prior  to  exiting  the  cell  via  the  overflow  weir.  The  solution  is 
recirculated back to the eluant tank. Barren levels are targeted at 5 mg/L Au.  
 
During  electro-winning,  a  voltage  is  applied  by  the  rectifier  across  the  anode  and 
cathode resulting in reduction and subsequent deposition of gold and silver on the
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
cathodes.  The  electro-winning  current  is  monitored  and  the  voltage  is  adjusted 
automatically to supply sufficient current for gold and silver deposition. The cathodes 
are constructed from stainless steel wool and the anodes from stainless steel plates.  
 
On  completion  of  the  electro-winning  cycle  the  rectifier  is  switched  off  and  the 
cathodes are manually removed from the cell. The cathodes are washed with high 
pressure  water  to  recover  the  metal  sludge  that  has  deposited.  The  cathode 
washings  gravitate  to  the  cathode  wash  bay/tank.  Once  the  cathodes  have  been 
washed  they  are  returned  to  the  cell  and  the  electro-winning  process  can 
recommence.  
 
The  settled  gold/silver  sludge  in  the  cathode  wash-bay/tank  gravitates  into  the 
cylindrical filter press located below the tank. The press is sealed and compressed 
air is introduced on top of the filter press. 
 
The  filter  cake  is  collected  and  dried  in  the  drying  oven.  Fluxes  are  added  to  the 
dried  filter  cake  and  then  smelted  in  the  LPG  fired  furnace  and  gold/silver  bars 
produced.  
 
The  circuit  discharge  will  feed  the  cyanide  destruction  circuit  (CND  circuit)  prior  to 
being  sent  to  the  tailings  pond.  The  CND  circuit  will  be  performed  at  the  50-55% 
solid density using Air/SO₂ method.  
 
Regarding  water  circulation  in  the  process  plant,  it  is  expected  that  approximately 
417 m3/d of water enters in the plant as moisture in the ore. The outgoing water will 
be  the  water  content  in  the  products  of  the  plant:  620  m3/d  with  concentrate  and 
13,491  m3/d  with  final  tailings.  The  total  process  water  requirement  will  be 
30,957 m3/d,  which  will  be  recirculated  from  the  flotation  concentrate,  the  tailings 
thickeners  overflow,  as  well  as  tailings  pond  reclaim.  The  total  fresh  water 
requirement for the reagents and flocculant preparation is estimated at 144 m3/d.

PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
This section summarizes Project infrastructure, such as power lines, access roads, 
on-site buildings and tailings storage facilities (TSF), as well as site services that are 
required to complement the processing of ore from the Duparquet deposit.  
 
All  topographic  information  for  infrastructure  locations  was  derived  from  stereo 
satellite images. 
 
No geotechnical investigations for the surface infrastructure have been performed for 
this PFS. The process plant buildings and site buildings are located in an area where 
outcrops are found. Detailed geotechnical investigations, such as boreholes and test 
pits, are recommended at the feasibility level in order to confirm assumptions about 
bedrock  depth  and  capacity,  and  to  optimize  civil  design  criteria  related  to  the 
foundations of the mill and process plant. It is expected that field investigations will 
begin as the Project progresses to a feasibility phase. 
 
The site layout and general site arrangement are presented in Figure 18.1.

Off-Site Infrastructure 
Power Line  
Electric power will be provided by Hydro-Québec through a new 15 km long 120 kV 
power  line  that  could  be  available  in  36  months  depending  on  permiting  and 
construction. At the present time, Hydro-Québec’s Abitibi network does not have the 
capacity  to  supply  the  required  energy  for  the  project,  except  by  importing  or  the 
temporary  rerouting  of  its  power  network.  Hydro-Québec  is  currently  planning  on 
upgrading their network for 2019.  A 120 kV main substation will be located near the 
process  plant.  The  main  substation  will  include  a  concrete  base,  a  30  MVA  120  / 
13.8  kV  transformer  and  accessories  for  the  Concentrate  option  (50  MVA  for  the 
POX  option),  and  a  capacitor  bank  for  power  factor  correction.  Power  will  be 
delivered to the site’s remote buildings at 4.16 kV via a 5 km power line. 
 
The  total  power  capacity  will  be  50  MW  and  the  estimated  power  requirement  will 
amount to approximately 35 MW. Provisions to the transformer capacity are required 
for starting large motors; an additional capacity of 5 to 10 MVA is therefore included. 
Final capacity will be reviewed in the detailed engineering phase. 
 
Metso’s  proposal  for  the  SAG  Mill  and  Ball  Mill  includes  wound  rotor  induction 
motors  with  liquid  resistance.  Wound  rotor  induction  motors  require  less  starting 
current than synchronous motors, but their utilisation requires power factor correction 
(capacitor  bank).  On  another  hand,  synchronous  motors  need  no  power  factor 
correction  and  can  be  used  to  control  the  power  factor  of  a  plant.  Synchronous 
motors, however, require specific devices for starting, such as an air clutch. 
 
Access Road 
The Duparquet Project is located 45 km northwest of Rouyn-Noranda in the Abitibi-
Témiscamingue  region  of  Québec.  The  Property  partly  overlaps  the  municipal 
boundary of the Town of Duparquet. The future mine site is easily accessible using 
the already existing provincial highway, Route 393, and no access road other than a 
connection  between  the  site  facilities  and  Route  393  will  be  required  for  project 
development. 
 
On-Site Infrastructure 
Tailings Storage Facility and Water Management
Site layout and staged construction, and conceptual dam sections
The proposed beneficiation plant will produce approximately 46.5 Mt of tailings over 
the  life  of  mine.  Two  options  are  considered  for  the  processing  as  described  in 
Section 17 of the Report: 1) a Concentrate option where all tailings will result from a 
CIL  circuit;  and  2)  a  POX  option  where  approximately  6%  of  the  tailings  will  have 
passed  through  the  CIP  process.  Since  the  CIL  circuit  involves  cyanidation,  the 
tailings  and  process  water  resulting  from  this  circuit  will  require  being  stored  in  a 
lined or impermeable tailings cell to prevent seepage into groundwater aquifers.  
 
Concentrate option 
 
The  Concentrate  option  involves  a  volume  of  approximately  34.5  Mm3  of  tailings 
requiring  containment  in  an  impermeable  TSF.  Due  to  the  cyanidation  process
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
227
www.innovexplo.com
involved  in  this  option,  this  TSF  will  be  fully  lined  to  prevent  seepage  into 
groundwater aquifers. This volume is based on a bulk density of 1.35 t/m3, which is a 
conservative  estimate  based  limited  information.  Consolidated  tailings  are  likely  to 
achieve  a  higher  bulk  density  resulting  in  lower  storage  volume  requirements  and 
costs for dam construction.  
 
A preliminary assessment of disposal facility requirements to store and manage the 
tailings was prepared for the Duparquet Project LOM. The TSF for the Concentrate 
option  is  conceived  as  a  staged  construction  with  two  separate  cells  (see  Figures 
18.2, 18.3, and 18.4).
•  Cell 1 in the southwest – for cyanidation process tailings (fully lined); 
•  Cell 2 in the north – for cyanidation process tailings (fully lined);
The  tailings  dams  will  be  constructed  in  stages  to  minimize  the  initial  capital 
construction costs. The TSF is conceived to be constructed in three phases:
•  Phase 1: Cell 1 for approximately 10.7 Mm³ (elev. 331.1 m); 
•  Phase 2: Cell 2 construction (elev. 325.1 m); 
•  Phase 3: Raise Cell 1 and Cell 2 to final crest height (elev. 334.5 m). May be 
carried out as single lift or as multiple lifts to make use of cycloned underflow 
tailings as construction material.
The concept is presented in the Figure 18.2, 18.3 and, Figure 18.4, which illustrate 
the  construction  stages  and  the  use  of  natural  ridges  to  help  form  parts  of  the 
containment structure and reduce construction costs.

Figure 18.3 - Phase 2 configuration 
 for Concentrate option
Figure 18.4 - Phase 3 configuration for 
 Concentrate option
POX option 
 
The  POX  option  involves  treating  only  about  6%  of  the  tailings  with  a  CIP 
(cyanidation) circuit. Since only the tailings of the CIP circuit need to be stored in a 
lined cell, less membrane is required in construction than for the Concentrate option, 
and water management and treatment is simplified. 
 
The TSF layout is similar to that of the Concentrate option described above, except a 
third smaller lined cell is added to handle the reduced tailings quantity from the CIP 
circuit.  The  large  northern  and  southwest  cells  are  unlined  in  this  scenario  since
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
229
www.innovexplo.com
early geochemical results indicate that the tailings are not acid generating, nor will 
they be treated by cyanide as was the case for the Concentrate option.
Figure 18.5 - Phase 3 configuration for POX option.  
POX cell constructed during Phase 1.
As described previously, the proposed beneficiation plant will produce approximately 
46.5 Mt (34.7 Mm3) of tailings. Of this, 44.2 Mt (32.7 Mm3) will come directly from the 
flotation  process  while  2.3  Mt  (1.9  Mm3)  will  be  produced  using  the  POX  process, 
which includes a CIP component. The volumes in the POX option are slightly higher 
due to the assumed lower bulk density of the tailings resulting from the POX process 
(1.2 t/m3). The remaining 94% of the tailings from flotation are still estimated at 1.35 
t/m3, as was the case for the Concentrate option.  
 
The two types of tailings will require separate handling and disposal at the tailings 
storage  facility  utilising  the  tailings  delivery  pipelines.  Separate  pipelines  will  be 
required for the POX/CIP and flotation tailings.  
 
For  the  POX  option,  the  TSF  is  conceived  as  a  staged  construction  with  three 
separate cells (see Figure 18.5 above):
•  Cell 1 in the southwest – for low-risk tailings (unlined); 
•  POX cell in southeast – for cyanidation process tailings (fully lined); 
•  Cell 2 in north – for low risk tailings (unlined).
As was the case for the Concentrate option, the tailings dams will be constructed in 
stages to minimize the initial capital construction costs. The tailings storage facility is 
conceived to be constructed in 3 phases:
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
230
www.innovexplo.com
•  Phase  1:  Cell  1  and  POX  cell  for  approximately  10.7  Mm³  and  1.9  Mm³ of
tailings, respectively (elev. 331.1 m);
•  Phase 2: Cell 2 construction (elev. 325.1 m); 
•  Phase 3: Raise Cell 1 and Cell 2 to final crest height (elev. 334.5m). Can be 
carried  out  as  a  single  lift  or  as  multiple  lifts  to  make  use  of  cycloned 
underflow tailings as construction material.
18.2.1.2
Conceptual dam sections
The  current  conceptual  plan  is  a  centreline  dam  configuration,  predominantly 
constructed  using  waste  rock  from  the  open  pit  mining  operation  with  upstream 
portions of the dam being founded on compacted coarse cycloned underflow tailings 
or low plasticity tailings (see Figure 18.6 to Figure 18.13 below). Compaction of the 
tailings foundation material will be required to reduce the risk of liquefaction. Where 
tailings  foundation  material  is  fine,  dewatering  of  the  foundation  tailings  must  be 
considered. In addition, an upstream filter and drain below the dam is recommended 
to increase stability of the embankment and facilitate the tailings dewatering, as well 
as prevent piping of the fine tailings deposited next to the embankment. This will be 
handled  with  a  filter  design  based  on  the  embankment  and  tailings  grain  size 
distributions  on  either  side  of  the  filter  (to  be  assessed  during  the  feasibility  study 
and design phase). For the purposes of the PFS, a 1 m thick filter on the upstream 
side was considered, both for proper drainage and ease of construction. 
 
Drainage ditches on the downstream toe are to manage runoff and seepage through 
the dam. Water collected from the seepage of the dam can be pumped back to the 
tailings  decant  pond  or  polishing  ponds  for  recirculation  via  the  reclaim  water 
pipeline. 
 
Tailings  cells  1  and  2  will  be  managed  as  a  permeable  facility  which  necessitates 
that  the  tailings  are  classified  as  low  risk  as  per  Directive  019  (MDDELCC,  March 
2012).  Preliminary  tailings  geochemistry  support  that  tailings  resulting  from  the 
flotation circuit for the POX option (i.e., not requiring cyanidation) are considered low 
risk and non-acid generating. As per the guidelines on the characterization of mine 
tailings  (MDDELCC,  2003),  the  testing  of  the  tailings  material  and  crushed  core 
material should be carried out as outlined in Table 18.1 during production.
Table 18.1 - Recommended minimum geochemical analysis for tailings classification
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
231
www.innovexplo.com
All the tailings resulting from the Concentrate option and 6% of the tailings mass in 
the  POX  process  tailings  are  classified  as  “cyanide-containing”  since  the  gold 
recovery involves a carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit. Level-A leak-proofing measures will 
be required for the tailings resulting from the CIL circuit.  
 
For the purposes of this report, only the maximum final dam heights (Phase 3) are 
presented. The configuration of the conceptual dams for areas with clay foundation 
(purple)  and  granular  foundation  (yellow)  materials  are  shown  in  Figure  18.6  to 
Figure 18.13 below.

It should be noted that the clay observed in the field was saturated beyond its liquid 
limit  resulting  in  highly  conservative  designs  for  the  dams  founded  on  clay  soil.  In 
some cases, upstream berms were required to maintain stability during construction. 
Further  geotechnical  studies  may  result  in  reduction  or  removal  of  these  berms. 
Trenching in the clay to firmer foundation materials may also be considered during 
the feasibility study.
18.2.1.3
Embankment slope angles and volume estimates
A summary of the preliminary stability analysis is presented below. The parameters 
used in the analysis were chosen from results of the fall 2013 field program and from 
values  commonly  found  at  other  sites  and  in  the  literature.  This  assessment  was 
based  on  preliminary  geotechnical  data  in  the  form  of  test  pits  in  and  around  the 
TSF.  Due  to  access  restrictions,  the  geotechnical  testing  was  not  necessarily 
performed below the dam foundation, but in regions where the foundation conditions 
are expected to be similar to those in the region of the TSF. The results of the testing 
provide preliminary foundation characteristics and help guide the future geotechnical 
investigation during a bridging program and/or during the feasibility study. At the end 
of  this  section  is  a  summary  of  recommendations  for  the  future  geotechnical 
investigation required to better define the tailings storage facility foundation.  
 
The  values  chosen  tended  towards  conservative,  which  ultimately  leads  to  greater 
material  volume  requirements  and  costs.  Improved  definition  of  the  geotechnical 
properties  of  the  foundation  during  the  feasibility  stage  may  allow  for  a  further 
reduction in dam construction costs. For the current estimates, the slope ratios and 
safety factors are shown in Table 18.2.

Table 18.2 - Summary of preliminary embankment slope ratios and safety factor
estimates.
www.innovexplo.com
The material volume estimates, based on the above slopes, are presented in Table 
18.3.
Table 18.3 - Volume and membrane estimates – Concentrate and POX options
During  the  current  PFS,  berms  for  dam  stabilization  are  considered  in  the  volume 
and cost estimates since they will potentially be an important volume of material due 
to the relatively soft clay observed during the test pit program. Alternatively, following 
further characterization of the clay, some may be excavated from the dam foundation 
and  placed  as  a  liner  below  the  membrane  in  the  POX  tailings  cell.  This  requires 
further geotechnical characterization of the dam foundations during the FS to assess 
the deeper clay properties or presence of more stable dam foundation materials at 
depth. 
 
Based on observations of the bedrock outcrops at the site, the bedrock is generally 
massive  with  little  open  jointing  or  weathering  at  the  surface.  However,  a  proper
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
237
www.innovexplo.com
mapping, drilling, and hydrogeological assessment should be carried out during the 
feasibility  study.  At  the  current  time,  little  grouting  or  excavation  of  bedrock  is 
expected along the abutments or foundation. 
 
The slope ratios described in the table above depend partly on the characteristics of 
the waste rock material used for the embankment. While the material from the pit is 
expected to provide suitable construction material, the characteristics of the material 
should be defined at the feasibility and detailed design levels of the Project.
18.2.1.4
POX tailings cell
The  conceptual  POX  tailings  storage  cell  is  founded  largely  on  granular  soil  to 
reduce the strain on the liner resulting from potential settlement and consolidation of 
a soft clay foundation soil. In addition, its placement makes use of the dams already 
forming cells 1 and 2.  
 
Due to the lack of geotechnical information at this phase regarding the suitability or 
availability of clay as a construction or foundation material, the POX storage cell is 
expected to be a fully lined storage structure. Clay was found on the site in the fall 
2013 test pit program, but proved to be highly saturated with low shear strength.  
 
However,  further  field  studies  should  be  carried  out  during  the  feasibility  study  to 
assess alternative POX tailings storage locations, including valleys with firm clay or 
locations  closer  to  the  plant  in  order  to  reduce  dam  construction  costs  and 
piping/pumping  requirements.  In  addition,  it  may  be  possible  to  stage  the  POX 
tailings  dam  construction  to  reduce  the  initial  CAPEX.  Water  management  of  the 
POX tailings cell is to be assessed at the FS phase. 
 
Construction  of  the  POX  impoundment  area  involves  grubbing  and  removal  of  the 
topsoil,  which  is  stockpiled  for  future  restoration,  followed  by  compaction  of  the 
exposed foundation soils. A geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) may be required below the 
membrane depending on the foundation soil characteristics (i.e., permeability, grain 
sizes,  etc.).  Alternatively,  if  suitable  clay  is  located  on  the  site,  it  may  be  placed 
below the membrane where the foundation soils are inadequate. A protective layer 
should be considered over the membrane to prevent damage from sun, temperature, 
and ice before the membrane is adequately covered by tailings. Finally, the drainage 
below  the  liner  on  the  sides  of  the  POX  cell  adjacent  to  cells  1  and  2  should  be 
evaluated  in  detail  to  prevent  seepage  water  from  these  cells  from  building  up 
pressure  below  the  POX  cell  liner.  Further  assessment  of  these  needs  should  be 
considered during the feasibility study and detailed engineering.
18.2.1.5
Reclaim water system and effluent quality control
Runoff water and supernatant water from the tailings will accumulate in the northern 
sections  of  Cell  1  and  Cell  2  next  to  the  bedrock  where  dam  construction  is  not 
required.  The  water  accumulated  will  either  spill  over  into  polishing  ponds  or  be 
pumped directly back to the mill for re-use. It is proposed that the northwest dam of 
Cell 2 is started during Phase 1 to form the initial polishing pond. Allowance should 
be made for regular hydraulic dredging of this pond to maintain residence time and 
avoid accumulation of slimes that would negatively impact the stability of future dam 
lifts in Cell 2. The need for a polishing pond in Phase 2 can be assessed based on 
the performance of the decant pond in Cell 1 during Phase 1 operations.

Waste rock, ore, overburden and tailings management
The  criteria  used  for  waste  rock,  ore,  overburden  and  tailings  management  are 
depicted in Table 18.4. The values used to estimate bulk density and angle of repose 
were established following a review of other projects similar in terms of geology and 
ore  processing.  No  geotechnical  study  was  performed  to  assess  soil  bearing

Site Roads and Surface Pads 
Local roads will be used to access the various industrial sites and services. Mining 
roads will be used for activities relating to mining production. The on-site roads will 
provide access to the following areas:
•  Process plant facility and surrounding buildings; 
•  Open pits; 
•  Ore stockpile; 
•  Waste dumps and overburden dump; 
•  Explosives storage; 
•  Garage; 
•  Pumping stations; 
•  Tailings disposal area.
The  selected  location  of  haul  roads  will  minimize  the  distances  between  long-term 
infrastructures.  With  the  information  available,  only  a  small  brook  on  the  road  to 
waste dump #1 will need to be crossed so neither major bridges nor river dykes will 
be required for the haul roads construction.  
 
To estimate the haul road dimensions, the following assumptions have been taken in 
consideration:  
 
•  The haul trucks used are 150-ton payload trucks with a width of 6.64 m and a tire
height of 3 m;
•  The standard haul road construction design consists of four main layers:
o 
o 
o 
o
the sub-grade (various materials),  
the sub-base (sand),  
the base course (coarse gravel),  
the surface course (crushed gravel).
Most of the haul roads will be double lane. According to article 45.1 of the Regulation 
respecting Occupational Health and Safety in Mines, such roads need to be at least 
three times the width of a truck. Adding a 3 m berm on each side, the width of the 
double-lane roads are planned to be 26 m.  
 
A few haul roads, such as the tailings pond access road, will only be single-lane due 
to the low traffic. According to the same regulation, these roads need to be twice the 
width of a truck. Including the same berm specifications, the width of the single-lane 
roads will be 20 m. 
 
The  haul  roads  require  a  maximum  grade  of  10%.  According  to  the  available 
topography,  a  major  steep  gradient  to  overcome  is  on  the  haul  road  between  the 
central  pit  and  waste  rock  dump  #3. To  smooth  the  road  angle from  18%  to  10%, 
about 40,000 m3 of additional material will be required. 
 
A total of about 13 km of mine roads will be required. All roads will be equipped with 
the appropriate information, regulatory and warning signs.

House Relocation 
In  the  prefeasibility  scenario,  it  is  estimated  that  six  (6)  houses  will  need  to  be 
relocated or bought by Clifton Star. One of those houses is curently the property of 
the current mine owner and is used at times to house Clifton Star employees. The 
five remaining houses are located on Rue Principale, two are on the north side of the 
road, and three are on the south side of the road and the end of Rue Principale. No 
discussions  have  yet  been  held  between  Clifton  Star  and  the  owners  of  these 
houses.

Security and Access Control System 
The security officer will  control the site access and  will be  located in a  gate at the 
entrance of the mine site. This gatehouse will be part of the administration building. 
There will be an alarm system for fire protection and a surveillance system for the 
site  via  cameras.  The  cameras  will  be  Ethernet  type  (Power  Over  Ethernet  if 
possible) and all linked to the fibre-optic network.  
 
Surveillance cameras will be installed to monitor the following areas: the gatehouse, 
overall plant site, the open pit, the mine vehicle maintenance shop, the sub-station, 
the pumping stations, and the explosive storage; all cameras will have pan, tilt and 
zoom functions. 
 
Also  cameras  for  process  monitoring  will  be  installed  in  the  process  plant  (with 
adequate dedicated quartz or LED lighting):
• 
• 
• 
•
in the crusher area, including the ore bin chute; 
in the tunnel and process plant feed conveyor; 
in the concentrator sector; 
in the POX sector – for POX option only.
A DVR server with recording capability will be at the gatehouse. This server allows 
the  operator  to  organize  views  on  the  screen,  operate  the  cameras,  and  watch 
previously  recorded  images.  The  security  officers  will  have  access  to  the  cameras 
via a TV screen in the gatehouse. The process plant and crusher operators will also 
have access to the process cameras via another TV screen. 
 
Green Wall 
A buffer zone 50 m wide will be developed along the southern limit of the Beattie pit 
to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  the  mining  activities  on  the  citizens  of  the  Town  of 
Duparquet. Inside this buffer zone, a green wall will be built mainly made of rock and 
topsoil from the prestripping mining work. This wall will be 10 m high and 33 m wide. 
Soil and organic matter will cover the surface and then different types of vegetation 
will be planted, such as shrubs trees and grasses. Figure 18.14 illustrates the green 
wall.

Fence 
Because of the operation’s proximity to the Town of Duparquet and provincial roads, 
and to ensure security by preventing access to the property by intruders, fences will 
be installed around the mine site and facilities. A simple fence will be installed along 
the green wall, on east and west of Route 393, and around the site pad for process 
facilities  and  the  administrative  building  with  access  control.  Pedestrian  turnstiles 
and motorized gates will be installed to control the flow to and from this area.  
 
Fuel Storage and Distribution System 
The mine site fuel storage facilities will have a concrete slab with containment berms 
for  the  vehicle  filling  area,  bollards  to  protect  the  installation,  and  a  membrane  to 
prevent soil contamination in the event of fuel leakage or spill. 
 
The fuel storage will include three diesel tanks of 50,000 litres for the mine fleet. This 
fuel  will  be  used  for  filling  the  fuel  tanker,  mine  trucks,  and  emergency  power 
generation. A high flow dispenser with a hose reel is selected to fill the mine trucks, 
along  with  a  low  flow  dispenser  for  other  vehicles.  It  will  also  include  a  gasoline 
reservoir of 5,000 litres for small vehicles and other equipment. 
 
An additional fuel tank will be installed next to the 5 MW emergency generating set 
(genset).  This  tank  will  be  exclusively  used  for  emergency  power  generation 
purpose. 
 
Solid Waste, Water Treatment, and Management 
At  the  mine  site,  domestic  waste  water  will  be  treated  through  a  standard  system 
located in a container which will allow for water disinfection and phosphate removal 
before being returned to the environment. 
 
Solid waste will be removed from the site by a contractor on a regular basis. 
 
Process and Fresh Water
18.2.12 
18.2.12.1
Site fresh water
The fresh water pumping station will be located at the old Central Duparquet mine 
shaft.  This  water  source  will  be  used  for  the first  6-7  years  of  operation.  After  this 
period, the Central Duparquet pit will be developed and another water source will be 
needed. 
 
The fresh water pump will pump the  water to the plant through a 2.8-km insulated 
and  heat  traced  steel  pipeline  from  the  old  Central  Duparquet  shaft.  The  nominal 
capacity of this pumping station will be 2400 m3/d. 
 
For that purpose, a building with an electrical room will be erected at that location. 
The main purpose of the building and its equipment will be to allow the installation 
and maintenance of the two pumps, one in operation and one on stand-by. The plant 
pumping station will have a fan for air evacuation and a power-driven louver. Heating 
will be provided by electric unit heaters and a heat trace will be installed to prevent 
the piping from freezing.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The  fresh  water  pumping  station  will  have  a  4160  /  600 V  transformer  and  will 
include  an  electrical  room  with  distribution  and  control  equipment.  Remote  signals 
will be available through the optical fiber link. Electric power will be provided by the 
4.16 kV overhead power line installed along the pipeline.
18.2.12.2
Reclaim water
Tailings water reclaims will be pumped from the settling pond at the discharge of the 
tailings pond through a 4.8 km HDPE pipeline to be reused as process water in the 
process plant. The total pumping capacity will be 9,000 m3/d. 
 
For that purpose, a building with an electrical room will be erected at that location. 
The main purpose of that building and its equipment is to allow the installation and 
maintenance  of  the  two  pumps.  The  plant  pumping  station  will  have  fan  for  air 
evacuation  and  a  power-driven  louver.  Heating  will  be  provided  by  electric  unit 
heaters. 
 
The tailings water reclaims pumping station will have a 4160 / 600V transformer and 
will  include  an  electrical  room  with  distribution  and  control  equipment.  Remote 
signals will be available through the fiber-optic link. Electric power will be provided by 
the  4.16  kV  overhead  power  line  installed  along  the  pipeline.  The  water  reclaim 
pumps will be on emergency power to allow flushing and avoiding sedimentation of 
the tailings pipeline in case of emergency shutdown. The water reclaim pipeline will 
not  be  insulated  or  heat  traced  because  the system  will  recirculate  if  necessary  to 
avoid freezing.
18.2.12.3
Fire protection
In the plant fresh water tank, there will be water capacity allocated for fire protection. 
The  lower  section  of  the  tank  will  be  kept  for  that  purpose,  representing  around 
175 m3. There will be three dedicated pumps for fire protection at the process plant 
pump house. There will be two high pressure pumps, one electrical and one diesel 
with  a  small  capacity  (Jockey  pump)  to  maintain  pressure  in  the  fire  protection 
system and all required monitoring control panels.
18.2.12.4
Drinking water supply
Drinking  water  will  be  supplied  through  the  local  Duparquet  city  water  distribution 
system for the administrative building, assay laboratory and process plants. 
 
The explosives storage area will be serviced by an artesian well and will include a 
minimum operating reserve. No water treatment facilities are planned for this zone; 
bottled-water  dispensers  will  be  added  if  the  water  drawn  from  the  well  does  not 
meet quality standards and requirements for human consumption.

MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS
Market Studies 
Markets for doré are readily available and the doré bars produced from Duparquet 
could  be  sold  on  the  spot  market.  Gold  markets  are  considered  mature,  despite  a 
current gold price that is lower than the 3-year trailing average; in recent years, the 
demand  has  been  high  and  the  gold  price  has  risen  significantly.  To  better  reflect 
current  market  expectation,  this  study  uses  a  price  of  gold  of  US$1300/oz  at  a 
CAD/USD exchange rate of 1.1 : 1.  
 
Contracts 
No  contracts  have  been  assigned  for  the  Duparquet  Project  considering  the  early 
stage of the Project.

Environmental Baseline Studies 
Duparquet Project Area 
In  November  2013,  an  environmental  baseline  study  (EBS)  report  was  issued  by 
Roche  Ltd  Consulting  Group  (“Roche”)  for  the  Duparquet  Project  area  in  order  to 
refine  a  study  previously  completed  by  STAVIBEL/SNC-Lavalin  in  February  2013. 
The  latter  covered  past  environmental  work  performed  on  the  area  from  1994  to 
2012.  Components  of  the  human  environment  characterizing  the  study  area  were 
also described by STAVIBEL and Roche in 2013. The following sections summarize 
the methodology used and the main results for each component.
20.1.1.1
Physical Environment
The  physical  environment  of  the  Duparquet  Project  area  was  described  based  on 
information collected from various sources:
1.  Field surveys;  
2.  Aerial photographs and/or satellite images, maps, and geomatics tools;  
3.  Information gathered from various governmental agencies as well as by other
project proponents active in the territory (other mine projects);
4.  Studies from the scientific and technical literature.
characterizations  mainly  established
An  evaluation  of  the  site’s  existing  environmental  conditions  was  performed  based 
on  two  environmental  assessment  studies  (SNC-Lavalin,  1995  and  2012).  Soil, 
groundwater  and  surface  water  as  well  as  lake  and  river  sediment  analyses  were 
performed  in  order  to  assess  the  physical  environment  before  the  start  of  mining 
operations.  These  preliminary 
the 
characteristics  and  natural  variability  of  the  environment  in  anticipation  of  site 
restoration objectives. Sample analyses were conducted by independent laboratories 
in Québec, following standard quality control programs (QA/QC). 
 
Findings  showed  that  arsenic  contamination,  generated  by  the  initial  milling 
processes which began in 1933 and the later addition of ore roasting activities that 
took  place  between  1937  and  1956  is  present  on  the  industrial  site  and  the 
neighbouring  residential  and  institutional  sites.  In  addition,  in  certain  areas, 
molybdenum and occasional mineral oil and grease contamination were also found.  
 
Hydrology 
 
No  hydrogeological  assessment  has  been  performed  to  date.  Soils  on  the  site 
consist of thin layers of sand or silty sand and clay. In general, groundwater flows to 
the south, towards Lake Duparquet. 
 
The  main  water  course  whose  watershed  overlaps  the  Property  is  Creek  #1.  The 
source  of  this  creek  is  located  northeast  of  the  Property.  It  starts  flowing  from  the 
east  to  west  and  then  turns  south  and flows  into  Lake  Duparquet, just west  of  the 
existing  tailings  beach.  The  Creek  #1  watershed  drainage  area  is  approximately 
1,600 ha.  Close  to  one  third  of  the  Property  is  located  within  this  watershed.  The
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
249
www.innovexplo.com
remainder  of  the  Property  is  located  on  the  upstream  area  of  several  watersheds 
flowing to the south, i.e. also towards Lake Duparquet. The old mine pit, also called 
Glory Hole, is located in the Creek #1 watershed.  
 
Soil quality 
 
During  the  1995  study,  several  test  pits  were  carried  out  in  areas  of  concern. The 
waste deposit, the sawdust storage area as well as another storage area and some 
soil samples were all analyzed for arsenic, molybdenum and mineral oils and grease. 
Some  soil  and  waste  samples  were  submitted  to  leaching  tests  for  arsenic  and 
molybdenum.  
 
In the 2010-2011 study, 104 boreholes were drilled to the south, northwest and west 
of the mine tailings area in order to determine the quality of soils and tailings. The 
Beattie  mine  tailings  contained  in  the  area  where  samples  were  collected  are  not 
acid  generating.  The  tailings  samples  yielded  results  above  applicable  criteria  for 
certain  metals  (arsenic,  manganese,  molybdenum,  and  in  some  cases  copper, 
nickel,  lead  and  selenium).  Soil  samples  collected  from  the  native  soil  layer  below 
the tailings also exceeded applicable criteria for some metals. 
 
Site rehabilitation will take place as part of the Duparquet Project (see Section 20.2.6 
of this Report).  
 
Groundwater quality 
 
The monitoring wells that were installed to assess groundwater vulnerability during 
the 1995 study have been sampled regularly since 1999. This monitoring consisted 
of 21 sampling programs conducted between June 1999 and May 2011. 
 
In  the  1995  study,  groundwater  analysis  indicated  very  high  arsenic  and  sulphur 
concentrations,  as  well  as  a  high  molybdenum  concentration  (above 
the 
MDDELCC’s Groundwater Criteria for Drinking Water) in the farthest and uppermost 
well (F-1A). In the same location, analytical results indicated high molybdenum and 
sulphur concentrations (above the Drinking Water criteria) in the farthest and lower-
most  well  (F-1).  The  other  wells 
low  arsenic  and  molybdenum 
concentrations, but high sulphur contents (above the Drinking Water criteria). Figure 
20.1 locates the wells.  
 
Between  1999  and  2011,  the  groundwater  analysis  indicated  very  high  arsenic 
concentrations  in  well  F-1A,  at  levels  above  the  criteria for  Drinking Water  and for 
Seepage  into  Surface  Water  or  Infiltration  into  Sewers.  Numerous  concentrations 
above the criteria for Drinking Water were also measured in well F-1. Some arsenic 
concentrations  above  the  criteria  for  Drinking  Water  have  also  been  measured  in 
wells  F-2,  F-3  and  F-3A  since  2008.  As  well,  high  molybdenum  concentrations 
(above Drinking Water criteria) were also detected in wells F-1, F-1A and F-2.  
These results indicate that the local sandy deposits, where wells F-1 and F-1A are 
located,  are  characterized  by  groundwater  with  high  concentrations  of  arsenic, 
molybdenum  and  sulphur.  On  the  other  hand,  the  results  indicate  that  the  clay 
deposit where F-3 and F-3A are located contains groundwater with low arsenic and 
molybdenum concentrations, but a high sulphur content.
indicated
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
250
www.innovexplo.com
These  results  may  indicate  that  the  clay  unit  is  less  susceptible  to  contamination 
transport. 
 
2010-2011 Study (mine tailings area) 
 
Twenty-one (21) monitoring wells were installed in the tailings and in the underlying 
natural  material  in  order  to  determine  groundwater  quality.  Groundwater  analytical 
results collected in tailings showed arsenic and chromium concentrations above the 
criteria  for  Seepage  into  Surface  Water  or  Infiltration  into  Sewers,  for  almost  the 
entire  surface  of  the  tailings  area.  Numerous  exceedances  of  the  arsenic  and 
chromium criteria were also observed in wells installed in the natural soils underlying 
the aquifer. 
 
Reservoir No. 1 - Complementary sampling of the observation wells 
 
A groundwater sampling program was carried out near Reservoir No. 1 in October 
2012. In well PZ-3, water analysis results indicated high concentrations (above the 
MDDELCC’s  criteria  for  Seepage  into  Surface  Water  or  Infiltration  into  Sewers)  of 
aluminum,  arsenic,  copper,  mercury  and  total  phosphorus.  In  PZ-2,  the  water 
analysis  results  indicated  high  concentrations  (above  the  criteria  for  Seepage  into 
Surface  Water  or  Infiltration  into  Sewers)  of  aluminum,  arsenic,  silver,  cadmium, 
copper,  mercury,  molybdenum,  lead,  selenium  and  total  phosphorus.  It  has, 
however, recently been determined that several of these wells were placed within the 
limits  of  previously  existing  reservoirs  that  were  used  to  store  arsenic  trioxide 
material, thus explaining the high values.  
 
Surface water quality 
 
In  the  2010-2011  study,  a  total  of  24  surface  water  samples  were  collected  along 
Creek  #1,  Lake  Duparquet  and  their  tributaries.  Samples  were  collected  over  time 
and at different periods to evaluate the hydrochemistry of the various watercourses 
in the vicinity of the study area. During the summer of 2013, ten (10) samples were 
collected (Figure 20.1). Of these, eight (8) were taken in rivers and two in lakes.  
 
Samples  were  all  collected  in  accordance  with  applicable  provincial  and  federal 
guidelines. Analysis parameters meet the recommendations of Directive 019. 
 
In  general,  surface  waters  of  the  study  area  are  characteristic  of  shallow  aquatic 
environments rich in organic matter. The waters are relatively turbid, mildly acidic to 
alkaline and they have moderate to high buffering capacities. The conductivity, total 
dissolved solids and hardness results from the water samples vary considerably from 
one  station  to  the  next.  Observed  variability  is  likely  due  to  the  hydrological 
differences  between  streams  and  lakes  and,  particularly  at  station  ST-3  (Figure 
20.1), to sediment transport in the runoffs coming in from the village of Duparquet. 
No petroleum hydrocarbon contamination was detected in any of the water samples. 
 
Surface  water  mineral  content  is  highly  variable.  Nitrogen  concentrations  are 
relatively  low.  Total  phosphorus  concentrations  are  characteristic  of  mesotrophic 
(0.01-0.03  mg/l) 
(>0.10  mg/l;  MDDELCC,  2013)  water 
environments. The proximity of the village of Duparquet and of its sewage treatment 
plant as well as the agricultural areas found close to stations ST-6, ST-7 and ST-8
to  hyper-eutrophic
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
251
www.innovexplo.com
likely  explain  the  high  mineral  and  phosphorus  concentrations  that  were  observed 
(Figure 20.1). 
 
Arsenic  concentrations  vary  between  0.0027  and  0.190  mg/l.  It  is  not  unusual  to 
observe  high  arsenic  concentrations  in  samples  collected  close  to  or  on  the  old 
Beattie  gold  mine  site  and  its  tailings  accumulation  areas.  Observed  results  and 
relevant  literature  suggest  that  high  arsenic  results  obtained  from  the  samples 
collected outside of the old mine site are, to a large extent, of natural origin. In fact, 
the Archean sedimentary rock that composes the geology of the area is known to be 
a potential source of arsenic. Other metals found in concentrations higher than the 
detection  limit  are  aluminum,  barium,  copper,  iron,  manganese,  mercury,  lead  and 
zinc. 
 
The  concentrations  of  dissolved  oxygen,  total  phosphorus,  aluminum,  arsenic, 
copper,  iron,  manganese,  mercury  and  lead  all  exceeded  the  criteria  for  the 
protection  of  aquatic  life  in  at  least  one  water  sample.  No  real  trend  in  the  spatial 
distribution  of  these  exceedances  was  observed,  with  some  being  located  in  past 
mine  areas  while  others  were  located  in  reference  areas  out  of  the  Property  limits 
and in a separate sub-watershed. It is important to note that, in the surface waters of 
mineralized  areas  with  an  economical  potential,  measuring  high  metal 
concentrations  exceeding  aquatic  life  protection  criteria  or  recommendations  is  not 
unusual. 
 
In  order  to  complete  the  surface  water  characterization  program,  it  would  be 
important to collect samples at different hydrological periods such as during spring 
freshet since this important hydrological period is usually different from the others. In 
addition, all  waterbodies likely to be affected by  the projected infrastructure should 
be comprehensively portrayed.

Sediment Quality 
 
In the summer of 2013, sediment samples were collected at the same sites used for 
water quality assessment (Figure 20.1). 
 
Sediments found in water bodies of the study area are mostly composed of sand or 
of clay and silt. Total organic carbon content of the collected samples varies between 
0.6  and  5.0%  and  it  is higher  in the  sediments composed  of  clay  and  silt.  Sulphur 
content is higher in samples collected on the old Beattie gold mine site. Measured 
levels of arsenic, chromium, mercury, copper, cadmium, lead and zinc all exceeded 
the criteria for the protection of aquatic life in at least one sediment sample. As for 
surface  water,  no  real  trend  in  the  spatial  distribution  of  these  exceedances  was 
observed.  Sample  concentrations 
iron,  manganese,  arsenic,  copper, 
molybdenum and mercury were highly correlated to sulphur concentrations whereas 
aluminum,  barium,  chromium,  lithium,  nickel,  vanadium  and  zinc  results  were 
correlated  to  organic  carbon  concentrations  of  the  sediment  samples.  Additional 
sediment quality programs should be done at different periods of the year in order to 
monitor changes in their quality.

Biological Environment
Vegetation and Wetlands 
 
No  exhaustive  floral  inventory  has  been  made  on  the  study  zone  sector  to  date, 
although the flora of the Kekeko hills, located some 50 km south of the Project, have 
been  studied.  STAVIBEL  reported  that  this  data  constitutes  the  only  publicly 
available inventory for this area. As part of the future development of the Duparquet 
Project, an inventory of terrestrial habitats and wetlands will need to be conducted in 
order  to  list  plant  species  present  on  the  Property  as  well  as  those  that  may 
potentially be present.  
 
According  to  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resourcesof  Québec  (MNR), 
there  are  designated  exceptional  forest  ecosystems  (EFE)  along  Lake  Duparquet. 
Those  have  been  classified  and  protected  since  2002  under  section 14  of  the 
Sustainable Forest Development Act (R.S.Q., c A-18.1, Québec Government). The 
Forêt  d’enseignement  et  de  recherche  du  Lac  Duparquet  (“Lake  Duparquet 
Research and Teaching Forest”; FERLD) has three EFEs within its boundaries: the 
ancient  Akotekamik  forest,  the  ancient  Lac-Bayard  forest  and  the  rare  Lake 
Duparquet  forest.  Four  other  EFEs  have  been  proposed  by  the  MNR  and  the 
FERLD. None of those are located in the immediate vicinity of the Duparquet Project.  
 
The  regional  sector  under  study  for  the  Duparquet  Project  contains  a  number  of 
naturally  occurring  lakes,  none  of  which  lie  directly  within  the  current  limits  of  the 
mining project.  
 
According to the regional pedological map, the Duparquet Project area is generally 
surrounded by heavy clay deposits, but a peatland is observed about 400 to 500 m 
west of it. According to the MNR, there are also two peatlands located about 400 to 
500  m  south  and  east  of  the  study  area.  Moreover,  a  number  of  beaver  dams 
contribute to altering the hydric nature of the habitat.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

www.innovexplo.com
Terrestrial Wildlife 
 
No exhaustive terrestrial wildlife inventory has been completed to date. Based on the 
literature, 198 bird species have been identified on the land under the responsibility 
of the FERLD and 54 species of mammals and micromammals are likely to be found 
within that same area.  
 
Information  obtained  from  the  MNR  indicates  that  there  are  two  white-tailed  deer 
(Odocoileus virginianus) yards in the Duparquet region. 
 
Finally,  the  MNR  also  provided  information  on  wildlife  species  likely  to  be found  in 
the  Duparquet  Project  area.  The  presence  of  an  aquatic  bird  concentration  area, 
heron colonies and bald eagle nests (special status species) were confirmed in the 
area. In addition, four large mammal species, two small mammal species (including 
one special status species) and eight micromammal species (including one special 
status  species)  are  known  to  be  present  within  that  area  according  to  the  MNR’s 
data. Moreover, during the course of the August 2013 surveys, one species of snake 
was recorded.  
 
No specific bird or wildlife surveys were done as part of the Project. Thus, bird and 
terrestrial  wildlife  surveys  should  be  done  for  the  subsequent  realisation  of  the 
project impact study. 
 
Fisheries and Fish Habitats 
 
According  to  STAVIBEL,  three  spawning  sights  are  known  to  be  present  in  the 
Duparquet region: two for walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) and one for northern pike 
(Esox lucius). Four potential spawning areas have also been identified, two of them 
for freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens). According to the MNR, fish were also 
identified in the Glory Hole water body. 
 
As  part  of  the  fish  habitat  surveys,  nine  water  courses  that  may  be  impacted  by 
future mining operations were characterized in August 2013 using standard methods 
recommended by provincial and federal authorities (Figure 20.1). The water courses 
were characterized over a distance of 100 m. Each 100-m segment was first divided 
into  homogeneous  sub-sections  following  Boudreault  (1984).  Homogeneity  was 
defined  using  criteria  such  as  type  of  watercourse,  particle  size  distribution  of  the 
riverbed,  width  and  depth. Other  biophysical  characteristics  –  such  as  width  at  the 
natural high water mark, water flow, presence and type of aquatic vegetation, etc. – 
were  also  noted.  In  addition,  the  potential  ecological functions  of  each sub-section 
were also noted.  
 
Three  principal  types  of  flow  facies  were  identified:  ponds,  channels  and  zones 
alternating  between  rapids  and  weirs.  Almost  all  streams  found  on  the  Duparquet 
Property  presented  a  channel  type flow  facies  with  a  clay  substrate.  Most  streams 
could  be  considered  to  be  a  poor  to  good  fish  habitat.  A  potential  impassable  fish 
passage  was  located  on  watercourse  #1,  which  is  the  only  stream  or  channel  to 
cross the project site. 
 
No experimental fisheries were achieved during the August 2013 field surveys. Only 
a specific fish field survey could confirm fish presence/absence in streams as well as
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
255
www.innovexplo.com
which  ones  can  be  considered  as  fish  habitats.  This  survey  would  also  allow 
characterizing streams that were not surveyed in August 2013. The MNR’s answers 
to information requests indicate that 34 species of fish have been found in the area 
during  the  course  of  their  experimental  fisheries.  According  to  Bernatchez  and 
Giroux (2012), 44 species of fish are likely to be found in the area.

Methods
In  order  to  determine  the  geochemical  characteristics  of  mine  materials  to  be 
produced as part of the Duparquet Project and to define the associated management 
requirements,  Maxxam  Analytics,  an  MDDELCC-accredited  laboratory  based  in 
Québec  City,  Québec,  and  SGS  Canada,  based  in  Lakefield,  Ontario,  performed 
several tests and/or measurements on various samples of waste rocks (CS-1 to CS-

20.1.2.2
Applicable Management Requirements
In  Québec,  Directive  019  for  the  mining  industry  is  the  document  used  by  the 
Department  of  Sustainable  Development,  Environment,  Wildlife  and  Parks 
(MDDELCC) to authorize and monitor mining projects. It should be noted that in that 
document, waste rock, tailings, treatment sludge and dusts are all defined as “mining 
residues” (or mining waste).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
257
www.innovexplo.com
Directive  019  outlines  requirements  with  regards  to  the  characteristics  of  the 
residues  (low-risk,  leachable,  acid-generating,  cyanide-containing  or  high-risk)  and 
defines leakproofing measures to be applied to mining waste management facilities, 
thereby  ensuring  groundwater  protection.  Figure  20.2  specifies  criteria  to  be 
considered in determining the leakproofing measures as depicted in Directive 019.  
 
Defined  as  “low  risk”  is  any  mining  residue  with  metal  concentrations  that  comply 
with criterion A of the Soil Protection and Rehabilitation of Contaminated Sites Policy 
(SPRCSP) for a specific geological province (in this case, the Superior Province) or 
the  natural  local  background  levels  of  the  area.  However,  residues  that  produce  a 
leachate with concentrations lower than the groundwater protection criteria specific 
to  “leachable”  mining  residues  are  also  considered  “low  risk”,  even  if  total  metal 
content is greater than criterion A of the SPRCSP.  
 
A sample is considered “leachable” for a given element if its metal concentration is 
higher than Québec’s  SPRCSP  criterion  A  and its  leachate  concentration  obtained 
with TCLP 1311 test is higher than the SPRCSP groundwater protection criteria for 
surface  water  seepage.  Leachable  residues  require  groundwater  protection 
measures. It is important to note that there are no criterion A values for some metals.  
 
Directive 019 specifies that “acid-generating” mining wastes are characterized by a 
sulphur  content  of more  than  0.3%  and for  which  an  acid  generating  potential  has 
been  confirmed by  one of the two  following  conditions:  1)  the  net  acid neutralizing 
potential (NP-AP) is lower than 20 kg CaCO3/t of residues; or 2) the acid neutralizing 
potential  ratio  (NP/AP) 
than  3.  “Acid-generating”  residues  require 
groundwater protection measures. 
 
It  should  also  be  noted  that  any  mining  residues  produced  as  part  of  a  process 
involving cyanidation are considered as “cyanide-containing”. Such residues require 
groundwater protection measures. 
 
Finally,  defined  as  “high  risk”  is  any  material  that  produces  leachate  with  levels 
higher  than  those  defined  in  Appendix  II  of  Directive  019  or  material  that  is 
considered radioactive according to the definition set out in Directive 019. “High-risk” 
residues require the strictest groundwater protection measures.

Results
The  following  tables  present  all  results  obtained  as  part  of  the  above-mentioned 
tests:
•  Table 20.2: Metal content in solids for waste rock, ore and tailings; 
•  Table  20.3:  Characteristics  of  the  decant  solution  of  tailings  samples
prepared by SGS Minerals Services;
•  Table  20.4:  Metal  content  in  leachates  produced  following  TCLP  1311
leaching tests on solids for waste rock, ore and tailings;
•  Table  20.5:  Metal  content  in  leachates  produced  following  SPLP  1312
leaching tests on solids for waste rock, ore and tailings;
•  Table 20.6: Metal content in leachates produced following CTEU-9 leaching 
tests  or  Shake  Flask  Extraction  tests  on  solids  for  waste  rock,  ore  and 
tailings;
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
258
•  Table 20.7: Acid-generating potential for waste rock, ore and tailings. 
•  According  to  those  results  and  following  Directive  019,  Duparquet’s  mining
residues are classified as:
www.innovexplo.com
o  Not “high risk”; 
o  Not  potentially  “acid-generating”,  except  for  POX  tailings  which  are
potentially acid-generating;
o  Potentially  “leachable”  according  to  TCLP  1311  test  results  for  Al, 
Ba, Be, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni, Ag and Zn. However, it should be noted that 
results  obtained  from  SPLP  1312  and  CTEU-9  (or  SFE)  leaching 
tests for waste rock, ore and both types of tailings tend to show that 
such  materials  would  most  likely  not  be  leachable  in  “real-life” field 
conditions.  SPLP  1312,  CTEU-9  and  SFE 
tests  are  more 
representative of such conditions than TCLP 1311, but are still over-
conservative (SPLP grain size is <9.5 mm, CTEU-9 is <150 µm and 
SFE is 1.0 mm to 2.5 mm; inadequate solid/liquid ratio, etc.).
o  Therefore, based on the information gathered so far, waste rock, ore 
and  both  types  of  tailings  are  considered  as  potentially  non-
leachable.  Kinetic  tests  will  be  performed  to  confirm  that  those 
mining residues are not leachable.
POX  tailings  are  also  classified  as  “cyanide-containing”  since  their  production 
involves  a  carbon-in-leach  (CIL)  circuit  during  which  carbon  adsorbs  the  gold from 
the solution as cyanidation of the ore proceeds. Flotation tailings do not go through 
cyanidation. See Section 17 of this Report for more information on ore processing.

Waste Rock, Ore and Tailings Management
Based on the above results and considering not only the TCLP leaching test results 
but  also  the  SPLP,  CTEU-9  and  SFE  results,  the  waste  rock,  ore  and  flotation 
tailings  would  be  classified  as  “low-risk”  at  the  provincial  level,  meaning  that  no 
specific leakproofing measures have to be implemented for management purposes. 
Again, kinetic tests will have to be performed to confirm such classification.  
 
On the other hand, POX tailings, as stated above, are classified as potentially acid-
generating  and  cyanide-containing  since  their  production  involves  cyanidation. 
Consequently,  level-A  leakproofing  measures  would  be  required  for  POX  tailings 
following Directive 019:

stockpile.
Considering the type of soils present in the area targeted for the proposed tailings 
storage facility (TSF), a geomembrane will have to be used to cover all of the area 
where POX tailings will be disposed. 
 
Tailings  management  will  consequently  be  done  in  such  a  way  that  flotation 
(desulphurized)  tailings  will  be  managed  separately  from  POX  tailings,  therefore 
using two distinct tailings storage facilities. Such separate management enables cost 
reduction not only at construction phase – since no geomembrane is required under 
the  Flotation  TSF  –  but  also  at  closure  since  legal  requirements  applicable  to 
potentially acid-generating POX tailings are also stricter.

As explained in Section 17 of this Report, a different production scenario was also 
considered as part of the present study, i.e. the production of an ore concentrate that 
would  be  shipped  directly  out  of  the  Property  without  any  additional  on-site  POX 
processing. In that scenario, the production of such a concentrate would require the 
flotation tailings to be classified as “cyanide-containing” since their production would 
involve  a  carbon-in-leach  (CIL)  circuit  during  which  carbon  adsorbs  the  gold  from 
solution as cyanidation of the ore proceeds. Such a classification would mean that 
flotation  tailings  would  require  Level-A  leakproofing  measures  in  compliance  with 
Directive 019 and, considering the type of soils in the area targeted for the Flotation 
TSF, 
lined  with  a 
geomembrane during construction phase. Closure requirements would however not 
be  impacted  by  such  classification  since  flotation  tailings  would  still  not  be 
considered as potentially acid-generating or leachable.  
 
Jurisdictions and Applicable Laws and Regulations  
The legal framework for the construction and operation of the projected facilities is a 
combination  of  provincial,  national,  and  municipal  policies,  regulations  and 
guidelines.  The  design and  the  environmental  management  of  the  Project facilities 
and activities must be done in accordance with this legal framework. 
 
Recent Modifications to the Mining Act 
The  Québec  Mining  Act  was  substantially  amended  and  modernized  by  Bill  70, 
which  the  Québec  National  Assembly  adopted  on  December  9,  2013.  This  fourth 
attempt to update Québec’s mining legislation follows on the heels of the defeat of 
Bill  43  and  that  of  Bill  79  and  Bill  14  in  previous  legislative  sessions.  Within  the 
specific context of the Duparquet Project, the following amendments are relevant:
20.2
20.2.1
•  Provisions  specific  to  aboriginal  communities  and  referring  to  an  aboriginal 
community  consultation  policy  specific  to  the  mining  sector  (obligation  to 
consult  aboriginal  communities  and  requirement  that  the  Minister  consult 
aboriginal communities separately if the circumstances so warrant).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

•  On each anniversary date of a mining lease or mining concession, the lessee 
or grantee will have to send the Minister a report showing the quantity of ore 
extracted during the previous year, its value, the duties paid under the Mining 
Tax Act during that period and the overall contributions paid.
•  Mining  leases  to  be  issued  will  require  the  prior  approval  of  a  rehabilitation 
and restoration plan and the issue of a CA under the Environment Quality Act 
(EQA), unless the time needed to obtain a certificate is unreasonable.
On July 23, 2013, the Government of Québec passed amendments to the Regulation 
respecting Mineral Substances other than Petroleum, Natural Gas and Brine in order 
to set new rules concerning the financial guarantees required for the restoration of 
mining  sites.  Among  other  things,  those  result  in  an  increase  of  the  financial 
guarantee from 70% to 100% of the projected costs for the work required under the 
rehabilitation  and  restoration  plan.  The  guarantee  must  cover  not  only  restoration 
costs associated with the accumulation areas, but all costs for the entire mine site 
and associated infrastructures. It must be paid in three annual instalments. The first 
instalment  corresponds  to  50%  of  the  total  amount  of  the  guarantee  and  must  be 
paid within 90 days following the receipt of the approval of the plan. The second and 
third instalments each represent 25% of the guarantee and must be paid in full by 
the first and second anniversary date. 
Lastly, Bill 70 amends the Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment 
and Review in order to require an environmental impact assessment for all metal ore 
processing  plant  construction  projects,  and  all  metal  mine  openings  and  operation 
projects  where  the  processing  or  production  capacity  of  the  plant  or  the  mine  is 
2,000 metric tons or more per day. 
 
Québec Procedure Relating to the Environmental Assessment of the Project
20.2.2 
20.2.2.1
Overview
“Section  31.1  of  the  Environment  Quality  Act  (EQA)  states  that  “No  person  may 
undertake any construction, work, activity or operation, or carry out work according 
to  a  plan  or  program,  in  the  cases  provided  for  by  regulation  of  the  Government 
without  following  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  review  procedure  and 
obtaining an authorization certificate from the Government.” 
 
Moreover, section 2 of the Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment 
and  Review  provides  the  list  of  projects  subject  to  the  environmental  impact 
assessment and review procedure, namely: 
 
(n.8)  the  construction  of  an  ore  processing  plant  for  metalliferous  ore  or  asbestos 
ore, where the processing capacity of the plant is 2,000 metric tons or more per day, 
except in the case of rare earth deposits; 
 
(p)  the  opening  and  operation  of  a  metals  mine  or  an  asbestos  mine  that  has  a 
production capacity of 2,000 metric tons or more per day, except in the case of rare 
earth deposits” 
 
Thus,  the  Duparquet  Project  is  subject  to  the  provincial  environmental  impact 
assessment and review procedure.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
268
www.innovexplo.com
Section  31.2  of  the  EQA  states  that:  “Every  person  wishing  to  undertake  the 
realization  of  any  of  the  projects  contemplated  in  section  31.1  must  file  a  written 
notice with the Minister describing the general nature of his project; the Minister, in 
turn,  shall  indicate  to  the  proponent  of  the  project  the  nature,  the  scope  and  the 
extent of the environmental impact assessment statement that he must prepare.” 
 
Clifton  Star  will  table  a  Project  Notice  as  soon  as  possible  with  the  MDDELCC.  A 
month  later,  following  the  review  of  the  project  notice,  a  Directive  (“guidelines”) 
defining the required scope and content of the environmental impact assessment of 
the Project will be sent by the MDDELCC to Clifton Star.  
 
According  to  the  Regulation  respecting  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and 
Review,  and following  the filing  of the  Project  Notice, the  Minister  must submit the 
application record to the Government for approval within a maximum of 15 months. 
However, one should note that the 15-month period does not include the time taken 
by  the  ‘’proponent’’  to  draft  the  EIA  report  or  to  answer  any  request  for  additional 
information,  nor  the  time  taken  by  the  Government  (Cabinet)  to  make  its  decision. 
Figure 20.3 shows the steps involved in this procedure.
20.2.2.2
General Contents of an Environmental Impact Assessment Statement
Section  3  of  the  Regulation  respecting  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and 
Review defines the contents of an environmental impact assessment statement: 
 
a)  A description of the project mentioning, in particular, the desired objectives, the 
site [...], the project timetable, any subsequent operation and maintenance activities, 
the  amounts  and  characteristics  of  types  of  borrowed  materials  required,  power 
sources, methods of management of waste or residue other than road construction 
residue,  transportation  activities  inherent  in  the  construction  and  subsequent 
operation  of  the  project,  any  connection  with  land  use  planning  and  development 
plans,  urban  zoning  plans  or  agricultural  zoning  and  reserved  areas  within  the 
meaning of the act to preserve agricultural land [...]; 
 
b)  A qualitative and quantitative inventory of the aspects of the environment which 
could  be  affected  by  the  project,  such  as  fauna,  flora,  human  communities,  the 
cultural, archaeological and historical heritage of the area, agricultural resources and 
the use made of resources of the area; 
 
c)  A list and evaluation of positive, negative and residual impacts of the project on 
the environment, including indirect, cumulative, latent and irreversible effects [...]; 
 
d)  A  description  of  the  different  options  to  the  project,  in  particular  regarding  its 
location, the means and methods of carrying out and developing the project, and all 
other variables in the project as well as reasons justifying the option chosen; 
 
e)  A list and description of measures to be taken to prevent, reduce or attenuate the 
deterioration of the environment, including [...] In particular, any equipment used or 
installed to reduce the emission, deposit, issuance or discharge of contaminants into 
the environment, any control of operations and monitoring, emergency measures in 
case of accident, and reclamation of the area affected.”

20.2.2.3
Summary of the Environmental Impact Assessment Statement
www.innovexplo.com
Section  4  of  the  Regulation  respecting  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and 
Review  indicates  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  statement  prepared 
pursuant  to  section  31.1  of  the  EQA  must  be  accompanied  by  a  non-technical 
summary  of  the  main  elements  and  conclusions  of  the  studies,  documents  or 
research. The summary is published separately.
20.2.2.4
Evaluation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
A well-defined project is essential to producing an EIA report that not only accounts 
for the project to be carried out, but that would also be considered acceptable by the 
authorities early on in the procedure. After reviewing the EIA report, the MDDELCC 
will determine its admissibility. This assessment involves consultations with several 
government  departments  and  agencies.  The  proponent  should  generally  expect  to 
receive  questions  and  comments  to  be  addressed  before  the  EIA  report  can  be 
determined to be admissible. Following the filling of the response to this first set of 
questions, a second set of questions may be issued. To avoid delays associated with 
this procedure, it is essential to produce an environmental impact assessment that 
covers as specifically as possible every aspect raised in the Directive issued by the 
MDDELCC.

20.2.2.5
Public Consultations
Section  31.3  of  the  EQA  states  that:  “After  receiving  the  environmental  impact 
assessment  statement,  the  Minister  shall  make  it  public  and  indicate  to  the 
proponent  of  the  project  to  initiate  the  stage  of public  information  and  consultation 
provided for by regulation of the Government.” 
 
Once  the  impact  study  is  found  to  be  admissible,  the  Minister  will  then  direct  the 
Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE) to prepare the project for 
public  consultation.  This  consultation  process  lasts  45  days  (section  11  of  the 
Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment and Review).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
271
20.2.2.6
Public Hearings
www.innovexplo.com
Section 31.3 of the EQA also states that: “Any person, group or a municipality may, 
within the time prescribed by regulation of the Government, apply to the Minister for 
the  holding  of  a  public  hearing  in  connection  with  such  a  project.  Unless  he 
considers such application to be frivolous, the Minister shall direct the [BAPE] to hold 
a public hearing and report its findings and its analysis thereof to him.” 
 
Public hearings are governed by the Rules of Procedure relating to the Conduct of 
Public Hearings (Q 2, r. 45). 
 
Following  the  public  hearings,  the  BAPE  commission  files  its  report  to  the 
MDDELCC. The commission is required to complete its mandate and file its report 
within 4 months. The Minister then has 60 days to publicly release the BAPE report.
20.2.2.7
Government Decision
On the basis of the BAPE report and of the MDDELCC’s evaluation of the EIA (the 
Environmental  Analysis  Report;  in  French:  “Rapport  d’analyse  environnementale”), 
the Minister analyses the project and makes a recommendation to the Government. 
As  specified  in  section  31.5  of  the  EQA,  the  Government  renders  its  decision  by 
Decree: it authorizes the project, with or without changes and conditions, or rejects it. 
The  maximum  period  between  the  publication  of  the  BAPE  report  and  the 
Government's decision is not specified in the EQA nor its regulations. 
 
Federal Procedure  
The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 2012) was introduced on July 
6, 2012. Consequently, projects are now examined according to the requirements of 
this new law. Thus, under the CEAA 2012, an environmental assessment focuses on 
potential adverse environmental effects that are within federal jurisdiction, including:
20.2.3
•  Fish and fish habitat; 
•  Other aquatic species; 
•  Migratory birds; 
•  Federal lands; 
•
Impacts  that  will  or  could  potentially  cross  provincial  or  international 
boundaries; 
Impacts on Aboriginal peoples, such as land use and traditional resources; 
Impacts  that  are  directly  linked  or  necessarily  incidental  to  any  federal 
decisions about a project.
• 
•
An  environmental  assessment  will  consider  a  comprehensive  set  of  factors  that 
include any cumulative effect, mitigation measure and comments received from the 
public.  
 
Regulations  Designating  Physical  Activities  determines  the  specific  activities  which 
constitutes  designated  projects  that  may  require  an  environmental  assessment  by 
the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Agency  (“the  CEA  Agency”,  or  “the 
Agency”)  or  by  the  Canadian  Nuclear  Safety  Commission  or  the  National  Energy 
Board. It should be noted that this Regulation was officially amended on October 24, 
2013  (Regulation  amending  the  Regulations  Designating  Physical  Activities).  The
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
272
www.innovexplo.com
schedule  specifies  the  designated  projects  that  may  require  an  environmental 
assessment  under  the  responsibility  of  the  CEA  Agency  (sections  1  to  30),  the 
Canadian  Nuclear  Safety  Commission  (sections  31  to  38)  or  the  National  Energy 
Board  (sections  39  to  45).  With  regards  to  the  Duparquet  Project,  it  has  been 
determined that the following designated activities are to be considered: 
 
“16. The construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new […] 
(c)  rare  earth  element  mine  or  gold  mine,  other  than  a  placer  mine,  with  an  ore 
production capacity of 600 t/day or more.” 
 
According to CEAA (2012), proponents of designated projects are required to submit 
a description of the designated project to the Agency to inform on whether or not an 
environmental  assessment  of  the  designated  project  is  required.  The  project 
description  must  include  the  prescribed  information  as  set  out  in  the  Prescribed 
Information  for  the  Description  of  a  Designated  Project  Regulations,  including 
information  about  the  possible  adverse  environmental  effects  which  will  be 
generated  by  the  project.  Clifton  Star  will  table  a  Project  Description  as  soon  as 
possible with the CEA Agency.  
 
After approving the Project Description, the Agency posts a notice on the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Registry Internet site (“the registry”) to inform whether or 
not  an  environmental  assessment  must  be  conducted.  A  summary  of  the  Project 
Description  is  also  displayed,  along  with  a  notice  that  the  public  has  20  days  to 
submit comments on the project. 
 
Within 45 days after the posting of the Project Description in the registry, the Agency 
must  decide  whether  a  federal  environmental  assessment  is  required  or  not.  The 
Agency must consider the following factors while making a decision:
•  The description of the designated project provided by the proponent; 
•  The possibility that the designated project may cause adverse environmental
effects;
•  Any comments received from the public during the 20 days after posting the
project description summary on the registry; 
•  The results of any relevant regional studies.
Considering the above information and recent experience with the CEAA 2012, the 
Duparquet Project is a designated project and it will consequently have to go through 
the Canadian environmental assessment process. 
 
After having determined that an environmental assessment is required, the Agency 
shall  post  a  Notice  of  Commencement  of  the  environmental  assessment  on  the 
registry.  The  Agency  shall  then  prepare  a  preliminary  version  of  the  guidelines 
relative to the environmental impact assessment. These guidelines are posted on the 
registry allowing the public to comment on the proposed studies and methods as well 
as on the information that will be required for the environmental impact assessment.  
 
The  Agency  takes  into  account  the  general  public’s  comments,  including  the 
observations made by Aboriginal groups and federal ministries before providing the 
final version of the environmental impact assessment guidelines to the proponent.

information
further  clarifications  or  additional
The  proponent  then  has  to  submit  to  the  Agency  an  environmental  impact 
assessment  identifying  the  environmental  effects  of  the  project  and  propose 
measures to mitigate these effects, while accounting for the Agency’s guidelines 
 
Following  the  submission  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  to  the  Agency, 
the latter will ensure of its relevancy and accuracy. The Agency may require that the 
proponent  provides 
to  better 
understand  the  potential  environmental  effects  and  the  proposed  mitigation  and 
preventive measures. 
 
The Agency will then prepare a preliminary version of the environmental assessment 
report,  which  will  include  the  Agency’s  conclusions  on  the  potential  environmental 
effects  of  the  project,  the  proposed  mitigation  measures,  the  significance  of  the 
residual  adverse  environmental  effects  of  the  project  and  the  requirements  of  the 
monitoring  program.  The  Agency  will  then  invite  the  public  to  comment  on  this 
preliminary report before finalizing it and submitting it to the Minister of Environment. 
 
If the Minister decides that the project is not likely to cause any significant adverse 
environmental effects or that the latter are considered justifiable by the Governor in 
Council, then the conditions relative to the mitigation measures and the monitoring 
program to be respected by the proponent as part of its project, are set out in the 
assessment decision statement issued by the Minister 
 
An  environmental  assessment  to  be  conducted  by  the  Agency  must  be  completed 
within  365  days.  This  timeframe  begins  when  the  environmental  assessment’s 
Notice of Commencement is released on the website of the registry and ends when 
the Minister of Environment issues its decision as to whether or not the designated 
project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.  
 
The Minister may extend the deadline for a maximum of 3 months in order to allow 
for a partnership with another authority or because of particular circumstances to the 
project. The Federal Cabinet has the authority to extend this deadline for more than 
three months  
 
Canada-Québec Agreement on Environmental Assessment Cooperation (2010) 
The  federal  and  provincial  governments  reached  an  agreement  in  2004  (“the 
Agreement”) aiming for a simultaneous analysis of impact assessments submitted to 
both  governmental  levels  in  order  to  minimize  the  time  required  for  obtaining  the 
environmental authorizations. The Agreement which expired in 2009 was renewed in 
2010. 
 
This Agreement applies to projects located in Québec and conducted on provincial 
and  federal  lands  that  are  subject  to  an  assessment  under  the  CEAA  and  the 
Québec  EQA.  However,  it  does  not  apply  to  projects  governed  by  the  James  Bay 
and Northern Québec Agreement.  
 
The Agreement has as objective to ensure that a single environmental assessment 
is  conducted  for  projects  that  must  comply  with  the  federal  and  provincial 
requirements  for  environmental  assessments.  The  Parties  agreed  to  respect  the 
environmental  assessment  timetables  stipulated  in  the  provincial  and  federal
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

legislations. Each jurisdiction has a single point of contact and they are responsible 
for  ensuring  that  the  requirements  of  each  party  participating  in  the  cooperative 
environmental  assessment  are  respected.  The  Agreement  does  not  delegate  any 
federal  powers  to  the  province,  or  vice  versa.  Each  government  maintains  its 
authority  in  the  areas  under  its  jurisdiction  and  remains  responsible  for  the 
environmental assessment decisions required by its legislation. 
 
As specified on the CEA Agency’s website, the Agreement:
•  constitutes  an  administrative
the  parties  will 
collaborate  to  exercise  their  respective  powers  and  duties  with  respect  to 
environmental assessment as set out in the CEAA and in Division IV.1 of the 
Québec EQA;
framework  within  which
•  must be interpreted in accordance with the CEAA and the Québec EQA, as 
well  as  any  other  legal  requirements,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the 
legislative requirements;
•  does  not  establish  new  powers  or  duties  nor  does  it  alter  the  powers  and 
duties  established  by  the  CEAA  and  the  Québec  EQA,  and  is  not  legally 
binding on the parties;
•  does  not  affect  in  any  way  the  independence  and  autonomy  of  any 
commission  of the  BAPE  or  joint  review  panel  which  may  participate  in  the 
process of a cooperative environmental assessment.
Environmental Permitting 
Even  if  the  project  undergoes  an  environmental  impact  assessment  and  is 
authorized by the Government pursuant to section 31.5 of the EQA, it would still be 
subject to section 22 of the EQA and must therefore obtain a CA as stated in section 
6 of the Regulation Respecting the Administration of the Environment Quality Act (c. 
Q-2, r. 3). 
 
“6.  Notwithstanding  sections  1  to  3  of  this  Regulation,  any  project  arising  from  a 
project authorized by the Government pursuant to section 31.5 of the Act is subject 
to the application of section 22 of the Act.” 
 
In  addition  to  the  mitigation  measures  set  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  impact 
assessment,  the  final  project  design  must  comply  with  all  applicable  standards 
relating to the proposed infrastructure and equipment.  
 
The issuance of the CA, however, should only be a formality as the certificate issued 
pursuant to section 31.5 of the EQA binds the Minister as to where he exercises the 
powers provided in section 22 and as specified in section 31.7 of the Act. 
 
“31.7. Every decision rendered under section 31.5 or 31.6 is binding on the Minister, 
where he subsequently exercises the powers provided in section 22, 32, 55, 70.11 or 
in Division IV.2.” 
 
In  addition  to  the  CA  required  under  section  22  of  the  EQA,  the  proponent  must 
obtain  the  permits,  authorizations,  approvals,  certificates  and  leases  required  from 
the appropriate authorities. Those are described in the upcoming sections.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

The  authorization  application  and  permitting  process  is  expected  to  take  one  full 
year.  Applications  may be filed  concurrently  with  the  construction  work and  should 
therefore not impact on the project schedule.
20.2.5.1
Certificates of Authorization
In order to carry out the Duparquet Project, one or more certificates of authorization 
(CAs) will be required from the MDDELCC under section 22 of the EQA. A form to 
which are attached the documents and information set out in sections 7 and 8 of the 
Regulation respecting the Application of the Environment Quality Act is included with 
a  CA  application.  For  mining  activities,  CA  applications  must  also  comply  with  the 
Directive 019 requirements.  
 
Moreover,  because  the  Duparquet  Project  will  involve  discharges  into  the  aquatic 
environment,  it  will  be  necessary  to  complete  the  effluent  discharge  objectives 
application  form  (“Demande  d’objectifs  environnementaux  de  rejet  (OER)  pour  les 
industries”)  and  attach  it  to  the  CA  application.  The  CA  application  forms  and  all 
required  documents  must  be  sent  to  the  MDDELCC’s  Abitibi-Témiscamingue  and 
Northern Québec regional branch. The time required to analyze an application for a 
CA  directly  depends  on  the  complexity  of  the  project.  Under  the  Declaration  of 
Services to the Public, the Department is committed to providing an official response 
within 75 days following the receipt of the application for a CA or approval.  
 
The number of CA applications to prepare will depend on the timeline of the project 
activities and its associated work items. By dividing the project into predefined items, 
it will enable a step-by-step implementation process.  
 
Under  the  Ministerial  Order  concerning  the  fees  payable  under  the  EQA,  fees  are 
payable by the company seeking an authorization under the Act. The fees which are 
indicated  in  the  Ministerial  Order  are  approximately  $1,000  to  $5,000  for  each 
request for an authorization under sections 22, 31, 32, 48 and 70.8 of the EQA.
•  Authorization  for  Water  Supply  Intakes  and  Devices  for  the  Treatment  of
Drinking Water and Disposal of Wastewater
An authorization under section 32 of the EQA is needed to connect the Duparquet 
Project facilities to the municipal water system. Two forms must be completed and 
signed  by  the  project  engineer,  and  the  required  documents  must  be  attached  to 
them.  The  required  documents  are  administrative  documents  and  a  technical 
document to be signed by the project engineer. The application for an authorization 
must be submitted to the MDDELCC regional branch.
•  Authorization  to  Install  an  Apparatus  or  Equipment  to  Prevent,  Reduce  or
Cause the Cessation of the Contaminants Release into the Atmosphere
Under section 48 of the EQA, an application for an authorization must be submitted 
for the installation of an apparatus or equipment which will prevent, reduce or cause 
the cessation of the release of contaminants into the atmosphere. The application for 
the  authorization  of  an  industrial  project  (“Demande  d’autorisation  pour  un  projet 
industriel”) must be completed and submitted to the MDDELCC regional branch. The 
documents to be attached to this application are listed in the form.

Approval
www.innovexplo.com
Approval  for  the  Location  of  the  Process  Concentration  Plant  and  Mine 
Tailings Storage Facility 
 
Under section 240 of the Mining Act, “Any person who intends to operate a mill for 
the preparation of mineral substances, a concentration plant, a refinery or a smelter 
shall, before commencing its operations, have the site approved by the Minister or, 
where  the  project  is  subject  to  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  review 
procedure provided for in Division IV.1 of Chapter I of the Environment Quality Act, 
by  the  Government.”  Section  241  of  the  same  Act  also  states,  “Every  person 
responsible for  the  management  of  a  concentration  plant,  refinery  or  smelter  shall, 
before  commencing  activities,  have  the  site  intended  as  a  storage  yard for  tailings 
approved by the Minister. The same applies to every holder of a mining right, owner 
of  mineral  substances  or  operator  who  intends  to  establish  a  mine  tailings  site.” 
Consequently,  a  request  for  approval  must  be  submitted  to  the  MERN  before 
activities  begin  at  the  Duparquet  gold  mine.  This  request  must  include  the 
information  and  documents  as  set  out  in  sections  124  and  125  of  the  Regulation 
respecting Mineral Substances other than Petroleum, Natural Gas and Brine.
20.2.5.3
Attestation
Depollution Attestation 
 
In  accordance  with  the  Order  in  Council  515-2002  issued  on  May  1,  2002,  the 
Duparquet  Project  requires  a  depollution  attestation  from  the  MDDELCC.  This 
certificate, which is renewable every 5 years, identifies the environmental conditions 
that  must  be  met  by  the  industrial  facilities  when  carrying  out  its  activities.  The 
certificate compiles all of the environmental requirements relating to the operation of 
an  industrial  facility.  The  depollution  attestation  differs  from  the  CA  issued  under 
section  22  of  the  EQA.  The  latter  is  a  statutory  document  issued  prior  to  the 
implementation  of  a  project  or  activity,  whereas  the  former  applies  strictly  to  the 
operation  of  an  industrial  facility.  The  steps  included  in  the  depollution  attestation 
process are described below. 
 
Order in Council 
 
The process for the issuance of a depollution attestation was implemented through 
the adoption by the Québec Government of an order in council that subjects certain 
categories of industrial facilities to Subdivision 1 of Division IV.2 of Chapter 1 of the 
EQA. This Subdivision of the Act establishes the legal framework for the depollution 
attestation. 
 
Application for a Depollution Attestation 
 
The operator of an industrial facility which is subject to an order in council must apply 
to the Ministry for a depollution attestation within 30 days following the issuance of 
the CA issued under section 22 of the EQA for the operation of its mine project. This 
application must be made using the form provided by the Ministry that identifies all of 
the required information.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
277
www.innovexplo.com
First Draft of Depollution Attestation 
 
The Ministry will prepare and submit a first draft of the depollution attestation to the 
industrial facility. The facility management has then 30 days to provide comments, as 
stipulated by the regulation. 
 
Public Consultations 
 
As  stipulated  by  the  regulation,  the  Ministry  must  publish  a  notice  for  public 
consultation in a daily or weekly newspaper within 90 days of the mailing date of the 
first draft of the depollution attestation. The Ministry must also make the request and 
project attestation accessible to public consultation. These consultations must take 
place over a period of at least 45 days. The facility management is also informed of 
the project attestation being submitted to public consultation. 
 
Second Draft of Depollution Attestation 
 
Following the public consultations, the Ministry will review the comments that were 
received and will prepare a second draft of the depollution attestation. The second 
draft is submitted to the industrial facility management, which has 30 days to provide 
comments. 
 
Issuing of Depollution Attestation 
 
The  Ministry  will  review  the  final  comments  provided  by  the  industrial  facility 
management and will prepare the final version of the depollution attestation, which 
will be issued to the industrial facility management for a period of five years. 
 
The facility management for its part will be responsible for requesting a renewal of its 
depollution  attestation  at  least  six  months  before  it  expires.  The  original  certificate 
will remain in effect until a new certificate is issued.
20.2.5.4
Permits
Forest Management Permit for Mining Activities 
 
Under section 73 of the Sustainable Forest Development Act holders of mining rights 
can  obtain  forest  management  permits  relating  to  mining  activities  in  order  to 
exercise their rights under the Mining Act. This permit holder is allowed to cut timber 
on the land covered by its mining rights for the construction of buildings or any other 
operations  necessary  for  its  mining  activities,  in  compliance  with  the  Sustainable 
Forest  Development  Act  and  its  regulations.  The  applicant  must  have  already 
obtained the right to operate the site for mining purposes, a right which is granted by 
the  Mines  Division  of  the  MERN.  Prior  to  proceeding  with  its  timber  cutting 
operations, the holders of mining rights must submit a written request to the MERN 
forest  management  unit  in  order  to  obtain  a  permit  for  its  mining  operations.  The 
request can be for the clearing of a site for mining activities, the exploratory boring of 
a gravel bed or the clearing of a gravel or sand pit.  
 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  holder  of  a  forest  management  permit  for  mining 
activities  must  scale  all  timber  harvested  in  public  land  according  to the  standards
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
278
www.innovexplo.com
prescribed  by  the  Government  regulation  and  as  specified  in  section  75  of  the 
Sustainable  Forest  Development  Act.  The  holder  is  responsible  for  paying  the 
prescribed  duty  as  stipulated  in  section  6  of  the  Regulation  respecting  Forest 
Royalties. 
 
High-Risk Petroleum Equipment Operating Permit 
 
Under  section  120  of  the  Safety  Code,  “The  owner  of  a  petroleum  equipment 
installation  that  includes  at  least  one  component  that  is  high-risk  petroleum 
equipment must obtain a permit for the use of all the high-risk petroleum equipment 
situated  at  the  same  address,  until  the  equipment  is  removed  from  its  respective 
place of use”. 
 
A  “high-risk”  petroleum  equipment  as  defined  in  section  8.01  of  the  Construction 
Code is having one of the following characteristics:
•  For underground storage systems:
o  Capacity of 500 or more litres, used to store gasoline or diesel; 
o  Capacity of 4,000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel 
oil  except  for  equipment  used  for  heating  a  residential  single-family 
dwelling;
•  For aboveground storage systems:
o  Capacity of 2,500 or more litres, used to store gasoline; 
o  Capacity of 10,000 or more litres, used to store diesel; 
o  Capacity of 10,000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel 
oil  except  for  equipment  used  for  heating  a  residential  single-family 
dwelling;
•  Storage tanks used to store gasoline, diesel, heating oil and heavy fuel oil for
profit, regardless of their capacity.
The form “Application for a Permit for the Use of a High-Risk Petroleum Equipment” 
must  be  completed  and submitted  to  the  Régie du  bâtiment. This  application  must 
include all of the information and documents identified in section 121 of the Safety 
Code.  A  permit  is  valid  for  24  months.  The  issuing  and  renewal  of  a  high-risk 
petroleum equipment permit are subject to compliance and performance monitoring 
under the provisions of the Construction Code and the Safety Code. 
 
Explosives Permit 
 
Under the Act respecting Explosives, no person shall possess, store, sell or transport 
any  explosives  unless  he  is  holding  a  permit  for  such  purpose.  Depending  on  the 
intended  usage,  several  permits  are  required  for  the  possession  of  explosives  for 
industrial  or  commercial  purposes.  Division  II  of  the  Regulation  under  the  Act 
respecting  Explosives  describes  the  different  types  of  permits  that  are  required.  A 
general  explosives  permit  entitles  the  holder  to have  explosives  in  his  possession. 
Solely the holder of a general permit can obtain a magazine, sale or transport permit. 
A  magazine  permit  entitles  the  holder  of  a  general  permit  to  purchase  and  store 
explosives in a container or a building that complies with the regulations. A transport 
permit entitles the holder of a general permit to transport explosives.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
279
20.2.5.5
www.innovexplo.com
In  order  to  obtain  these  permits,  the  forms  “Application  for  a  General  Explosives 
Permit” and the “Application for a Sales, Magazine or Transport Permit”, which are 
available  from  the  Sûreté  du  Québec  (SQ),  must  be  completed.  The  required 
documents and fees must be submitted to the SQ. Permits are valid for a period of 5 
years. 
 
Leases 
Mining Lease 
 
Under  section  100  of  the  Mining  Act,  “no  person  may  mine  mineral  substances, 
except surface mineral substances, petroleum, natural gas and brine, unless he has 
previously obtained a mining lease from the Minister or a mining concession under 
any former Act relating to mines”. In order to obtain a mining lease, a claim holder 
must  establish the  existence  of the  presence  of  an  economic  deposit.  Applications 
must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office or to the regional office. The initial term of 
a mining lease is 20 years. The lease can then be renewed every 10 years for the 
duration  of  the  mining  operation.  The  procedure  for  obtaining  a  mining  lease  is 
described in the MERN’s online publication “Mining Leases and Concessions”. 
 
Non-Exclusive Lease for the Mining of Surface Mineral Substances 
 
According to section 109 of the Mining Act, “a lessee or a grantee may use, for their 
mining  activities,  sand  and  gravel  that  is  part  of  the  domain  of  the  State  except 
where the land that is subject to the lease is already subject to an exclusive lease to 
mine surface mineral substances in favour of a third person”. The mining of sand and 
gravel located outside of mining leases requires a non-exclusive lease for the mining 
of  surface  mineral  substances,  under section  140  of  the  Mining  Act. The  applicant 
must make a request for a non-exclusive lease by completing the form “Application 
for  Non-Exclusive  Lease  (BNE)  for  Mining  Surface  Mineral  Substances”  and 
providing the documents identified in section 3 of the form. 
 
Lease for the Occupation of the Domain of the State 
 
Under  section  239  of  the  Mining  Act,  “the  holder  of  mining  rights  or  the  owner  of 
mineral  substances  may,  in  accordance  with  the  Act  respecting  the  lands  in  the 
domain of the State (chapter T-8.1), obtain that public lands be transferred or leased 
to  him  to  establish  a  storage  site  for  tailings,  or  a  site  for  mills,  shops  or  facilities 
necessary for mining activities”. Several components of the Duparquet Project might 
be located outside of the lands covered by the mining lease. Since a portion of the 
Duparquet  Project  is  located  on  public  lands,  the  land  in  question  will  need  to  be 
leased under section 47 of the Act respecting the Lands in the Domain of the State.
20.2.5.6
Rehabilitation of the historical Beattie gold mine site
As  depicted  in  Section  6  of  this  Report,  infrastructure  associated  with  the  historic 
Beattie Gold Mine site will have to be dismantled. The former operator of this mine, 
Beattie  Gold  Mines  Limited,  was  set  up  in  1932.  Production  started  in  1933  and 
operations ended in 1956, after 23 years of almost continuous production. Except for 
a  small  surface  exploration  program  in  1966,  the  property  remained  dormant  from 
1956  to  1987.  From  1987  until  2007,  several  mining  and  exploration  companies, 
such  as  SOQUEM,  Cambior,  Forbex  Mining  Resources,  Beattie  Gold  Mine,  and
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

Fieldex  Inc,  conducted  drilling  on  the  Beattie,  Donchester,  Central  Duparquet  and 
Dumico  properties.  From  2007  until  today,  the  exploration  of  the  Beattie  and 
Donchester  properties  was  accelerated  in  order  to  gather  enough  information  to 
conduct the present NI 43-101. 
 
The  environmental  characterization  work  completed  in  2012  by  Stavibel  for  the 
demolition  of  the  on-site  infrastructure  indicates  and  confirms  the  presence  of 
hazardous  materials  and  materials  contaminated  by  hazardous  materials.  These 
materials will have to be managed during demolition to limit their impact on human 
health, flora and fauna, and the environment. Demolition work will have to be carried 
out methodically, in stages, so that proper material segregation can be maintained. A 
demolition  specification  (technical  specifications)  with  a  demolition  material 
management  plan  (dismantling  plan)  will  have  to  be  prepared  for  this  purpose  to 
guide  the  contractor  during  the  demolition  work.  It  is  recommended  that  the  main 
Roaster  and  Cottrell  buildings  and  the  ore  conveyor  building  be  demolished 
mechanically.  The  preliminary  risk  assessment  associated  with  demolishing  the 
stack  recommended  demolition  by  blasting.  The  waste  and  debris  from  the  stack 
demolition  will  subsequently  be  sorted  on  the  ground  and  then  managed, 
characterized,  and  disposed  of  in  an  authorized  facility.  It  is  recommended  that 
Clifton Star perform an exhaustive stack demolition risk and feasibility study before 
proceeding  with  any  demolition  work.  Different  options  will  have  to  be  analyzed, 
taking  into  account  the  risks  and  costs  associated  with  the  demolition  of  this 
infrastructure. 
 
Regulation Respecting Hazardous Materials 
 
Activities such as dismantling, temporary storage, treatment and/or cleaning, reuse, 
recycling  and  revalorization  as  well  as  disposal  and  transport  will  all  need  specific 
permits, mostly to be issued under the Regulation respecting hazardous materials, 
but also in compliance with the EQA and the Regulation regarding the landfilling and 
incineration of residual materials.  
 
Federal Permitting 
Authorization to Alter Fish Habitat 
 
Section 35 of the Fisheries Act specifies that: 
 
(1)  No  person  shall  carry  on  any  work,  undertaking  or  activity  that  results  in  the 
harmful alteration or disruption, or the destruction, of fish habitat. 
(2)  A  person  may  carry  on  a  work,  undertaking  or  activity  without  contravening 
subsection (1) if: 
(a) the work, undertaking or activity is a prescribed work, undertaking or activity, or is 
carried  on  in  or  around  prescribed  Canadian  fisheries  waters,  and  the  work, 
undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the prescribed conditions; 
(b) the carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by the Minister 
and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the conditions 
established by the Minister; 
(c) the carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by a prescribed 
person or entity and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with 
the prescribed conditions;
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
281
www.innovexplo.com
(d) the harmful alteration or disruption, or the destruction, of fish habitat is produced 
as  a  result  of  doing  anything  that  is  authorized,  otherwise  permitted  or  required 
under this Act; or 
(e) the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the regulations. 
 
When a project includes a known risk of affecting fish and fish habitat, such a project 
must  be  submitted  to  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada  (DFO)  for  its  review.  The 
general  process  that  must  be  followed  is  described  on  the  DFO  website.  The 
“Proponent’s Guide to Information Requirements for Review under the Fish Habitat 
Protection Provisions of the Fisheries Act” identifies the information requirements for 
a detailed review by DFO. In order for a project to be reviewed, the proponent must 
have  previously  completed  the  form  “Request  for  Review  under  the  Fish  Habitat 
Protection  Provisions  of  the  Fisheries  Act”.  The  request  must  be  submitted  to  the 
local Fish Habitat Management Office. 
 
There are three possible outcomes following a DFO review:
•  Mitigation measures (included in the project design or proposed by DFO are 
sufficient to avoid or mitigate the negative impacts to fish and fish habitat – 
DFO issues a “Letter of Advice”;
•  The residual damage to the fish habitat cannot be avoided, but is considered 
to  be  acceptable  –  an  authorization  for  a  harmful  alteration,  disruption  or 
destruction  of  fish  habitat  (HADD)  and  a  compensation  for  fish  habitat  loss 
are required;
•  The  project  will  have  unacceptable  impacts  on  fish  and  fish  habitat  –  the
project cannot proceed as designed.
The  Ministry  will  issue  in  most  cases  an  authorization  if  the  compensation  plan 
results in no net loss of fish habitat. The Duparquet Project is expected to require an 
authorization for HADD and a compensation for the loss of habitat.  
 
Clifton  Star  will  have  to  establish  an  Environmental  Effects  Monitoring  Program 
(EEMP).  This  is  a  requirement  for  regulated  mines  in  accordance  with  the  Metal 
Mining  Effluent  Regulations  (MMER)  under  the  authority  of  the  Fisheries  Act.  The 
objective of the EEMP is to evaluate the effects of mine effluents on fish, fish habitat 
and  the  use  of fisheries  resources  by  humans. Directive  019  sets  at the  provincial 
level the criteria that mine effluents must comply with at the end-of-pipe. The EEMP 
examines the effectiveness of the environmental protection measures directly in the 
aquatic  ecosystems,  i.e.  downstream  of  the  final  discharge  point.  The  EEMP 
consists of biological monitoring and effluent and water quality monitoring as follows:
•  Effects  on  fish  are  assessed  through  comparison  of  adult  fish  exposed  to
effluent with unexposed fish;
•  Effects  on  fish  habitat  are  assessed  through  a  comparison  on  benthic
invertebrate communities from areas exposed and unexposed to effluent;
•  Effects  on  the  use  of  fisheries  resources  are  assessed  by  comparing  the 
designated contaminants (i.e., mercury for metal mines) in fish tissue against 
health guidelines for fish consumption.

Moreover,  the  effluent  quality  is  monitored  through  sub-lethal  toxicity  testing.  For 
metal  mines,  an  effluent  characterization  and  water  quality  monitoring  studies  are 
also required. 
 
The requirement of an EEMP is to be reviewed as more information is collected and 
when a better assessment of the impact of effluents on the aquatic environment is 
available. 
 
Licence for Explosives Factories and Magazines 
 
Under section 7(1) a) of the federal Explosives Act, a licence issued by the Minister 
of Natural Resources Canada is required for the operation of explosives plants and 
magazines in Canada. 
 
It is reported that there will be no explosives plant on site. Also, according to section 
2 of the same Act, the term “magazine” excludes: 
 
“a place where an explosive is kept or stored exclusively for use at or in a mine or 
quarry  in  a  province  in  which  provision  is  made  by  the  law  of  that  province  for 
efficient inspection and control of explosives”. 
 
In  Québec,  the  Act  respecting  Explosives  provides  for  the  issuing  of  permits,  the 
inspection and the control of activities associated with explosives (see section 1.4.4 
of the Act: Explosives permit). 
 
Thus, no licence for explosives should be required from Natural Resources Canada. 
If  modifications  were  to  be  implemented  to the  Project  so  that  it  would  require  the 
operation  of  an  explosives  plant  or  magazine,  such  license  would  be  necessary. 
However,  obtaining  it  would  not  have  any  impact  on  the  permitting  schedule  after 
consideration of the recent modifications applied to the CEAA 2012.  
 
Appendix 2 of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations 
 
Project design was done in a  way that, most likely, no fish habitats will  be directly 
impacted  by  the  implementation  of  any  accumulation  areas.  Consequently,  those 
infrastructures will not have to be listed in Appendix 2 of the MMER.  
 
The use of a natural waterbody considered as a fish habitat to store mine residues 
indeed requires a modification to the MMER which was adopted in compliance with 
sections 34(2), 36(5) and 38(9) of the Fisheries Act in order to control mine effluent 
discharge and the implementation of tailings and waste rock management facilities in 
fish-bearing waterbodies.  
 
Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Plan 
Section 232.1 of the Mining Act states that: 
The  following  must  submit  a  rehabilitation  and  restoration  plan  to  the  Minister  for 
approval and must carry out the work provided for in the plan:
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
283
www.innovexplo.com
(1)  every  holder  of  mining  rights  who  engages  in  exploration  work  determined  by 
regulation or agrees that such work be carried out on the land subject to his mining 
rights; 
 (2)  every  operator  who  engages  in  mining  operations  determined  by  regulation  in 
respect of mineral substances listed in the regulations; 
 (3) every person who operates a concentration plant in respect of such substances; 
 (4)  every  person  who  engages  in  mining  operations  determined  by  regulation  in 
respect of tailings. 
 
The obligation shall subsist until the work is completed or until a certificate is issued 
by the Minister under section 232.10. 
 
As  stated  in  section  101,  “the  [mining]  lease  cannot  be  granted  before  the 
rehabilitation and restoration plan is approved in accordance with this Act, and the 
CA mentioned in section 22, 31.5, 164 or 201 of the EQA (chapter Q-2) has been 
issued.”  
 
Hence,  a  rehabilitation  plan  will  have  to  be  prepared  as  part  of  the  project  and 
approved by the MERN. The rehabilitation and restoration plan should be elaborated 
in  accordance  with 
for  Preparing  a  Mining  Site 
Rehabilitation  Plan  and  General  Mining  Site  Rehabilitation  Requirements  (1997) 
which  provides  to  the  proponents  the  rehabilitation  requirements.  This  study 
accounts for costs of all works needed for the rehabilitation of a mining site following 
the  Regulation  respecting  Mineral  Substances  other  than  Petroleum,  Natural  Gas 
and Brine.
the  provincial  Guidelines
20.2.6.1
General Principles
The main objective of mine site rehabilitation is to restore the site to a satisfactory 
condition by:
•  Eliminating unacceptable health hazards and ensuring the public safety; 
•  Limiting the production and circulation of substances that could damage the 
receiving  environment  and  trying  to  eliminate  long-term  maintenance  and 
monitoring;
•  Restoring  the  site  to  a  condition  which  is  visually  acceptable  to  the
community;
•  Reclaiming  the  areas  where  the  infrastructures  are  located  (excluding  the
accumulation areas) for future use.
Specific objectives are to:
•  Restore degraded environmental resources and land uses;  
•  Protect important ecosystems and habitats of rare and endangered flora and
fauna, which favors the re-establishment of biodiversity;
•  Prevent or minimize future environmental damage;  
•  Enhance the quality of specific environmental resources; 
•
Improve the capacity of eligible organizations to protect, restore and enhance 
the environment; and
•  Undertake  resource  recovery  and  waste  avoidance  projects  and  prevent
and/or reduce pollution.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
284
The general guidelines of a rehabilitation plan include:
www.innovexplo.com
•  Favouring  a  progressive  restoration  to  allow  for  a  rapid  re-establishment  of
biodiversity; 
Implementing a monitoring and surveillance program;
• 
•  Maximizing recovery of previous land uses; 
•  Establishing new land uses; 
•  Promoting habitat rehabilitation using operational environmental criteria; 
•  Ensuring sustainability of restoration efforts.
The mine site rehabilitation plan focuses on land reclamation, reclamation of tailings 
area and water basins, and of surface drainage to prevent erosion. The successful 
completion of a rehabilitation plan will ensure that the project will result in a minimum 
of disturbance. Site inspections will be carried out before the property is returned to 
the Government. 
 
The  rehabilitation  concept  for  the  current  project  is  described  below  and  complies 
with  the  requirements  described  in  the  Guidelines  for  Preparing  a  Mining  Site 
Rehabilitation  Plan  and  General  Mining  Site  Rehabilitation  Requirements  and  the 
current legislation.
The rehabilitation and restoration plan concept is summarized as follows:
•  Tailings Accumulation Cells and Waste Rock Piles
o  Exposed surfaces of the accumulation areas (tailings accumulation cells, 
waste  rock  and  overburden  piles)  will  be  covered  with  a  layer  of  top 
soil/overburden and revegetated when feasible.
•  Haul Roads
o  Surface will be scarified and revegetated.
20.2.6.2
Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan Concept
•
Industrial Complex and Buildings 
o  No building will be left in place. Whenever possible, buildings will be sold 
with 
they  contain,  completely  or  partially.  During 
dismantling works, beneficiation/recycling of construction material will be 
maximized. Remaining waste will be disposed of in an appropriate site.
the  equipment
o  All equipment and machinery will be disposed of or recycled off-site.  
o  The explosives magazine, if any, and related facilities will be dismantled. 
o  The  drinking  water  supply  and  domestic  wastewater  treatment  facilities
o
will be dismantled. 
Infrastructure  relating  to  electricity  supply  and  distribution  will  be 
dismantled with the exception of Hydro-Québec requirements.
All underground services (power lines, pipelines, water and sewer pipes, etc.) shall 
remain  in  place  since  they  are  unlikely  to  cause  any  environmental  damage. 
Openings and access to such pipelines, however, shall be sealed.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

Open Pit 
 
The surface exploitation of a mineral substance is common in Québec. Many open 
pits  that  are  created  to  extract  a  mineral  substance  or  ore  are  therefore  found 
throughout  the  province.  Unlike  quarries  that  are  essentially  developed  on  rock 
outcrops, ore deposits can be located below the surface, which means pits could be 
filled with groundwater. In many open pit mines, water could rise to the overburden 
contact without the dewatering wells.  
 
Once mining activities cease, the pit will gradually fill up to its equilibrium level with 
rainfall and groundwater. The overburden slope around the pit will have already been 
established for a safe operation of the mine. No special work in this regard will be 
required upon the cessation of mining activities. 
 
To permanently close pit access roads, an embankment 2 m high will be built using 
waste rock, along with an equivalent crest line. A ditch 2 m wide and 1 m deep will 
be excavated in front of the embankment. 
 
Environmental Aspects
•  Drainage
o  Whenever  possible,  the  surface  water  drainage  pattern  will  be  re-
established to a condition similar to the original hydrological system.
•  Topsoil Management
o  During  the  site  construction  period  and  overburden  stripping  over  the 
orebody,  overburden  and  topsoil  will  be  stored  separately  and  used for 
revegetation  purposes.  Slopes  of  the  overburden  storage  area  and  flat 
surfaces will ultimately be seeded and revegetated.
•  Waste Management
o  Waste material from demolition activities will be:
-  Decontaminated when required;  
-  Recycled when cost-effective; 
-  Buried in an appropriate site.
o  All non-contaminated waste will be sent to an appropriate site.
•  Hazardous Materials
o  Facilities  containing  petroleum  products,  chemicals,  solid  waste, 
hazardous  waste,  and/or  contaminated  soil  or  materials  will  be 
dismantled and managed according to regulatory requirements.
o  All  hazardous  waste  will  be  managed  according  to  existing  laws  and
regulations and will be transported off site.
•  Characterization Study
The Land Protection and Rehabilitation Regulation, which came into force on March 
27, 2003, contains several provisions concerning land protection in the new section 
IV.2.1  of  the  EQA. The term  “land”  also  includes  groundwater  and  surface  waters. 
The  Regulation  sets  limit  values  for  a  range  of  contaminants,  and  specifies  the
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
286
www.innovexplo.com
industry,
the  mining
categories of targeted commercial or industrial activities. The mining industry is one 
of the categories subject to the Regulation. 
 
For 
this  generally  entails  an  undertaking  of  a  site 
characterization  study  within  6  months  following  the  termination  of  the  mine 
operations. In cases where the contamination were to exceed the criteria set for in 
the  Regulation,  a  rehabilitation  plan  which  would  specify  the  environmental 
protection  measures  to be  undertaken  must  be  submitted  to  the  MDDELCC  for  its 
approval. 
 
Waste rocks and mine tailings are not soils and are not covered by this Regulation. 
The  characterization  study  will  address  the  areas  that  are  likely  to  have  been 
contaminated by human activities, specifically the handling of petroleum products.
20.2.6.3
Monitoring Program and Post-Closure Monitoring
According to Directive 019 for the mining industry, a Monitoring Program will have to 
be  implemented  during  the  mine  operation  to  account  for  all  the  requirements 
specified in that Directive, especially with regards to noise levels, vibrations, surface 
and ground waters.  
 
Physical Stability 
 
The physical stability of the tailings dams and of the waste rock piles will need to be 
assessed, and signs of erosion will be noted. This monitoring will be conducted on 
an annual basis for a minimum of five years following mine closure. 
 
Environmental Monitoring 
 
Monitoring  of  the  water  quality  (surface  and  groundwater)  will  continue  for  a 
minimum of five years after the completion of the restoration work.  
 
Agronomic Monitoring 
 
The  agronomic  monitoring  program  is  designed  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the 
revegetation which will be done as part of mining rehabilitation efforts. 
To document the success of the revegetation efforts over the waste dumps areas, an 
agronomic monitoring will be undertaken following the establishment of a vegetative 
cover on the areas subject to the progressive restoration program. This monitoring 
will  be  conducted  annually  for  three  years  following  the  revegetation  efforts. 
Reseeding  will  be  carried  out,  as  required,  in  areas  where  revegetation  is  found 
unsatisfactory.

Assumptions 
Rainfall and Evapotranspiration 
 
Weather  data  from  the  Kinojevis  River  Station,  near  Rouyn-Noranda,  was  used  to 
estimate rainfall and snowfall in the area. The annual average rainfall is estimated at 
648 mm while snowfall is 235 cm annually. Total precipitation is therefore annually 
estimated  at  883  mm  on  average.  Evapotranspiration  rates  were  used  considering 
land  types  (tailings,  waste  rock,  open  pit,  etc.;  Table  20.8).  Those  rates  were 
determined  following  numerical  simulations  performed  for  a  different  mine  project 
located in a region with similar weather conditions.  
 
Pit Dewatering 
 
A preliminary estimate of the water inflow to mine pits was made despite the lack of 
available  information  on  the  hydrogeological  properties  of  the  sector.  The  water 
inflow  during  dewatering  was  calculated  using  the  simple  analytical  equations  by 
Marinelli and Niccoli (2000). The Marinelli and Niccoli (2000) method is divided into 
two  parts  where  Q1  represents  the  inflow  from  the  pit  walls  and  Q2  is  the  flow 
through the pit bottom and is calculated by the following analytical equations:
eq 1: Q1 = Wπ (ro2 – rp2)  
eq 2: Q2 = 4rp (Kh/m2)(ho-d)
Where:
W = recharge flux 
rp = effective pit radius 
ro = radius of influence (maximum extent of the cone of depression) 
Kh = horizontal hydraulic conductivity 
Kv = vertical hydraulic conductivity 
m = anisotropy parameter 
d = depth of pit lake 
ho = initial saturated thickness above the base of the pit
In this method, the pit is treated as a well, and the long‐term pumping is considered 
as  steady  state  discharge. The  estimation  was made for  the  last  year of  operation 
when each pit will be at their maximum depth.
•  Assumptions associated with this method include: 
•  Pit walls are considered as if they were forming a right circular cylinder; 
•  Water table is approximately horizontal; 
•  Recharge is uniformly distributed across the influenced area; 
•  All recharge within the influenced area of the pit is assumed to be captured
by the pit; and
•  Ground water flow towards the pit is axially symmetric.

identified
In 2013, Stavibel carried out four (4) pumping tests in monitoring wells located in the 
vicinity  of  the  project  and  installed  in  the  top  part  of  the  bedrock.  The  measured 
hydraulic  conductivity  values  range  from  1.1x10-8  to  8.1x10-7  m/s.  The  geometric 
mean value of 8.3x10-8 m/s was selected in order to calculate the inflow in the pits. 
This  value  is  consistent  with  the  theoretical  values  for  fractured  rock  between 
4.3x10-5  m/s  and  5.0x10-9  m/s  as 
the  Abitibi-Témiscamingue 
Groundwater Knowledge Acquisition Program (Projet d’acquisition de connaissances 
sur  les  eaux  souterraines  [PACES];  Cloutier  et  al.,  2013).  For  this  preliminary 
estimation,  the  inflow  of  water  has  been  calculated  for  the  three  main  pits  of  the 
Project,  i.e.  Beattie,  Donchester  and  Central  Duparquet.  The  initial  hydraulic  head 
was estimated from data collected by Stavibel (2013) in monitoring wells installed in 
the  rock  aquifer  and 
the  recharge  rate  (W)  was  estimated  from  regional 
meteorological  information.  According  to  Marinelli  and  Niccoli  (2000),  the  inflow  to 
the pits are maximized when the seepage face depth at the pit walls is set to 0. This 
will  be  the  case  where  mine  dewatering  is  active  since  mining  will  be  done  in  dry 
conditions. This will also act as a safety for determining the maximum possible inflow 
to the mine. Table 20.9 shows data that were used for the preliminary estimation of 
water inflow for each pit.

Based on these data, the total inflow rate of groundwater is estimated to be 1,400 
m3/d for the Beattie pit, 890 m3/d for Donchester and 250 m3/d for Central Duparquet 
(Table 20.8).  
 
Note  that  the  current  estimation  is  based  on  geometric  mean  value  of  hydraulic 
conductivity measured in the surface of the bedrock. The Marinelli and Niccoli (2000) 
method  is  sensitive  to  the  hydraulic  conductivity  value;  therefore,  hydraulic 
conductivity values in the entire thickness of the aquifer should be investigated in a 
future phase of the Project. In addition, in situ hydrogeological values should be used 
in the future in order to confirm water inflow by numerical modelling. This estimate 
provides (within an order of magnitude) the potential daily flow that will need to be 
pumped  in  order  to  dewater  the  pits.  Since  these  values  are  estimated  from 
theoretical data and a simplified model, it must under no circumstances be used for 
design purposes.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

20.3.3
www.innovexplo.com
As part of the future steps of the Duparquet Project, a comprehensive hydrogeology 
assessment  will  have  to  be  completed  in  order  to  adequately  estimate  the 
groundwater input in the water balance. Such assessment will include, among other 
things, mathematical modelling of the successive mine operation phases to estimate 
the daily flow rate required to keep the pit dry. 
 
Tailings Interstitial Water Content 
 
According  to  the  mining  plan  for  the  Duparquet  Project,  a  maximum  of  3.65  Mt  of 
tailings will be generated annually and sent to the TSF for disposal. Considering that, 
based on data depicted in Section 17 of this Report, solid content of flotation tailings 
is 49.8% (w/w) and of POX tailings is 13% (w/w), it is considered that 13,576 m³/d of 
water is associated with those tailings. However, based on data collected as part of 
another  gold  project  located  in  the  same  region  and  using  similar  ore  processing 
methods,  it  was  calculated  that  tailings  water  content  (interstitial  water),  once 
disposed in the TSF, typically is about 50%; that is, for every dry m3 of tailings there 
is  0.5  m3  of  water  that  stays  in  the  TSF  (“within”  the  tailings  themselves)  and  this 
quantity must not be considered as part of the final effluent. Based on a mining rate 
of 10,000 tpd, this corresponds to about 3,732 m3/d (Figure 20.4). 
 
Preliminary Water Management Plan 
The Property is mostly flat and badly drained (clayey to silty soils). However, in some 
areas, the land is hillier with elevation ranging from 270 masl near Lake Duparquet to 
365  masl  at  the  top  of  the  highest  hill  in  the  easternmost  section  of  the  Property. 
Such hilly sections are also associated with better-drained surface deposits such as 
sand and/or sandy silt.  
 
All  mine  infrastructure  components  are  located  within  only  one  watershed,  namely 
Lake  Duparquet.  Furthermore,  almost  90%  of  all  areas  to  be  impacted  by  the 
implementation  of  the  proposed  infrastructure  are  located  within  a  single  sub-
watershed,  namely  Creek  #1,  which  drains  all  water  coming  from  the  eastern-, 
northern- and westernmost sections of the Property.  
 
A small portion of the proposed tailing storage facility (TSF) is located outside that 
area, as well as the TSF Polishing Ponds, but all waters coming out of those facilities 
will  be  managed  in  such  a  way  that  it  will  be  discharged  with  the final  effluent (as 
defined by Québec’s Directive 019 issued by the MDDELCC) in Creek #1. No water 
discharge is located outside that sub-watershed, and consequently, once treated to 
comply with both provincial and federal requirements, the final effluent will end up in 
Lake Duparquet as it is the case prior to site implementation.  
 
Water from the TSF  Polishing  Pond  will  be  recirculated  to the  mill.  Make-up  water 
required at the mill is estimated at 13,288 m3/d (Figure 20.4). In order to guarantee 
that  input  during  the  first  years  of  mill  operation,  the  first  construction  phase  will 
include  the  implementation  of  the  Process  Water  Pond  (or  Main  Storage  Water 
Ponds; 280,000 m3), i.e. prior to production at the mine so that enough water can be 
accumulated for use as process water. An additional input of 159 m3/d of fresh water 
will also be required.

in  Directive  019  consist  of  maximum
All  water  accumulated  in  the  TSF  Polishing  Ponds  that  will  not  have  been 
recirculated (reclaimed) to the mill will be discharged with the final effluent following 
treatment. 
 
All  surface  water  on  the  process  facilities  (mill  and  office)  pad  will  be  managed 
(Table 20.8; Figure 20.4). The surface water will flow to the peripheral drainage ditch 
which  will  discharge  at  the  lowest  point  to  be  transfer  to  the  treatment  pond  (TSF 
Pond). A segregation ditch will also be made to separate naturally flowing water and 
surface  water  that  needs  to  be  treated.  The  same  management  procedure  will  be 
applied to the adjacent ore stockpile. Mine water will be pumped to the TSF.  
 
According to Directive 019, only one final effluent is to be considered (at 0.09 m3/s or 
8,079 m3/d; Table 20.8; Figure 20.4). According to Directive 019, a final  effluent is 
defined as an effluent which needs no further treatment before being discharged to 
the  receiving  environment  in  full  compliance  with  all  applicable  guidelines  and/or 
criteria.  Equipment  will  be  implemented  to  measure  pH  and  flow.  Also,  the  final 
effluent will be monitored as specified in Directive 019. The final effluent discharge 
criteria  prescribed 
limit  values.  The 
environmental discharge objectives (EDO) to be imposed by the MDDELCC may be 
more  stringent  than  those  specified  under  Directive  019  and  the  Metal  Mining 
Effluent Regulations (MMER). The EDOs will be based on water volumes discharged 
as  well  as  water  quality,  the  minimum  annual  flow,  and  usages  of  the  receiving 
aquatic environment (Creek #1 and, downstream, Lake Duparquet). 
 
Additional  hydrological  data  will  be  collected  in  2014  to  adequately  assess  any 
potential  impact  of  effluent  discharge  on  Creek  #1  and  Lake  Duparquet  and  to 
develop  relevant  mitigation  measures  (erosion  control,  habitat  enhancement,  etc.). 
Such  measures  (ex.  artificial  wetlands,  riprap,  etc.)  are  already  expected  to  be 
required immediately downstream of the final effluent discharge point and along the 
section  running  towards  Lake  Duparquet,  immediately  west  of  the  existing  Beattie 
tailings management area and south of provincial highway Route 388.  
 
Four other water discharges were also considered: one at the overburden stockpile 
and one at each of the three waste rock stockpiles (Table 20.8). Since overburden is 
not  considered  as  mining  residue  and  waste  rock  is  classified  as  “low  risk”,  in 
accordance  with  Directive  019,  waters  running  off  those  piles  will  be  collected  by 
ditches  towards  a  settling  pond  prior  to  discharge  in  the  adjacent  receiving 
environment. Provincial  and federal best-practice measures will be  implemented to 
adequately  manage  such  discharge  and  limit  any  potential  impact  on  downstream 
aquatic environments.  
 
Final Effluent Water Treatment 
A 300-000 m3 polishing pond will be installed at the end of the Flotation TSF in order 
to  control  for  TSS  content  (adequate  retention  time)  and  ensure  compliance  with 
provincial and federal guidelines/criteria.  
 
A water treatment unit will be implemented at the end of the POX TSF to make sure 
its effluent comply with all applicable guidelines/criteria. However, it should be noted 
that  both  effluents  (Flotation  and  POX)  will  be  combined  before  discharge  as  one 
final  effluent  as  per  Directive  019  definition.  To  do  so,  a  25,000-m3  pond  will  be
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
293
20.4

installed at the end of the POX TSF to enable pumping of water to the Flotation TSF 
Polishing Pond. The final effluent will come out of the Flotation TSF Polishing Pond.  
 
As described in Section 20.1.2 of this Report, flotation tailings are classified as not 
potentially  acid-generating,  not  cyanide-containing  and  not  leachable.  Other  than 
TSS content, which is to be controlled using a polishing pond, no other treatment is 
required for the Flotation TSF. 
 
Since  no  kinetic  test  has  yet  been  performed  on  POX  tailings  to  refine  the 
characterization of the POX TSF effluent, a CAPEX provision of $1M was considered 
for that treatment unit (including building and power) and an OPEX of $200,000 per 
year for the use of chemicals was also considered. POX tailings are considered as 
potentially  acid-generating,  cyanide-containing  and  not  leachable  (see  Section 
20.1.2 of this Report). The discharge rate at the end of the POX TSF is expected to 
be lower than 300 m3/d.  
 
The effluent of the Flotation TSF Polishing Pond is to be considered as the only final 
effluent  according  to  Directive  019.  The  final  effluent  will  comply  with  all  provincial 
(Directive 019) and federal (CCME, MMER) criteria/guidelines 
 
Relations with Stakeholders 
The  Town  of  Duparquet  and  two  aboriginal  communities,  Abitibiwinni  First  Nation 
(Pikogan) in Québec and Wahgoshig First Nation in Ontario, have been identified as 
communities  of  interest.  A  socio-economic  profile  of  these  communities  was 
completed by Roche in 2013. It addressed the following topics:
•  The socioeconomic environment of Duparquet and the Abitibi-Ouest Regional
County Municipality (RCM);
•  The  socioeconomic  environment  of  the  Abitibiwinni  First  Nation  and  of  the
Wahgoshig First Nation;
•  Land-use planning; 
•  Land use by non-aboriginals; 
•  Land use by the Abitibiwinni First Nation and by the Wahgoshig First Nation 
•  Archaeological potential study; 
•  Recreational activities; 
•  Transport, energy-related, community and institutional infrastructure; 
•  Public services.
First Nations 
The First Nation located the closest to the Duparquet Project area is the Algonquin 
Nation, which includes eleven communities among which two are in Ontario and nine 
in Québec. Six of those communities – Abitibiwinni, Eagle Village, Kitcisakik, Kitigan 
Zibi,  Lac-Simon,  Long  Point  and  Wahgoshig  –  have  joined  to  form  the  Algonquin 
Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council, thus encompassing about 75% of all Algonquins. 
The  Abitibiwinni 
(Abitibi  70,  Ontario) 
communities are considered as stakeholders for the Duparquet Project. In February 
2013, those two communities signed an agreement which involves working together 
towards a common approach with regards to their rights, interests and land claims.
(Pikogan,  Québec)  and  Wahgoshig
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

20.4.2
www.innovexplo.com
The  Algonquin  Anishinabeg  Nation  officially  has  no  specific  or  general  land  claim 
registered  with  Aboriginal  Affairs  and  Northern  Development  Canada.  However,  in 
2011,  it  has  publicly  claimed  a  large  part  of  lands  which  encompasses  sections of 
both Québec and Ontario (about 650,000 km2, from Sault-Ste-Marie to Trois-Rivières 
and from just south of James Bay to the St-Lawrence River). Consequently, Clifton 
Star has initiated communication with Québec’s Secretariat aux affaires autochtones 
in order to better define how to communicate and engage with the tribal council and 
communities (Pikogan being the closest community to Duparquet, in the province of 
Québec).  
 
It should also be noted that the Pikogan and Lac-Simon communities have entered 
into a special agreement with the provincial governement called “Entente de principe 
sur  la  consultation  et  l'accommodement  entre  le  gouvernement  du  Québec  et  le 
Conseil de la Première Nation Abitibiwinni et le Conseil de la Nation Anishinabe de 
Lac-Simon”.  
 
Although  Algonquin  communities  in  Québec  have  not  signed  any  federal  or 
provincial  agreement  or  treaty,  all  three  communities  –  Pikogan,  Lac-Simon  and 
Wahgoshig  –  have  recently  signed  agreements  with  mining  companies  (Canada 
Lithium  in  2012,  Northern  Gold  Mining  and  Royal  Nickel  in  2013),  therefore 
demonstrating  their  willingness  towards  harmonious  relations  with  the  mining 
industry.  
 
It  should  finally  be  noted  that  an  archaeological  potential  study  was  recently 
completed and confirmed that there are no areas of interest on the Property.  
 
Non-Aboriginal Communities and Governmental Authorities 
Since 2011, Clifton Star representatives have established sustainable relationships 
with  several 
include 
representatives from the Town of Duparquet, the Abitibi-Ouest RCM as well as local 
businesses,  landowners  and  residents.  As  part  of  the  future  steps  of  project 
development, additional stakeholders – among others, the Town of Rouyn-Noranda, 
the  Conférence  régionale  des  Élu(e)s  de  l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue,  the  Conseil 
régional  en  environnement  de  l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue,  Action  boréale  de  l'Abitibi-
Témiscamingue,  the  Organisme  de  bassins  versants  du  Témiscamingue/Abitibi-

the  Société  des  eaux  souterraines  en  Abitibi-Témiscamingue,  the 
Regroupement  d’éducation  populaire  de  l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue,  the  Agence  de 
santé  et  de  services  sociaux  de  l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue,  the  Abitibi  Chamber  of 
Commerce, ComaxAT, the Centre local d’emploi Abitibi-Ouest and the Centre local 
de développement de Rouyn-Noranda – will be contacted to inform them about the 
Project and to gather their concerns.  
 
Finally, Clifton Star representatives have taken part in numerous meetings with the 
Department of Energy and Natural Resources (MERN), of Sustainable Development, 
Environment  and  the  Fight  to  Climate  Change  (MDDELCC)  and  of  Transportation 
(MTQ)  to  discuss  mutual  interests  and  to  ensure  that  all  involved  parties  could  be 
satisfied.  All  parties  are  working  towards  common  objectives,  including  the 
rehabilitation  of  the  historical  Beattie  Gold  Mine  site  as  part  of the  development of 
the Duparquet Project, and have been fully cooperating with Clifton Star.

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
The  PFS  is  based  on  capital  pricing  as  of  the  last  quarter  in  2013.  The  PFS 
considered two possible processing scenarios: Pressure Oxidization (POX) process 
and  Concentrate  production  process.  The  strategy  of  using  the  POX  option 
generated the highest financial return, while the alternative resulted in lower capital 
and lower operating costs. Based on the current results, the POX process is favored 
and was selected as the base case for the PFS.  
 
 
Capital Cost Estimate 
The  pre-production  capital  costs  for  the  POX  option  are  estimated  at  $394  million 
and sustaining capital is estimated at $118 million. The capital costs include various 
added  contingencies  depending  on  the  sector.  In  the  base  case  estimate, 
contingencies and indirect costs total $98.7 million of the pre-production costs and 
represent 26% of the costs. Indirect costs (owner’s costs; engineering, procurement 
and construction management (EPCM); and detailed engineering) of 37% have been 
applied  to  the  process  plant  and  to  other  surface  infrastructure.  The  average 
contingency for all environmental items is 20%.  
 
The total capital expenditure of $512M for the Duparquet Project is broken down into 
five  (5)  cost  components:  mine  production  equipment;  surface  installation  and 
equipment; processing facilities; tailings storage facilities; and environmental (Table 
21.1). 
 
The  tailing  storage  facilities  item  in  the  table  below  includes  the  reclaim  pumping 
station and pipeline.  The remainder of the tailings dam infrastructure is included in 
the environmental pre-production and sustaining costs.

Capitalized Revenue 
During  the  pre-production  period,  it  is  anticipated  that  15,005  ounces  of  gold  and 
4,690  ounces  of  silver  will  be  produced,  providing  revenue  of  $22M.  The  pre-
production revenue was capitalized. 
 
Mine Production Equipment Cost 
The capital expenditure for principal equipment will be financed by partnership with 
the  supplier  with  a  25%  down  payment  upon  receipt  of  the  equipment,  and  the 
remaining  amount  financed  at  4.75%.  The  total  capital  cost  for  the  production 
equipment is $114.2M, as presented in Table 21.2

Surface Installation and Equipment 
The surface installation and equipment cost estimate mainly represents expenses for 
new site infrastructure, such as the mill, garage, office, and principal and secondary 
equipment. No mining costs are included in the capital costs and neither is the cost 
of waste removal to start environmental work in pre-production years PP3 and PP4.

A capital cost estimate for the Duparquet Project has been produced for two options. 
Option  1,  the  Concentrate  option,  consists  of  processing  the  ore  to  produce  a 
flotation concentrate of gold for shipping to a smelter and treating flotation’s tails by 
cyanidation for doré bars production. Option 2, the Pressure Oxidation (POX) option, 
uses flotation,  pressurized  oxidation  and  cyanidation  of the flotation  concentrate to 
produce doré bars on site.  
 
There  is  an  increase  of  $36.4M  in  direct  capital  costs  between  the  Concentrate 
option and the POX option due to the additional processing equipment, building, and 
infrastructure  required for  the  POX  option. This  also  has  an  impact  on  the  indirect 
capital costs, with an increase of $13.7M.

Estimate classification
www.innovexplo.com
The estimate is classified as prefeasibility study level, which is defined by the AACE 
International  (Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Cost  Engineering)  as:  “[...]  a 
comprehensive  study  of  the  viability  of  a  mineral  project  that  has  advanced  to  a 
stage  where  the  mining  method,  in  the  case  of  underground  mining,  or  the  pit 
configuration,  in  the  case  of  an  open  pit,  has  been  established  and  an  effective 
method  of  mineral  processing  has  been  determined,  and  includes  a  financial 
analysis  based  on  reasonable  assumptions  of  technical,  engineering,  legal, 
operating,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  factors  and  the  evaluation  of  other 
relevant  factors  which  are  sufficient  for  a  qualified  person,  acting  reasonably,  to 
determine  if  all  or  part  of  the  mineral  resource  may  be  classified  as  a  mineral 
reserve.”  A  prefeasibility  study  level  cost  estimate  is  the  equivalent  of  the  AACE 
Class 4 cost estimate.  
 
The purpose of this prefeasibility study phase is to prepare a capital cost estimate 
with  an  accuracy  of  ±25%.  In  order  to  obtain  this  level  of  accuracy,  the  following 
have been done:
•  Obtained  the  major  equipment  procurement  cost  based  on  suppliers’
quotations;
•  Obtained all-in construction labour rates from previous mining project studies
and local contractors in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue area; 
the
•  Performed  calculations  of  quantities
to  reflect
latest  engineering
documents issued;
•  Confirmed  unit  prices  based  on  previous  mining  project  studies  and  local
contractor quotes in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue area;

for  all  sub-projects,  area,  disciplines,  and
It  provides  cost 
activities/equipment. 
The main contributors to the Infrastructure and Process Facilities CAPEX are Roche 
and Tenova-Bateman (for the POX option).  
The estimate is divided into direct and indirect costs. The direct cost section of the 
estimate  is  divided  into  sub-projects,  areas,  disciplines,  and  cost  items.  Each  sub-
project is divided into areas representing different physical entities, be it a service, a 
building,  a  process,  etc.  Each  area  is  divided  by  disciplines.  Each  discipline  is 
responsible  for  evaluating  the  scope,  quantities,  and  unit  costs  for  each  activity  or 
equipment required for any given area.  
 
Cost Information 
For each individual cost item, cost data was entered for three categories: material, 
equipment,  and  installation/labour.  Descriptions  of  the  three  categories  are  found 
below.
21.1.10
21.1.10.1
Material
“Material”  includes  all  construction  materials  (concrete,  steel,  piping,  electrical 
cables, etc.) and non-tangible items (earthworks).
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

Equipment
www.innovexplo.com
21.1.10.3
21.1.11
21.1.12
21.1.13
“Equipment” includes mechanical and HVAC equipment, platework as well as freight 
estimation.  
 
Installation/Labour 
All cost related to the man-hours required to install or perform a task is categorized 
as installation/labour. The purpose is to separate the installation cost, especially the 
required man-hours, from the material and equipment items in order to assess how 
many workers will be needed during the construction period. The cost of construction 
equipment (ex: crane) is estimated separately as an indirect cost.  
 
Note 
installation/labour cost is embedded in the material unit costs.  
 
Design Basis - Reference Documents 
The  prefeasibility  study  level  CAPEX  is  based  on  the  engineering  documents 
produced throughout the PFS. The main reference documents include, but are not 
limited to:
for  earthworks  and  concrete,
items,  mostly
that
for  some  cost
the
•  Design criteria; 
•  Equipment list; 
•  Flowsheets, mass & water balance; 
•  Project location & site layout; 
•  General arrangements.
Units of Measure 
International  System  (SI)  units  are  used  throughout  the  estimate.  In  some  cases, 
imperial units might be used (ex: pipe diameter) but are converted to metric. 
 
Currency Base Date and Exchange Rates 
The base date of the cost estimate is November 1, 2013.  
The estimate is expressed in Canadian dollars. 
All duties and taxes are excluded from the capital cost 
For  reference,  the  currency  conversions  rates  used  during  the  preparation  of  the 
estimate were established by Clifton Star:
•  1 CAD = 0.95 USD (American dollar); 
•  1 CAD = 0.74 EUR (Euro); 
•  1 CAD = 0.94 AUD (Australian dollar);
For all materials and installation/labour, the cost information came from local vendors 
and/or  contractors  and  was  expressed  in  Canadian  Dollars  (CAD  or  C$).  Most 
equipment quotations come from North America and are therefore in USD or CAD. 
Some  cost  sources  come  from  Australia  for  the  POX  option  and  have  been 
converted to CAD.

Direct Costs 
Direct costs cover cost that is directly attributable to the cost item and/or activity. It 
covers equipment supply, material costs, and installation costs (labour, contractor’s 
supervision  and  management  costs,  contractors’  travelling  and  living  allowances, 
contractors/suppliers administration and profits).
21.1.14.1
Mechanical - Equipment procurement
Based on the engineering documents produced for the PFS, an equipment list was 
created  for  all  process  equipment  for  both  options  (Concentrate  and  POX). 
Datasheets  were  prepared  in  order  to  request  for  quotations  from  equipment 
suppliers.  All  quotations  received  were  budgetary.  For  minor  equipment,  historical 
data from previous similar projects and factorization of equipment size were used in 
order  to  complete  the  estimate.  Allowances  were  used  in  some  cases  for  small 
equipment  when  historical  data  was  not  available.  The  approximate  breakdown  of 
sourcing  for  the  process  equipment  procurement  is  estimated  as  follows  in  Table 
21.6.

The freight estimate is included in the direct equipment cost and corresponds to 5% 
of the direct equipment purchase cost.
21.1.14.2
Piping
Piping  cost  for  the  process  facilities  is  divided  into  the  crushing  area,  ore  storage 
area  and  process  plant.  The  costs  for  the  crushing  and  ore  storage  areas  are 
estimated  based  on  an  allocation  for  small  piping,  compressed  air,  etc.  Cost  for 
process  plant  piping  is  estimated  with  a  factor  of  around  15%  of  the  total  process 
plant  equipment  cost.  The  cost  of  the  tailings  pipeline  was  estimated  based  on 
historical  data  from  Roche.  Diameter  and  quantities  are  based  on  process  design 
criteria for diameter sizing and site layout for distance and topography calculations. 
The fresh water pipeline is assumed to be made of steel and is heat traced.
21.1.14.3
Electrical and instrumentation
Budget  quotations  from  local  suppliers  were  obtained  for  major  electrical  material. 
Unit prices for sections of MCCs and switchgears were established based on recent 
projects and used as per the electrical distribution design. Cable sizing and lengths 
were estimated based on the PFS general arrangements and were integrated to the 
load  list  to  allow  adequate  estimate  accuracy.  Man-hours  for  installation  of  the 
equipment,  services,  grounding,  cable  trays,  and  cables  were  based  on  similar 
projects and from standard working methods and recognized estimating tools.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
303
www.innovexplo.com
For  the  automation  and  instrumentation,  a  ratio  was  used  to  estimate  the  cost  of 
material and installation.
21.1.14.4
HVAC - Services
The methodology for estimating the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning cost for 
the  process  plant  is  based  on  cost  data  from  previous  similar  projects  located  in 
northern Québec. For the auxiliary buildings, the cost has been estimated based on 
the typical requirement based on the area of the building.
21.1.14.5
Construction labour rates
The  all-in  rate  for  the  Duparquet  Project  is  based  on  recent  similar  projects  in  the 
area.  The  all-in  rate  was  validated  by  consulting  the  Québec  Construction 
Association  (ACQ)  hourly  rate  publication for  January  2013. The  chosen  all-in  rate 
for the PFS CAPEX is an average of $122/hour for all trades. This is based on a 60-
hour  per  week  schedule,  corresponding  to  6  days  a  week  at  10  hours  per  day 
(Monday to Saturday). It involves 40 hours per week at regular rate, and 20 hours 
per week double time.  
 
No productivity factor was included in the all-in labour rates. The productivity factor is 
estimated in the number of man-hours.  
 
No productivity factor has been applied to take into account the local conditions for 
construction work in Abitibi-Témiscamingue region.  
 
No separate productivity factor was used for outside winter work. For this estimate, it 
is assumed that minimal work will take place outside during the worst winter months. 
Winter work usually results in a lower productivity in the range of 75%. 
 
All-in labour rates – Inclusions 
 
The  all-in  construction  labor  rate  includes  mobilization  and  demobilization  of 
contractor’s  personnel,  room  and  board,  living  allowances,  transportation  costs, 
safety  PPE,  contractor’s 
foreman, 
superintendent),  contractor’s  site  supervision  personnel,  head  office  overhead, 
expenses,  insurance,  contractor’s  profit,  consumables,  and  contractor’s  temporary 
facilities.  It  also  includes  the  contractor’s  construction  vehicles,  small  tools  and 
consumables. 
All-in labour rates – Exclusions 
 
Excluded  items  are  estimated  separately  in  the  number  of  man-hours  and  include 
daily pre-start safety meetings, weekly tool box meetings, safety induction sessions, 
special  safety  trainings,  and  other  time  consuming  activities  other  than  real 
installation hours.  
 
Mobilization  and  demobilization  of  specialized  equipment,  office  trailers  and  lunch 
rooms,  crane  rentals,  project  management  complex  and/or  facilities,  construction’s 
guard house and security personnel as well as first aid station are all included in the

NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
306
21.1.15.8
Owner’s Cost
www.innovexplo.com
The owner’s cost is included in the financial analysis. It covers the owner’s incurred 
costs for the pre-production period. Where costs incurred by the owner prior to the 
project approval date are to be capitalized on the project, they are not included in the 
PFS CAPEX estimate but are presented in Section 26.0 – Recommendations.  
 
During  the  pre-production  period,  the  owner’s  construction  team  is  involved  in  all 
aspects of the Project. Items like insurance, permits and certifications, performance 
bonds, taxes & duties, land acquisition, pre-production salaries and benefits, training 
expenses,  consultants,  security,  human  resources,  public  relations,  environmental 
follow-up,  health  &  safety  operations,  etc.  are  all  under  the  owner’s  direct 
responsibility. This involves a team and considerable cost associated with it. Owner’s 
costs  also  include  head  office  support for  legal,  accounting,  engineering  and  other 
related support cost that will be charged under the Duparquet Project by the Clifton 
Star Head Office. Owner’s costs are estimated in the economic analysis in Section 
22 as part of Capitalized Operating Costs in the expense schedule.
21.1.15.9
Mill first load and two years of spare parts (part of working capital)
The  mill  first  load  includes  the  cost  of  the  first  fill  of  reagents’  reservoirs,  grinding 
media, lubricants, etc. Spare parts cost includes the cost of initial inventory of spares 
for the different equipment on site. These items are included in the Working Capital 
presented  in  the  economic  analysis  in  Section  22  of  the  Report.  Therefore,  these 
items are excluded from the Capital Cost estimate.
21.1.16  Contingency
Contingency is an amount of money allowed in an estimate for costs which, based 
on  past  experience,  are  likely  to  be  encountered,  but  are  difficult  or  impossible  to 
identify at the time the estimate is prepared. It is an amount which is expected to be 
expended  during  the  course  of  the  Project.  Contingency  does  not  include  scope 
changes, force majeure, labour strikes/wobbles or labour availability.  
 
Contingency  for  the  PFS  is  divided  into  three  (3)  categories:  direct  costs 
contingency;  construction  indirects  contingency;  and  owner’s  costs  contingency.  A 
contingency  of  15%  has  been  applied  to  the  construction  indirects  and  owner’s 
costs.  
 
The direct costs contingency has been determined based on the level of confidence 
for  different  cost  items  /  areas.  For  example,  earthwork-related  costs  have  mostly 
been  assigned  a  20%  contingency,  since  the  level  of  definition, geotechnical  data, 
etc.  was  limited.  Process  equipment  purchase  costs  coming  from  suppliers’ 
quotations have been assigned a 10% contingency, since the level in confidence in 
the price is greater. Installation, freight, and all other cost items all have been looked 
into to determine an appropriate contingency. The result for direct cost contingencies 
for  the  Concentrate  option  and  POX  option  are  respectively  14.70%  and  14.68%. 
Total  contingencies  for  the  Project’s  Concentrate  option  and  POX  option  are 
respectively 14.75% and 14.73%.  
 
In the POX option, the contingencies and indirect costs total $98.7 million of the pre-
production costs and represent 26% of the costs.

21.2.1 
21.2.1.1
Scope
The  scope  of  the  Operating  Cost  Estimate  (OPEX)  covers  all  costs  related  to  the 
operation  of  the  Duparquet  Project  and  includes  mining,  ore  processing,  tailings 
management, on-site water management, general and administration (G&A) fees, as 
well as infrastructure and services. The scope covers the Duparquet Project’s yearly 
operation for a typical production year of 3.65 Mt of ore milled.
21.2.1.2
Methodology
The methodology used to estimate the operating cost consisted of using data from 
existing similar mining operations and quotations received from local contractors, as 
well  as  consulting  reference  publications.  Roche, 
InnovExplo,  and  Tenova-
Bateman’s  experience  with  estimating  operating  costs  for  mining  projects  also 
contributed to estimating parts of the operating costs when detailed information was 
limited.
21.2.1.3
Basis of estimate
The operating cost estimate for the processing cost is based on tonnage per year for 
a  typical  full  production  year.  Other  costs  have  been  estimated  on  zero-based 
costing and have been built based on the following parameters:

services  include  manpower  salaries  and  the  cost  of  materials  required  for  the 
department.  The  total  technical  services  cost  is  estimated  at  $31.48M.  This  cost 
represents $0.80 per tonne milled.  
 
Processing Operating Costs 
The  processing  operating  costs  include  all  costs  applicable  to  the  operation  of  the 
processing  facilities  and  tailings  storage  facilities.  The  scope  of  the  processing 
operating costs includes all processing activities from the crushing of ore to the gold 
concentrate and/or gold doré products. It is comprised of the processing manpower, 
energy, fresh water, reagents, consumables, as well as other processing costs.  
 
For a typical year at the design processing rate, the operating costs for both options 
of the process plant are summarized in Table 21.10. These are subdivided into the 
following  components:  manpower;  energy  (electrical  power  and  fuel);  fresh  water; 
reagents  and  consumables;  and  other  processing  elements.  These  costs  were 
derived  from  information  provided  by  suppliers  and  from  the  Roche  database,  or 
were factored from similar operations.

A  value  of  $16.63/t  was  used  in  the  POX  option  economic  scenario.  This  value 
includes  an  operating  cost  of  $15.82  as  presented  in  Table  21.10  plus  $0.82/t  for 
general costs related to mill activity. Since the tailings will not need crushing, a cost 
of $12.63/t was considered for that portion of the mineralized material. 
 
The annual operating cost for the POX option is higher than the Concentrate option 
due  to  additional  processing  manpower  required  as  well  as  additional  electrical, 
reagent and consumable consumptions.
21.2.4.1
Processing facilities manpower operating costs
For  the  Concentrate  option,  the  processing  facilities  operations  and  supervision 
group  (72  employees)  is  composed  of  a  mill  superintendent,  metallurgists, 
metallurgical technicians (wet lab), a chief chemist, lab technicians (assay lab), mill 
supervisors, equipment operators as well as a maintenance group. 
 
For  the  POX  option, the  processing facilities  operations  and supervision  group (74 
employees)  is  composed  of  one  (1)  additional  electrician  and  one  (1)  additional 
mechanic to compensate for the additional pieces of equipment.
21.2.4.2
Energy costs
Duparquet  operations  will  be  powered  by  the  following  four  (4)  sources  of  energy: 
electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, and propane. Most fixed equipment will be powered 
by  electricity.  Generators,  most  mobile  equipment  and  the  elution  process  for  the 
POX option will use diesel fuel. Gasoline will be kept for small pick-up trucks, small 
generators,  and  hand  tools.  Propane  will  be  used  for  the  elution  process  for  the 
Concentrate  option.  The  consumption  of  each  energy  source  and  the  basis  for 
operational cost evaluation is described below. Details are shown in Table 21.11.

Electricity consumption  
 
For practical reasons, the electrical power consumption for the entire site is based on 
the  process  plant  load  because  it  typically  represents  95%  of  the  energy 
consumption.  Electricity  consumption  is  based  on  connected  and  running  power 
(kW)  for  the  entire  site.  The  total  electrical  power  requirement  is  based  on  the 
equipment load list, which is derived from the mechanical equipment list. 
 
Based on the electrical load list, the estimated electrical power consumption for the 
Duparquet  Project  is  21,460 kW for the  Concentrate  option  and  27,590 kW for  the 
POX option, both of which are above the 5,000 kW threshold that qualifies for Hydro-
Québec’s “Tarif L” program.  
 
As of April 2013, the “Tarif L” program states that Hydro-Québec charges $12.36 per 
subscribed kilowatt agreed to with Hydro-Québec on a montly basis and 3.04¢ per 
kWh consumed. 
 
Diesel consumption 
 
Diesel cost per litre is established at $0.99/L and corresponds to the cost after tax 
credit/refund  from  the  government  plus  transportation  fee.  Diesel  consumption  for 
mobile  support  equipment  (pick-up  trucks,  small  loader,  etc.)  has  been  estimated 
based on 6 mobile vehicles consuming 50 L/day per piece of equipment for 365 days 
a year. Diesel consumption for fixed equipment (emergency gensets, diesel heaters, 
etc.)  has  been  estimated  at  4,000  L/week.  Diesel  is  used  for  carbon  regeneration 
and melting furnace for the POX option.  
 
Gasoline consumption 
 
Gasoline cost per litre is established at $0.99/L and corresponds to the cost after tax 
credit/refund  from  the  government  plus  transportation  fee.  Gasoline  consumption 
allowance  for  potential  gasoline-powered  pick-up  trucks,  small  generators,  pumps, 
vibrating plates, etc. has been estimated at 1,000L/week.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
313
21.2.4.3
www.innovexplo.com
Propane consumption 
 
Based on supplier’s quotation for the carbon regeneration kiln and melting furnace, 
propane  consumption  is  close  to  21,000  liters  per  year.  Propane  cost  per  litre  is 
estimated at $1.00/L.  
 
Fresh water  
Fresh  water  will  come  from  the  old  underground  mine  located  southeast  of  the 
process facilities  site. The  cost for fresh  water consumption  comes from  Québec’s 
regulation  regarding  the  water  usage  royalty5.  The  rate  is  $0.07/m3  of  fresh  water 
used. Fresh water consumption is estimated at 20 m3/hr. The anticipated annual cost 
for the water royalties is $11,155.
21.2.4.4
Reagents
The annual consumption of reagents has been based on pilot plant and laboratory 
testing done throughout the prefeasibility study. The quantities have been scaled up 
to reflect the full scale process plant mass and water balances. Reagent unit prices 
came from various manufacturers and reflect annual quantities required as well as 
actual market price. Table 21.12 details the cost of reagents.

21.2.10  Manpower operating costs
www.innovexplo.com
A total of 339 employees will be needed for the Duparquet Project. A summary of the 
total  estimated  annual  manpower  is  presented  in  Table  16.11.  Manpower  salaries 
have  been  estimated  based  on  existing  mining  operations 
the  Abitibi-
Témiscamingue area and were benchmarked with the results of the Canadian Mine 
Salaries, Wages and Benefits 2012 Survey6.  
 
The  Duparquet  Project  manpower  work  group  has  been  divided  into  three  (3) 
subgroups: mine employees, process facilities; employees and administration Staff. 
Table  21.21  summarizes  the  manpower  costs  for  both  options.  Two  (2)  additional 
employees are required for the POX option to account for the additional maintenance 
workload resulting from additional pieces of equipment.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
www.innovexplo.com
A pre-tax and after-tax cash flow projection has been generated from the life-of-mine 
(LOM) schedule according to the capital and operating cost estimates. It has been 
made  in  constant  2013  money  terms  and  in  Canadian  currency  unless  stated 
otherwise, with no allowance for inflation or escalation. The net cash flow has been 
discounted  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  the  net  present  value  (NPV).  A  base 
discount  rate  of  5%  per  year  has  been  selected  as  most  likely  to  represent  a  low 
capital  expense  gold  project  in  a  mining-friendly  environment.  Future  annual  cash 
flow  estimates  are  based  on  grade,  gold  recoveries  and  cost  estimates,  as 
previously discussed in this Report. 
 
The  PFS  considered  two  possible  processing  scenarios.  Cash  flow  models  were 
created  for  both  options.  The  strategy  of  using  the  Pressure  Oxidization  (“POX”) 
process generated the highest financial return and, as a result, the POX process is 
favoured in the PFS and presented in this section as the base case of the PFS. 
 
The undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $493.19M over the 11-year mine life and 
the payback period is 4.3 years. 
 
A summary of the base case cash flow model is given in Table 22.1. LOM totals for 
undiscounted  and  discounted  cash flows  are  also  provided. Table  22.1  shows  that 
the pre-tax net present value of the project cash flow at a discount of 5% per year is 
evaluated  at  approximately  $222M  and  a  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return of  15.11%. 
The average cash cost of production equates to US$775/oz gold.

Gold Price Forecast 
The  long-term  price  used  in  this  study  is  US$1300/oz,  at  an  exchange  rate  of  1.1 
CAD/USD.  The  gold  price  has  been  considered  constant  for  the  mine  life  of  the 
Duparquet Pit, which is spread over eleven (11) years. 
 
A selling cost of $3/oz was applied to the revenue. 
 
Silver content 
No mineral estimate was performed to determine the silver content of the Duparquet 
deposit because very few silver assays were available. At the request of Clifton Star, 
InnovExplo  used  a  predetermined  silver  content  to  calculate  the  cash  flow  in  the

current PFS. The value was derived from the 2009 tailings sampling program, and 
the  2013  12  t  composite  bulk  sampling  program  and  the  238  individual  samples, 
representing  the “Master  Holes” for  the  bulk  sampling  program that  were  analysed 
for silver. Details justifying the silver grade considered in the cashflow are presented 
in Section 24.  
 
Royalties 
No royalties affect the Duparquet Project.  
 
Income taxes 
Income  taxes  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  federal  and  provincial  tax 
legislations relating to mining companies. The calculations were estimated by Lucie 
Chouinard  of  Raymond  Chabot.  The  federal  income  tax  rate  is  15%  and  the 
combined provincial income tax rate is 11.9%. 
 
Mining duties 
Québec  mining  duties  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  Bill  55,  which  contains 
amendments to Québec’s Mining Tax Act and received its first reading in the Québec 
legislature  on  November  12,  2013.  Under  the  new  regime  in  the  Mining  Tax  Act, 
mining  operators  in  Québec  will  be  required  to  pay  the  higher  of  a  new  minimum 
mining tax applied to the value of the ore at the mine shaft head and a progressive 
tax on excess profits. The new mining tax is introducing progressive mining tax rates 
ranging  from  16%  to  28%  (replacing  the  single  tax  rate  of  16%),  and  a  minimum 
mining tax based on the mine-mouth output value is used.  
 
The effective rate of this tax on mining profits will start at the existing 16% rate for 
mining companies with a profit margin of 35% or less, but rising to 17.8% for mining 
companies with a profit margin from 35% to 50%, and reaching as high as 22.9% for 
mining companies with a profit margin of more than 50%. The profit margin will be 
calculated on the operator’s mining profit divided by the total of the gross value of 
annual  output  for  all  the  mines  it  operates.  Therefore,  the  higher  a  mining 
corporation’s profit margin, the higher the mining tax. 
 
Working Capital 
No  provision  has  been  made  for  working  capital,  assuming  this  cost  would  be 
covered by financing fees. 
 
Residual Value 
A  residual  value  of  $15.9M  was  integrated  into  the  cashflow  model  based  on  the 
estimated value of major equipment at the end of the mine life. 
 
Financial Guarantee Bond 
In  the  cash  flow  estimation,  it  is  assumed  that  the  closure  cost  will  be  a  secured 
bond. The financial  cost for  the  bond  was  estimated  at  1.5%  per  year  of  the  bond 
cost and was integrated in the cashflow model.

Sensitivity Analysis 
Project risks can be identified in economic and non-economic terms. Key economics 
were examined by running cash flow sensitivities against:
•  Operating cost 
•  Capital cost 
•  Revenue 
•  Gold price, exchange rate, mill grade and mill recovery
Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  the  Project’s  pre-tax  NPV  (5%)  and  IRR, 
revenue, operating cost, and capital cost. Sensitivity calculations were performed on 
the Project’s NPV and IRR, applying a range of variation (± 25%).  
 
While  project  revenues  are  directly  proportional  to  gold  price,  mill  recovery  and 
grade, a sensitivity analysis was only done on gold price.  
 
Sensitivity Analysis Results 
As  illustrated  in  the  figures  below,  the  Duparquet  Project  is  highly  sensitive  to 
changes in gold price. It is moderately sensitive to changes in OPEX and CAPEX. 
 
Results  from  the  sensitivity  on  the  NPV  at  5%  are  presented  in  Table  22.3  and 
illustrated  in  Figure  22.1.  A  10%  reduction  in  gold  price,  which  corresponds  to 
C$1,287/oz, reduces the NPV to $50.07M and drops the IRR from 15% to 8%. 
 
To  generate  an  IRR  of  15%  after-taxes  and  royalties  requires  a  gold  price  of 
$C1,368/oz over the LOM.

ADJACENT PROPERTIES
www.innovexplo.com
the  east-west
trending  deformation  corridor  defined  by
Inc.  and  Geoconseil  Jack  Stoch  Ltée,  (collectively
Duquesne-Ottoman Property (Globex Mining Enterprises Inc.) 
The Duquesne-Ottoman property is located to the east and adjacent to the Central 
Duparquet  claims  of  the  Duparquet  Project  (Fig. 23.1).  The  Duquesne-Ottoman 
property is comprised of 20 claims known as Duquesne West Block and 40 claims, 
known as Ottoman Fault Block (more commonly referred to as Ottoman), and covers 
an area of 928.6 hectares. All claims are held 100% by Duparquet Assets Inc (2012 
MD&A of Xmet from SEDAR website). 
 
On March 5, 2012, Xmet entered into a new Share Option Agreement with Globex 
Mining  Enterprises 
the 
“optionors”),  which  granted  the  Company  an  accelerated  option  to  acquire  either  a 
75% or 100% interest in Duparquet. On July 3, 2013, Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. 
announced by press release that the optioning of 50% interest in the Duquesne West 
property  (Duquesne-Ottoman)  to  Xmet  Inc.  has  been  terminated  due  to  market 
conditions. 
 
The northwest part of the Duquesne-Ottoman property is located along the eastern 
extension  of 
the 
Beattie−Donchester−Central  Duparquet  fault  system.  The  southeast  portion  of  the 
property, which hosts most of the gold showings and zones, appears to be related to 
the  Destor-Porcupine-Manneville  deformation  corridor  or  to  another  east-west 
trending deformation corridor at the south contact of the Duparquet Formation (Fig. 
7.3).  
 
On  September  8,  2011  Xmet  published  the  results  of  a  new  NI  43‐101  compliant 
resource  estimate  for  the  Duquesne‐Ottoman  property.  The  Current  Resource  at 
Duquesne‐Ottoman stands at 853,000 inferred ounces gold uncut at a grade of 6.36 
g/t Au or 727,000 ounces gold at a grade of 5.42 g/t Au applying a gold top cut‐off 
grade  of  30  g/t.  The  resource  estimate  was  carried  out  by  Watts,  Griffis  McOuat 
Limited Consulting Geologists and Engineers of Toronto, Canada (Power-Fardy and 
Breede, 2011).  
 
Brionor Property  
On  May  16,  2012,  Xmet  announced  the  signature  of  a  purchase  agreement  with 
Brionor  Resources  Inc.  to  acquire  twenty‐four  (24)  contiguous  mineral  claims  from 
Brionor (known as the “Pitt Gold Project”), which claims are immediately adjacent to 
the  Duquesne‐Ottoman  Property.  On  April  30,  2013,  Brionor  announced  by  press 
release that the agreement with Xmet Inc. on Pitt Gold Project will not proceed. 
 
As set forth in the technical report entitled “NI 43‐101 Technical Report and Audit of 
the  Preliminary  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  for  the  Pitt  Gold  Project,  Duparquet 
Township,  Abitibi  Region,  Québec,  Canada”  dated  June  10,  2011,  by  William  J. 
Lewis and Alan San Martin of Micon International Limited, the Pitt Gold Project is an 
NI 43‐101 compliant gold resource with 600,000 t at 7.83 g/t equalling 151,000 oz Au 
at the Indicated level, and 476,000 t at 6.91 g/t equalling 106,000 oz at the Inferred 
level.

Duparquet Gold Property (Tres-Or Resources Ltd) 
Tres-Or Resources Ltd owns the Duparquet Gold property, located northeast of the 
Central  Duparquet  property,  and  north  and  adjacent  to  the  Duquesne-Ottoman 
property. According to Tres-Or Resources, the property is believed to host potential 
splay-fault extensions of mineralization associated with the Beattie and Donchester 
past-producing mines (Tres-Or website: http://www.tres-or.com/Québec-Duparquet). 
Tres-Or  Resources  Ltd  has  carried  out  a  magnetic  and  electromagnetic  survey  on 
the property.  
 
East Bay Property (Explor Resources Inc.) 
The  East  Bay  property  is  located  in  the  central  part  of  Duparquet  Township, 
approximately  1  km  west  of  the Town  of  Duparquet,  Québec. The  property  lies  on 
the Porcupine Destor Fault Zone. The mineralization on the property is exposed on 
Beattie Island in Lake Duparquet and is hosted within the Destor tholeiitic unit of the 
Blake River Group (website of Explor Resources). Mineralization is associated with 
interflow volcanic sediments between andesite flows and dioritic sills. The alteration 
consists  of  silicification,  carbonization  and  considerable  sulphide  enrichment.  Gold 
occurs  with  pyrite-chalcopyrite  in  shallow  dipping  quartz  veins  that  crosscut  the 
stratigraphy. Historical channel samples completed by Lacana Mining Corporation in 
1982 include 0.81 oz/ton over 5 feet, 0.165 oz/ton over 6 feet and 0.10 oz/ton over 
10 feet. 
 
Explor has completed a study and a complete compilation of work executed in the 
past, followed by line cutting, magnetic survey and VLF to determine the localization 
of  structural  targets  on  the  property.  After  analysing  all  of  this  information,  in  July 
2013,  the  Corporation  started  an  initial  4-hole  drill  program  of  1,500  m  on  the 
property (October 31, 2013 MD&A of Explor Resources from SEDAR website). The 
four  holes  drilled  in  2013  on  this  target  (EXS-13-01  to  EXS-13-04)  were  laid  out 
according to the follow-up drill program proposed in 1988, through a tighter spacing. 
With  an  aggregate  total  of  879  m,  all  four  drill  holes  encountered  a  sequence  of 
highly sheared and altered felsic tuffs and quartz porphyries, with subordinate felsic 
and mafic volcanics and ultramafics. Stronger gold mineralization was cored in drill 
hole EXS-13-04, which returned 1.68 g/t Au over a 2.0 m interval (Explor Resources 
press release February 17, 2014). The host rock is rhyolite-looking, weakly pyritized 
(1-3% pyrite) and wedged between strongly sheared to mylonitic quartz-floored felsic 
tuffs and ultramafics. 
 
Gold Potential of the Other Adjacent Properties 
InnovExplo has been unable to verify the above information on adjacent properties 
near  the  Duparquet  Project.  The  presence  of  significant  mineralization  on  these 
adjacent  properties  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  similar  mineralization  on  the 
Duparquet Project.

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
No mineral estimate was performed to determine the silver content in the Duparquet 
deposit because very few silver assays were available. At the request of Clifton Star, 
InnovExplo  used  a  predetermined  silver  content  to  calculate  the  cash  flow  in  the 
current Prefeasibility Study. The value was derived from the 2009 tailings sampling 
program,  the  2013  12  t  composite  bulk  sampling  program  and  the  238  individual 
samples, representing the  “Master  Holes” for the  bulk sampling  program  that  were 
analysed for silver. 
 
Silver assays results from Beattie mine tailings (Fillion, 2009)  
A total of eight (8) samples from the tailings were assayed for silver in 2009 (Table 
24.1). The average silver grade of all results was 2.4 g/t Ag. This grade was used to 
calculate the cash flow in the current Prefeasibility Study.
Table 24.1 – Silver assays results from Beattie mine tailings (Fillion, 2009)
Head analysis results of the 2013 bulk sample 
Clifton Star sent approximately 12 tonnes of full HQ core of its 2013 composite bulk 
sample (see section 11.7) to SGS Canada Inc. The results yielded a head analysis 
of  1.84  g/t  Au  and  2.2  g/t  Ag,  and  the  Au/Ag  ratio  was  0.84  (Table  24.2).  These 
values were used to calculate the cash flow in the current Prefeasibility Study.

Silver assay results from master holes of the 2013 bulk sample  
The 2013 Clifton Star bulk sample comprises material from six (6) mineralized zones 
(Figure  11.3). This  represents  a  better  representative  sample  corresponding  to  the 
future  mineralized  zones  that  will  be  mined  at  the  Duparquet  Project  and  also 
represents  the  mineralized  zones  treated  in  the  current  PFS.  A  total  of  238  pulp 
samples were assayed for silver. The silver grades are plotted against Au/Ag ratios 
on Figure 24.1. 
 
The Au/Ag ratios on Figure 24.1 were taken from historical data. From the start of 
production in 1933 until the end of 1940, the mill at the Beattie Gold mine processed 
3,921,281  short  tons  of  ore  and  recovered  471,085  ounces  of  gold  and  73,214 
ounces  of  silver,  for  an  average  of  0.120  oz/t  Au  and  0.019  oz/t  Ag  (Dresser  and 
Denis, 1949). This tonnage came from the North and A zones. The Au/Ag ratio was 
6.32.  According  to  the  Department  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resourcesof  Québec 
(Lavergne, 1985), the Beattie mill treated 9,645,000 metric tonnes with an average 
grade  of  4.01  g/t  Au  and  0.99  g/t  Ag.  The  ore  came  from  the  Beattie  mine  and 
Donchester mine between 1933 and 1956. The Au/Ag ratio decreased to 4.05 during 
this time because the ore from the North Zone of the Donchester mine was added to 
the  Beattie  mill.  This  is  also  evident  on  Figure  24.1  where  the  North  Zone  of  the 
Donchester mine (green diamonds; DDH D09-18) shows a higher silver content than 
that of the North Zone of the Beattie mine (beige diamonds; DDH BD12-15).  
 
Furthermore, the fact that silver recovery was not optimal during these years must be

that reported by Dresser and Denis (1949) and Lavergne (1985).

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
The  objective  of  the  mandate  assigned  to  InnovExplo  Inc.,  Roche  Ltd.  Consulting 
Group and Dresinger Consulting was to produce a Prefeasibility Study (PFS) for the 
Duparquet  Project  in  accordance  with  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-
101F1.  The  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  on  which  the  PFS  is  based  was 
published in an earlier report titled “Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate 
Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation  43-101  and  Form  43-
101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013 (Williamson et al., 2013b).  
 
InnovExplo  considers  the  present  PFS  (and  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  presented 
herein)  to  be  reliable  and  thorough,  and  based  on  quality  data,  reasonable 
hypotheses and parameters compliant with NI 43-101 and CIM standards regarding 
mineral resource estimates. 
 
Resources 
 
Using  new  geological  and  analytical  information  available,  InnovExplo  updated  the 
mineralized-zone  wireframe  model  of 
following 
summarizes  the  changes  and  additions  made  to  the  mineralized  material  zone 
wireframe  model  (as  presented  in  the  August  2013  report  by  Williamson  et  al., 
2013b).
the  Duparquet  Project.  The
1)  The South Zone was redesigned in such a way that it now presents a series
of ten (10) “en-echelon” subzones associated with the DFZ;
2)  The West Zone has been remodelled into three (3) distinct lenses; 
3)  A new zone, CD S2, has been created at Central Duparquet; 
4)  Five (5) mineralized zones have been created at Dumico; 
5)  Thirty-four (34) new zones (secondary zones) have been created within the
“inter-zone” mineralized envelope.
After  conducting  a  detailed  review  of  all  pertinent  information  and  the  updated 
Mineral Resource Estimate (August 2013), InnovExplo concludes the following:
•  In spite of the current drill spacing, the geological and grade continuities of the 
sixty  (60)  interpreted  gold  mineralized  zones  of  the  Duparquet  Project  were 
demonstrated.
•  The  definition  drilling  program  and  the  updated  mineralized-zone  wireframe 
model  successfully  upgraded  a  significant  part  of  the  in-pit  resources  to  an 
Indicated Resource category, which allowed the Duparquet Project to advance 
to a prefeasibility study stage.
•  New  drilling  included  in  the  update  added  to  the  overall  Measured  and 
Indicated resources, bringing it to a total of 3.11 Moz, a 29% increase over the 
previous  estimate.  The  total  Inferred  Resource  amounts  to  1.44  Moz.  In-Pit 
Measured and Indicated Resources have increased by 38% to 2.67 Moz.
•  Not all of the Inferred Resources had been converted into Indicated Resources
in the pit area, so it could have an impact on a future economic study.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

•  The  new  geological  and  structural  model  greatly  enhances  resource 
conversion  to  the  Indicated  category  and  would  benefit  considerably  from 
detailed mapping of the numerous outcrops present on the Property.
•  The  potential  is  high  for  adding  new  resources  along  strike,  at  depth  and 
along  the  down-dip  extensions  of  the  main  and  secondary  zones,  through 
additional diamond drilling.
Reserves 
 
The reserves for the detailed pit design have been calculated in accordance with the 
definitions  and  guidelines  adopted  by  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy 
and  Petroleum  (CIM  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves)  in  August 
2000.  
 
The effective date of the Mineral Reserve is March 26, 2014, the date on which the 
latest processing cost estimation was concluded.  
 
The  PFS  is  based  on  a  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  produced  by  InnovExplo  in  an 
earlier report prepared for the issuer titled “Technical Report and Mineral Resource 
Estimate  Update  for  the  Duparquet  Project  (according  to  Regulation  43-101  and 
Form 43-101F1)”, dated August 2, 2013.  
 
The  mineral  resource  block  model  developed  by  InnovExplo  was  imported  into 
Whittle™  software  from  Dassault  Systèmes  GEOVIA  (formerly  Gemcom  Software 
International).  Design  parameters,  such  as operating  costs,  mine recovery,  dilution 
and gold price, were used to generate an optimal pit shell.  
 
InnovExplo  evaluated  dilution  and  mine  recovery  by  performing  an  analysis  of 
mineable  blocks  on  typical  cross-sections  at  the  mill  cut-off  grade.  After  a  cross-
sectional evaluation, average dilution was estimated at 10% at a grade of 0 g/t, and 
mine  recovery  was  estimated  at  95%  assuming  good  blasting  and  dilution  control 
practices.  
 
To integrate dilution in Whittle, an initial 5% dilution factor was used when performing 
reblocking and merging the original small blocks (5x5x5) into grade bands (high and 
low).  This  feature  defines  a  maximum  number  of  parcels  per  reblock  blocks.  This 
action regroups the smaller blocks of 5x5x5 into larger parcels, by grade interval. In 
this  evaluation,  two  parcels  were  considered.  The  resulting  parcel  includes  blocks 
lower than the cut-off grade that are considered internal dilution. If the average grade 
of the parcel is higher than the cut-off grade, it is considered as ore and sent to the 
mill. This dilution was estimated at 5%. An additional 5% dilution factor was added to 
the Whittle parameters for a total dilution factor of 10%. 
 
Iterations were performed to generate a pit design that fits the selected pit shell. To 
do  so,  a  pit  design,  including  a  ramp  and  catch  bench,  is  made  in  the  selected 
pitshell.  For  the  Duparquet  Project,  the  initial  pit  wall  angle  was  too  steep  to 
accommodate the ramp. The slope angle was smoothed until a ramp could fit in the 
Whittle  pit  shell.  Many  iterations  were  needed  before  finding  an  adequate  pit  wall 
angle.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
338
www.innovexplo.com
After many iterations, pit slopes were set at 29° in the overburden, 45° on the north 
side of the pits, and 48° on the south side of the pit. The ramp was designed on the 
north side of the pit due to the constraints imposed by the golf course and houses on 
the south side and due to the location of the  mill.  
 
The  concurrent  prefeasibility  work  allowed  InnovExplo  and  Roche  Ltd  Consulting 
Group (“Roche”) to better quantify the operating costs. These costs were used for a 
final pit optimization in Whittle. These parameters are presented in Table 15.1.

Note: An additional 5% dilution factor is included in the reblocking for a total dilution factor of 10%. 
 
The mining cost of $1.93/t represents the initial cost to mine the rock present at the 
surface of the open pit. An incremental hauling cost of $0.21 per kilometre of ramp 
was added, depending on pit depth. 
 
The open pit production is supplemented by 4.1 Mt of available old tailings. The old 
tailings  will  be  processed  during  the  beginning  of  the  Project  at  a  rate  of  750,000 
tonnes per year.  
 
The  global  In-pit  and  Tailings  Proven  and  Probable  Reserves  total  39,363,000 
tonnes  at  an  average grade  of  1.50 g/t (1,895,530  contained  ounces  of gold). The 
Whittle pit shell selected for this PFS generates 35,238,429 tonnes of ore, including 
dilution  and  losses.  Another  4,124,600  tonnes  from  the  old  tailings  completes  the 
resources  for  a  total  of  39,363,029  tonnes  of  ore  from  which  0.5%  is  Proven 
Reserves  and  99.5%  is  Probable  Reserve.  A  cut-off  grade  of  0.45  g/t  has  been 
considered  for  the  tailings  material  and  0.51  for  the  pit.  The  Mineral  Reserve 
Estimate for the Duparquet Project is presented in Table 15.2.

The  Duparquet  Project  pit  optimization  for  the  present  PFS  generates  35,238,429 
tonnes of ore. Another 4,124,600 tonnes from the old tailings complete the resource 
for a total of 39,363,029 tonnes of ore. The pit also generates 291,213,881 tonnes of 
waste and 23,398,085 tonnes of overburden resulting in an LOM strip ratio of 8.26 to 
1.  Taking  into  account  the  overburden,  the  LOM  strip  ratio  is  8.92  to  1.  The 
estimated LOM average grade is 1.50 g/t including the ore from the pit and the old 
tailings. A total of 1,682,968 ounces of gold would be recovered over the mine life. 
An average of 173,000 ounces per year would be recovered for the first 5 years, and 
an average of 158,000 ounces per year over the 11 years of production studied. A 
stockpile  will  be  used  to  vary  the  cut-off  grade  in  order  to  optimize  project 
economics.  The  ore,  waste  and  tailings  production  plan  is  presented  in  the  table

The Duparquet Pit LOM was based on supplying the mill with 3,650,000 tonnes of 
ore  per  year.  Initially,  4.1  Mt  of  tailings  would  be  reserved  to  supplement  the  mill 
when necessary, but it was later decided to process the tailings at a rate of 750,000 
tonnes per year right from the start in order to clean the tailings area to make room 
for the waste stockpile.  
 
The  Duparquet  Pit  LOM  will  be  spread  over  11  years,  preceded  by  a  4-year  pre-
production period. This schedule will yield a yearly production of 3,650,000 tonnes. 
For  the  Project,  three  (3)  6030FS  shovels  have  been  selected,  as  well  as  one  (1) 
994H front-end loader, and it has been determined that 785D trucks will be used. A 
total of 14 trucks will be necessary during the production peak, which covers Years 2 
to 7. Sanvik recommended two types of drill for the Project: one DR540 for the pre-
shear  drilling  which  will  drill  140  mm  holes,  and  four  (4)  D55SP  drills  for  the 
production drilling which will drill 215 mm holes. 
 
A total of 339 employees will be needed for the Duparquet Project. This assumes the 
operation will run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year. 
  
The  working  schedule  for  most  yearly  compensated  employees  will  be  a  standard 
40-hour week at 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday to Friday. Some yearly 
compensated employees will be  working 12-hour shifts, equivalent to 84 hours per 
week,  as  part  of  a  two-week  repeating  schedule:  the  first  week  working  4  days 
followed by 3 days off, the second week working 3 days followed by 4 days off. The 
hourly workers will be working 12-hour shifts as part of the same two-week repeating 
schedule.  Most  activities  require  24-hour  per  day  operation,  which  is  split  into  4 
shifts. 
 
Processing 
 
Bench scale and pilot plant metallurgical testwork programs have been  carried out 
for the PFS. The PFS considered two processing options for the recovery of the gold 
from  the  Clifton  Star  Duparquet  Project  ores:  the  Concentrate  option  and  the 
Pressure Oxidation  (“POX”)  option. Whereas gold  doré  would  be  produced  on  site 
with the POX option, the Concentrate option would produce a sulphide concentrate 
product for sale. 
 
The  Concentrate  option  would  produce  a  sulphide  rich  concentrate  having  the 
highest gold content possible. Maximizing the gold grade in the concentrate has an 
impact  on  the  flotation  gold  recovery,  and  justifies  a  CIL  circuit  to  recover  the 
remaining gold from the flotation tailings. For the POX option, the flotation circuit is 
operated  to  maximize  gold  recovery  to  flotation  concentrate  instead  of  maximizing 
the gold concentrate grade, as in the Concentrate option. With much less gold being 
rejected  in  the  flotation  tailings  in  the  POX  option,  cyanidation  of  the  tailings  is 
currently not economically feasible in light of the CAPEX and OPEX associated with 
a  tailings  CIL  circuit,  as  well  as  the  price  of  gold  used  for  the  current  study 
(US$1,300/oz). 
 
The  strategy  of  using  the  POX  process  generated  the  highest  financial  return  on 
investment,  while  the  alternative  concentrate  production  process  option  resulted  in 
lower capital and lower operating costs. Based on the current results, conventional
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
341
www.innovexplo.com
POX  technology,  using  an  autoclave,  is  the  preferred  method  of  oxidation  for  the 
Duparquet Project. 
The processing plant is designed to process an average of 10,000 tpd of ore with an 
overall recovery of 90.1% for gold and 90% for silver. 
 
The process flowsheet chosen includes a conventional open circuit primary crushing 
stage  followed  by  two  grinding  stages.  The  flotation  circuit  includes  a:  rougher 
flotation  stage,  a  rougher  concentrate  regrind  stage  and  a  cleaner  flotation  stage. 
After  thickening,  the  flotation  concentrate  will  pass  through  the  pressure  oxidation 
circuit  to  be  oxidized  followed  by  a  carbon-in-pulp  (CIP)  circuit for  cyanidation  and 
carbon adsorption for gold recovery. The flotation tailings will be considered as final 
tailings.  In  the  CIP  circuit,  gold  will  be  cyanide  leached  and  adsorbed  onto  the 
carbon  and  then  recovered  from  the  carbon  by  an  elution  circuit,  followed  by 
electrowinning, and doré smelting. Carbon regeneration has also been included. 
 
Environment Permitting 
 
Up to this date, environmental, geochemical and social baseline studies have not led 
to  the  identification  of  any  fatal  flaw  that  could  seriously  impact  the  future 
development of the Duparquet Project. 
 
The overall Project is subject to environmental assessment provisions of Quebec’s 
Environment  Quality  Act  (EQA)  and  the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Act 
(CEAA). The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) that is required 
pursuant  to  these  Acts  will  be  initiated  as  soon  as  a  Project  Notice  and  a  Project 
Description  will  have  been  tabled  with  the  provincial  and  federal  authorities, 
respectively.  A  schedule  for  the  environmental  assessment  and  permitting  of  the 
Project  has  been  developed.  Environmental  and  social  baseline  studies  were  and 
will  be  conducted  and  reports  either  have  been  or  will  be  prepared.  Permitting 
requirements  are  also  well-defined  and  have  been  considered  in  the  project 
development plan. 
A  tailings  and  water  management  strategy  has  been  defined  at  a  prefeasibility 
design level.  
A Mine Rehabilitation and Closure Plan will be prepared for the Project as part of the 
environmental  permitting  process.  The  Plan  will  describe  measures  planned  to 
restore the Property as close as reasonably possible to its former use or condition, or 
to an alternate use or condition that is considered appropriate and acceptable by the 
Québec Department of Natural Resources (MERN). The Plan will outline measures 
to  be  taken  for  progressive  rehabilitation,  closure  rehabilitation  and  post-closure 
monitoring and treatment. It will also help refine the evaluation of restoration costs 
completed as part of this Report.  
 
Capital and Operating Costs 
 
The pre-production capital cost for the POX option is estimated at $394 million and 
sustaining  capital  is  estimated  at  $118  million.  The  capital  costs  include  various 
added  contingencies  depending  on  the  sector.  For  the  base  case  (POX), 
contingencies and indirect costs total $98.7 million of the pre-production costs and 
represent 26% of the costs. Indirect costs (owner's costs; Engineering, Procurement 
and  Construction  Management  (EPCM);  and  detailed  engineering)  of  37%  have
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
342
www.innovexplo.com
been  applied  on  the  process  plant  and  to  the  other  surface  infrastructure.  An 
average contingency for all environmental items is 20%.
The total estimated capital expenditure of $512M for the Duparquet Project consists 
of five (5) components (see table below): mining; surface installation and equipment; 
processing facilities; tailings storage facilities; and environmental. 
 
The  tailing  storage  facilities  item  in  the  table  below  includes  the  reclaim  pumping 
station and pipeline.  The remainder of the tailings dam infrastructure is included in 
the environmental pre-production and sustaining costs.
Breakdown of the capital cost (Table 21.1)
The  OPEX  cost  breakdown  for  the  PFS  is  divided  into  five  (5)  main  categories: 
general  and  administration 
(G&A);  processing;  mining;  environmental;  and 
overburden removal. The G&A category includes the costs of technical services and 
administration.  Open  pit  mining  costs  include  drilling,  blasting,  loading,  hauling, 
auxiliary,  and  general  mine  maintenance.  The  processing  category  includes 
manpower,  the  cost  to  process  ore  from  the  pit,  and  the  cost  to  process  the  old 
tailings. The environmental category includes manpower and departmental costs.

Financial Analysis 
 
Pre-tax and after-tax cash flow projections were generated from the LOM schedule 
according to the capital and operating cost estimates. It was done in constant 2013 
money terms and in Canadian currency unless stated otherwise, with no allowance 
for inflation or escalation. The net cash flow has been discounted for the purposes of
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star

calculating  NPV.  A  base  discount  rate  of  5%  per  year  has  been  selected  as  most 
likely  to  represent  a  low  capital  expense  gold  project  in  a  mining-friendly 
environment. Future annual cash flow estimates are based on grade, gold recoveries 
and cost estimates. 
 
The  PFS  considered  two  possible  processing  scenarios.  Cash  flow  models  were 
created for both options. The POX option generated the highest financial return and, 
as a result, the POX process is favoured and used as the base case of the present 
PFS. 
 
The undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $493.19M over the 11-year mine life and 
the payback period is 4.3 years. 
 
A summary of the base case cash flow model is given in the table below. LOM totals 
for undiscounted and discounted cash flows are also provided. The table shows that 
the pre-tax NPV of the project cash flow at a discount of 5% per year is evaluated at 
approximately $222M and a pre-tax internal rate of return of 15.11%. The average 
cash cost of production equates to US$775/oz gold.

•  There is a risk that Hydro-Québec might not have the capacity to supply the 
Duparquet  Project,  depending  on  other  power  consumptions.  Further  study 
and discussion should be initiated with Hydro-Québec.
•  There is a risk that the MERN will not allow Clifton Star to recover the portion 
of  the  Mineral  Resources  in  the  tailings  that  are  outside  the  Property 
boundary. If this were to happen, the authors wish to point out that this very
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
345
www.innovexplo.com
small portion of the total Mineral Resources would only have a minor impact 
and would not affect the potential viability of the Project.
•  There  is  a  risk  that  the  CAPEX  to  develop  the  project  will  be  higher  than 
estimate. Not all recent projects have achieved the expected cost anticipated 
to  reach  production.  To  limit  the  risk,  Clifton  Star  should  put  considerable 
effort  into  assembling  a  highly  qualified  and  experienced  team  for  project 
development.
•  The  foundations  cost  could  be  higher  or  lower  depending  on  the  results  of
•
future geotechnical studies. 
 
If  development targets  are  not  achieved  during  the  preproduction  and  early 
production  periods,  the  ramp-up  schedule  to  full  production  may  be 
compromised.
•  There  is  a  risk  that  the  Québec  Ministry  of  Transport  will  not  allow  heavy 
equipment  to  travel  across  Route  393,  or  will  require  a  larger  buffer  zone 
between the highway and the pit edges.
•  The  social  and  economic  effects  in  developing  a  by-pass  for  the  portion  of
highway 393 that passes over the mineralized zone should be investigated.
•  The risk related to metallurgical issues are that:
o  variations in mineralogy could cause fluctuations in mill recovery; 
o  grinding characteristics may differ from test results; 
o
thickening and filtration testwork may not be representative of the ore 
deposit;
•  As  with  all  mining  projects  in  the  Province  of  Québec  or,  more  largely,  in 
Eastern Canada and also elsewhere in the world, there is always a risk that 
the mining company may not be successful in obtaining a “social licence to 
operate”.  In  the  present  case  however,  the  “social  acceptability”  risk  is 
relatively  mitigated  in  part  because  the  Project  is  located  in  an  area  with  a 
long history of mining development (when compared with other regions). Still, 
for any mining project located close to urban areas, there is always a risk of 
developing a project that is not acceptable for the local, regional or provincial 
communities.
Opportunity
•  The project is located in located in the vicinity of the town of Duparquet and 
close  to  major  center  of  Rouyn-Noranda  and  La  Sarre.  Both  skilled  and 
general  workforces  are  readily  available.  Suppliers,  contractors,  consulting 
firms and competent workers are available locally.
•  The  inferred  Mineral  Resource  blocks  as  well  as  all  blocks  having  at  least 
0.01% of their volume contained within stope solids that fall within the pit limit 
have been treated as waste and have been assigned a zero grade. If these 
blocks are incorporated in the mine schedule, it should translate in a tonnage 
and grade increase.

•  The additional 47 drill holes and channel samples that were completed after 
current  resource  cut-off  date  (May  6th,  2013)  could  be  included  in  a  new 
resource calculation and thus increase the current resource.
•  Additional definition drilling could convert the current Inferred Resources into
Indicated Resource and Reserves.
•  Additional  exploration  drilling  could  expand  the  known  mineralized  zones
along strike and at depth.
•  Geotechnical drilling along the proposed pitwalls may allow steeper pitwalls
and hence reduce the waste to ore strip ratio.
•  The economic effects in developing a by-pass, for the portion of highway 393 
that  passes  over  the  mineralized  zone,  that  would  permit  mining  a  single 
larger pit, should be investigated.
•  Future mining potential of the Duparquet Project, below the current pit shell, 
by an underground bulk mining method will need to be assessed and could 
provide an extension of the mine life.
•  The  province’s  mining  industry  is  well  established.  The  hydro-electricity  is 
affordable  and  offers  competitive  advantage  for  companies  operating  in 
Quebec. Mining companies also enjoy relatively stable mining legislation.
•  The  historical  Beattie  Mine  site  surface  area  will  be  cleaned  up  and  the 
current  buildings  demolished  and  removed  prior  to  the  development  of  the 
open-pit  mining.  The  old  tailing  area  will  be  reclaimed  as  part  of  the  mine 
closure plan.
InnovExplo,  Roche  and  Dresinger  Consulting  conclude  that  this  PFS  allows  the 
Duparquet Project to advance to a feasibility study stage. InnovExplo believes that 
more advanced engineering work is necessary for the Duparquet Project in order to 
support a feasibility study and reduce the risks to the Project. 
 
InnovExplo  considers  the  present  PFS  to  be  reliable  and  thorough,  and  based  on 
quality data, reasonable hypotheses and parameters compliant with NI 43-101 and 
CIM standards regarding mineral resource estimations.

RECOMMENDATIONS
www.innovexplo.com
Based  on  the  results  of  the  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  and  the  positive 
outcome  of  the  PFS,  InnovExplo,  Roche  and  Dreisinger  Consulting  recommend 
advancing the Duparquet Project to the next phase, which would consist of preparing 
a feasibility study. 
 
Drilling 
 
InnovExplo  recommends  further  exploration  drilling  on  the  Duparquet  Project  to 
increase  resources  and  the  confidence  level  of  the  geological  model.  More 
specifically, the NE-SW striking secondary zones should be drilled to test their lateral 
and  depth  extensions.  In  the  same  way,  detailed  surface  mapping  and  channel 
sampling is recommended to enhance the structural model.  
 
A  compilation  of  historical  diamond  drill  holes  is  recommended  on  the  Central 
Duparquet  property,  particularly  those  of  the  1980s  drilling  programs  that  covered 
the current mineralized zones in the area. 
 
Further  definition  drilling  is  recommended  along  strike  and  at  depth  to  upgrade 
Inferred  resources  to  the  Indicated  category  in  order  to  address  the  underground 
potential for all zones. 
 
In  order  to  advance  to  the  feasibility  stage,  the  reserve  and  resource  calculations 
should be updated to include the results from the 47 holes that were received after 
the last cut-off date. 
 
Mining 
 
Additional geotechnical and hydrogeological studies should be undertaken to better 
define the pit wall slopes from those presented in this Report. In order to proceed to 
a feasibility level study, it is recommended that the proposed slope configurations be 
verified.  This  involves  confirming  the  structural  data  over  the  proposed  open  pit 
footprint. Ideally, this would involve a geotechnical drilling program with a minimum 
of one (1) hole oriented perpendicular to each of the four pit walls (north, south, east 
and west). 
 
Pit  optimization  should  continue,  and  other  scenarios  should  be  investigated 
following an update of the resources according to previous recommendations:
•
•
Investigation of a scenario that considers bypassing Route 393 and for which 
there is no road constraint; 
Investigation of a scenario that uses a contractor for overburden removal.
Metallurgy 
 
Although  intensive  laboratory  and  pilot  plant  work  has  been  conducted  on 
representative  samples  and  bulk  samples,  additional  metallurgical  testing  will  be 
required as the Project proceeds to the feasibility stage in order to firm up the design 
basis, further refine the ore processing flow sheet, and finalize the design of the mill 
facilities.
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
348
www.innovexplo.com
Recommendations for Additional Testwork:
•  A variability testwork program including metallurgical testing on samples from 
various  depths,  various  zones  throughout  the  pit,  and  various  sulphide 
contents. The program should also study the metallurgical behaviour for each 
lithology and for combined ore types.
•  Grindability testwork including crusher work index, Bond ball mill grindability 
index, Bond rod mill grindability  index, drop-weight test and abrasion index. 
These are required to better define the rock variability for each zone of the 
deposit;
•  Testwork to further confirm the process and reagent selection and dosage for
optimized recovery and grade;
•  Additional testwork to confirm silver recovery; 
•  Mineralogical characterization and gold and silver deportment should also be
verified;
•  Further optimization tests on each unit of operation. An integrated pilot plant 
for  the  whole  circuit  should  be  operated  for  an  extended  period  of  time  to 
confirm  the  results  and  also  test  other  unit  operations  within  the  proposed 
flowsheet;
•  Further  work  to  investigate  leaching  and  adsorption  kinetics  on  lime  boiled 
samples  to  determine  the  impact  of  liberated  silver  on  precious  metal 
leaching  and  adsorption  kinetics  to  ensure  the  cyanidation  extraction  and 
recovery circuit configuration is designed more accurately;
•  More  testwork  on  the  limestone  that  will  be  sourced  for  the  Project, 
particularly  in  terms  of  optimal  particle  size,  reaction  kinetics  and  dosage 
rates.
•  Further tests to accurately ascertain the rheology of the thickened stream.
Infrastructure 
 
Condemnation drilling will be required for infrastructure locations, such as the waste 
rock dump, primary crusher, process plant, buildings, etc. 
 
Geotechnical  work  such  as  geotechnical  drilling,  test  pits,  seismic  analysis  and 
stability analysis are recommended as the Project proceeds to the feasibility level in 
order to confirm the assumptions used for the tailings storage facility design and the 
waste piles. It will also confirm bedrock depth and capacity, and optimize civil design 
criteria related to the foundations for the plant and auxiliary facilities.  
 
A  study  on  borrow  banks  for  suitable  materials  for  use  during  construction  of  the 
various  dykes,  pads  and  roads,  and  for  use  as  concrete  aggregate  should  be 
undertaken  during  the  feasibility  stage  to  determine  available  quantities  and 
distances from the various facilities. 
 
Groundwater  hydraulics  should  be  verified  at  the  feasibility  stage  to  determine 
available flow rates for plant make-up water. 
 
The  current  method  for  tailings  disposal  and  rheology  is  not  well  known  since  the 
tailings rheology is not well understood. Two possibilities are presented:
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Duparquet – May 23, 2014 – Clifton Star
349
www.innovexplo.com
• 
•
Compacted cyclone tailings 
Low plasticity tailings.
More study is required at the feasibility stage to determine the methods and to refine 
CAPEX estimations. The reduced material quantities resulting from better estimates 
of the bulk density should partly offset costs resulting from deposition methods and 
equipment. 
 
It is recommended that negotiations with Hydro-Quebec be initiated to advance the 
work for installation of the power line. 
 
Environment 
 
In  order  to  complete  the  surface  water  quality  assessment  program,  it  would  be 
important to collect samples at different hydrological periods such as during spring 
freshet since this important hydrological period is usually different from the others. In 
addition, all waterbodies likely to be affected by the projected infrastructures should 
be comprehensively portrayed. Additional sediment quality sampling should also be 
done at different periods of the year in order to monitor changes in their quality. 
 
As part of the future development of the Duparquet Project, an inventory of terrestrial 
habitats and wetlands will be conducted in order to list plant species present on the 
Property as well as those who have the potential to be present. Bird and terrestrial 
wildlife  surveys  should  also  be  done  for  the  subsequent  realization  of  the  project 
impact study. 
 
Even  if  a  preliminary  fish  habitat  characterization  was  performed  on  the  Property, 
only a specific fish field survey could confirm fish presence/absence in streams as 
well  as  which  ones  can  be  considered  as  fish  habitats.  This  survey  would  also 
characterize  streams 
in  August  2013  and  should 
consequently be done as part of future project development steps.  
 
Static 
tests  were  completed  using 
representative  samples  of  waste  rock,  ore  and  tailings.  However,  kinetic  tests  will 
have to be performed to confirm that those mining residues are not leachable. 
As part of the future steps of the Duparquet Project, a comprehensive hydrogeology 
assessment  will  have  to  be  completed  in  order  to  adequately  estimate  the 
groundwater input in the water balance. Such assessment will include, among other 
things, mathematical modelling of the successive mine operation phases to estimate 
the daily flow rate required to keep the pit dry. 
 
In order to ensure project permitting in a timely manner, Clifton Star should initiate as 
soon as possible the above environmental work and also cover all biophysical and 
socio-environmental  elements  typically  included  in  an  ESIA  compliant  with  both 
provincial  and  federal  requirements/guidelines.  As  outlined  in  sections  20.2.2  and 
20.2.3  of  this  Report,  Project  Notice  documents  should  be  issued  to  initiate  the 
environmental  assessment  and  permitting  process.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  as 
part  of  the  provincial  permitting  process,  a  Mine  Rehabilitation  and  Closure  Plan 
must be prepared and submitted for approval prior to obtain the general CA.

Finally,  with  regards  to  the  social  acceptability  of  the  Project,  it  is  highly 
recommended  that  Clifton  Star  continues  informing  and  discussing  with  all 
stakeholders. Over recent years, representatives of Clifton Star have been present in 
the community and provided information on the Project to the representatives of the 
Town  of  Duparquet,  the  Abitibi-Ouest  RCM,  and  governmental  authorities.  Such 
actions will have to be pursued and also extended to all other stakeholders identified 
in Section 20.4 of this Report.  
 
InnovExplo, Roche and Dresinger Consulting have prepared a cost estimate for the 
recommended work program to serve as a guideline for the Project. The budget for 
the proposed program is presented in Table 26.1. 
 
The estimated cost for the work program would amount to approximately $8.8M, and 
would  include  exploration,  definition  and  condemnation  drilling,  metallurgical, 
geotechnical and hydrogeological testwork and a Feasibility Study final report. Table 
26.1 presents the estimated costs for the phases of the recommended program.

InnovExplo  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  recommended  two-phase  work  program  and 
proposed  expenditures  are  appropriate  and  well  thought  out.  InnovExplo  believes 
that  the  proposed  budget  reasonably  reflects  the  type  and  amount  of  the 
contemplated activities.

The  Independent  and  Qualified  Persons  for  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  as  defined  by  NI 43-101,  are  Kenneth Williamson,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo  and 
Karine Brousseau, Eng. under the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.), and the effective date of the estimate is June 26, 
2013.  
Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
Results are presented undiluted within Whittle-optimized pit shells. The estimate includes 60 gold-bearing zones and the envelope zone containing 
isolated gold intercepts. 
Resources were compiled at 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.90 g/t Au cut-off grades. 
Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange rate and mining cost). 
A fixed density of 2.73 g/cm3 was used in the mineralized zones and the envelope zone. 
A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed, or a value of zero when not assayed. 
High grade capping was done on the raw data and established at 25.0 g/t Au for diamond drill hole assays and channel sample assays. 
Compositing was done on drill hole and channel sample sections falling within the mineralized zone solids (composite = 1 m). 
Resources were evaluated from drill hole and surface channel samples using an ID2 interpolation method in a two folders percent block model. 
The Measured category is defined by blocks having a volume of at least 25% within an envelope built at a distance of 10 m around existing Channels. 
The Indicated category is defined by the combination of blocks within a maximum distance of 15 m from existing stopes and blocks for which the 
average distance to drill hole composites is less than 30 m. 
Ounce (troy) = Metric tons x Grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). 
The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the 
recommendations in NI 43-101. 
InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues or any other relevant 
issue that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate. 
Input  parameters  used  for  MCoG  estimation  and  Whittle  pit  design:  Gold  price:  C$  1,450;  Gold  selling  cost:  C$  5.00;  Mining  costs:  C$  2.40; 
Processing cost: C$ 13.46; Transportation cost: C$ 0.25; Administration cost: C$ 4.18; Processing recovery: 93.9%; Mining recovery: 90.9%; Mining 
dilution: 10.0%; Overall pit slope: 52°.

•  The  Independent  and  Qualified  Persons  for  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate,  as  defined  by  NI 43-101,  are  Kenneth  Williamson,  M.Sc.,  P.Geo  and  Karine
Brousseau, Eng. under the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.), and the effective date of the estimate is June 26, 2013.
•  Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
•  Results are presented undiluted, outside Whittle-optimized pit shells. The estimate includes 60 gold-bearing zones and the envelope containing isolated gold
intercepts.
•  Resources were compiled at cut-off grades of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 5.0 g/t Au. 
•  Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange rate and mining cost). 
•  A fixed density of 2.73 g/cm3 was used in the mineralized zones and in the envelope zone. 
•  A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed, or a value of zero when not assayed. 
•  High grade capping was done on the raw data and established at 25.0 g/t Au for diamond drill hole assays and channel sample assays. 
•  Compositing was done on drill hole and channel samples sections falling within the mineralized zone solids (composite = 1 m). 
•  Resources were evaluated from drill hole and surface channel samples using an ID2 interpolation method in a two folders percent block model. 
•  The  Indicated category  is  defined  by  the  combination  of  blocks  within  a maximum  distance  of  15 m  from  existing  stopes  and  blocks for  which  the  average
distance to drill hole composites is less than 30 m.
•  Ounce (troy) = Metric tons x Grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). 
•  The  number  of  metric  tons  was  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundred.  Any  discrepancies  in  the  totals  are  due  to  rounding  effects;  rounding  followed  the
recommendations in NI 43-101.

Results are presented undiluted and in situ. The estimate includes four (4) tailings zones. 
Tailings resources were compiled at cut-off grades of 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.9 g/t Au. 
Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange rate and mining cost). 
A fixed density of 1.45 g/cm3 was used in zones and waste. 
High grade capping was done on the raw data and established at 13.0 g/t Au for Zone 1, 3.5 g/t Au for Zone 2, 1.7 g/t Au 
for Zone 3 and 2.2 g/t Au for Zone 4. 
Compositing was done on drill hole sections falling within the mineralized zone solids (composite = 0.5 m). 
Resources were evaluated from drill hole samples using an ID2 interpolation method in a block model. 
The Measured and Indicated categories were defined based on the drill hole spacing (Measured: zones 1 and 2 = 30m x 
30m grid; Indicated: zone 3 = 100m x 100m grid and zone 4 = 200m x 200m grid).
