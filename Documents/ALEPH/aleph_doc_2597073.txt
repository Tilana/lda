DHEM Survey to Commence at Liontown East
ASX Release
Highlights:
  Second drill hole at Liontown East (LTED02) completed at 570m depth – intersected target horizon 
from 510m down hole. LTED02 intersected package of intensely sericite altered rocks combined 
with barite and disseminated sulphide mineralisation from 510m to 540m down hole.
  Gap  GeoPhysics  mobilised  to  Thalanga  to  commence  DHEM  and  DHMMR  survey  program.
Program expected to take 3 to 4 weeks to complete.
  Survey  will  commence  immediately  at  Liontown  East  (LTED01  and  LTED02)  and  will  cover  all
targets drilled by Red River to date.
  Program  will  be  used  to  vector  in  on  the  location  of  potential  VHMS mineralisation  at  targets 
where alteration and mineralisation indicative of the presence of VHMS mineralisation has been 
intercepted.
  RVR fully funded to aggressively continue Thalanga high impact exploration program.
Zinc developer Red River Resources Limited (ASX: RVR) (“Red River” or the “Company”) advises that the second drill 
hole at Liontown East (LTED02), has been completed and intersected a package of intensely sericite altered rocks 
from 510m to 540m downhole, including locally barite rich zones with disseminated sulphides. The intense sericite 
alteration and barite enrichment intersected at the target horizon is evidence of a significant VHMS system having 
being developed at Liontown East.
Gap GeoPhysics have been mobilised to Thalanga to commence a Down Hole Electromagnetic (DHEM) and Down 
Hole  MagnetoMetric  Resistivity  (DHMMR)  survey  program.  The  DHEM  technique  is  ideally  suited  for  detecting 
conductive massive sulphide mineralisation, in particular copper sulphide rich bodies. The DHMMR technique is 
ideally suited for detecting poorly conducting mineralisation such as sphalerite (zinc sulphide) rich bodies.
The DHEM/DHMMR survey will begin immediately at Liontown East (LTED01 and LTED02) and the survey results 
will be processed when they become available to optimise the design of further follow up holes at Liontown East.
Red  River’s  Managing  Director  Mel  Palancian  commented:  “We  are  pleased  to  be  starting  a  program  of 
DHEM/DHMRR  surveying  at  Thalanga,  as  it  is  consistent  with  our  strategy  of  using  cutting  edge  exploration 
technology in the highly prospective Mt Windsor Belt where the last major exploration activity took place in the late 
1990s.
The strategy has already delivered results at Liontown East, where reprocessing geophysical data dating from 1984 
allowed us to see that the geophysical anomaly at Liontown East had not been tested by previous drilling.
We are looking forward to the results, particularly at targets which have all the ingredients present to support the 
presence of a system capable of producing VHMS mineralisation. We believe that the DHEM/DHMMR surveys will 
allow us to better vector in on location of potential VHMS mineralisation within these systems and to design holes 
to test the potential locations.”

1.  LTED02 Completion
The second diamond drill hole (LTED02) has been completed at the Liontown East target. LTED02 intersected the 
target horizon 93m east of, and 52m down dip of LTED01 (or 110m down plunge of LTED01). 
LTED02 intersected a package of intensely sericite altered rocks from 510m to 540m downhole, including locally 
barite rich zones with disseminated sulphides. The core will shortly be sampled and sent for assay.  No significant 
assay results are expected.

2.  Down Hole Electromagnetic (DHEM) and Down Hole MagnetoMetric Resistivity (DHMMR) Survey
Program
Red River has engaged Gap Geophysics to commence a program of Down Hole Electromagnetic (DHEM) and Down 
Hole MagnetoMetric Resistivity (DHMMR) surveys at the Thalanga Zinc Project. The program will start immediately 
with surveys being undertaken at LTED01 and LTED02. The data gathered will be processed and used to optimise 
the design of follow up drill holes at Liontown East. This process is expected to take 6 days to complete.  
The DHEM technique is ideally suited for detecting conductive massive sulphide mineralisation, in particular copper 
sulphide rich bodies. The DHMMR technique is ideally suited for detecting poorly conducting mineralisation such 
as sphalerite rich bodies. 
The survey program will also include recent drilling carried out by Red River at the other prospects, including Far 
West, Wattle Tree, Jasper Flats and Truncheon. The survey program is expected to take 3 to 4 weeks to complete. 
The survey results at Far West will be used to optimised the designed infill drilling program, which is scheduled to 
commence when the current drill hole (TH677) testing the Portal IP target at West 45 is completed. 
The survey results will also be used to design follow up holes at Wattle Tree, Jasper Flats and Truncheon, where 
initial drilling intersected encouraging zones of intense hydrothermal alteration, plus significant zones of intensive 
pyrite alteration and veining indicative of feeder zones associated with volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) 
mineralisation, allowing the follow up holes to be designed to intersect any off hole conductors identified by the 
DHEM and DHMMR surveys.

Thalanga Zinc Project Background
Red River released a Restart Study (the internal study prepared by Red River to assess the potential restart of the 
Thalanga  Zinc  Project)  in  November  2015,  which  demonstrated  the  highly  attractive  nature  of  the Project.  The 
Project has a low operating cost, low pre-production capital cost ($17.2 million), and a short timeline to production 
(six months). 
Annual average production is 21,400 tonnes of zinc, 3,600 tonnes of copper, 5,000 tonnes of lead, 2,000 ounces of 
gold and 370,000 ounces of silver in concentrate over  an initial mine life of five years, and there is outstanding 
extension potential. 
Please refer to ASX release dated 12 November 2015 for further details on the Thalanga Zinc Project Restart Study. 
Red River confirms that all material assumptions underpinning the production target in the ASX release dated 12 
November 2015 continue to apply and have not materially changed. 
The  Thalanga  Zinc  Project  Restart  Study  is  based  on  production  from  three  deposits  –  West  45,  Far  West  and 
Waterloo. The Thalanga Zinc Project Restart Study is based on low level technical and economic assessments and 
there is insufficient data to support the estimation of Ore Reserves at Far West and Waterloo, provide assurance 
of an economic development case at this stage, or provide certainty that the results from the Thalanga Zinc Project 
Restart Study will be realised. Further, as the production target that forms the basis of the Thalanga Zinc Project 
Restart Study includes Mineral Resources that are in the Inferred Category and there is a low level of geological 
confidence  associated  with  Inferred  Mineral  Resources,  there  is  no  certainty  that  further  exploration  work  will 
result in the determination of Indicated Mineral Resources or that the production target itself will be realised.
