<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Belarus was held at the 1st meeting, on 4 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Belarus was headed by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valentin 
</p>
<p>Rybakov. At its 10th meeting, held on 8 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the report 
</p>
<p>on Belarus. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Belarus: Algeria, Pakistan and Paraguay. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Belarus: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/BLR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/ BLR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/ BLR/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America 
</p>
<p>was transmitted to Belarus through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation emphasized the importance of the universal periodic review to 
</p>
<p>Belarus as a mechanism for the objective assessment of the human rights situation in every 
</p>
<p>country. Belarus had worked on the implementation of the recommendations from the first 
</p>
<p>cycle. Progress had been regularly monitored, involving all branches of Government, the 
</p>
<p>academic community, civil society and the United Nations, and a midterm progress report 
</p>
<p>on implementation had been submitted. 
</p>
<p>6. The national report had been prepared in partnership with civil society through four 
</p>
<p>rounds of national consultation, which had resulted in measures such as equipping polling 
</p>
<p>stations with Braille materials from 2015.  
</p>
<p>7. Human rights and freedoms were guaranteed in the Constitution and widely 
</p>
<p>recognized principles of international law had been transposed into national legislation. As 
</p>
<p>a relatively new State, Belarus had set itself ambitious tasks in protecting the rights of its 
</p>
<p>citizens. In a complex geopolitical situation, Belarus remained an island of peace, 
</p>
<p>tranquillity and order, thanks to strong State power and effective State policy.  
</p>
<p>8. In the past five years, Belarus had climbed 15 places in the Human Development 
</p>
<p>Index; almost all of the Millennium Development Goals had been achieved, five of them 
</p>
<p>ahead of schedule. Other positive indicators had been achieved in the fields of education, 
</p>
<p>gender equality, improving the quality of drinking water and immunization of children. </p>


<p>9. Belarus had acceded to six international instruments in the past five years and was 
</p>
<p>preparing to sign the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Numerous 
</p>
<p>legislative changes had been adopted as part of the accessions. In 2013, a judicial reform 
</p>
<p>programme had commenced with the aim of strengthening judicial independence and 
</p>
<p>making other improvements to the system. Numerous laws were under preparation in other 
</p>
<p>fields and in 2015, a National Strategy on Sustainable Socioeconomic Growth to 2030 had 
</p>
<p>been prepared. There were institutions for the protection and promotion of various human 
</p>
<p>rights and, although not perfect, they were generally effective. 
</p>
<p>10. Discrimination was forbidden under the Constitution and criminally punishable, as 
</p>
<p>was hate speech. The 2013 concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination referred to the country&#8217;s protection of freedom of religion and belief. 
</p>
<p>Belarus had taken measures in the field of gender equality; 30 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians in Belarus were women. 
</p>
<p>11. The death penalty had been retained in Belarus as a temporary measure and was 
</p>
<p>applicable only to the most serious crimes. The delegation noted the specific restrictions on 
</p>
<p>its use, the country&#8217;s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights and the continuous public focus on the issue. The parliamentary group established to 
</p>
<p>study the issue had resumed its work in 2012. While public opinion in favour of a 
</p>
<p>moratorium and gradual abolition was important, current opinion polls indicated that 70 per 
</p>
<p>cent of respondents favoured its retention. In 2015, the possibility of substituting a death 
</p>
<p>sentence with life imprisonment by agreement with the prosecution had been introduced. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the situation of detainees, the increasing numbers of appeals to the courts 
</p>
<p>indicated confidence in the system. There was public oversight of prisons and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations had access to them. In 2015, a definition of torture that was in compliance 
</p>
<p>with the definition contained in the Convention against Torture had been introduced into 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Code. Six prisons were being reconstructed, subject to the country&#8217;s financial 
</p>
<p>constraints. 
</p>
<p>13. The current National Action Plan for the improvement of the situation of children 
</p>
<p>and the protection of their rights had been under implementation since 2012. It included 
</p>
<p>many measures that had been recommended by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>There had been developments in juvenile justice and measures to improve child protection, 
</p>
<p>including increased rates of adoption.  
</p>
<p>14. Belarus had made significant progress in addressing domestic violence, including 
</p>
<p>the introduction of the concept into legislation. A draft law on domestic violence was under 
</p>
<p>preparation and a series of relevant measures were in place. 
</p>
<p>15. The law on combating trafficking in human beings had been adopted in 2012. The 
</p>
<p>delegation described the relevant measures that had been taken, including in the field of 
</p>
<p>victim support.  
</p>
<p>16. Belarus had accepted the competence of the Human Rights Committee and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to receive individual 
</p>
<p>complaints. Only 20 countries worldwide had accepted the competence of the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to receive individual complaints. Belarus had 
</p>
<p>repeatedly stated that it did not recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in Belarus and had explained its concerns about how the mandate 
</p>
<p>had been created. Presidential elections would be held in 2015. The Organization for 
</p>
<p>Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) principles would be respected and the 
</p>
<p>elections would be transparent with national, regional and international oversight secured. 
</p>
<p>There were no reports to the treaty bodies overdue. </p>


<p>17. A unified judicial system had been created and the military courts had been 
</p>
<p>abolished. In January 2014, the executive had relinquished all its authority in relation to 
</p>
<p>judicial administration. Work continued on the creation of a professional corps of judges; 
</p>
<p>40 per cent were currently under the age of 40 and more than half were currently women. 
</p>
<p>The practices in the appointment of judges were consistent with those throughout the world. 
</p>
<p>More than half of the judges were now on lifetime appointments. Belarus was moving 
</p>
<p>towards an appellate system for appeals in both criminal and civil law. Other developments 
</p>
<p>included the use of modern technology and the introduction of mediation to settle civil 
</p>
<p>disputes.  
</p>
<p>18. As for progress in the development of civil society, as of January 2015, more than 
</p>
<p>2,500 civil society organizations were registered and the trend in increasing registrations 
</p>
<p>was being sustained. The process of registration of organizations was carried out strictly in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the law and everything possible had been done to ensure that the process 
</p>
<p>was not burdensome. Some individuals had knowingly submitted false information which 
</p>
<p>had prevented the registration of their organizations and there had been cases in which 
</p>
<p>groups had used their unregistered status for political ends. In February 2014, new 
</p>
<p>legislation had simplified the process for registration, regulation of statutes and liquidation 
</p>
<p>of political parties and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation outlined the principles applied in the regulation of the legal 
</p>
<p>profession and mentioned the new law on the legal profession, which had entered into force 
</p>
<p>in 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 95 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report.

</p>
<p>22. Switzerland deplored the intimidation of civil society and expressed concern at 
</p>
<p>impunity for perpetrators of torture.  
</p>
<p>23. Syria commended Belarus for the steps it had taken to improve national legislation 
</p>
<p>and ensure its compatibility with its human rights commitments, as well as efforts to 
</p>
<p>guarantee the right to education.  
</p>
<p>24. Tajikistan noted that the practical steps taken by Belarus bore witness to the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s willingness to fulfil its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>25. Thailand encouraged Belarus to establish a national human rights institution and 
</p>
<p>adopt measures on persons with disabilities.

</p>
<p>28. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland urged Belarus to 
</p>
<p>improve democratic standards for the forthcoming elections. 
</p>
<p>29. Noting the release of Ales Bialiatski, the United States of America asked Belarus to 
</p>
<p>release all political prisoners, and highlighted restrictions on free expression, civil society 
</p>
<p>and the media. </p>


<p>30. Uruguay welcomed the fact that Belarus was preparing to sign the Convention on </p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>31. Argentina welcomed the 2012&#8211;2016 action plan on children&#8217;s rights. It urged 
</p>
<p>Belarus to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>32. Uzbekistan noted the achievements Belarus had made in the realization of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights and its efforts in combating trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>33. Viet Nam highlighted the progress Belarus had made to ensure social security, 
</p>
<p>health services, education and decent work conditions and to protect vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>34. Zimbabwe noted the social welfare policies for eradicating extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>hunger, as well as the human rights education awareness programme. 
</p>
<p>35. Algeria welcomed the accession of Belarus to the Council of Europe Convention on 
</p>

</p>
<p>36. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acknowledged the implementation of the

</p>

</p>
<p>partners.

</p>
<p>mechanisms.

</p>

</p>
<p>xenophobia and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>40. Bangladesh noted the achievements Belarus had made in implementing free and 
</p>
<p>compulsory education, raising women&#8217;s education to a high level and reducing maternal 
</p>
<p>and infant mortality. 
</p>
<p>41. Belgium welcomed the submission by Belarus of a progress report on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Nicaragua commended Belarus for the legislative reforms it had introduced based on 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review recommendations, the achievement of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals and the national plan on international technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>43. Bosnia and Herzegovina commended Belarus for its ratification of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and its efforts to 
</p>
<p>establish a national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>44. Brazil welcomed the national plan on gender equality.  
</p>
<p>45. Botswana noted the legislative and policy measures that had been taken since the 
</p>
<p>previous review. It was concerned about mass arrests of demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>46. Brunei Darussalam commended Belarus for its efforts to improve and adopt national 
</p>
<p>legislation to fulfil its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>47. Canada was deeply concerned at the ongoing detention of political prisoners and at 
</p>
<p>continuing restrictions on civil society. 
</p>
<p>48. Chile urged Belarus to strengthen its cooperation with human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>especially the special procedures. </p>


<p>49. China welcomed the comprehensive measures to enhance social protection and to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the elderly and others had an adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>50. The Congo was concerned that conventions protecting the rights of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>had yet to be incorporated into national legislation.  
</p>
<p>51. Costa Rica noted the progress made.  
</p>
<p>52. Croatia identified the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as the 
</p>
<p>most urgent issue. 
</p>
<p>53. Singapore noted the adoption of legislation on trafficking in persons in 2012 and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of related policies. 
</p>
<p>54. The Czech Republic made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea mentioned the considerable progress 
</p>
<p>made in the implementation of the recommendations from the first universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review. 
</p>
<p>56. Belarus outlined the priorities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The operations of 
</p>
<p>the police in detaining persons, using physical force, firearms and other means was strictly 
</p>
<p>regulated in law. Detained persons had the right to judicial examination of the legality of 
</p>
<p>their detention. The law also allowed people to submit complaints about the behaviour of 
</p>
<p>police officers; 6,000 such complaints had been received in 2014, which represented a 10 
</p>
<p>per cent reduction from 2013. After investigation, one in ten of the complaints had been 
</p>
<p>found to be justified and appropriate measures had been taken. Only five complaints had 
</p>
<p>been received concerning the unlawful use of force. The same trends in the statistics had 
</p>
<p>been seen from the start of 2015. 
</p>
<p>57. Public prosecutors focused on preventing violations of the constitutional rights of 
</p>
<p>citizens as the best method of preventing human rights violations and the indicators showed 
</p>
<p>increased public confidence in the prosecutorial system. In cases of mass gatherings, the 
</p>
<p>prosecutors worked to ensure that public order was maintained and to protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>all citizens, not just that of participants. Prosecutors played an important role in preventing 
</p>
<p>illegal immigration, in the light of the threat of terrorism, and were also engaged in 
</p>
<p>monitoring the Internet to gather evidence on issues such as trafficking in human beings, 
</p>
<p>drug trafficking and threats to public order. They also thoroughly investigated all complains 
</p>
<p>of torture or inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>58. The delegation outlined the policies of Belarus on the execution of sanctions, 
</p>
<p>including the legal framework, and noted that compulsory labour for prisoners did not 
</p>
<p>constitute forced labour under the terms of the conventions of the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization. Prison management authorities were open to cooperation with civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, including international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and there 
</p>
<p>was a State system for oversight of penal institutions which also included judicial oversight. 
</p>
<p>NGOs could participate in the commissions for oversight and also had access to the 
</p>
<p>correctional institutions outside of the commission, as did religious organizations. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, NGOs could participate in rehabilitation activities. 
</p>
<p>59. Belarus had been cooperating with the United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and had invited the special procedures to visit the country, but responses had not yet been 
</p>
<p>received. However, it did not support the mandates of the special procedures that violated 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council resolutions on institution-building. The political engagement of 
</p>
<p>certain mandate holders was not conducive to respectful dialogue and they had thus not 
</p>
<p>been invited. Belarus had cooperated actively with OHCHR and in 2011, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner had been invited to visit. Technical cooperation activities had been 
</p>
<p>undertaken and consultations on the possible creation of an Ombudsman had also included </p>


<p>international experts, representatives of the Council of Europe and civil society, and 
</p>
<p>representatives of organizations that did not support the Government&#8217;s policies. The Vienna 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action gave States the right to decide upon the appropriate 
</p>
<p>national structures.  
</p>
<p>60. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons enjoyed equality, including 
</p>
<p>the availability of free sex-change surgery. 
</p>
<p>61. Denmark welcomed the release of Ales Bialiatski, but remained concerned at the 
</p>
<p>situation regarding freedom of expression and assembly and remaining political prisoners. 
</p>
<p>62. Ecuador acknowledged the implementation of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations on free education and the national action plan on gender equality. 
</p>
<p>63. Egypt welcomed steps to combat human trafficking and prevent torture, and legal 
</p>
<p>reforms, particularly amendments to the Labour and Criminal Procedure Codes. 
</p>
<p>64. El Salvador commended efforts to implement universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations and the priority given to implementation of the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals. 
</p>
<p>65. Estonia noted increased engagement in discussing human rights but regretted the 
</p>
<p>fact that Belarus refused to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights in Belarus.  
</p>
<p>66. Ethiopia commended the wide coverage of social services, such as access to medical 
</p>
<p>services and elementary and secondary education. 
</p>
<p>67. Finland was concerned about reports of discrimination and profiling of members of 
</p>
<p>the Roma community, but noted positive practices in ensuring their access to primary 
</p>
<p>education. 
</p>
<p>68. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Germany appreciated the fact that there had been positive signs from Belarus on 
</p>
<p>human rights, but was concerned that the overall human rights situation remained dire. 
</p>
<p>70. Ghana commended the inclusion of torture in the Criminal Code as well as other 
</p>
<p>changes relating to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>71. Greece was concerned about violations of the right to freedom of assembly, 
</p>
<p>restrictions on Internet freedom and other issues. 
</p>
<p>72. Guatemala welcomed the accession of Belarus to the Convention on the Rights of </p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and its adoption of the law on international labour migration.  
</p>
<p>73. The Holy See welcomed the 2012 Trafficking in Persons Act and commended 
</p>
<p>measures to support families with children. 
</p>
<p>74. Hungary noted endeavours to establish a national human rights institution and 
</p>
<p>efforts to eliminate domestic violence and protect women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>75. India commended the clearance of the backlog of reports to the treaty bodies and 
</p>
<p>noted cooperation with the special procedures. It appreciated the achievements Belarus had 
</p>
<p>made in terms of the Millennium Development Goals and encouraged it to strengthen its 
</p>
<p>capacities in pursuit of gender parity. 
</p>
<p>76. Indonesia appreciated the comparative analysis of national legislation with the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and noted the study conducted on 
</p>
<p>establishing a national human rights institution.  </p>


<p>77. The Islamic Republic of Iran commended measures that Belarus had taken 
</p>
<p>concerning children&#8217;s rights, health care, the elimination of domestic violence, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>78. Iraq noted the adoption of legislation on education and on migrants and the 
</p>
<p>submission of reports to treaty bodies, including the common core document. 
</p>
<p>79. Ireland urged Belarus to promote wider use of the Belarusian language in all areas of 
</p>
<p>life, including education and culture. 
</p>
<p>80. Italy welcomed the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
</p>
<p>against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p>81. Japan appreciated steps taken to implement the National Action Plan for Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality. 
</p>
<p>82. Kazakhstan welcomed the efforts Belarus had made in the areas of children&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights, counter-trafficking, education and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>83. Kuwait commended Belarus for its adoption of legislation promoting human rights, 
</p>
<p>which aimed to achieve equality among its citizens. 
</p>
<p>84. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic welcomed the accession of Belarus to 
</p>
<p>several international instruments, its progress in improving medical services, and the 
</p>
<p>measures it had taken to meet the Millennium Development Goals, combat human 
</p>
<p>trafficking and achieve gender equality. 
</p>
<p>85. Latvia remained concerned about the human rights situation in Belarus, in particular 
</p>
<p>with regard to freedom of assembly, association and expression. 
</p>
<p>86. Lithuania noted the progress that had been made in certain areas with regard to its 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>87. Luxembourg was concerned about restrictions that were placed on human rights

<p>defenders and journalists and urged Belarus to cooperate with the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>88. Malaysia noted the efforts and progress made in the establishment of a national 
</p>
<p>human rights institution, poverty alleviation, women&#8217;s rights and the promotion of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>89. Mexico commended the progress made concerning the Millennium Development

<p>the situation of human rights in Belarus and to abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>91. Morocco noted the willingness of Belarus to eradicate poverty and reduce 
</p>
<p>unemployment and maternal and infant mortality and the measures it was taking to combat 
</p>
<p>human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>92. Myanmar noted progress in the implementation of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Namibia commended Belarus for the amendments it had made to various legislative 
</p>
<p>instruments including the Education Code and the Presidential Decree on improving the 
</p>
<p>judicial system. 
</p>
<p>94. Belarus stated that it was among world leaders in terms of access to health care and 
</p>
<p>had fully integrated the World Health Organization Health 2020 policy into its national 
</p>
<p>policies. Access was equal for all regardless of age, sex, place of residence, nationality, 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation, religion or social status. Progress had been made since the first universal </p>


<p>periodic review, inter alia, in combating tuberculosis and in sexual and reproductive health, 
</p>
<p>in cooperation with United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and United Nations Population Fund. 
</p>
<p>95. The delegation highlighted the damage caused by the Chernobyl disaster and how it 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>allowances had increased in the past four years. The poverty index for Belarus had reduced 
</p>
<p>by a factor of 8.7 in the last 14 years. Despite the ageing population, the pension age had 
</p>

<p>97. Protection of children and the family was a priority for the Government and there 
</p>
<p>had been recent increases in family allowances. Women enjoyed equal access to education 
</p>
<p>and training and in other spheres. The slight gender pay gap was down to the fact that more 
</p>
<p>men than women were employed in industry, construction and dangerous professions, 
</p>
<p>which provided higher remuneration. Men and women received equal pay for equal work. 
</p>
<p>Recently adopted legislation and government programmes ensured that persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities enjoyed unhindered access to social infrastructure, a better quality of life and 
</p>
<p>improved integration into society. 
</p>

</p>
<p>government press conferences. The information space in Belarus was open and there were 
</p>
<p>foreign media among the 7,000 registered media organizations and 193 registered foreign 
</p>
<p>television stations. Some 1,573 print media publications were registered, including 
</p>
<p>publications in Russian, Belarusian and foreign languages. Amendments to the media law 
</p>
<p>in January 2015 aimed at social protection and national security had broadened electronic 
</p>
<p>access to information. While no registration was necessary for Internet access, the 
</p>
<p>legislation addressed the threats and challenges arising from pornography, drug promotion 
</p>
<p>and extremism on the Internet. A State commission was working to identify extremist 
</p>
<p>materials.
