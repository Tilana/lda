<p><i>Summary 
</i> In resolution 21/24, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to prepare a study on access to justice in the protection 
and promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples. This study outlines the right to access to 
justice as it applies to indigenous peoples, including analysis of its relationship to the rights 
of indigenous peoples to self-determination, non-discrimination and culture. It examines 
access to justice issues relevant to indigenous women, children and youth and persons with 
disabilities, as well as the potential of truth and reconciliation processes to promote access 
to justice for indigenous peoples. The study concludes with Expert Mechanism advice 
No.5.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  In resolution 21/24, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to prepare a study on access to justice in the protection 
and promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples and to present it to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism called for submissions from States, indigenous peoples, non-
State actors, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders to assist it in the 
study. The submissions received are, where permission was granted, publicly available on 
the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s website.1 The study also benefited from contributions made at the 
international expert seminar on indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice, including truth and 
reconciliation processes, held from 27 February to 1 March 2013, organized by the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Columbia University 
Institute for the Study of Human Rights and the International Center for Transitional 
Justice. The Expert Mechanism appreciates the submissions and is informed by them. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Access to justice for indigenous peoples  
</b>3. Access to justice requires the ability to seek and obtain remedies for wrongs through 
institutions of justice, formal or informal, in conformity with human rights standards.2 It is 
essential for the protection and promotion of all other human rights. The United Nations has 
committed itself to taking all necessary steps to provide access to justice for all.3<b> 
</b>4. Access to justice is of particular importance &#8220;given the gravity of the issues facing 
indigenous peoples, including discrimination in criminal justice systems, particularly for 
indigenous women and youth. Overrepresentation of indigenous peoples in incarceration is 
a global concern.&#8221;4  It raises issues of both procedural fairness and substantive justice, 
including fair, just and equitable remedies for violations of human rights. Access to justice 
cannot be examined in isolation from other human rights issues, including structural 
discrimination, poverty, lack of access to health and education, and lack of recognition of 
rights to culture and lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>5. In conformity with the right to self-determination, indigenous peoples must have 
access to justice externally, from States, and internally, through indigenous customary and 
traditional systems.5 Indigenous peoples must have access to justice both individually and 
collectively. 
</p>
<p>6. A particular dimension of access to justice relates to overcoming long-standing 
historical injustices and discrimination, including in relation to colonization and 
dispossession of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources. Injustices of the past 
that remain unremedied constitute a continuing affront to the dignity of the group. This

  Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, at the Human Rights Council panel 
</p>
<p>discussion on access to justice for indigenous peoples, 18 September 2012. </p>


<p>contributes to continued mistrust towards the perpetrators, especially when it is the State 
that claims authority over indigenous peoples as a result of that same historical wrong. 
</p>
<p>7. Harm associated with historical injustices continues today and thus must be taken 
into account. Many of the contemporary challenges faced by indigenous peoples are rooted 
in past wrongs.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Access to justice under international law 
</b>8. As the most comprehensive international instrument elaborating the rights of 
indigenous peoples, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is 
a key starting point for any consideration of their individual and collective rights, including 
their right to access to justice. The Declaration&#8217;s overarching provision on remedies &#8211; a key 
component &#8211; is article 40:  
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to access to and prompt decision through just and 
fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts and disputes with States or other 
parties, as well as to effective remedies for all infringements of their individual and 
collective rights. Such a decision shall give due consideration to the customs, 
traditions, rules and legal systems of the indigenous peoples concerned and 
international human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Declaration is an instrument for achieving justice and is an important 
foundational framework for the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples. Its 
implementation can support the attainment of access to justice for indigenous peoples. 
</p><p>10. The Declaration&#8217;s numerous relevant provisions include rights to effective 
mechanisms for the prevention of, and redress for, inter alia: deprivation of cultural rights, 
dispossession of lands, territories and resources, and forced assimilation and integration 
(art. 8, para. 2); redress through effective mechanisms with respect to their cultural, 
intellectual, religious or spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed 
consent (art. 11, para. 2); just and fair redress where deprived of their means of subsistence 
and development (art. 20); processes to recognize and adjudicate the rights of indigenous 
peoples related to their lands, territories and resources (art. 27); right to redress with respect 
to lands, territories and resources confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without 
their free, prior and informed consent (art. 28); effective mechanisms for redress in 
connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other 
resources (art. 32, para. 3); the right to develop and maintain their institutional structures, 
inter alia, and their juridical systems or customs (art. 34); recognition, observance and 
enforcement of treaties (art. 37); and access to and prompt decisions through procedures 
and remedies vis-&#224;-vis infringements of indigenous peoples&#8217; individual and collective rights 
(art. 40). Many provisions provide for redress for historical wrongs, for example, article 28. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal recognition and remedies 
</b></p>
<p>11. The provisions of the Declaration should guide the interpretation of international 
human rights treaties in relation to access to justice for indigenous peoples. Elements of 
access to justice include the right to an effective remedy, procedural fairness and the need 
for States to take positive measures to enable access to justice.  
</p><p>12. The Declaration is consistent with, and elaborates upon, the rights of indigenous 
peoples to access to justice as expressed in International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries, which include rights, inter alia, to have access to legal proceedings for the </p>


<p>protection of their human rights (art. 12) and to retain their own customs and institutions 
(art. 8). The Convention further requires that, when applying national laws to indigenous 
peoples, their customs and customary laws be regarded (art. 8), and that adequate 
procedures be established to resolve land claims (art. 14). 
</p><p>13. The right to a remedy and related procedural and substantive rights essential to 
securing a remedy are protected in a wide range of international instruments.6 The United 
Nations treaty bodies have found that, when providing for remedies, they should be adapted 
so as to take account of the special vulnerability of certain categories of persons. 7 
Moreover, without the provision of reparations, the duty to provide remedies has not been 
discharged.8 Reparations can take the form of restitution, rehabilitation and measures such 
as public apologies, public memorials, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in the 
relevant laws and practices and bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights 
violations.9 The Expert Mechanism has recommended previously that, in providing redress 
to indigenous peoples for the negative impacts of State laws and policies, States should 
prioritize the views of indigenous peoples on appropriate forms of redress (A/HRC/21/53, 
para. 23).  
14. The right to equality before courts and tribunals requires procedural fairness. In 
facing criminal charges, this includes being informed promptly and adequately in an 
appropriate language of the charges; communication with counsel of one&#8217;s own choosing; 
and the free assistance of an interpreter. In particular, measures are to be taken to ensure 
that indigenous peoples can understand and be understood in legal proceedings.10 Access to 
legal aid, including assistance of counsel, is often an essential element in ensuring access to 
courts, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination have been construed 
by their respective treaty bodies as encompassing rights to counsel in civil and criminal 
cases.11 
</p>
<p>15. Under international law, States must take positive measures to enable realization of 
human rights, including through the removal of economic, social and cultural barriers to 
access to justice.12 In addition to the adoption of legislative measures, such measures may 
include administrative, financial, educational and social measures, 13  the provision of 
judicial remedies,14 and the establishment of national commissions or other appropriate 
bodies.15 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has found that positive

<p> 
</p>
<p>6
  Such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Human rights treaty bodies have 
</p>
<p>outlined the need for access to effective remedies to guarantee the realization of many human rights.

(1998); and Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, communication No.

<p>measures to be taken by States in relation to the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural 
rights include making available and accessible appropriate remedies and establishing 
appropriate venues for redress such as courts, tribunals or administrative mechanisms that 
are accessible to all on an equal basis, including the most disadvantaged men and women.16 
In the light of the historic abuses experienced by indigenous peoples, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is particularly 
noteworthy, as it recognizes the need for special measures to deal with discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional human rights jurisprudence 
</b>16. Regional human rights conventions, including the American Convention on Human 
Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, include the right to a remedy. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights provides that every individual has the right to have his or her cause heard, which 
necessarily requires provision of a remedy. The Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights has required positive State action to remove barriers to access to justice.17 
17. Indigenous peoples have sought justice under international law and associated 
processes, especially within human rights frameworks. International human rights bodies 
have developed human rights jurisprudence to provide substantive justice for indigenous 
peoples and to expand their access points of justice. 
18. Positive examples of international human rights jurisprudence include decisions that 
expand on domestic protection of the rights of indigenous peoples.18 Examples include the 
decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in <i>Saramaka People</i> v. <i>Suriname</i> 
and that of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in <i>Centre for Minority 
Rights Development (Kenya) and Minority Rights Group International on behalf of 
Endorois Welfare Council</i> v. <i>Kenya</i>. They provide a platform for further action by the 
indigenous peoples. As noted about <i>Saramaka</i>, &#8220;it is platform of identity, constituted by 
formal recognition (the Saramaka are the bearers of international indigenous rights) and by 
substantive recognition (they possess title to their territory, and participation, resource-
sharing and impact assessment rights)&#8221;.19  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The relationship between access to justice and other rights of 
indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>19. The right to self-determination is a central right for indigenous peoples from which 
all other rights flow. In relation to access to justice, self-determination affirms their right to 
maintain and strengthen indigenous legal institutions, and to apply their own customs and 
laws.  
</p>

<p>19
  Ibid. &#8220;The closer the attention and the more specific the descriptions international law offers of what 
</p>
<p>changes are needed in domestic law, the more the intervention translates relatively abstract 
international human and indigenous rights into concrete legal entitlements cognizable to the domestic 
legal order in question in a programmatic way, the firmer the foundation that an international legal 
decision will provide to indigenous political mobilization.&#8221; (Ibid.) </p>


<p>20. Simultaneously, indigenous peoples have the right &#8220;to participate fully, if they so 
choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State&#8221;.20 Here, the right to 
self-determination requires recognition of the legal standing of indigenous peoples as 
collectives, and of their representative institutions, to seek redress in appropriate forums.21 
Moreover, in these cases, remedies must be collective. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>21. Indigenous peoples have faced considerable challenges in obtaining international 
and national respect for their self-determination, in part due to State fears that such 
recognition could undermine States&#8217; own legal, economic, cultural and other forms of 
authority. 
</p>
<p>22. The Expert Mechanism is aware of long-standing complaints from indigenous 
peoples that they lack standing to bring complaints relating to loss of sovereignty and self-
determination under international law or to enforce treaties between indigenous peoples and 
States, for example standing as States before the International Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>23. To address instances of non-recognition, reference should be made to jurisprudence 
at all levels where there has been recognition of the collective legal personality of 
indigenous peoples and their communities. 22  Another solution identified was the 
development of a voluntary &#8220;optional protocol&#8221; to the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.23 Notably, the draft American Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples includes a provision that, where disputes regarding treaties, agreements 
and other constructive arrangements cannot be resolved, these shall be submitted to 
competent bodies, including regional and international bodies, by States or indigenous 
peoples.24 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>24. The pre-emptory norm of non-discrimination, a fundamental pillar of international 
human rights law, requires that indigenous peoples have access to justice on an equal basis 
to the general population. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers  
</b></p>
<p>25. In all regions, often as a result of structural discrimination, indigenous peoples are 
disproportionately more likely to experience poor economic and social conditions, 
including poverty and lack of equal access to appropriate education, health services, 
employment, vocational training and housing. These factors contribute to social problems 
among indigenous peoples such as alcoholism and violence, which bear directly upon 
indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice and on the adequacy of justice services they receive. 
</p>

<p>All of the above are contributing factors that bear on the ability of indigenous individuals 
and peoples to gain access to justice.  
</p><p>26. Challenges also include discriminatory laws and practices, lack of funding necessary 
to seek justice, including legal aid,25 insufficient numbers of indigenous judges and lawyers, 
and biases against indigenous peoples and individuals involved in legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>27. States must provide remedies, reparations and, where appropriate, public apologies, 
public memorials and guarantees of non-repetition for violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
right to freedom from discrimination.26 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>28. The cultural rights of indigenous peoples include recognition and practice of their 
justice systems (A/HRC/21/53, para. 21), as well as recognition of their traditional customs, 
values and languages by courts and legal procedures.27 Cultural rights are interrelated with 
the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples, and therefore, to access to justice, as 
set out by numerous provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, specifically articles 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 25, 31 and 36.   
</p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>29. Cultural rights often go unrecognized. In the case of linguistic rights, for example, 
challenges include a lack of bilingual interpreters and training in indigenous languages 
informing people about mechanisms that facilitate access to justice.28 A 2012 study in 
Guatemala found that the majority of indigenous inmates in selected prisons had not been 
offered language-appropriate legal services or information in indigenous languages 
regarding their detention.29 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>30. Positive examples include measures to ensure the use of indigenous languages in 
courts,30 as well as providing for training of officials on indigenous history, legal traditions 
and customs.31 
</p>
<p>31. A notable example of efforts to ensure culturally appropriate justice is the Cree 
Court, a circuit court handling criminal and child protection matters established by the 
Saskatchewan Provincial Court of Canada. The Cree Court conducts hearings entirely or 
partially in Cree and encourages the participation of community leaders in the criminal 
justice system, recognizing the community&#8217;s role in supporting both the victims and the

</p>
<p><b> V. Key areas for advancing the right of indigenous peoples to 
access to justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Advancing access to justice through national courts 
</b>32. At the national and regional levels, strategic litigation, education, outreach and 
advocacy can help to expand access to justice and protections for the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 33  One example is the Maya Joint Programme in Guatemala, which seeks to 
empower indigenous organizations to use litigation to demand recognition of their rights. It 
includes training and has focused on cases addressing indigenous rights to lands and 
territories; bilingual intercultural education; identity; and the promotion of indigenous 
languages. Positive outcomes have included a court ruling restoring the property of 4,185 
hectares to the Kaqchikel Maya community of Chuarrancho. The decision provides a legal 
basis for recognition of ancestral lands and indigenous forms of organization. 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has noted, in the context of a successful case brought against 
the Government of Uganda by the Benet people on eviction from their lands, that successful 
litigation helps to expand access points to justice for indigenous peoples and encourages 
them to fight for their rights through legal means.34  
</p>
<p>34. There is support for the participation of victims in trials at the International Criminal 
Court.35 The Expert Mechanism encourages indigenous peoples to pursue this as an option 
where relevant, along with the principles of universal jurisdiction.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues relating to the rights of indigenous peoples to lands, territories 
and resources 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Declaration affirms that States are to establish and implement processes to 
recognize and adjudicate the rights of indigenous peoples as related to their lands, 
territories and resources (art. 27). The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has held that 
States must provide indigenous peoples with an effective and efficient remedy for resolving 
claims to their ancestral territories and that failure to do so can amount to violation of the 
rights to a fair trial and to effective judicial protection.36 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>36. Indigenous peoples face difficulties in obtaining adequate access to justice with 
respect to their rights as related to lands, territories and resources, especially where these 
are or have been claimed by States, private owners, businesses or others. Challenges 
include lack of access to legal services and collusion between private sector entities and

<p>Governments to deprive indigenous peoples of access to justice for their lands.37 Where 
indigenous peoples have won land rights cases in courts, States must implement these 
decisions.  
</p>
<p>37. Despite the responsibility of businesses to respect international human rights law, 
indigenous peoples face difficulties in seeking reparations for human rights violations 
caused by business. Moreover, redress mechanisms for issues arising from development 
and private sector projects may not be into place, resulting in impunity for serious human 
rights abuses.38 
</p>
<p>38. Indigenous leaders and individuals have been subjected to various forms of abuse, 
including harassment, physical violence and extrajudicial executions, in instances where 
they have supported campaigns against commercial activities on indigenous territories.39 
Furthermore, criminal processes in some instances are lodged against indigenous 
organizations seeking to defend their rights, and the media are used to characterize 
indigenous peoples as delinquents or even criminals.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>39. Some States have established specific mechanisms for the investigation of 
indigenous land rights, such as the Specific Claims Tribunal Act of Canada and the 
Finnmark Commission of Norway. 
</p>
<p>40. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has found that, in the case of violation of 
land rights, restitution is the ideal form of reparation.40 Where indigenous peoples have been 
deprived of lands and territories traditionally owned or otherwise inhabited or used without 
their free and informed consent, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
has found that the State should take steps to return those lands and territories. Only when this 
is for factual reasons impossible should the right to restitution be substituted by the right to 
just, fair and prompt compensation, which should, as far as possible, take the form of lands 
and territories.41 
</p>
<p><b> C. Issues relating to the administration of criminal justice in relation to 
indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>41. Available data indicates that indigenous peoples are often overrepresented in all 
contact with the criminal justice system: they are more likely to be victims of crimes,42 
often committed by non-indigenous perpetrators; and they are more likely to have contact 
with the police and be charged with offences, convicted of offenses and receive harsher 
sentences.43 
</p>

<p>42
  For example, in the United States of America, Native Americans are more than twice as likely as 
</p>
<p>members of the general population to be the victims of violent crime. (United States Department of 
Justice, &#8220;American Indians and Crime: a BJS Statistical Profile, 1992-2002&#8221; (2004)). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43
  See, for example, Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada, &#8220;Spirit matters: aboriginal people 
</p>
<p>and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act&#8221;, 2012. </p>


<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>42. Where indigenous peoples are victims of crimes, in some cases, the response is 
inadequate, including as a result of insufficient State support for appropriate policing,44 or 
where there is a lack of impartiality on the part of law enforcement agencies.45 Access to 
justice can be blocked where law enforcement is not available or its officers fail to act 
appropriately, including by not recording complaints or undertaking genuine investigations. 
In some instances, State authorities decline to prosecute in cases involving indigenous 
victims. 46  Further, indigenous victims are also less likely to report crimes committed 
against them.   
</p>
<p>43. Existing data demonstrates that indigenous persons often experience 
disproportionately high rates of detention. In Australia, for example, indigenous adults are 
14 times more likely to be imprisoned.47 Such figures demonstrate discrimination in all 
stages of criminal justice systems.48  
</p><p>44. In detention, indigenous peoples may face a higher likelihood of segregation and 
maximum security designation, and may be held in substandard conditions with inadequate 
access to basic services. In addition, imprisonment can cause particular challenges because 
of separation from family, community and culture.  
</p>
<p>45. The ability of indigenous persons to effectively participate in domestic criminal 
proceedings, either as victims or defendants, can be questioned on the basis of a number of 
cultural and socioeconomic factors. In addition, until discriminatory aspects of criminal 
laws and their enforcement are themselves corrected, access to justice systems alone will 
not be sufficient to ensure access to justice.49 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>46. Many of these inequalities have been addressed by the United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies. For example, in relation to administration of justice, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called on States to ensure equal access to justice 
for all communities by providing legal aid, facilitating group claims, encouraging NGOs to 
defend community rights; to ensure that judicial authorities and officials take the 
protections in the Convention into account; and to encourage descent-based communities to 
become police and other law enforcement and justice officials.50 In their submissions to the 
Expert Mechanism, a number of States, including Japan, Finland and Norway, noted 
measures to help overcome such inequalities. 
</p>
<p>47. In terms of sentencing, international law provides that, in imposing penalties on 
indigenous persons, their economic, social and cultural characteristics should be

<p>considered, and preference should be given to methods of rehabilitation other than prison.51 
In some cases, States have passed laws or undertaken initiatives in this regard.  
</p>
<p>48. The Penal Code of Peru includes a number of provisions intended to ensure 
consideration of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural rights, including a reduction or exemption of 
sentences in cases where an indigenous defendant has committed a crime under different 
cultural parameters.52 In Canada, efforts to address high incarceration levels include the 
Gladue sentencing principles, which seek to address overrepresentation of indigenous 
persons in custody, where possible, by compelling judges to pay particular attention to the 
unique circumstances of indigenous peoples and their social histories in determining 
suitable sentence for indigenous offenders.53  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Indigenous peoples&#8217; legal systems 
</b></p>
<p>49. Tribal justice systems are diverse. In some cases, indigenous justice systems employ 
adversarial processes while others conduct traditional dispute resolution. Many indigenous 
courts apply written or positive law and others are guided by unwritten customary laws, 
traditions and practices that may be learned primarily by example and through oral 
teachings.54 Indigenous justice systems often reflect closely the cultures and mores of the 
peoples concerned, contributing to their legitimacy. In some cultures, indigenous women 
play an important role, such as the Naga women in north-east India.55 
</p>
<p>50. For many indigenous peoples, customary norms and laws that govern relationships 
are accepted as correct and beneficial for generating harmonious relationships and 
communities.56 Customary justice mechanisms are often more accessible than domestic 
State systems, because of their cultural relevance, availability and proximity.  
</p>
<p>51. Despite their long usage, there may also be challenges associated with the 
administration of traditional justice. These include the difficulties of applying complex 
norms that may vary considerably among local communities. This may also include 
processes that give collective concerns paramount importance over individual rights, such 
as in the context of domestic or sexual violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>52. Forms of restorative justice have been practiced in many regions. In contrast to 
many mainstream criminal justice practices, restorative justice often focuses on healing the 
harm caused by events or criminal acts and, in working towards this goal, involving all of 
those impacted by the event, including the parties, families and members of the community. 
The purpose of restorative justice may go beyond the immediate dispute to also heal the 
relationships of those involved. Indigenous restorative justice practices have contributed to 
restorative approaches more generally, demonstrating alternatives to punitive or retribution-
based approaches.57

<p><b> A. International and State recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; justice 
systems 
</b></p>
<p>53. United Nations bodies, including human rights treaty bodies and special procedures, 
as well as regional mechanisms, have highlighted the need for recognition of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; justice mechanisms in legal systems. A key priority in reports of the special 
procedures has been indigenous peoples&#8217; right to practice their own legal systems.58 For 
example, issues of concern have included: limitations on the jurisdiction of indigenous 
judicial authorities; requirements that persons who administer traditional justice have 
formal legal training; certification of expert elders; subordination of indigenous justice 
systems to ordinary justice systems; and the failure to raise awareness among judicial 
officials about the rights of indigenous peoples to administer their own justice 
(A/HRC/17/30/Add.3, paras. 80&#8211;81).  
</p><p>54. State recognition of indigenous justice systems and their jurisdiction over criminal 
matters also varies. At the domestic level, some States formally recognize traditional justice 
systems.59 In Latin America, many national constitutional frameworks, including nearly all 
of the countries of the Andean region,60 recognize the jurisdiction of indigenous authorities 
and their authority to apply customary laws. The Canadian Human Rights Act requires that 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Tribunal and courts consider First Nations&#8217; 
legal traditions and customary laws when applying the Act.61  
</p>
<p>55. Indigenous peoples often continue to struggle to have their institutions and systems, 
including legal systems, traditional laws and approaches to justice, recognized. In some 
cases, customary laws are recognized in legislation but often with limitations, subject to 
jurisdictional limitations or so-called repugnancy clauses, which provide that customary 
laws are recognized where they do not conflict with domestic laws. 62  Such provisions 
undermine and discriminate against indigenous peoples&#8217; legal systems. However, there may 
be a growing recognition of the need for greater tribal authority over criminal matters, as 
evidenced, for example, by the 2013 re-enactment of the United States Violence against 
Women Act, which included landmark provisions reducing federal restrictions on tribal 
jurisdiction and empowering Native American tribal authorities to prosecute non-Native 
Americans for abuses committed on tribal lands. 
</p>
<p>56. In some cases, States themselves challenge indigenous judicial practices, often based 
on arguments that customary systems are discriminatory or inconsistent with domestic or 
international standards. It is important to note that the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires compliance with international human rights 
standards but does not include a similar provision regarding national systems.63

<p>57. Where indigenous persons are subject to both indigenous peoples&#8217; laws and also 
State-based justice systems for the same alleged actions, they run the risk of being subject 
to prosecution under two legal systems. The problem is exacerbated where the State-based 
system does not recognize the indigenous peoples&#8217; system. In such cases, the tribal system 
should be paramount. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Linking indigenous peoples and State justice systems 
</b>58. Some positive examples exist of States&#8217; recognition of and cooperation with 
indigenous justice systems. In New Zealand, where Maori youth comprise 20 per cent of 
the youth population but 54 per cent of young people appearing in court,64 youth may be 
diverted from the conventional justice system to Marae-based courts, which aim to 
reconnect young Maori with their culture and encourage the meaningful involvement of 
families and iwi in the youth justice process to contribute to reduced risk of reoffending.65 
59. After studying the peacemaking processes practiced by the Navajo Nation and other 
tribes across the United States and Canada, the Center for Court Innovation, a federally 
funded NGO, invited Navajo peacemakers to contribute to the initiation of a peacemaking 
programme by non-indigenous individuals in Red Hook, Brooklyn in the United States. The 
programme is now applying principles of peacemaking to resolve disputes.66  
</p>
<p>60. In some cases, States have sought to codify the customary laws of indigenous 
peoples. In Greenland, until 2010, criminal justice was conducted on the basis of the 1954 
Act on the Criminal Code. The Act was rooted in indigenous Greenlandic perceptions of 
justice, which focused greatly on rehabilitation. As a result, Greenland did not have 
conventional prisons but rather open institutions where the offender, after sentencing, had 
to stay and perhaps undergo treatment, while able to pursue employment or training 
opportunities. As of 2010, a new and revised law on the administration of justice in 
Greenland entered into force which, although maintaining the principle of rehabilitation, 
also made it possible to sentence criminal offenders to so-called semi-closed institutions.67 
</p>
<p>61. Sarawak, Malaysia, established the Majlis Adat Isti Adat (Council for the 
Preservation of Customs) for the purpose of preserving native customs. Through a process 
of consultation with the elders and members of indigenous communities, the Council 
codified customary law, selecting versions that were the common practice in all the 
communities to ensure credibility and acceptability. Codification may facilitate the linking 
of State and customary justice systems and have benefits, for example, by making complex 
systems accessible and understood by younger generations and the general public. It can 
also contribute to greater local acceptance for decisions made, for example, by Elder 
Senates or Councils. At the same time, codification can affect the fluid and informal nature 
of the original and living customary laws.68

<p><b> VII. Access to justice for specific groups  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>62. Multiple discrimination, structural violence and poverty are among the root causes 
of indigenous women&#8217;s lack of access to justice. Indigenous women are disproportionately 
represented in the criminal justice system and, in some cases, the numbers are growing. In 
Canada, for example, in 2010/11, Aboriginal women accounted for over 31.9 per cent of all 
federally incarcerated women, representing an increase of 85.7 per cent over the previous 
decade.69  Reference can be made to the recently published report <i>Breaking the Silence on 
Violence against Indigenous Girls, Adolescents and Young Women</i> produced by the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
ILO, UN-Women and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children. 
</p>
<p>63. In many regions, indigenous women face significant barriers to criminal justice at all 
stages. They can experience a higher incidence of violence, including sexual violence, and 
an increased risk of violations to their sexual and reproductive health and rights, including 
an increased risk of HIV/AIDS in prisons. The ability of indigenous justice systems to 
address violence experienced by indigenous women is sometimes limited by State-imposed 
jurisdictional restrictions. In some cases, there may also be a need for tribal justice systems 
to strengthen their willingness and ability to protect indigenous women and girls from 
violence.70 Moreover, in some instances, traditional justice systems are male dominated,71 
and may not adequately address indigenous women&#8217;s access to resources.  
</p>
<p>64. Where traditional justice systems are unable to address violence against indigenous 
women, they must turn to the national justice system. However, in some instances, 
allegations of police abuse, including excessive use of force and physical and sexual 
assault, exist,72 leaving indigenous women in a precarious situation with few options in 
terms of reporting abuse. For those living in remote regions, law enforcement may not be 
on hand to respond to reports or to conduct a prompt investigation, and women may not 
have access to forensic examinations often used to gather physical evidence of sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>65. International human rights law requires that States take all measures to ensure 
equality before the law. 73  States are also to ensure women&#8217;s equal right to conclude 
contracts and administer property.74 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women has noted with concern the lack of women, including indigenous women,75

officers.77 The Committee has further noted that laws or customs that limit a woman&#8217;s 
access to legal advice or ability to seek remedy before courts, or accord lesser value to a 
female testimony, violate the right to equality before the law.78  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Indigenous children and youth 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>66. While little systematic data exists regarding indigenous youth, existing statistics 
point to their overrepresentation throughout the justice system.79 In its general comment 
No. 11 (2009), the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted with concern such 
disproportionately high rates of incarceration, observing that, in some instances, these may 
be attributed to systematic discrimination within the justice system and society (para. 74).  
</p><p>67. Indigenous youth may be more likely to be detained as a result of laws with 
discriminatory effect, such as curfew breaching and &#8220;move on&#8221; laws, which 
disproportionately affect indigenous youth who make greater use of public space as a 
cultural space and for congregation and socialization due to lower levels of property 
ownership.80 Once in custody, indigenous youth may be less likely to benefit from non-
custodial sentencing options or restorative justice measures, and more likely to receive the 
most punitive measures81 and to be subjected to the harshest treatments, such as being 
placed in secure confinement.82 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies

<p>68. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has called upon States to both take 
measures to address juvenile crimes without resorting to judicial proceedings wherever 
possible and also to support traditional restorative justice systems to the extent they 
promote the best interests of the child. 83  The Committee has also called on States to 
develop juvenile justice systems in consultation with indigenous peoples and has further 
identified the need for access to culturally appropriate services in juvenile justice.84  
</p><p>69. Some appropriate measures are under way. For example, the Expert Mechanism 
received information about the Marae-based court system (New Zealand) described above.

</p>
<p>70. The Expert Mechanism also received information on the importance of including 
indigenous youth, who may experience systemic violence without understanding historical 
and policy-related causes, in truth-seeking processes. Such engagement can help youth to 
participate in broader processes of seeking justice. This can validate the experiences of 
elders who have survived historical injustices and abuse.85 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>71. Indigenous persons with disabilities experience multiple forms of discrimination 
based on their indigenous status and also on disability, and often face barriers to the full 
enjoyment of their rights.  
</p><p>72. Indigenous persons with disabilities face considerable obstacles, such as physical 
inaccessibility to domestic or traditional courts. In relation to family law, indigenous 
parents with disabilities may face a heightened risk of having their children apprehended.86  
</p>
<p>73. While data is scarce, that available suggests that indigenous persons with disabilities 
also experience disproportionately high rates of incarceration.87 Concerns exist regarding 
their treatment in prisons where, among other challenges,88 there may be no access to 
necessary services, including psychological and psychiatric assistance.89 
</p>
<p>74. Disproportionate representation of indigenous persons with mental health disabilities 
in detention raises concerns that indigenous persons with mental illness or intellectual or 
cognitive disabilities are not receiving needed attention. This implicates other human rights, 
including access to adequate health services, housing and care and support services. It also 
points to the need for increased training and awareness on mental health disabilities, 
including foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, by justice system officials. 90 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Declaration calls for specific attention to the rights and special needs of 
indigenous persons with disabilities (arts. 21 and 22). The situation of persons with 
disabilities who are subject to multiple forms of discrimination is addressed by the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which establishes that States parties 
are to ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with 
others (art. 13).

<p>76. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has commented in its 
concluding observations on the situation of indigenous persons with disabilities and their 
access to justice. Its relevant observations to date have focused on ensuring equality and 
non-discrimination,91 the importance of disaggregated data and statistics;92 and the need to 
consider the situation of indigenous children.93 
</p>
<p>77. Furthermore, indigenous and State systems should ensure accessibility of their 
systems to indigenous persons with disabilities (i.e. by providing sign language, accessible 
premises and information available in alternative formats). The United Nations system can 
ensure that websites and reports are accessible by using web content accessibility 
guidelines (WCAG standards) and posting documents in Microsoft Word. The report 
entitled &#8220;Study on the situation of indigenous persons with disabilities, with a particular 
focus on challenges faced with regard to the full enjoyment of human rights and inclusion 
in development&#8221; by the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues is insightful.94   
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Access to justice, truth and reconciliation and indigenous 
peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous peoples and transitional justice processes  
</b>78. An avenue to explore with a view to attaining indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice 
are the processes and mechanisms associated with transitional justice, which are concerned 
with how societies emerging from conflict or repressive rule address the legacy of 
violations of human rights.   
</p>
<p>79. The objectives behind transitional justice and the measures implemented in their 
pursuit can resonate with indigenous peoples&#8217; objectives and conceptions of appropriate 
means to achieve justice, and peace, in the long term. Transitional justice processes and 
mechanisms in conformity with international human rights norms and standards should 
strive to take account of the root causes of conflict and address the related violations of all 
rights. In the case of indigenous peoples, this includes human rights violations arising in 
situations of conflict, where indigenous peoples often figure prominently among victimized 
populations, as well as grievances associated with indigenous peoples&#8217; loss of sovereignty, 
lands, territories and resources and breaches of treaties, agreements and other constructive 
arrangements between indigenous peoples and States, as well as their collective experiences 
of colonization.  
</p>
<p>80. The international normative and operational framework utilized by the United 
Nations for a human rights-based approach to transitional justice is found in two 
documents: the updated set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), and the Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of 
International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law.95

<p>95
  General Assembly resolution 60/147, annex. </p>


<p>81. The updated set of principles promotes a broad concept of justice based on the right 
to know (also known as the right to the truth), the right to justice, the right to reparation and 
guarantees of non-recurrence. These rights are underpinned by international legal 
obligations that have been explicitly recognized in several international and regional human 
rights treaties and instruments (including the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance). 
</p><p>82. The right to the truth provides that all persons have the right to know the truth about 
past events concerning the commission of heinous crimes and about the circumstances and 
reasons that led to the perpetration of those crimes. In particular, victims and their families 
have the right to know the truth about the circumstances in which violations took place and, 
in the event of death or disappearance, the victims&#8217; fate. The duty to provide guarantees to 
give effect to the right to know requires States, inter alia, to ensure the independent and 
effective operation of the judiciary, and may include the creation of truth commissions that 
complement the role of the judiciary. 
83.  The right to justice refers to the duties of States with regard to the administration of 
justice; in particular, States must ensure that those responsible for serious crimes under 
international law are prosecuted, tried and duly punished. The right to reparation implies a 
State duty to make reparations and the possibility for the victim to seek redress from the 
perpetrator. The right to reparation includes measures of restitution, compensation, 
rehabilitation and satisfaction. 
</p>
<p>84. Transitional justice consists of both judicial and non-judicial processes and 
mechanisms, including prosecutions, truth-seeking, reparations programmes, institutional 
reform, or an appropriate combination thereof.96 These mechanisms are interlinked and one 
does not replace another. While the present study focuses largely on truth commissions, 
other relevant measures to guarantee the rights to truth and justice include international 
criminal tribunals, national criminal proceedings, commissions of inquiry, official archives 
and historical projects. For example, the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia is 
currently conducting a National Inquiry into the Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 
Malaysia, focused on root causes of problems associated with customary rights to land. 
</p>
<p>85. To address the needs and rights of indigenous peoples, transitional justice processes 
should be adapted to ensure cultural appropriateness and consistency with customary legal 
practices and concepts concerning justice and conflict resolution. Such processes will be 
enriching to transitional justice procedures. Regarding cases of mass atrocity against 
indigenous peoples, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, the design 
and implementation of transitional justice policies should use customary practices as 
appropriate.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Truth commissions 
</b></p>
<p>86. Truth commissions have on many occasions been established in nations where there 
are indigenous peoples and, in some instances, have addressed issues facing indigenous 
peoples even where they have not been the specific focus. The involvement of indigenous 
peoples in these processes has varied, ranging from not being included at all, to more recent 
instances of truth commissions established specifically to address rights violations 
experienced by indigenous peoples, where indigenous peoples have led the processes from 
their initiation.  
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>96
  Guidance note of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Approach to Transitional Justice, 
</p>
<p>March 2010, p. 2.  </p>


<p>87. Examples of the latter include the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 
and, in the United States, the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. The Canadian Commission, led by indigenous peoples, is 
examining State-sponsored institutional harm done to indigenous children and their families 
over 150 years, perhaps the longest duration examined by a truth commission. The Maine 
Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission is working to 
document what happened to Wabanaki children in the State child welfare system; to give 
Wabanaki people an opportunity to share their experiences and begin the healing process; 
and to issue a report that includes recommendations on best child welfare practice for 
Wabanaki children and families.  
</p>
<p>88. There are numerous instances in which truth commissions have addressed, though 
not focused specifically on, the violation of rights experienced by indigenous peoples, 
including in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, Nigeria, Paraguay and Peru, among others. In the 
case of the Guatemalan Commission for Historical Clarification, in operation from 1997 to 
1999, given the magnitude of the sufferings experienced by Mayan peoples as a result of 
the internal armed conflict between 1960 and 1996, the Commission&#8217;s work ultimately 
focused considerably on their situation, describing the State as having committed acts of 
genocide against indigenous peoples.   
</p>
<p>89. In many cases, however, truth commissions have failed to address the needs of 
indigenous peoples in any significant ways. In such instances, indigenous peoples are 
completely ignored, excluded from the narrative created and not consulted or included as 
participants.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges to truth-seeking to address injustices experienced by 
indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>90. Challenges faced by truth commissions include ensuring the independence and 
credibility of the commission; political interference; inadequate funding; and ensuring 
continued participation of marginalized groups, civil society and victims&#8217; organizations.  
</p>
<p>91. Truth commissions have also been criticized for weak outcomes, and lack of 
implementation of their recommendations or adequate follow-up. Implementation of these 
recommendations has generally been weak even where recommendations are strong. For 
example, the strong recommendations of the Commission for Historical Clarification have 
not been duly implemented, resulting in a &#8220;truth that is not embraced as a truth&#8221;.97 In the 
case of the Waitangi Tribunal of Aotearoa/New Zealand, criticisms, including by the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, included that the Government had 
rejected its findings in some significant cases.98 
</p><p>92. Lack of implementation demonstrates a wider problem, related not to the final 
outcome or report of a Commission, but rather inadequacies in the process leading up to it 
and the process of engagement. Ultimately, truth commissions will not lead to recognition 
of indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination or transform a country by themselves. However, 
the processes around them, including the building of platforms, can have transformative 
potential. For this reason, while the quality of the recommendations of truth commissions is 
important, it is insufficient. To be implemented, truth commissions need to be part of a 
larger political process that builds alliances and consensus.99 
</p>

<p>93. In terms of their suitability for indigenous peoples, there are also challenges related 
to how truth commissions have been conducted, including their tendency to focus mostly 
on recent violations and a discourse of national unity and reconciliation. In the case of 
national reconciliation, which is often a goal of truth commissions, some observers have 
questioned whether current understandings of reconciliation are appropriate in the context 
of indigenous peoples, as there is the danger of strengthening the dominant national identity 
at the expense of others.100  
</p>
<p>94. Concerns also exist regarding the dominant views represented by truth-seeking 
processes. Indigenous peoples have their own world views, which include understandings 
of justice and truth that may differ from that of the dominant society. In addition, truth 
processes have generally not been adequately inclusive of indigenous peoples, who must be 
included from the earliest stages, throughout the work of the commission and in the 
implementation of their outcomes. 
</p>
<p>95. Challenges exist even in instances where truth processes are indigenous led. For 
example, criticisms of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada include that the 
scope of its mandate is very limited, excluding, for example, the examination of issues 
associated with day students at residential schools and broader harms suffered by 
Aboriginal peoples in Canada.101 Some have argued that the Commission regarding schools 
should extend to include collective and cultural harms suffered by communities, including 
historical grievances. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Ways that truth commissions can effectively address the rights and 
concerns of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>96. There are a number of advantages to truth commissions, including that they might be 
more consistent with indigenous peoples&#8217; conceptions of justice and cultures; they can 
inspire political commitment to the resolution of grievances; 102  and they can enhance 
understandings of and public support for indigenous peoples&#8217; claims to politically sensitive 
rights such as self-determination. Generally, truth commissions are still young institutions, 
and therefore offer great scope for their enrichment with and adaptation to indigenous 
practices.  
</p>
<p>97. However, to best address the rights and concerns of indigenous peoples, transitional 
justice processes and mechanisms must take account of indigenous peoples&#8217; context and the 
root causes of the injustices experienced.   
</p><p>98. As a starting point, the participation of indigenous peoples is essential at all stages. 
A positive example of indigenous engagement comes from the Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission of Kenya. Although not specifically focused on indigenous 
peoples, the Commission provided an explicit forum for the expression of indigenous issues 
regarding historical injustices, marginalization and ethnic tension. While the Commission 
has faced challenges in other respects, in relation to the participation of indigenous peoples, 
successes included the engagement of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations from the early 
stages. The Commission: hired indigenous people as part of its staff; conducted public 
hearings allowing testimony in different languages, including Maasai; and conducted

<p>outreach to indigenous communities and organizations that addressed their rights.103 In 
Colombia, where there are ongoing debates regarding how to provide reparations for the 
victims of human rights abuses committed during the country&#8217;s internal armed conflict, 
indigenous peoples have taken a leading role in the development of a decree to address the 
issue of reparations for indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities.  
</p>
<p>99. Additional requirements for transitional justice in the indigenous context include 
that truth-seeking processes should not be viewed as a tool to legitimize the current 
governance structures but rather should proceed on a nation-to-nation basis.104 In addition, 
they should be designed to focus on historical as well as contemporary grievances suffered 
collectively.105 They should also be considered as part of a much broader strategy to address 
ongoing human rights abuses suffered by indigenous peoples, including, for example, 
political empowerment, and implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. Truth 
commissions must be accessible to indigenous peoples, which can include ensuring 
processes in indigenous languages and/or interpretation, and must ensure the participation 
of indigenous women and youth. Because the sharing of traumatic experiences can lead to 
retraumatization, culturally appropriate support services must be provided.  
</p>
<p>100. Finally, it should be recognized that, for truth commissions to succeed, the process is 
as important as the outcome.106 Commissions must include broad and ongoing consultations 
with indigenous peoples at all stages. Governments should consult in good faith and obtain 
the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples for legislative or administrative 
measures that affect them.

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Expert Mechanism advice No. 5 (2013): Access to justice in 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples should be the 
basis of all action, including at the legislative and policy levels, on the protection and 
promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to access to justice. The implementation of the 
Declaration should be seen as a framework for reconciliation and as a means of 
implementing indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice.  
</p><p>2. Access to justice concerns arise especially in the context of lands, territories and 
resources. In the promotion of peace, justice and harmonious and cooperative relations 
between States and indigenous peoples, the Declaration affirms the right to the integrity of 
their lands and territories (arts. 25&#8211;32). Indigenous peoples have the collective right to live 
in freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples (art. 7(2)). Such security includes, inter 
alia, cultural, environmental and territorial aspects. 
</p>
<p>3. Respect for the right to self-determination requires both recognition of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; systems and the need to overcome historic factors and related contemporary 
factors that negatively affect indigenous peoples in the operation of State systems. At the 
national and regional levels, strategic litigation, complemented by outreach and advocacy, 
can help to expand access to justice and protections for other rights of indigenous peoples.  
</p><p>4. Indigenous peoples&#8217; understanding of access to justice often differs from that of 
States and of businesses, in some cases informed by their own understandings of, and 
practices associated with, justice. This means that, at the outset, before undertaking 
activities to respect, promote and protect indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice, common 
understandings of the meaning of justice and the best means to attain access to justice 
should be sought, in line with indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination and related rights to 
participate in decision-making affecting them. 
</p>
<p>5. Historical injustices contribute to multiple contemporary disadvantages for 
indigenous peoples, which in turn increase the likelihood of indigenous peoples coming 
into contact with the justice system. The relationship of indigenous peoples with domestic 
criminal justice systems cannot, therefore, be considered in isolation from historical factors 
or the current economic, social and cultural status of indigenous peoples. Moreover, there 
are other areas of law, including family law, child protection law and civil law that have an 
impact on this relationship. Solutions include not only reforms to criminal justice systems 
themselves but also measures addressing the socioeconomic situation of indigenous peoples 
and all human rights of indigenous peoples which are interrelated, interdependent and 
indivisible. </p>


<p><b> B. States 
</b></p>
<p>6. Consistent with indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination and self-
government, States should recognize and provide support for indigenous peoples&#8217; own 
justice systems and should consult with indigenous peoples on the best means for dialogue 
and cooperation between indigenous and State systems.   
</p>
<p>7. States should accord recognition and assign legal validity to customary practices that 
are already carried out by indigenous authorities de facto. States should take a flexible 
approach to the establishment of jurisdictional boundaries and avoid overly restrictive 
limits to indigenous jurisdictional competencies over justice. 
</p><p>8. States should work with indigenous peoples to address the underlying issues that 
prevent indigenous peoples from having access to justice on an equal basis with others.  
9. States should work in partnership with indigenous peoples, particularly indigenous 
women, to determine the most effective strategies for overcoming barriers to access to 
justice. This includes helping to revitalize traditional justice norms and institutions.  
10. Moreover, States should facilitate and provide access to legal remedies for 
indigenous peoples and should support capacity development of indigenous communities to 
help them to understand and make use of legal systems. 
</p>
<p>11. States should consider the impact of law and policy on indigenous peoples&#8217; access to 
human rights processes and institute reform where such law and policy interferes with 
indigenous peoples&#8217; enjoyment of substantive equality in this regard.  
</p><p>12. States should recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands, territories 
and resources in laws and should harmonize laws in accordance with indigenous peoples&#8217; 
customs on possession and use of lands (including laws and policies that affect the conduct 
of business on indigenous territories) and forms of justice. Where indigenous peoples have 
won land rights and other cases in courts, States must implement these decisions. The 
private sector and the Government must not collude to deprive indigenous peoples of access 
to justice. 
13. Training and sensitization for law enforcement officials, judicial officials and other 
state agencies on the rights of indigenous peoples is recommended. 
</p>
<p>14. In relation to criminal justice, State authorities should consult and cooperate with 
indigenous peoples and their representative institutions to:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that the criminal justice system does not become a self-promoting industry 
benefiting from the overrepresentation of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Formulate plans of action to address both the high levels of indigenous victimization 
and the treatment of indigenous peoples in domestic criminal justice systems. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Develop appropriate methodologies to obtain comprehensive data on 
(a) victimization of indigenous peoples, including information on the number of 
cases prosecuted, and (b) the situation of indigenous peoples in detention, 
disaggregated by age, gender and disability. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reduce the number of indigenous individuals in prison, including through the 
pursuit of non-custodial options, such as, inter alia, use of traditional restorative and 
rehabilitative approaches. 
</p>
<p>15. In relation to transitional justice mechanisms: </p>


<p>&#8226; Indigenous peoples and indigenous peoples&#8217; representative institutions should be 
consulted and involved in all stages of the establishment and implementation of 
transitional justice mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Truth commissions should be guided by and should make explicit reference to the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Truth commissions should recognize and address the historical injustices 
experienced by indigenous peoples, as well as how failures to recognize indigenous 
peoples&#8217; self-determination historically and today have created conditions for human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Truth processes should be linked to larger outreach and education efforts. These 
efforts should include explaining important justice issues, such as self-
determination, to the broader public.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Truth processes and reparations programmes should be designed in a way that 
respects the cultures and values of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>16. Indigenous peoples should strengthen advocacy for the recognition of their justice 
systems. Indigenous peoples should strengthen their own organizations and local 
governance capacity to meet the challenges faced by their communities. 
</p>
<p>17. Indigenous peoples&#8217; justice systems should ensure that indigenous women and 
children are free from all forms of discrimination and should ensure accessibility to 
indigenous persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>18. Indigenous peoples should explore the organization and running of their own truth-
seeking processes.  
</p>
<p>19. Indigenous peoples should strive for explicit inclusion of their particular interests in 
transitional justice initiatives in those cases where indigenous peoples are one among many 
groups that suffered human rights abuse.  
</p>
<p>20. Indigenous peoples should ensure that all persons are effectively represented in 
transitional justice processes, especially women. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International institutions  
</b></p>
<p>21. The Declaration should guide the efforts of United Nations system entities and 
mandates, including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation 
and guarantees of non-recurrence.  
</p>
<p>22. The United Nations should dedicate resources to the development and carrying out, 
in cooperation with indigenous peoples, of training on the rights of indigenous peoples in 
relation to access to justice for law enforcement officials and members and staff of the 
judiciary.   
</p><p>23. The United Nations system should seek to expand programmes designed to support 
indigenous peoples to carry out strategic litigation to advance their rights and expand their 
access to justice. 
24. The United Nations should work with indigenous peoples to contribute to further 
reflection on and capacity-building regarding truth and reconciliation procedures for 
indigenous peoples. </p>


<p>25. Relevant United Nations special procedures should monitor implementation of 
transitional justice processes to ensure that they respect the principles of the Declaration, 
and that States act in a timely way on truth commission recommendations and the 
implementation of reparations programmes for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>26. National human rights institutions, in partnership with indigenous peoples, can play 
an important role in ensuring improved access to justice for indigenous peoples, including 
by encouraging recognition of and providing support for indigenous justice systems and 
promoting the implementation of the Declaration at the national level. National human 
rights institutions, in partnership with indigenous peoples, have the opportunity to provide 
training on the rights of indigenous peoples in relation to access to justice for judiciaries.
