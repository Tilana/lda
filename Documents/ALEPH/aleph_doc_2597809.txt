MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
for the three and six-month periods ended
30 June 2016 and 2015
The following report contains a discussion and analysis of the financial position of PJSC LUKOIL
at 30 June 2016 and the results of its operations for the three and six month periods ended 30
June 2016 and 2015, as well as significant factors that may affect its future performance. It should
be read in conjunction with our International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") condensed
interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the respective periods.
References to "LUKOIL," "the Company," "the Group," "we" or "us" are references to
PJSC LUKOIL and its subsidiaries and equity affiliates. All ruble amounts are in millions of
Russian rubles ("RUB"), unless otherwise indicated. Income and expenses of our foreign
subsidiaries were translated to rubles at rates which approximate actual rates at the date of the
transaction. Tonnes of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced were translated into barrels
using conversion rates characterizing the density of crude oil from each of our oilfields and the
actual density of liquids produced at our gas processing plants. Tonnes of crude oil purchased as
well as other operational indicators expressed in barrels were translated into barrels using an
average conversion rate of 7.33 barrels per tonne. Translations of cubic meters to cubic feet were
made at the rate of 35.31 cubic feet per cubic meter. Translations of barrels of crude oil into
barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") were made at the rate of 1 barrel per BOE and of cubic feet - at
the rate of 6 thousand cubic feet per BOE.
This report includes forward-looking statements - words such as "believes," "anticipates,"
"expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans," etc. - that reflect management's current estimates and
beliefs, but are not guarantees of future results.

(1) Profit from operating activities before depreciation, depletion and amortization.
(2) Cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and acquisition of licenses.
Our results for the first half of 2016 were affected by a decrease in average hydrocarbon prices
and fluctuations of ruble exchange rates to the US dollar and euro. This was partially offset by
lower mineral extraction tax and export duty rates. As far as we compensated most of the costs
incurred within the West Qurna-2 project, we were eligible for significantly lower volumes of
compensation crude oil, compared to the respective periods of 2015 that affected our EBITDA
(operating) and production volumes (see p. 6 for details). Timely upgrade of our Russian
refineries allowed to enhance our product slate and supported our financial results in unfavorable
macroeconomic environment.
In the first half of 2016, our profit amounted to 105 billion RUB and our EBITDA (operating)
amounted to 382 billion RUB, representing a decrease of 37.2% and 8.6%, respectively,
compared to the first half of 2015. Despite lower hydrocarbon prices, our net profit for the second
quarter of 2016 remained practically unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. Net of
the West Qurna-2 project, the Group's EBITDA (operating) increased by 6.8% in the second
quarter of 2016 and remained flat in the first half of 2016 compared to respective periods of 2015.
In the first half of 2016, we continued generating strong free cash flow that amounted to 93 billion
RUB, compared to 80 billion RUB in the first half of 2015.
Business overview
LUKOIL is one of the world's largest publicly traded vertically integrated energy companies in
terms of hydrocarbon reserves that amounted under SEC standards to 16.6 billion BOE at 1
January 2016 and comprised of 12.6 billion barrels of crude oil and 23.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.
Most of our reserves are conventional. Our daily hydrocarbon production in the first half of 2016
amounted to 2.2 million BOE with liquid hydrocarbons representing approximately 85% of our
overall production volumes.
The primary activities of LUKOIL and its subsidiaries are oil exploration, production, refining,
marketing and distribution.
Our operations are divided into three main business segments:
·     Exploration and Production - which includes our exploration, development and production
operations related to crude oil and gas. These activities are primarily located within Russia, with
additional activities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the Middle East, Northern and
Western Africa, Norway, Romania and Mexico.
·      Refining, Marketing and Distribution - which includes refining, petrochemical and transport
operations, marketing and trading of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, generation,
transportation and sales of electricity, heat and related services.
·      Corporate and other.
Each of our segments is dependent on the other, with a portion of the revenues of one segment
being a part of the costs of the other. In particular, our Refining, Marketing and Distribution
segment purchases crude oil from our Exploration and Production segment. As a result of certain
factors considered in the "Domestic crude oil and refined products prices" section on page 12,
benchmarking crude oil market prices in Russia cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore,
the prices set for inter-segment purchases of crude oil reflect a combination of market factors,
primarily international crude oil market prices, transportation costs, regional market conditions,
the cost of crude oil refining and other factors. Accordingly, an analysis of either of these
segments on a stand-alone basis could give a misleading impression of those segments'
underlying financial position and results of operations. For this reason, we do not analyze either
of our main segments separately in the discussion that follows. However, we present the
financial data for each in Note 28 "Segment information" to our condensed interim consolidated
financial statements.
Changes in Group structure
In line with the Company's strategy of optimization its downstream operations in Europe, we sold
petrol station networks in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania in the first quarter of 2016 and petrol
stations networks in Ukraine and Estonia in the second quarter of 2015.
In August 2015, a Group company closed the transaction to sell its 50% interest in Caspian
Investment Resources Ltd, an exploration and production company operating in Kazakhstan, to a
Sinopec group company for $1,067 million (70.1 billion RUB). Related structural decrease in the
Group's crude oil production amounted to approximately 20 thousand barrels per day.
Sectorial sanctions against the Russian companies
In July-September 2014, the United States ("US"), the European Union ("EU") and other
countries imposed a set of economic sanctions on Russia, including certain sectoral sanctions
which affect Russian oil and gas companies. Such sectoral sanctions prohibit US and the EU
companies and individuals from providing, exporting, or re-exporting directly or indirectly, goods,
services (except for financial services), or technology in support of exploration or production for
deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
The Company is not subject to any financial restrictions and is not currently involved in
deepwater, Arctic offshore or shale projects in Russia. That is why we assess the impact of the
sanctions on the Company's activities as immaterial.

We undertake exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas in Russia and
internationally. In Russia, our major oil producing subsidiaries are LUKOIL-Western Siberia,
LUKOIL-Komi and LUKOIL-PERM. Our international upstream segment includes stakes in PSA's
and other projects in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Romania, Iraq, Egypt, Ghana, Cote
d'Ivoire, Norway, Cameroon, Nigeria and Mexico.
Crude oil and natural gas liquids production. In the first half of 2016, we produced (including the
Company's share in equity affiliates) 46.8 million tonnes, or 342.8 million barrels, of crude oil,
compared to 49.6 million tonnes, or 363.4 million barrels, of crude oil in the first half of 2015.
In the first half of 2016, the output of natural gas liquids at the Group gas processing plants in
Western Siberia, Ural and Volgograd regions of Russia was 6.8 million BOE, compared to 6.6

(1) Compensation oil that represented approximately 32% of production from the West Qurna-2
field in the first half of 2016 and 52% in the first half of 2015.
The main oil producing region for the Company is Western Siberia where we produced 45.4% of
our crude oil in the first half of 2016 (46.8% in the first half of 2015).
Crude oil production in Western Siberia continued to decline due to natural depletion of reserves,
increase in water cut and the Company's decision to reallocate capital to higher return projects in
other regions of Russia, in particular those benefiting from tax incentives. We expect production
decline rates in Western Siberia to decrease as a result of our recent decision to intensify
production drilling in this region. Production growth in Timano-Pechora was primarily driven by
ramp-up of production at the Yaregskoye and Usinskoe fields, as well as the fields in
Denisovskaya depression. Production growth in Ural region was primarily driven by successful
drilling on existing brownfields and launch of new small sized fields.
The decrease in our international production was a result of lower volumes of production from the
West Qurna-2 oilfield in Iraq attributable to the Company. We compensated the major part of our
initial costs incurred within the project and therefore were eligible for less volumes of
compensation crude oil compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015 (for details see
p. 6).
The increase in our share in crude oil produced by equity affiliates in Russia was due to an
increase in production at the Trebs and Titov oilfields by Bashneft-Polus, where the Group holds
a 25.1% interest.
The decrease in our share in crude oil produced by equity affiliates outside Russia resulted from
the disposal of our 50% share in Caspian Investment Resources Ltd in the middle of 2015.
In the nearest future, we plan to start production at two new major fields, the V. Filanovskogo field
in the Caspian Sea (Volga region) and the Pyakyakhinskoye field in the Bolshekhetskaya
depression (Western Siberia). Launch of these fields will enable us to significantly increase our
daily hydrocarbon production with a major positive impact on our financial results due to tax
incentives and high quality reserve base.
Natural and petroleum gas production. In the first half of 2016, we produced 12,261 million cubic
meters (72.2 million BOE) of gas (including our share in equity affiliates), that is 3.1% more than
in the first half of 2015. Our available for sale gas production amounted to 10,447 million cubic
meters (61.5 million BOE), compared to 10,114 million cubic meters (59.6 million BOE) in the first
half of 2015.

Our major gas production field is the Nakhodkinskoe field, which is in natural decline. Our
production at the field was 3,423 million cubic meters of natural gas in the first half of 2016 (3,731
million cubic meters in the first half of 2015). This decrease was offset by commencement of gas
production at the Yu. Korchagin field in the first half of 2016. Decrease in production in Ural
region was largely a result of increase in own gas consumption following the launch of new
power generation unit at the Perm refinery. We are planning to start gas production at the
Pyakyakhinskoye field in the Bolshekhetskaya depression of Western Siberia by the end of
2016. This will enable us to substantially increase our gas production in the region.
Our international gas production (including our share in affiliates' production) increased by
12.0%, compared to the first half of 2015, which resulted from the increase in production in
Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. Growth of gas production in Uzbekistan was due to launching new
wells and a compressor booster station at the Gissar field. We are currently involved in
construction of a gas treatment plant in the region, which completion together with further
upstream works will enable us to significantly increase gas production in that region.
West Qurna-2 project. The West Qurna-2 field in Iraq is one of the largest crude oil fields
discovered in the world, with estimated recoverable oil reserves of 12.9 billion barrels (1.8 billion
tonnes). Service agreement for the West Qurna-2 field development and production was signed
on 31 January 2010. Currently, the parties of the project are Iraq's state-owned South Oil
Company and a consortium of contractors, consisting of a Group company (75% interest) and
Iraq's state-owned North Oil Company (25% interest).
The Group launched the "Mishrif Early Oil" stage on the West Qurna-2 field and reached the
production of 120 thousand barrels per day in March 2014. According to the service agreement,
costs compensation begins after this level of production is achieved and maintained during any
90 days within a 120-day period. In June 2014, we met this requirement and from the second
quarter of 2014 started to receive cost compensation. The project's target production level is 1.2
million barrels per day and the total term of the contract is 25 years.
Accounting for the cost compensation within the West Qurna-2 project in our consolidated
statement of financial position and consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income is as follows.
Capital expenditures are recognized in Property, plant and equipment. Extraction expenses are
recognized in Operating expenses in respect of all the volume of crude oil production at the field
regardless of the volume of compensation crude oil the Group is eligible for. As the
compensation revenue is recognized, capitalized costs are amortized.
There are two steps of revenue recognition:
·      The Iraqi party, on a quarterly basis, approves invoice for cost recovery and remuneration fee
for which the Group is eligible in the reporting period. Amount of the invoice depends on crude oil
production volumes during the period and current crude oil market prices. Approved invoice
amount and the remuneration fee for the reporting quarter are recognized in crude oil sales
revenue.
·      Based on the approved invoices, the Iraqi party arranges schedule of crude oil shipments
against its debt for cost compensation and remuneration. As this crude oil is actually shipped, its
cost is recognized at current market price in Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products.
Further, revenue from sales of this crude oil, or products from its refining, is recognized in Sales
(including excise and export tariffs). Unsold crude oil and refined products are recognized in
Inventories.

oil received, costs yet unrecovered and remuneration fee.

(2) This crude oil is sold to third party customers or delivered to our refineries. After realization of
these products, respective sales revenues are recognized.
The Group is exposed to various risks due to its operations in Iraq. Management monitors the
risks associated with the projects in Iraq and believes that there is no adverse effect on the
Group's financial position that can be reasonably estimated at present.
Refining, marketing and trading
Refining. We own and operate four refineries located in European Russia and three refineries
located outside Russia - in Bulgaria, Romania, and Italy. Moreover, we have a 45% interest in the
Zeeland refinery in the Netherlands.
We own two petrochemical plants in Russia, one in Ukraine and petrochemical capacity at our
refinery in Bulgaria. Currently, production at our petrochemical plant in Ukraine is suspended due
to adverse economic and political environment in this country.
Compared to the first half of 2015, the total volume of refined products produced by the Group
increased by 5.3%.
In Russia, our production volumes decreased by 2.0% due to throughput optimization as a result
of general weakening of refining margins in Russia driven by excise tax increases in January
and April 2016. Due to completed upgrade program and throughput optimization, our Russian
refineries remained profitable in the first half of 2016 despite unfavorable macroeconomic
environment. Timely launch of new secondary processing units in 2015 and 2016 enabled us to
substantially enhance our refined product slate by reducing production of fuel oil and vacuum
gasoil in favor of light products. In order to optimize dark products yield, in the first half of 2016,
we also decreased throughput volumes and redirected vacuum gas oil produced at our Perm and
Ukhta refineries from export deliveries to supply catalytic cracking unit at our refinery in Nizhny
Novgorod.  We expect our refined product slate to further enhance via achieving full utilization of
the hydrocracking unit at our Volgograd refinery launched in the second quarter of 2016.
Maintenance works at our refineries in Nizhny Novgorod and Ukhta also affected our refining
volumes in the second quarter and the first half of 2016.
Internationally, the production increase amounted to 19.9% against the background of low output
in the first quarter of 2015 due to overhauls at our Italian refinery as well as strong refining
margins.
Along with our own production of refined products we refine crude oil at third party refineries
depending on market conditions and other factors. In the periods considered, we processed our
crude oil at third party refineries in Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The following table summarizes key figures for our refining activities.

Marketing and trading. Our marketing and trading activities include crude oil and refined products
trading, wholesale and bunkering operations in Western Europe, South-East Asia, Central
America and retail operations in the USA, Central and Eastern Europe and other regions. In
Russia, we purchase refined products on occasion, primarily to manage supply chain
bottlenecks.
In addition to our production, we purchase crude oil in Russia and on international markets. In
Russia, we primarily purchase crude oil from affiliated producing companies and other
producers. Then we either refine or export purchased crude oil. Crude oil purchased on
international markets is normally used for trading activities, for supplying our international
refineries or for processing at third party refineries.
The following tables show the volumes of crude oil purchases by the Group during the periods
considered.

Compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our purchases for refining at
international refineries increased by 38.6% and 40.9%, respectively, and our purchases for
trading increased by 3.5% and 11.5%, respectively. Moreover, in the second quarter and the first
half of 2016, the Group received 2.6 million tonnes and 5.1 million tonnes, respectively, of
compensation crude from Iraq's state-owned South Oil Company as cost compensation within
the West Qurna-2 project (in the respective periods of 2015, the Group received 2.5 million
tonnes and 4.8 million tonnes of compensation crude oil).

In the first half of 2016, the volume of our crude oil exports from Russia decreased by 2.5%, and
we exported 43.6% of our domestic crude oil production (43.1% in the first half of 2015) and 216
thousand tonnes of crude oil purchased from our affiliates and third parties (794 thousand tonnes
in the first half of 2015). The decrease in crude oil exports was a result of lower domestic
production. The volume of our refined products exports decreased by 9.9% compared to the first
half of 2015 due to higher domestic sales volumes driven by favorable netbacks and decreased
refining volumes.
Substantially, we use the Transneft infrastructure to export our crude oil. Nevertheless, during the
second quarter and first half of 2016, we exported 2,178 thousand tonnes and 4,091 thousand
tonnes, respectively, through our own infrastructure (1,865 thousand tonnes and 3,689 thousand
tonnes during the second quarter and first half of 2015).  All the volume of crude oil exported that
bypassed Transneft was routed beyond the Customs Union.
In the first half of 2016, the Company exported 600 thousand tonnes of light crude oil through the
Eastern Siberia - Pacific Ocean pipeline compared to 795 thousand tonnes in the first half of
2015. This allowed us to preserve the premium quality of crude oil and thus enabled us to
achieve higher netbacks compared to exports to traditional Western markets.
During the second quarter of 2016, our revenue from export
of crude oil and refined products from Russia both to
Group companies and third parties amounted to 172 billion
RUB and 98 billion RUB, respectively (196 billion RUB for
crude oil and 118 billion RUB for refined products in the
second quarter of 2015). During the first half of 2016, our
revenue from export of crude oil and refined products from
Russia both to Group companies and third parties
amounted to 307 billion RUB and 186 billion RUB,
respectively (395 billion RUB for crude oil and 239 billion
RUB for refined products in the first half of 2015).
Power generation. In the first half of 2016, we continued to
develop the power generation sector of our business as
part of our strategic development program. This sector
encompasses all aspects of the power generation
business, from generation to transmission and sale of heat
and electrical power. Our power generation business
sector now includes OOO LUKOIL-Volgogradenergo, OOO
LUKOIL-Kubanenergo, OOO LUKOIL-Astrakhanenergo,
OOO LUKOIL-Rostovenergo, OOO LUKOIL-
Stavropolenergo, OOO Rostovskie Teplovyie Seti, ООО
LUKOIL-Ecoenergo, our own power generating facilities at
our oil and gas fields in Russia and at our refineries in
Bulgaria, Romania, Italy and Perm region of Russia.
Main macroeconomic factors affecting our results of
operations
Changes in the international price of crude oil and refined products
The price at which we sell crude oil and refined products is the primary driver of the Group's
revenues. During the first half of 2016, the price for Brent crude oil fluctuated between $26 and
$50 per barrel, reached its maximum of $50.7 in the middle of June and minimum of $25.9 in the
beginning of January, and averaged 31.2% less than in the first half of 2015. Nevertheless, as a
result of ruble devaluation, the prices expressed in rubles decreased less significantly.
Substantially all the crude oil the Group exports is Urals blend. The following tables show the
average crude oil and refined product prices in the respective periods of 2016 and 2015.

(1) The Company sells various crude oil blends on foreign markets on various delivery terms.
Thus, our average realized sale price of oil on international markets differs from the average
prices of Urals blend on Mediterranean and Northern Europe markets.
Domestic crude oil and refined products prices
Substantially all crude oil produced in Russia is produced by vertically integrated oil companies
such as ours. As a result, most transactions are between affiliated entities within vertically
integrated groups. Thus, there is no concept of a benchmark domestic market price for crude oil.
The price of crude oil that is produced but not refined or exported by one of the vertically
integrated oil companies is generally determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis against a
background of world market prices, but with no direct reference or correlation. At any time there
may exist significant price differences between regions for similar quality crude oil as a result of
competition and economic conditions in those regions.
Domestic prices for refined products are determined to some extent by world market prices, but
they are also directly affected by local demand and competition.
The table below represents average domestic wholesale prices of refined products in the
respective periods of 2016 and 2015.

Changes in the US dollar-ruble exchange rate and inflation
A substantial part of our revenue is either denominated in US dollars or is correlated to some
extent with US dollar crude oil prices, while most of our costs in the Russian Federation are
settled in Russian rubles. Therefore, a devaluation of the ruble against the US dollar generally
causes our revenues to increase in ruble terms, and vice versa. Ruble inflation also affects the
results of our operations.
The following table provides data on inflation in Russia and change in the ruble-dollar and ruble-
euro exchange rates.

Taxation
The rates of taxes specific to the oil industry in Russia are linked to international crude oil prices
and are changed in line with them. The methods to determine the rates for such taxes are
presented below.
Crude oil extraction tax rate is changed monthly and is calculated by multiplying the base rate by
a coefficient reflecting average international Urals price and ruble-dollar exchange rate during
the month. The base rate for 2016 is set at 857 rubles per metric tonne extracted (766 rubles for
2015).
The tax rate is zero when the average international Urals price is less than, or equal to, $15.00
per barrel. In 2016, each $1.00 per barrel increase in the international Urals price above $15.00
per barrel results in an increase in the tax rate by $0.45 per barrel ($0.40 per barrel in 2015).
The mineral extraction tax on crude oil is payable in rubles per tonne of crude oil extracted.
There are different types of tax incentives on the mineral extraction tax on crude oil applied to our
fields and deposits:
·         A special coefficient is applied to the standard tax rate depending on location, depletion,
type of reserves, size and complexity of a particular field, as well as on the average international
Urals price and the ruble-dollar exchange rate. This type of incentive with different coefficients is
applied to our highly depleted fields (more than 80% depletion), our Yu. Korchagin field located
in the Caspian offshore, the Permian layers of our Usinskoye field in Timan-Pechora producing
high-viscous crude oil, our Pyakyakhinskoye field located in the Yamal-Nenets region of Western
Siberia, a number of fields in the Nenets Autonomous region, as well as to our new small-sized
fields (recoverable reserves less than 5 million tonnes) and fields and deposits with low
permeability like V. N. Vinogradov field and Tyumen deposits;
·         A fixed tax rate of 15% of the international Urals price is applied to our V. Filanovsky field,
located in the Caspian offshore;
·      A zero tax rate is applied to our Yaregskoye field producing extra-viscous crude oil, as well
as to unconventional deposits (Bazhenov and others).
Some of the mineral extraction tax incentives are limited in time or by cumulative oil production
volumes.
The table on the page 14 illustrates the impact of mineral extraction tax incentives on the tax rate
at $50 Urals price.
Natural gas extraction tax rate. The base rate amounts to 35 rubles per thousand cubic meters
and is adjusted depending on average wholesale natural gas price in Russia, share of gas
production in total hydrocarbon production, regional location and complexity of particular gas
field.
In the first half of 2016, actual average natural gas extraction tax rate for our major gas field -
Nakhodkinskoe in Western Siberia amounted to 208 rubles per thousand cubic meters (150
rubles in the first half of 2015). The rate to this field is subject to a special regional reducing
coefficient.
Crude oil export duty rate is denominated in US dollars per tonne of crude oil exported and is
calculated on a progressive scale according to the bellow table.

35% of the difference between the actual price and $109.50 per
tonne (or $0.35 per barrel per each $1.00 increase in the Urals
price over $15.00)
$12.78 per tonne plus 45% of the difference between the actual
price and $146.00 per tonne (or $0.45 per barrel per each $1.00
increase in the Urals price over $20.00)
$29.20 per tonne plus 42% of the difference between the actual
price and $182.50 per tonne (or $0.42 per barrel per each $1.00
increase in the Urals price over $25.00)
The export duty rate changes every month with the rate for the next month being based on
average Urals price for the period from the 15th day of the previous month to the 14th day of the
current month.
Crude oil produced at some of our fields is subject to special export duty rates calculated
according to special formulas, which are lower than standard rates. A reduced rate is applied to
crude oil produced at our Yaregskoye field producing extra-viscous crude oil and our Yu.
Korchagin field in the Caspian offshore. A zero rate applies to crude oil of our V. Filanovskogo
field also located in the Caspian offshore.
The table below illustrates the impact of tax incentives for different fields and deposits in our
portfolio at $50 per barrel Urals price under 2016 tax formulas.

Crude oil and refined products exports from Russia are subject to two steps of customs
declaration and duty payments: temporary and complete. A temporary declaration is submitted
based on preliminary exports volumes and the duty is paid in rubles translated from US dollars at
the date of the temporary declaration. A complete declaration is submitted after receiving the
actual data on the exported volumes, but no later than six months after the date of the temporary
declaration. The final amount of the export duty is adjusted depending on the actual volumes, the
US dollar exchange rate at the date of the complete declaration (except for pipeline deliveries
when the exchange rate at the temporary declaration date is used) and the export duty rate. If
temporary and complete declarations are submitted in different reporting periods, the final
amount of the export duty is adjusted in the period of submission of the complete declaration. The
high volatility of the ruble-dollar exchange rates may lead to significant adjustments. For the
purposes of the IFRS consolidated financial statements, temporary declarations at the reporting
period end are translated to rubles from US dollars using the period-end exchange rate.
Crude oil and refined products exported to the member countries of the Custom Union - Belarus
and Kazakhstan, are not subject to export duties.
The following tables represent average enacted rates for taxes specific to the oil industry in
Russia for the respective periods.

Excise on refined products. The responsibility to pay excises on refined products in Russia is
imposed on refined product producers (except for straight-run gasoline). Only domestic sales
volumes are subject to excises.
In other countries where the Group operates, excises are paid either by producers or retailers
depending on the local legislation.
Excise rates on refined products in Russia are tied to the ecological class of fuel. Excise tax rates
for the respective periods of 2016 and 2015 are listed below.

During the first half of 2016, excise rates in Russia were increased twice, on 1 January and 1
April.
Income tax. The federal income tax rate is 2.0% and the regional income tax rate varies between
13.5% and 18.0%. The Group's foreign operations are subject to taxes at the tax rates applicable
to the jurisdictions in which they operate.
The Company and its Russian subsidiaries file income tax returns in Russia. A number of Group
companies in Russia are paying income tax as a consolidated taxpayers' group ("CTG"). This
allows taxpayers to offset taxable losses generated by certain participants of a CTG against
taxable profits of other participants of the CTG.
Transportation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products in Russia
The main Russian crude oil production regions are remote from the main crude oil and refined
products markets. Therefore, access by crude oil production companies to the markets is
dependent on the extent of diversification of the transport infrastructure and access to it. As a
result, transportation cost is an important macroeconomic factor affecting our profit.
Transportation of crude oil produced in Russia to refineries and export destinations is primarily
through the trunk oil pipeline system of the state-owned company, Transneft, or by railway
transport.
Transportation of refined products in Russia is by railway transport and the pipeline system of
Transnefteproduct. The Russian railway infrastructure is owned and operated by Russian
Railways. Both these companies are state-owned. We transport the major part of our refined
products by railway transport.
In Russia, gas is mostly sold at the wellhead and then transported through the Unified Gas
Supply System ("UGSS"). The UGSS is responsible for gathering, transporting, dispatching and
delivering substantially all natural gas supplies in Russia and is owned and operated by
Gazprom.

During the second quarter of 2016, our revenues decreased by 138 billion RUB, or by 9.3%,
compared to the second quarter of 2015. Our revenues from crude oil sales decreased by
64 billion RUB, or by 15.0%, and our revenues from sales of refined products decreased by 80
billion RUB, or by 8.3%.
During the first half of 2016, our revenues decreased by 401 billion RUB, or by 13.7%, compared
to the first half of 2015. Our revenues from crude oil sales decreased by 168 billion RUB, or by
19.9%, and our revenues from sales of refined products decreased by 259 billion RUB, or by
13.6%.
The main reason for the decrease in revenue was the decrease in international hydrocarbon
prices. That was partially compensated for by the effect of ruble devaluation on our revenues
denominated in other currencies.
Sales of crude oil
Our international crude oil sales revenue decreased by 13.7%, or by 51 billion RUB, and by
18.5%, or by 137 billion RUB, compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015,
respectively. Our international sales volumes (beyond the Customs Union) decreased by 977
thousand tonnes, or by 5.7%, in the second quarter of 2016 driven by decrease in the Company's
share in production from the West Qurna-2 field, and increased by 673 thousand tonnes, or by
2.0%, in the first half of 2016, due to higher volumes of crude oil trading. Our average
international realized crude oil prices decreased by 8.5% and 20.1% compared to the second
quarter and the first half of 2015, respectively.
Our realized domestic crude oil sales price did not change compared to the second quarter of
2015 and decreased by 11.5% compared to the first half of 2015, while our domestic sales
volumes decreased by 984 thousand tonnes, or by 38.3%, and by 1,691 thousand tonnes, or by
32.8%, respectively, following the decrease in production in Russia. As a consequence, in the
second quarter and the first half of 2016, our domestic sales revenue decreased by 38.2%, or by
14 billion RUB, and by 40.5%, or by 30 billion RUB, respectively.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from crude oil export from Russia
both to Group companies and third parties amounted to 172 billion RUB and 307 billion RUB,
respectively (196 billion RUB and 395 billion RUB in the second quarter and the first half of
2015).
Sales of refined products
Compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our revenue from the wholesale of
refined products outside Russia decreased by 74 billion RUB, or by 10.0%, and by 250 billion
RUB, or by 17.1%, respectively, that was largely price driven. During the second quarter of 2016,
our dollar and ruble realized prices decreased by 28.5% and 10.6%, respectively, and during the
first half of 2016 they decreased by 31.1% and 15.7%, respectively. At the same time, compared
to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our sales volumes didn't change significantly.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our dollar realized retail prices outside
Russia decreased by 12.9% and 14.7%, respectively, while our ruble realized prices increased
by 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively, due to the ruble devaluation. Our sales volumes decreased by
11.9% and 7.1% as a consequence of sale of our retail networks in Eastern Europe. As a result,
our international retail revenue decreased by 3 billion RUB, or by 3.9%, and by 5 billion RUB, or
by 3.0%, compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, respectively.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from the wholesale of refined
products on the domestic market decreased by 9.0%, or by 5 billion RUB, and by 8.5%, or by 10
billion RUB, respectively. Our realized prices decreased by 10.0% and 15.2%, but our sales
volumes increased by 1.1% and 7.9% in the second quarter and the first half of 2016.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from refined products retail sales
in Russia increased by 2 billion RUB, or by 2.7%, and by 6 billion RUB, or by 3.5%, respectively.
Our average domestic retail prices increased by 2.7% and 3.8%, while our retail volumes did not
change significantly.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from export of refined products from
Russia both to Group companies and third parties amounted to 98 billion RUB and 186 billion
RUB, respectively (118 billion RUB and 239 billion RUB in the second quarter and the first half of
2015).
Sales of petrochemical products
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from sales of petrochemical products
increased by 3 billion RUB, or by 16.8%, and by 11 billion RUB, or by 39.9%, respectively,
largely due to the increase in domestic output against the background of low production as a
consequence of a fire at our plant in the Stavropol region of Russia at the end of the first quarter
of 2014. Production at the plant was resumed in early April 2015.
Sales of gas and gas products
Compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, sales of gas and gas refined products
decreased by 2 billion RUB, or by 7.4%, and by 6 billion RUB, or by 8.3%, respectively, mainly
as a result of the decrease in sales prices.
Natural gas sales revenue decreased by 1 billion RUB, or by 5.0%, in the second quarter of 2016
and by 3 billion RUB, or by 8.1%, in the first half of 2016.
Gas products revenue decreased by 1 billion RUB, or by 9.9%, and by 3 billion RUB, or by 8.4%,
compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, respectively.
Sales of energy and related services
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our revenue from sales of electricity, heat
and related services increased by 1 billion RUB, or by 9.0%, and by 4 billion RUB, or by 10.6%,
respectively. In Russia, the increase was largely due to putting in operation a combined cycle
gas turbine with a capacity of 135 MW at the Group's power plant in the Stavropol region of
Russia in March 2015. Our international revenue increased as a result of the significant increase
in volumes of electricity sales in Sicily, Italy.
Other sales
Other sales include non-petroleum sales through our retail network, transportation services,
rental revenue, crude oil extraction services, and other revenue of our production and marketing
companies from sales of goods and services not related to our primary activities.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, revenue from other sales increased by 5
billion RUB, or by 21.8%, and by 18 billion RUB, or by 41.3%, respectively. The non-petrol
revenue of our retail network increased by 2 billion RUB, or by 23.4%, and by 3 billion RUB, or
by 21.1%. In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, revenue from transportation services
abroad increased by 2 billion RUB, or by 63.4%, and by 5 billion RUB, or by 78.5%, respectively.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our other sales also included revenue from sales
of diamonds in the amount of 3 billion RUB and 11 billion RUB, respectively (3 billion RUB and 5
billion RUB in the second quarter and the first half of 2015).

(1) Excluding extraction expenses at the West Qurna-2 field.
The method of allocation of operating expenses above differs from the approach used in
preparing the data for Note 28 "Segment information" to our condensed interim consolidated
financial statements. Expenditures in the segment reporting are grouped depending on the
segment to which a particular company belongs. Operating expenses for the purposes of this
analysis are grouped based on the nature of the costs incurred.
Compared to the respective periods of 2015, our operating expenses increased by 8 billion RUB,
or by 7.4%, in the second quarter of 2016, and by 15 billion RUB, or by 7.3%, in the first half of
2016, largely as a result of inflation in Russia and the effect of the ruble devaluation on the ruble
value of foreign subsidiaries' expenses.
Hydrocarbon extraction expenses
Our extraction expenses include expenditures related to repairs of extraction equipment, labor
costs, expenses on artificial stimulation of reservoirs, fuel and electricity costs, cost of extraction
of natural gas liquids, property insurance of extraction equipment and other similar costs.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our extraction expenses increased by 4 billion
RUB, or by 10.8%, and by 9 billion RUB, or by 11.3%.
Our average hydrocarbon extraction expenses increased from 213 RUB per BOE in the second
quarter of 2015 to 246 RUB per BOE in the second quarter of 2016, or by 15.5%. In the first half of
2016, our average hydrocarbon extraction expenses increased from 209 RUB per BOE in the first
half of 2015 to 238 RUB per BOE, or by 13.9%. In Russia, average hydrocarbon extraction
expenses increased by 13.7% to 241 RUB per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 and by 13.0%
to 234 RUB per BOE in the first half of 2016. Our domestic expenses increased driven by higher
costs of materials and services and shift towards more cost-intensive projects benefiting from tax
exemptions.
At the same time, our average hydrocarbon extraction expenses decreased from $4.04 per BOE
in the second quarter of 2015 to $3.73 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016, or by 7.7%, and
from $3.68 per BOE in the first half of 2015 to $3.41 per BOE in the first half of 2016, or by 7.3%.
In Russia, average hydrocarbon extraction expenses decreased by 9.2% to $3.65 per BOE in the
second quarter of 2016 and by 8.0% to $3.35 per BOE in the first half of 2016.
Crude oil extraction expenses at the West Qurna-2 field
Crude oil extraction expenses at the West Qurna-2 field represent expenses related to 100%
production from the West Qurna-2 field, while we are only eligible for a share of production that
compensates our historically incurred costs and expenses. For details see p. 6.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our expenses related to the West Qurna-2 project
amounted to 8 billion RUB and 19 billion RUB, respectively (11 billion RUB and 24 billion RUB
in the second quarter and the first half of 2015). The decrease in expenses was a result of
completion of commissioning stage of the field development and consecutive decrease in
personnel involved and associated transportation, security and other related services provided.
Own refining expense
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our own refining expenses increased by 2
billion, or by 8.6%, and by 2 billion, or by 4.8%, respectively.
Despite lower production volumes, refining expenses at our domestic refineries increased by
6.5%, or by 1 billion RUB, in the second quarter of 2016, and by 12.1%, or by 2 billion RUB, in
the first half of 2016, as a result of increase in consumption and costs of additives and
commissioning of new units at our refineries in Nizhny Novgorod and Volgograd.
Refining expenses at our refineries outside Russia increased by 1 billion RUB, or by 10.6%,
compared to the second quarter of 2015 and did not change significantly compared to the first
half of 2015. The increase was a result of the ruble devaluation and commissioning of heavy
residue processing complex at our Bulgarian refinery, but in the first half of 2016, it was offset by
lower overhaul expenses at our Italian refinery compared to first quarter of 2015.
Expenses for crude oil transportation to refineries
Expenses for crude oil transportation to refineries include pipeline, railway, freight and other
costs related to delivery of crude oil and refined products to refineries for further processing.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2016, our expenses for crude oil transportation to
refineries increased by 1 billion RUB, or by 13.6%, and by 3 billion RUB, or by 15.4%, largely as
a result of the increase in transportation tariffs, international refining volumes and the effect of the
ruble devaluation.
Petrochemical expenses
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, operating expenses of our petrochemical plants
increased by 1 billion RUB, or by 36.5%, and by 2 billion RUB, or by 37.7%, respectively, due to
the increase in domestic production volumes after commencement of production at our
petrochemical plant in the Stavropol region of Russia in April 2015.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses include expenses of the Group's upstream and downstream entities
that do not relate to their core activities, namely rendering of transportation and extraction
services, costs of other services provided and goods sold by our production and marketing
companies, and of non-core businesses of the Group.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, other operating expenses increased by 4 billion
RUB, or by 35.5%, and by 5 billion RUB, or by 26.1%, respectively, largely as a result of the
increased cost of transportation services provided to third parties, non-petrol sales of our retail
network and the increase in the ruble value of other operating expenses of our foreign
subsidiaries.
Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products
Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products includes the cost of crude oil and refined products
purchased for trading or refining, gas and fuel oil to supply our power generation entities and the
result of hedging of crude oil and refined products sales.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, the cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products
decreased by 100 billion RUB, or by 12.9%, and by 263 billion RUB, or by 17.8%, respectively,
following the decrease in hydrocarbon prices. Crude oil purchases in the second quarter and the
first half of 2016 also included 45 billion RUB and 74 billion RUB related to 2,588 thousand
tonnes and 5,143 thousand tonnes of compensation crude oil received from Iraq's state-owned
South Oil Company within the West Qurna-2 project (53 billion RUB and 95 billion RUB related
to 2,497 thousand tonnes and 4,769 thousand tonnes of compensation crude oil in the second
quarter and the first half of 2015).
In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a 36 billion RUB net loss from hedging, compared
to a 16 billion RUB net loss in the second quarter of 2015. In the first half of 2016 we recognized
a 34 billion RUB net loss from hedging, compared to a 26 billion RUB net loss in the first half of
2015.

Our transportation expenses increased by 9 billion RUB, or by 13.6%, in the second quarter of
2016 and by 17 billion RUB, or by 11.7%, in the first half of 2016.
Our expenses for transportation of crude oil in Russia were flat both to the second quarter and the
first half of 2015 as inflation of tariffs was offset by decrease in exports volumes. Outside of
Russia, increase in crude oil transportation expenses was driven primarily by the effect of the
ruble devaluation.
The increase in domestic expenses for transportation of refined products by 6.8% against the
second quarter of 2015 and by 6.2% against the first half of 2015 was triggered mainly by the
increase in tariffs. Outside of Russia, the increase was again mostly a result of the ruble
devaluation.
Other transportation expenses were mostly represented by the expenses for transportation of
gas. In Russia, the increase to the respective periods of 2015 was mainly due to higher volumes
of transportation of gas from the Yu. Korchagin field in the Caspian Sea. Internationnaly, the
increase that resulted from higher transportation volumes as a result of the increase in gas
production was amplified by the ruble devaluation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll costs (excluding extraction entities',
refineries' and power generation entities' production staff costs), insurance costs (except for
property insurance related to extraction and refinery equipment), costs of maintenance of social
infrastructure, movement in bad debt provision and other expenses. Our selling, general and
administrative expenses are roughly equally split between domestic and international operations.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 5 billion RUB, or by 13.2%, in the
second quarter of 2016, and by 12 billion RUB, or by 14.7%, in the first half of 2016. In Russia,
expenses increased by 6 billion RUB, or by 23.2%, in the second quarter of 2016 and by 7 billion
RUB, or by 16.2%, in the first half of 2016 as a result of inflation and higher accruals within share-
based compensation program. Internationally, decrease in selling expenses denominated in
local currencies as a result of the sale of our retail networks in Eastern Europe was offset by the
effect of the ruble devaluation on the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries and our expenses
outside of Russia decreased by 1 billion RUB, or by 5.6%, compared to the second quarter of
2015 and increased by 5 billion RUB, or by 13.0%, compared to the first half of 2015.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased by 15 billion RUB, or by
17.7%, compared to the second quarter of 2015, and by 10 billion RUB, or by 5.8%, compared to
the first half of 2015. The effect of the increase in the depreciation rate of upstream assets
following the decrease in hydrocarbon proved reserves was offset by the decrease of expenses
related to the West Qurna-2 project. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for
the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 included 5 billion RUB and 34 billion RUB, respectively,
related to the West Qurna-2 field. In the first half of 2016 and 2015, those expenses amounted to
24 billion RUB and 57 billion RUB, respectively. Other international subsidiaries' depreciation,
depletion and amortization increased as a result of the effect of the ruble devaluation.
Equity share in income of affiliates
The Group has investments in equity method affiliates and corporate joint ventures. These
companies are primarily engaged in crude oil exploration, production, marketing and distribution
operations in the Russian Federation, crude oil production and marketing in Kazakhstan.
Currently, our largest affiliates are Tengizchevroil, exploration and production company operating
in Kazakhstan, Bashneft-Polus, an exploration and production company that develops the Trebs
and Titov oilfelds in Timan-Pechora, Russia, Shakh-Deniz Midstream and Caspian Pipeline
Consortium, midstream companies in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. One of our major affiliates
was Caspian Investments Resources Ltd, which was sold in August 2015.
Our share in income of affiliates increased by 1 billion RUB, or by 43.8%, compared to the
second quarter of 2015 and decreased by 1 billion RUB, or by 10.8%, compared to the first half of
2015.

In the second quarter of 2016, our taxes other than income taxes decreased by 22 billion RUB, or
by 15.9%, compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the first half of 2016, our taxes other than
income taxes decreased by 69 billion RUB, or by 25.4%, compared to the first half of 2015. This
was largely driven by the decrease in the mineral extraction tax rate in Russia.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, application of the reduced rate for crude oil
produced from depleted oilfields and the zero rate for crude oil produced from oilfields with extra
heavy crude oil and from greenfields led to a 15 billion RUB and 26 billion RUB mineral
extraction tax reduction, respectively (19 billion RUB and 37 billion RUB in the second quarter
and the first half of 2015).

In the second quarter and the first half of 2016, export tariffs decreased by 30 billion RUB, or by
42.7%, and by 98 billion RUB, or by 52.8%, respectively, due to the sharp decrease in export
duty rates for crude oil and refined products in Russia amplified by the decrease in export
volumes. Compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2015, the volumes of crude oil
export beyond the Customs Union decreased by 1.0% and 3.0% and the volumes of the refined
products exports decreased by 13.7% and 9.9%, respectively. The increase in excise tax
expenses in Russia was driven by increase in rates, while international excise expenses
increased due to the ruble devaluation.
Foreign exchange loss
Foreign exchange loss mostly related to revaluation of US dollar and euro net monetary position
of Russian subsidiaries that mostly consists of accounts receivables and loans to our foreign
subsidiaries.
During the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, US dollar exchange rate showed similar decline
that, along with comparable net monetary position, resulted in 29 billion RUB foreign exchange
loss in both periods.
During the first half of 2016, US dollar exchange rate to ruble decreased from 72.88 rubles per
dollar at 1 January to 64.26 rubles per dollar at 30 June that resulted in a 74 billion RUB foreign
exchange loss. During the first half of 2015, US dollar exchange rate changed less significantly
(decreased from 56.26 rubles per dollar at 1 January to 55.52 rubles per dollar at 30 June) that
resulted in a 23 billion RUB foreign exchange loss.
Income taxes
The maximum statutory income tax rate in Russia is 20%. Nevertheless, the actual effective
income tax rate may be higher due to non-deductible expenses or lower due to certain non-
taxable gains.
In the second quarter of 2016, our total income tax expense decreased by 1 billion RUB, or by
4.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2015. At the same time, our profit before income tax
decreased by 2 billion RUB, or by 2.9%.
In the first half of 2016, our total income tax expense decreased by 14 billion RUB, or by 32.0%,
compared to the first half of 2015. At the same time, our profit before income tax decreased by 77
billion RUB, or by 36.3%.
In the second quarter of 2016, our effective income tax rate was 22.3%, compared to 22.7% in the
second quarter of 2015. In the first half of 2016, our effective income tax rate was 22.0%,
compared to 20.6% in the first half of 2015.

In the first half of 2016, our capital expenditures in the exploration and production segment
decreased by 34 billion RUB, or by 14.2%. The decrease was largely in our international
segment and related to completion of current stage of the West Qurna-2 project and of
exploratory drilling in Cameroon and Romania.
The decrease in capital expenditures in the domestic refining, marketing and distribution
segment in Russia was due to completion of upgrades at our Russian refineries. The decrease in
the international segment was a result of completion of the construction of a heavy residue
processing complex at our Bulgarian refinery.

Information about Basic Business Risks and Uncertainties of PJSC LUKOIL
PJSC LUKOIL management bodies pay great attention to the risk management issues in order to
ensure reasonable assurance of the set goals in the conditions characterized by uncertainties
and adverse factors. PJSC LUKOIL is constantly identifying, describing, estimating and
monitoring the possible events that may affect the Company's activities, and is elaborating and
implementing measures to minimize the probability of such events and/or to mitigate their
negative impact on the Company's performance.
PJSC LUKOIL seeks to actively promote risk management and is presently focusing its efforts on
the development and improvement of its General Enterprise Risk and Internal Control
Management System based on the best international practices. The Company is constantly
improving the applicable regulatory methodological risk management base which establishes
requirements, uniform for all of the LUKOIL Group organizations, aimed at organizing the risk
management process at all stages, and defines management standards for certain risk types of
utmost importance. The Risk Committee, a dedicated body under the President of PJSC
 LUKOIL, was set up and began its risk management work in 2011.
The risk management process in the LUKOIL Group is supported by a special information system
providing for the following:
-   a unified information environment for all participants of the risk management process (at all
managerial levels);
-     automation of the processes of collection, due diligence, approval and storage of risk
information;
-     the necessary response time and risk management efficiency in general;
-     development of a risk management knowledge base.
The following information reflects the Company's current vision of the major risks that may affect
its financial performance, and may not be exhaustive.
Macroeconomic Risks
Macroeconomic changes resulting from the global price volatility for energy carriers, foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, inflation processes may have an adverse impact on the Company's
financial performance.
In Q2 2016 the oil price continued to follow the recovery trend set in Q1 after a sharp fall in
January 2016. Gradual reduction of the surplus on the world market due to increasing seasonal
demand and declining production by independent producers accounted for the price growth.  As
a result, Brent crude oil price reached USD 50/barrel.
Over the past period risks of the world economy slowdown have increased considerably,
aggravated by the results of the UK referendum on the country's exit from the European Union.
This event can provoke a banking crisis and fuel separatist sentiments in the region, which is
already experiencing major economic problems.
Concerns of the market players are still raised about the slow economic growth in China, the
largest oil consumer. The monetary measures applied to stimulate the economy in this country
mitigate the negative impacts for a limited time only, the long-lasting solution however requires
structural changes in the economy. In the developed countries monetary easing is expanding,
which detects significant challenges faces by the economies of these countries. In addition to
that, negative growth slowdown signs are becoming more obvious in the US, the most
sustainable economy in the recent years. In this context, the probability of the interest rate rise in
the country this year is becoming ever more elusive. A number of developing export-oriented
countries continue to be under pressure due to the lingering low commodity prices. All of the
above increases the risks of a global economic slowdown. In this situation, the global capital will
flow into the most secure assets, including the US dollar, which could affect the oil price.
In Q2 2016 the world market supply of oil continued to decline, primarily on account of
independent producers. A significant drop in production was recorded in the United States
against the backdrop of the ongoing decline in drilling activity. Besides, more frequent
interruption of supplies from countries such as Canada, Nigeria and Kuwait contributed to the
market surplus drop. However, the effect of this factor is unlikely to be lasting. At the same time,
OPEC production output broke the historical record again. In the short term perspective, there is a
potential that the cartel will increase its production output, in particular due to Iran seeking to go
back to its pre-sanction production rates.
Nevertheless, we can expect the oil price growth in the mid-term perspective due to the delayed
effect of the reduced investment and cost optimization of the oil and gas companies. Growth in
supply will gradually slow down due to the lasting trend of independent producers cutting back
on production. Low prices will also instigate the global oil consumption.
Lingering low oil prices and the preservation of sanctions against Russia continue to hold back
growth of the Russian economy. Despite a slight drop, the interest rate remains rather high to
resume investments. There has been a significant decrease in the rate of inflation due to lower
consumer demand. GDP in Russia in the 1st quarter of 2016 dropped by 1.2% as opposed to the
previous year. Growth is not expected before 2017. Due to the imposed sanctions the Russian
companies are struggling to obtain access to foreign funds and technologies. Low energy carrier
prices, if they persist, pose a serious threat to the stability of the Russian economy.
The Company has been employing a scenario approach to forecast macroeconomic indicators.
One of them is defined as a base-case scenario and describes the most likely macroeconomic
development trends according to the Company's management. In addition, best-case and worst-
case scenarios are being developed. They assess the potential consequences of changes in
macroeconomic indices for the Company.
The Company is fully committed to minimizing the potential effects resulting from the realization
of macroeconomic risks. The application of the worst-case scenario makes it possible to identify
assets and investment projects that are most vulnerable to macroeconomic changes. The data of
this analysis serve as the basis for top management decisions to optimize the Company's asset
portfolio.
Country Risks
Among other things, PJSC LUKOIL has operations in a number of countries with high political
and economic risks. Should they be realized, such risks may significantly complicate the
Company's business or even cause the Company to suspend its operations in a certain region. In
particular, the Company has launched a number of projects in Iraq, Egypt, Uzbekistan, West
African countries where country risks are deemed high.
The Company seeks to diversify its operations and alongside with its activities in unstable
regions has been implementing projects in Europe and the US, where regional risks are
considered minimal.
The major part of the Company's development and refining assets is located in the Russian
Federation. The political environment in the RF is characterized by a fair degree of stability and
high support of the population for the policies undertaken by the President and the Government.
The main factors which are capable of affecting LUKOIL's activities include:
-   Instability of the political situation in the countries where the Company's is implementing its
investment projects, due to regime changes;
-     Escalation of military conflicts in the countries of the Company's presence;
-     Macroeconomic instability in the countries of the Company's presence;
-     Expropriation of the Company's assets;
-     Inefficiency of the legislation regulating economic relations, and of the court system.
When implementing projects with high country risks, the Company applies more stringent return
level requirements to such projects. Besides, should the political or social and economic
situation deteriorate in a region of the Company's presence, PJSC LUKOIL shall implement a set
of crisis response measures, including cost saving, optimization of the investment program based
on the new conditions, equity drawdown, and invite partners to share project risks.
Industry-Specific Risks
Risks Associated with Well Construction and Hard-to-recover Hydrocarbon Field Development
The risk associated with the prohibition of supply of the equipment and materials currently used
for well construction is essential to the Company. The fact that a considerable share of the
materials and equipment required for well construction is purchased today by the Company and
its contractors from foreign contractors is regarded as a risk factor.
The greatest part of the chemical agents intended for preparation and processing of drill muds, as
well as for preparation of grouting mixtures currently purchased from the EU and the US
manufacturers, can be replaced with the products manufactured by the enterprises of China,
Thailand, the RF and the Belarus Republic. It is also worth mentioning that the chemical products
currently purchased from the EU and the US manufacturers are low-tonnage;
Based on the information received from the Company's contractors providing maintenance
services during well construction, as of today the Company's projects have now stocked spare
parts, equipment and supplies for 1 year.
Due to the sanctions imposed against Russia there is a risk of constraints arising as hard-to-
recover-hydrocarbon fields are developed with application of the multi-zone hydrofracturing
technique. The equipment for multi-zone hydrofracturing used today as part of the Company's
projects knows no equals produced by the enterprises of the RF or China.
Risks Associated with the Growth of Tariffs and Suppliers' Prices for Goods/Work/Services in
Operations, except Critical Raw Material
The risk associated with tariff growth is accounted for the activities of such monopolies as JSC
Russian Railways, PJSC Gazprom and other monopolies in the countries of the Company's
presence, since the prices for their services grow on a regular basis.
The expenses on product logistics as the product volumes rise directly affect PJSC LUKOIL
profit.
There is also a risk of price growth for the services of other suppliers, including motor
transportation, the services of customs brokers, warehouse storage cost, etc.
In order to minimize the risks associated with tariff growth of JSC Russian Railways, and other
similar monopolies in the countries of its presence the Company:
-  diversifies ways to transport the Company's products;
-  in order to reduce the risks of advanced tariff growth of the above monopolies the Company
participates in the coordinated operations aimed at the prevention of advanced tariff growth
together with other consumers;
-  when suppliers are selected to cooperate on a long-term basis, the Company holds bidding
procedures.
Risk of Restricted Access to Petroleum Product Transshipment Infrastructure
The risk scenario depends on:
-  inability to ensure safety of goods in transit on the part of the natural monopolist in petroleum
product pipeline transport;
-  limited infrastructure capabilities given the growth in third-party transportation, and changes in
the quality of transported goods.
-  the political situation.
The Company invests great efforts to find ways to reduce these risks:
-  diversifies types of transport and petroleum product export destinations;
-  conducts systematic work with natural monopolies in terms of pipeline transfer to increase
transportation output through the PJSC Transneft system given the ever-growing oil production
rates and/or increasing refining output at the Company's refineries;
-  develops its own transportation and logistics infrastructure to satisfy oil and petroleum product
export.
Financial Risks
Price Risks
Oil and petroleum product price fluctuations may significantly affect the Company's financial
performance and the value of its securities. The Company has a limited influence on the output
prices, which depend a lot on the market situation and measures taken by the regulatory
authorities.
High oil price volatility is expected to persist in the near term as a result of the uncertainty as to
the outlooks of the global economic growth, oil supply interruptions to the market, the gap
between the global oil demand and supply, and high geopolitical tensions.
LUKOIL is a vertically integrated oil company which embraces production, refining and
distribution assets. This structure serves as a natural hedging mechanism, where multidirectional
risk factors compensate each other.
In addition to this, the Company uses a number of measures to reduce the negative price risk
impact:
-  As long-term programs are developed, several price scenarios are considered, while the
investment project portfolio is shaped in view of the tolerance analysis of the project performance
figures to the changes in price parameters;
-  A commodity supply management system has been implemented which makes it possible to
respond to market changes very quickly and conduct arbitrary shipments;
-  In its trading activities, the Company uses hedging operations which help significantly reduce
the negative impact of the price fluctuations on the oil and petroleum product markets as part of
the LUKOIL Group operations.
Liquidity Risks
High volatility of oil prices, exchange rates of foreign currencies to the US dollar, refining margin,
petrochemistry and power generation margin, growth of tariffs and suppliers' prices, as well as
possible international economic sanctions against the Russian Federation may create an
imbalance in the figures included into the plans, budgets and investment programs of the
LUKOIL Group, thus leading to the shortage of liquidity and financing sources.
This risk is managed through sensitivity assessment of the performance figures included into the
plans, budgets and investment programs to the changes in macroeconomic indicators. The
Company also develops proposals related to plan adjustments, possible sequestering of
expenses associated with the transition to the stress scenario, shifting of due dates and project
implementation dates or inclusion of optional projects in the plan in case of improvements in the
macroeconomic situation, as well as the proposals to ensure well-timed financing of its business
activities. Much attention is paid to cost minimization by means of bidding procedures.
LUKOIL Group's liquidity is managed on a centralized basis, but there's also an efficient global
system in place to manage LUKOIL Group's liquidity, which includes an automated system of
concentration and re-distribution of funds, corporate dealing, and cashflow rolling forecasts. The
liquidity indicators are monitored on a continuous basis.
Despite the unfavorable market situation for the Russian borrowers, the volume of bilateral
backup credit lines required to provide a sufficient level of liquidity in line with the requirements of
the rating agencies is maintained at the required level.
Currently, PJSC LUKOIL has investment ratings from two largest international rating agencies,
including: S&P (BBB- which is higher than the sovereign rating of the Russian Federation) and
Fitch (BBB-). The Company is monitoring and ensuring compliance of its financial indicators with
the rating agencies' requirements on a regular basis.
The fact that its credit rating exceeds the sovereign rating of the Russian Federation testifies to
high financial stability of PJSC LUKOIL.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The fact that the Company's assets are mainly concentrated in the RF makes its financial
indicators dependent on the ruble to dollar exchange rate. The Company's proceeds are mainly
shaped by US dollar proceeds from the oil and petroleum product sales, while operating and
capital expenses are mainly denominated in rubles. The Company has to sell foreign currency to
finance ruble denominated expenses. When the ruble appreciates, the Company needs to sell an
extra amount of its foreign currency proceeds to finance ruble denominated expenses, which will
have an adverse effect on the Company's net profit in rubles.
The Company's foreign currency revenue and expenses mix serves as natural hedging. For
instance, the oil price reduction, as a rule, is accompanied by a weaker ruble exchange rate,
which helps partially offset the negative impact of the oil price reduction on the Company's
financial indicators.
In order to mitigate the negative consequences of the changes in the currency exchange rates
the Company takes advantage of its geographic diversification. The Company also applies
hedging tools to its currency proceeds.
Risk of Contractor's Default, Failure to Pay on the part of the Contractor
The risk manifests itself in the possibility of untimely proceeds from the supplied goods. As
related to export sales, untimely and/or incomplete proceeds may require additional funds to
ensure fulfillment of the Company's financial obligations.
This risk is minimized by the contractual terms in view of which the settlements with third parties,
non-members of the LUKOIL Group are either made on a pre-paid basis or secured by letters of
credit or bank guarantees on the part of end buyers. The list of banks issuing letters of credit and
bank guarantees is subject to approval by the Company's corporate center.
Legal Risks
Tax and Customs Regulation Risks
The actions of the RF government focused on amending the taxation and customs policy are
primarily dictated by the state of the RF budget system and the way the domestic market is
regulated. Increased tax burden, unexpected changes in the tax and customs duty rates,
cancellation of the applicable incentive rates for a number of the Company's fields may affect
financial performance of the LUKOIL Group and its organizations.
Due to considerable fluctuations of the ruble to dollar exchange rate in the recent months and a
persisting trend towards further depreciation of the Russian ruble, there is a risk of additional
payments of customs duties accompanied by occasional declaration of oil and petroleum product
export supplies in excess of the planned amounts (except for pipeline transport supplies).
At the same time, in accordance with the Russian Law "On Customs Tariff" the Government of
the Russian Federation reconsiders export customs duties on oil and petroleum products on a
monthly basis. Customs duties are calculated based on what the oil price on the global oil
markets is, therefore, as the oil price falls, the duty rates are reducing as well, however starting
next calendar month.
High ruble volatility continues to bear significant risks and uncertainty in terms of the amount of
the export duties paid in rubles.
To manage the specified risks the Company conducts continuous monitoring of the taxation and
customs policy changes, participates in the discussions of legislative initiatives, promptly
assesses the influence produced by the probable changes in the taxation and customs
legislation upon the LUKOIL Group performance indicators, and takes respective measures in
order to either mitigate or offset the negative consequences of the changes in the taxation policy
and customs policy, for example, if possible, to be able to submit customs declarations as the
ruble to US dollar exchange rate is on the rise.
Risks Associated with Changes of the Russian Legislation on Joint-Stock Companies and
Securities Markets
Changes in the Russian corporate governance regulations, including those related to the
structure and competences of the regulatory bodies of a joint-stock company, due to the expected
amendments made into the Federal Law "On Joint-Stock Companies", as well as transition to
practical application of the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code (Letter of the Bank of
Russia No.06-52/2463 of April 10, 2014) in view of the reporting recommendations in accordance
with the Corporate Governance Code (Letter of the Bank of Russia No.IN-06-52/8 of February 17,
2016) may lead to changes in the Company's corporate structure and corporate governance
procedures, which in its turn may affect the Company's decision-making process and
performance.
The Company is constantly monitoring legislation changes in this field. The Company also takes
measures to collect information on such changes at the stage of preliminary discussion, and to
ensure participation of the Company's representatives in such discussions in order to provide a
detailed explanation of the Company's standpoint on these issues, risks and uncertainties which
may arise as a result of the proposed legislative initiatives.
The Company also takes measures to ensure participation of its representatives in the activities
focused on the development of efficient solutions in the area of practical application of the
effective legislative innovations.
Risks Associated with Circulation of the Company's Securities
The Company's securities circulate in regulated markets in Russia and abroad. Changes in the
requirements to the issuers on the part of the regulatory authorities for securities and stock
exchanges, as well as the changes in the listing structure may induce the Company to amend its
corporate governance procedures and assume extra obligations as to information disclosure and
shareholder relations. Should the Company fail to ensure compliance with these requirements
and fulfill the required obligations, it may result in transfer of the Company's securities to lower
listing segments, including delisting, which may have an adverse impact on the liquidity and cost
of the securities.
The Company monitors changes in the listing rules of stock exchanges and other requirements of
stock exchanges and regulatory authorities to the issuers whose securities are admitted for
circulation. The Company's representatives participate in the working meetings and other issuer
events arranged by stock exchanges and other organizations that provide consulting and
educational services to the issuers of the securities circulating in regulated markets. The
Company also seeks to introduce the best global practice in corporate governance and
shareholder relations.
Geological Risks
The Risk of Failure to Discover Geological Reserves or Discovery of the Reserves below the
Initially Expected Level
The Company's business is exposed to the risk that while implementing new projects, and
exploratory drilling, we might not discover any productive (commercially efficient) oil and gas
reserves, and/or that the discovered reserves will be considerably below the initially expected
level. Therefore, the Company may have to incur additional expenses or even cease operations
in a number of license areas.
PJSC LUKOIL strives to manage this risk at the level sufficient for prompt risk response, by
means of additional geologic exploration.
Risks Associated with Subsurface Use and Licensing
The applicable Russian legislation on subsurface use and licensing of exploration and
production activities, as well as their practical application expose oil companies to a number of
risks. The most important are the following ones:
-  risk of early termination of the subsoil license;
-  risk of failure to provide the companies with equal access to the subsoil resources of the
continental shelf;
-  risk of having no legislative guarantees to grant the right to subsurface use to a legal entity that
discovered a field of federal significance or a field located in the subsurface area of federal
significance (Russian continental shelf, internal and territorial seas of the RF, as well as the
Russian sector of the Caspian sea bottom), including the subsurface users with the share of
foreign investors in the companies' authorized capital);
-  risk of refusal to accept bidding documents for participation in competitive sales/biddings in
view of technicalities from subsurface users of the LUKOIL Group entities;
-  risk of fines imposed for administrative offenses for failure to fulfill the terms of license
agreements.
The Company is fully committed to minimizing the potential effects resulting from the realization
of the above risks, including the following:
- conducts monitoring of the changes in the legislation and in the area of subsurface use and
licensing, forwarding proposals to update the applicable regulatory framework;
-  creates a list of sites associated with the Unallocated Subsoil Stock, which are of interest to the
Company, in the oil and gas production companies, to ensure timely decision-making on
participation of the LUKOIL Group entities in the bidding procedures for subsoil use rights.
Prepares feasibility studies of new geological areas in the context of the existing basic unified
scenario conditions;
-  has established permanent working groups in the LUKOIL Group entities to develop the
bidding documents to participate in the bidding procedures and re-register licenses.
-  holds annual advanced training workshops for specialists in the area of licensing and subsoil
use, participates in workshops with governmental officers;
-  monitors current subsoil use state with application of a special information system;
-  interacts with the regulatory authorities in order to mitigate the risk of early subsoil license
termination.
Risk of Terrorist Attacks, Wrongful Acts by Third Parties
As the number of terrorist organizations increases, as well as that of terrorist attacks in the
countries of the Company's presence, there is a possibility of terrorist attacks and other wrongful
acts against the Company's assets.
Additional risks to the Company's assets are caused by the development of the military and
political situation in Iraq and in Syria in connection with the engagement of the international
coalition, as well as the Russian Federation, aimed at the destruction of illegal armed groups of
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
There are also risks related to wrongdoings on the part of LUKOIL's competitors (specifically,
risks of unfair competition), risks of financial and other abuses on the part of the LUKOIL Group
employees, as well as those related to theft of financial resources and commodity stocks.
The Company manages this risk in the following key areas:
-  participates in anti-terror events organized by the National Anti-terrorism Committee of Russia,
the RF Federal Security Service, the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs;
-  identifies persons who are intentionally inflicting harm on the Company's interests for the
benefit of competing and other third-party (including criminal) structures and persons;
-  plans and arranges events aimed at information security improvement;
-  implements the Information Safety Program in the LUKOIL Group Organizations;
-  obtains licenses issued by the RF Federal Security Services to use encryption-based
information security tools.
HSE Risks
The Company is exposed to the risk of failure of technical equipment at hazardous production
facilities, which may result in accidents, shutdowns, harmful emissions, negative environmental
impact, fire and occupational injuries, including those occurring as a result of offshore oil and gas
field development. This risk may result in unscheduled shutdowns of the production capacities
and, consequently, failure to receive the expected level of operating income.
In order to mitigate these risks the Company has created and is successfully implementing its
industrial safety system, including:
-  the use of  corporate standards, including those governing environmental safety matters;
-  production control over the operation of hazardous production facilities;
-  dedicated expert training;
-  diagnostics (non-destructive inspection) and monitoring of equipment parameters;
-  assessment of workplaces based on working conditions;
-  repairs and timely replacement of equipment;
-  building up a reserve for continuous preparedness of emergency response teams and
resources;
-  other measures to minimize accident rates at the Company's production facilities.
The applicable HSE Management System certified for compliance with the requirements of ISO
14001 and OHSAS 18001 international standards ensures prompt detection of discrepancies in
work organization and equipment operation, as well as development and implementation of
corporate target industrial and fire safety programs and plans, training of service personnel and
accident prevention services in emergency response.
Risks of Failure to Implement the Investment Program
While implementing investment projects, the Company has to face the risk of higher costs and
untimely commissioning of production assets.
Delays in project implementation, including those caused by the delays in preparing design and
estimate documentation, obtainment of approvals, conclusion of contracts, work execution
period, as well as changes in field development plans in connection with the collection of
additional geological information may result in a failure to implement the investment program.
This may lead to the deteriorated performance indicators for the subsequent years, undermined
efficiency of investment projects and the need to raise "excessive" funds.
The Company pays great attention to managing this risk by means of quarterly monitoring of
project implementation progress as well as by investment program adjustment. As the investment
program is developed, the greenfield development projects without any design and estimate
documentation are excluded from the plans for the coming year.
Risk Associated with the Lack of Qualified Personnel
The competence and expertise of the newly recruited employees may prove insufficient for them
to adequately fulfill their duties, which, in its turn, may adversely affect the financial performance
indicators of the Company.
To mitigate the negative impact of this risk, the Company focuses on integrated development of
the personnel potential. The Company has created and replenishes its personnel pool consisting
of the most experienced and the most promising employees; it pays special attention to the
recruitment of young specialists and graduates.
