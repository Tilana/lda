<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/175, in 
which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its sixty-
seventh session and to submit an interim report to the Human Rights Council at its 
nineteenth session. It reflects the patterns and trends in the human rights situation in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and provides information on the progress made in the 
implementation of the resolution. The report also draws upon observations made by treaty 
monitoring bodies, the special procedures of the Council and international non-
governmental organizations It refers to information from official State media, owing to the 
difficulty of collecting independent data on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>2. Since the previous report of the Secretary-General (A/66/361), human rights 
violations have continued, particularly in the case of journalists, human rights defenders, 
women&#8217;s rights activists and Government opponents. Concerns about torture, amputations, 
flogging, the increasingly frequent application of the death penalty (including in public and 
in cases of political prisoners and juvenile offenders), arbitrary detention and unfair trials 
continue to be raised by United Nations human rights mechanisms. Freedom of expression 
and assembly remained curtailed; opposition leaders have remained confined under house 
arrest since February 2011. Discrimination against minority groups persisted, in some cases 
amounting to persecution.  
</p>
<p>3. There were some positive developments, however, including the engagement by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran with the Human Rights Committee, in October 2011, and the visit 
of a working-level mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), in December 2011, to prepare for a visit by the High 
Commissioner. Also, a new Islamic Penal Code, adopted by Parliament in January 2012, 
omits the penalty of stoning and reduces the range of offences for which the death penalty 
may be applied against juveniles.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic issues  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including flogging and amputations 
</b></p>
<p>4. The recurrence of allegations of torture in detention facilities remains an area of 
grave concern to United Nations human rights mechanisms. The special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council and the United Nations treaty bodies 
continue to express concern over reports of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment taking place in detention facilities. During the review of the third 
periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the implementation of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in October 2011,1 the Human Rights Committee 
expressed deep concern about reports of the widespread use of torture and cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment in detention facilities, particularly of those accused of national 
security-related crimes. The Committee also expressed concern about the continued 
imposition of corporal punishment by judicial and administrative authorities, in particular 
amputations and flogging for a range of crimes, including theft, <i>moharebeh</i> (enmity against 
God) and certain sexual acts. In response, the Iranian authorities stressed that the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 CCPR/C/IRN/3. </p>


<p>Constitution forbids torture, the Penal Code stipulates stringent punishment for offenders, 
and confessions extracted through torture have no legal validity.   
</p>
<p>5. As referred to the communications report submitted to the Human Rights Council in 
September 2011,2 the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders,  in a joint communication, expressed concerns at the 
alleged detention and torture of Mohammad Reza Houtan Kian, a lawyer, who was arrested 
by security forces on 9 October 2010. After his indictment on 10 October, Mr. Kian was 
reportedly taken to Evin Prison, where he was allegedly kept in solitary confinement and 
subjected to frequent torture. On 24 January 2011, following a trial in which he had no 
access to a lawyer, Mr. Kian was reportedly sentenced to a year in prison and a five-year 
ban on practising law. Reports received also suggest that Nasser Alboshokeh Derafshan, an 
ethnic Arab who was reportedly arrested by security forces on 26 January 2012, died under 
torture during his detention. His family was informed of his death on 30 January 2012. 
During his detention, Mr. Alboshokeh was neither permitted contact with his family nor 
granted access to any legal representation. Local authorities reportedly warned the family 
members to keep the memorial service private as a condition for the funeral to take place.  
</p>
<p>6. Cases of amputation and corporal punishment, such as flogging, continue to be 
reported. On 11 December 2011, authorities in Shiraz reportedly amputated the hand and 
foot of two people. According to the official news agency, the Iranian Students&#8217; News 
Agency (INSA), the foot amputation was carried out in Adel Abad Prison on an armed 
robber who had already had one hand amputated. A hand amputation was carried out 
simultaneously on a second person charged with robbery. The Public Prosecutor of Shiraz 
stressed in media reports the effectiveness of sharia law in the deterrence of crimes, and 
that the judiciary was determined to deal decisively with serious crimes.3 On 29 October 
2011, another limb amputation was reported to have been carried out on a thief in Yazd 
central prison.4  
</p>
<p>7. Increasing cases of corporal punishment, particularly in public, also remain a cause 
of utmost concern. On 24 December 2011, a man accused of &#8220;forbidden acts&#8221; was 
reportedly publicly whipped in Masjid Soleiman province.5 On 20 December 2011, 
authorities in Shiraz carried out sentences of public lashing on three people accused of 
indecent conduct.6 Furthermore, according to media reports, three people accused of 
kidnapping were each publicly punished to 99 lashes on 31 October 2011 in Shahrod 
Province.7  
</p>
<p><b> B. The death penalty, including public executions 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Secretary-General welcomes the omission of the punishment of stoning and 
details of this method of execution in the new Islamic Penal Code adopted by Parliament in 
January 2012. The Secretary-General regrets, however, that the new law fails to fully

<p>abolish the death penalty or to restrict its imposition to only the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, as 
stipulated in article 6 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
new Penal Code still envisages the death penalty for people charged with &#8220;acts against 
national security&#8221;, <i>moharebeh</i>, <i>Mofsid Fil Arz</i> (corruption on earth), drug trafficking, rape, 
<i>Qisas</i> (retribution in kind) and certain other <i>hudud</i> crimes.  
</p>
<p>9. The death penalty reportedly continues to be widely applied, especially for drug-
related cases. In 2011, Amnesty International documented alarmingly high rates of drug 
related executions involving both Iranian citizens and foreign nationals; of 600 recorded 
executions in 2011, 488 were for drug-related offences. Thousands of people, including 
foreign nationals (particularly Afghans), are reported currently to be on death row.8 On 22 
September 2011, in a press statement, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment condemned the ongoing executions of people charged with drug-related 
offences, stressing that these do not amount to the most serious crimes for which the death 
penalty may be applied under international law. Concerns were also raised regarding fair 
trial safeguards, and access to lawyers and families for those convicted. The Iranian 
authorities argue that the issue of combating drug trafficking is a top priority for the country 
and must be deterred by severe penalties. OHCHR and special procedures mandate holders 
also received numerous reports on the application of <i>Qisas</i>-related executions.  
</p>
<p>10. On 26 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions9 drew the attention of the authorities to two members of the Kurdish minority at 
risk of imminent execution. Habib Latifi and Sherko Moarefi, accused of <i>moharebeh</i>, had 
their death sentences upheld by the Supreme Court for the second time in 2011 and their 
files were subsequently forwarded for execution of the sentence. On 17 December 2011, 
Iranian media reported that the death sentence of Zienab Jalaliyan, another Kurdish activist, 
had been commuted to life imprisonment. Ms. Jalaliyan had been sentenced to death on 
charges of <i>moharebeh</i> for her alleged membership in the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, 
defined as a terrorist group in the Islamic Republic of Iran.10      
</p>
<p>11. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was sentenced to death by stoning in 2006, still 
faces the risk of execution by hanging. On 25 December 2011, the head of the judiciary of 
the Eastern Azerbaijan province reiterated that the order for Ms. Ashtiani&#8217;s execution by 
hanging could be issued at any time. The order is reportedly pending the final approval of 
the chief of the national judiciary.11 Ms. Ashtiani is currently serving a 10-year prison 
sentence for complicity in her husband&#8217;s murder. 
</p>
<p>12.  A further worrying trend is the increasing number of public executions. At least 40 
public executions were reported by the authorities to have been carried out in 2011. Some 
of the executions were reportedly attended by a large crowd, including minors, a fact that 
also raises serious concerns about the devastating effect on the development of children 
who witness such executions. The authorities defend executions in public as effective in 
crime prevention. On 20 January 2012, a person accused of rape was reportedly hanged

<p>publicly in Khwajawi Square Karman.12 On 14 December 2011, media reports that a man 
who had cut his wrist a few minutes before his scheduled execution and was reportedly 
bleeding heavily was hanged publicly in Danesh Square of Shahre Kord.13 On 13 December 
2011, two people accused of kidnapping and rape were reportedly publicly executed in the 
town of Rostam, Fars Province.14 
</p>
<p><b> C. Execution of juvenile offenders  
</b></p>
<p>13. In a welcome development, the new Islamic Penal Code revokes capital punishment 
for persons under the age of 18 charged with certain crimes, such as smuggling narcotics. 
The law does not, however, increase the age of criminal liability of children, raising serious 
concern that children accused of murder may continue to face the death penalty. For 
example, in cases of attempted premeditated murder, persons under the age of 18 may 
remain in juvenile correction centres and be executed after reaching the legal age.15 
However, during its visit to Tehran in December 2011, the OHCHR delegation was 
informed by the authorities that the number of juvenile executions had dropped 
dramatically, and that offences committed by persons under the age of 18 were tried in 
children&#8217;s courts, where efforts were being made to apply lenient punishments. The 
authorities also pointed out that, even in cases of <i>qisas</i> (retribution), regarded under Iranian 
law as the private right of the victim&#8217;s family and which cannot be overruled by the 
judiciary, extensive efforts were being made by the Conciliation Commission of the 
judiciary to encourage families of the victim and perpetrator to reach a <i>diyah</i> (blood 
money) settlement. They also informed the delegation that the Government&#8217;s policy was to 
encourage the next of kin to forfeit the right to <i>qisas</i>, and that each year specific funds were 
earmarked by the Ministry of Justice to assist those convicted to pay the <i>diyah</i> settlement. 
</p>
<p>14. Against this backdrop, recurring cases of juvenile executions remain a serious cause 
for concern. On 22 September 2011, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment publicly condemned the practice of juvenile executions in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, and noted that, despite the repeated calls of the international community&#8217;s for a 
moratorium, three juveniles had been executed in public that year.16 These cases included 
the public execution on 21 September 2011 of 17-year-old Alireza Molla Soltani. The 
experts stressed that there was an absolute ban on the death penalty against persons under 
the age of 18 under international human rights law, and that any judgements imposing the 
death penalty upon juveniles below the age of 18, and their execution, were incompatible 
with the country&#8217;s international obligations.  
</p>
<p>15. On 11 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial and summary execution, in a

<p>joint communication,17 expressed their concern at the imposition of the death penalty on 
two children, Fatemeh Salbehi and Rangraz Tabatabaa&#8217;ie. According to information 
received, Ms. Salbehi was 16 years old when arrested in relation to the murder of her 
husband. She was reportedly interrogated without the presence of a lawyer. The Fars 
Criminal Court convicted her of murder and subsequently sentenced her to death. The death 
sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court. Mr. Tabatabaa&#8217;ie was allegedly arrested on 
suspicion of <i>lavat</i> (sodomy) in 2007 at the age of 17. He had no access to a lawyer and his 
confession was allegedly obtained under torture, which the court used as basis for the 
ruling. The Fars Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Tabatabaa&#8217;ie to death for offences allegedly 
committed when he was a child. The Supreme Court has reportedly upheld the decision.  
</p>
<p><b> D. </b>Women&#8217;s <b>rights  
</b></p>
<p>16. With regard to the Millennium Development Goals, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
made notable progress under Goal 1 (to reduce extreme poverty), Goal 2 (to achieve 
universal education), Goal 4 (to reduce child mortality by half) and Goal 5 (to reduce 
maternal mortality by two-thirds). It has also made considerable progress in literacy, health 
and education indices for women under its national development plans introduced in 1989. 
The female to male ratio for literacy was found to be 0.88, while the ratio for females to 
males in tertiary education increased from 1.09 to 1.15 in 2009. Access to health services, 
including reproductive health services, has improved; cases of infant mortality decreased to 
21 to 1,000, while the maternal morality ratio is 30 to 100,000. Births attended by skilled 
health staff rose from 90 per cent in 2007 to 97 per cent in 2011. Women account for 55 per 
cent of total staff members, and 71 per cent of staff in the nursing and midwifery sectors of 
the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and affiliated organizations. Gender 
disparities, however, differ among geographic regions.  
</p>
<p>17. Despite the progress made in higher education and health, scarce job opportunities 
and concomitant cultural and religious norms restrict women&#8217;s employment.18 According to 
the Human Development Report for 2011, the Islamic Republic of Iran ranks 98 out of 187 
in gender inequality.19 Only 13 per cent of the workforce in paid positions are women. In 
March 2010, the estimated unemployment rate was 11.9 per cent, but 16.8 per cent for 
women. There are reportedly more women civil servants, although the private sector is still 
male-dominated. It is reported that women&#8217;s admission to higher education, at least in 
technical universities, has been recently restricted. Based on these restrictions, it is 
estimated that less than 32 per cent of admitted students are female (45 per cent in 2007-
2008). If the decrease continues, women with higher education run the risk of having fewer 
opportunities for better paid jobs.  
</p>
<p>18. According to the Civil Code, the minimum age required for marriage is 13 years for 
girls and 15 years for boys. The Secretary-General is concerned at the low minimum age 
for girls, which is discriminatory and low by international standards. Iranian authorities 
claim, however, that, in practice, the age of marriage among boys and girls has risen and no 
one tends to marry under the age of 18. Nonetheless, marriages of girls under the age of 10 
have been reported. On 24 December 2011, the Head of the General Documents 
Registration Department of Hormzgan reported that five girls under the age of 10 had been

<p>married in the province.20 According to a report published by the official news outlet 
Khabaronline, 800,000 children have been married, of whom the majority are girls. The 
report cites a 6.5 per cent increase in the number of  child mothers, and suggests that 85 per 
cent of married girls between the age of 10 and 18 are married to men aged older than 18.  
</p>
<p>19.  Sistan and Baluchistan, provinces with low development indices, are reported to 
account for the highest rates.21 Reports of forced marriage are also emerging from some 
parts of the country. The head of the judiciary in Ilam reported that more than 10 per cent of 
marriages in the province were forced, and pointed out that forced marriages were the main 
reasons for the high rate of divorce and suicide among women in the province.22 
Furthermore, 66 per cent of Iranian women have reportedly experienced domestic violence 
at least once after their marriage. The rate was even higher in the southern cities of Bandar-
abbas and Zahedan.  
</p>
<p>20. Reports suggest that women&#8217;s rights activists remain under pressure for their 
advocacy; in particular, members of the Mourning Mothers23 and One Million Signatures 
Campaign continue to face harassment, intimidation and prosecution for their activities. 
Seven supporters of the Mourning Mothers were arrested in February 2010. Of these, Leila 
Seifolahi, Jila Karamzadeh Makvandi and Fatima Rastagari Nasab were all recently 
sentenced to four years of imprisonment for having &#8220;created an illegal organization&#8221; and 
&#8220;acted against national security&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>21. Special procedures mandate holders continue to receive reports of harassment, 
intimidation and persecution of minorities. Religious and ethnic minorities are reported to 
have been subjected systematically to a range of human rights violations and 
discrimination. On 22 February 2011, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the independent expert on minority issues, 
in a joint communication,24 expressed concern at the arrest and detention of 27 members of 
the Christian community between April 2010 and January 2011, which they feared could be 
linked to their religious beliefs or their peaceful activities on behalf of the Christian 
community. Pastor Behnam Irani, leader of a small church in Karaj, was arrested in April 
2010 while conducting church services. On 16 January 2011, he was reportedly tried on 
charges of apostasy and &#8220;action against the order&#8221;. It is alleged that, on 24 January 2011, 
Pastor Irani was kidnapped after leaving the tribunal. The authorities stress that religious 
and ethnic minorities enjoy protection under the Constitution and are free to perform their 
religious rites and ceremonies and, within the limits of the law, to act according to their 
own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education, and that individuals were 
not arrested or persecuted because of their belief.

<p>22. The case of Pastor Yousuf Naderkhani, who was sentenced to death for apostasy and 
evangelism, received considerable international attention. Arrested in October 2009, Pastor 
Naderkhani was found guilty and sentenced to death in September 2010. The death 
sentence was reportedly upheld by the Supreme Court, which added that, unless the accused 
decided to renounce Christianity, he would be executed by hanging. On 11 October 2011, 
however, the Supreme Court reportedly announced that the case was being re-examined 
owing to technicalities and that no final verdict had been passed.25 Earlier in October 2011, 
the Deputy Governor of Gilan Province laid new charges against Pastor Naderkhani, stating 
that he is not accused of converting people to Christianity but was rather guilty of crimes 
relating to security and of running a brothel.26  
</p>
<p>23. Reports of discrimination and restrictions, including travel bans, against members of 
Sunni Muslim sects also continued to be received. In November 2011, two Sunni scholars, 
Mufti Muhammad Qasim Qasimi and Mawlana Ahmad Noori, were prevented from 
travelling to Saudi Arabia for the <i>Hajj</i>. Mr. Qasimi, the interim <i>khateeb</i> of Sunnis in 
Zahedan and editor-in-chief of <i>Neday Islam</i> magazine, was stopped at Zahedan 
International Airport, while Mr. Noori, a senior teacher of Dar-al Uloom Zahedan, was 
stopped at Tehran airport. Sunni scholars have long complained about restrictions on 
building mosques and houses of worships in Tehran and Esfahan, and also on offering 
Friday and Eid prayers in congregations.   
</p>
<p>24. Special procedures mandate holders continue to raise the issue of mistreatment and 
discrimination against members of the Baha&#8217;i community with the Iranian authorities. In a 
</p>
<p>joint communication of 22 February 2011,27 the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the independent expert on minority issues 
expressed concern at the arrest and detention of 11 members of the Baha&#8217;i community in 
December 2010. In almost all cases, security agents reportedly searched their homes and 
confiscated books and other materials relating to the Baha&#8217;i faith. The mandate holders also 
expressed concern regarding the personal security of seven Baha&#8217;i community leaders, who 
</p>
<p>were sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2011. On 23 October 2011, in a press conference, 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief stressed that States are duty-bound 
to protect freedom of religion or belief, which is a fundamental human rights. He pointed 
out that the Islamic Republic of Iran had a policy of systematic persecution of persons 
belonging to the Baha&#8217;i faith, excluding them from the application of freedom of religion or 
belief by simply denying that their faith had the status of a religion.28 Iranian authorities 
regard Baha&#8217;ism as a political organization or cult, and stress that members of the 
organization have never obtained the required permit, which makes their activities illegal 
and against existing regulations.29 On 16 January 2012, the Head of the Yazd judiciary

<p> 29 Statement of Dr Mohammad Javad Larijani to the General Assembly, 21 November 2011.  </p>


<p>reportedly warned that members of the Baha&#8217;i community who caused disruption in the 
country would be seriously dealt with.30

<p>25. In its third periodic report submitted to the Human Rights Committee, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran stated that &#8220;all institutions of Government arise from the will and direct or 
indirect vote of the people&#8221;.31 The State party stressed that the electoral system was in 
conformity with article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which provides for free and fair elections. The Committee, however, expressed its concern 
at both the registration requirements in election campaign32 and the right of the Guardian 
Council to reject parliamentary candidates.33 The eligibility of candidates is defined by the 
Guardian Council, which screens all candidates. There are persistent concerns that the 
vetting power of the Guardian Council reduces the space for those who wish to participate 
in political life and undermines the right of Iranian citizens to elect the candidates of their 
choice. Furthermore, the absence of women, Sunni Muslims and recognized religious 
minorities in this powerful institution appears to undermine the fairness and transparency of 
the process.  
</p>
<p>26. A total of 5,395 people, including 428 women, had signed up for the country&#8217;s ninth 
parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2 March 2012. When compared with the 
parliamentary elections of 2008, the number of registered candidates had dropped by 30 per 
cent, a fact that the authorities attributed to amendments made to the electoral law, such as 
the requirement that the candidate hold a master&#8217;s degree.34 The candidates registered and 
running for election included 260 currently sitting lawmakers. On 11 February 2012, the 
Guardian Council announced its approval of 3,400 candidates to run for the elections in 
March. Approved candidates had eight days to campaign,35 which restricted their ability to 
present their policies and agendas to their constituents, and also limited voters&#8217; access to the 
information necessary to be able to make an informed choice.   
</p>
<p>27. Authorities estimated the overall turnout at 64.2 per cent for the election held on 2 
March, an increase in voter turnout of 10 per cent, over the previous parliamentary 
elections. Some 3,467 candidates reportedly competed in the election, and 48 million 
citizens were eligible to vote at more than 47,000 polling stations across the country. A 
total of 850,000 observers reportedly supervised the election process, and 13,000 local and 
350 foreign reporters provided coverage. Serious concerns remain about the vetting of the 
candidates for the election.36 Initial reports indicated that between 30 and 50 currently 
serving members of the parliament, including Ali Motahari, a vocal critic of the

<p>Government, Hamidreza Katoziyan, the chairman of the Majlis Energy Committee and a 
conservative who supported the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi during the 2009 
presidential elections, Dariush Qanbari, the spokesman of the Majlis minority faction, and 
Alireza Mahjoub, who is considered a representative of labourers, had been disqualified.37 
Some Members of Parliament challenged the legality of their disqualification, although few 
of the above-mentioned candidates were reportedly reinstated. At least 28 Members of 
Parliament, who had called for the questioning of the President, were reportedly either 
disqualified or their candidature rejected.38 It was also reported that the Guardian Council 
reinstated a number of candidates only days before the election, thus depriving candidates 
of the possibility of conducting proper campaigns. Senior officials and the clergy have 
reportedly denounced reformist candidates and appealed for a high voter turnout in 
response to opposition moves to encourage a boycott of the polls. According to media 
reports, the judiciary has also announced that any statement calling for a boycott of the 
elections and endangering security is a crime.39   
</p>
<p>28. In early November 2011, three reformist political parties (the Islamic Iran 
Participation Front, the Mujahidin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran and the Freedom 
Movement of Iran) reportedly had their licenses suspended and were banned from 
upcoming elections. On 4 November 2011, Solat Mortazawi, Chief of parliamentary 
election headquarters, announced that the three parties did not have relevant permits for 
political activities and were thus banned from running or presenting electoral lists for the 
election in March 2012.40  
</p>
<p>29. The Secretary-General is concerned that the two main opposition leaders, Mir 
Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, remained under house arrest and had limited contacts 
with the outside world during the elections. Such restrictions adversely affect the holding of 
free, fair and participatory elections. The opposition leaders were put under house arrest 
after seeking permission from the authorities to stage a rally on 14 February 2011. On 16 
November 2011, Mohammad Javad Larijani, Head of the High Council for Human Rights, 
publicly stated that the reasons for the confinement of the opposition leaders included 
incitement to violence and other illegal activities.41  
</p>
<p>30. Concerns continue about the continued crackdown on media professionals and the 
pervasive restrictions applied to freedom of opinion and expression. In its concluding 
observations on the report submitted by the State party, the Human Rights Committee 
expressed its concern at the arrest and detention of many journalists, newspaper editors, 
film maker and media workers since the presidential election of 2009, and that many 
newspapers and magazines had been closed. The Committee also expressed its concern 
about the monitoring of Internet use and contents, the blocking of websites carrying 
political news and analysis, the slowing down of Internet speeds and the jamming of 
foreign satellite broadcasts, in particular since the elections.42   
</p>
<p>31. During the reporting period, authorities continued to apply heavy restrictions to the 
media, in particular various newspapers, foreign broadcasters and websites, and arrested a

<p>large number of journalists. According to various sources,43 more than 40 journalists are 
currently imprisoned, with at least seven journalists and bloggers detained solely in January 
</p><p>2012. This includes the arrest of women&#8217;s rights activist and blogger, Parastou Dokouhaki, 
on 15 January 2012; and the arrest of the journalists Marzieh Rasouli, on 17 January on 
charges of &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;; Sahamoddin Bourghani, on 18 January; and 
Saeed Madadi, on 7 January. Furthermore, on 15 January, the Director of the official 
Iranian news agency IRNA and the press adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Ali 
Akbar Javanfekr, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence and a five-year ban on 
membership of parties, groups and associations, as well as on journalistic and media 
activities concerning topics deemed contrary to Islamic norms and public morals.44   
</p>
<p>32. On 29 January 2012, the Supreme Court reportedly upheld the death sentence for 
blogger Saeed Malekpour on charges of &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; for having developed a 
website considered obscene in Persian.45 IT professionals Vahid Asghari and Ahmad Reza 
Hashempour were also sentenced to death by a lower court on similar charges. In a recent 
report, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of the rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression stressed that the imprisonment of bloggers was a clear example of the 
criminalization of legitimate expression, pointing out that 13 bloggers had been imprisoned 
in the Islamic Republic on charges relating to the content of their online expression.46  
</p>
<p>33. Journalists and other media professionals working with foreign-based media outlets 
have also faced arrest on suspicion of espionage. The arrests on 17 September 2011 of 
independent documentary film-makers Hadi Afarideh, Shahnam Bazdar, Mojtaba 
Mitahmasb, Naser Saffarian, Katayoun Shahabi and Mohsen Shahrnazdar in connection 
with a BBC documentary about the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sparked 
widespread protests and criticism. On 20 September, the authorities stated that the people 
arrested had carried out anti-Iranian missions by providing the BBC with information.47 The 
BBC rejected the allegations and stressed that none of the six Iranian film makers had been 
involved in the production of the documentary. In December 2011, the official news agency 
ISNA reported that all six film-makers were released after each posted the equivalent of 
$200,000 bail.48 On 13 November, the Iranian authorities reported the arrest of Hassan 
Fathi for working secretly for the Persian language service of the BBC. Mr. Fathi was 
charged with &#8220;spreading lies&#8221; about the Islamic Republic and attempting to manipulate 
public opinion.49 On 6 February 2012, State media again reported the arrest of people 
secretly working for the Persian language services of BBC.50 Reports also suggest that the 
authorities routinely harass, intimidate, question and detain relatives of Iranian journalists 
working with foreign-based media.51

<p>34. The decision of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to close the Iranian 
House of Cinema, which was founded 20 years ago and registered as a non-governmental 
institute, received considerable attention both locally and internationally. The institute was 
the parent group for motion picture guilds and a forum of visual artistic expression with 
more than 5,000 members. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance claimed that the 
guild had been established without following required legal procedures, and that 
amendments had been made to its charter without the Iran Public Culture Council having 
been informed. Marzieh Vafamehr, a prominent actress who was arrested in June 2011, was 
released in October 2011 after having spent nearly five months in Varamin prison, south-
east of Tehran. Ms. Vafamehr was charged with having participated in &#8220;the production of a 
vulgar film&#8221; and &#8220;anti-sharia conduct&#8221;, for pretending to drink alcohol, shaving her head 
and appearing without <i>hijab</i> (Islamic dress) in a film. She was initially sentenced to one 
year in prison and 90 lashes, which was, however, commuted to a suspended sentence of 
three months of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>35. On 28 December 2011, authorities reportedly blocked access to the website run by 
the Chairman of the Expediency Council, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. On 2 January 2012, 
the Prosecutor-General, Gholam Mohsen Eijei, confirmed that the website had been 
blocked because it had criminal content.52 Authorities also reportedly introduced a new set 
of regulations that require all Internet caf&#233;s to install surveillance cameras and collect 
personal information about their customers.53 According to media reports, police closed 
down a number of Internet caf&#233;s and arrested their owners for using proxies and not 
implementing proper security measures.54 Access to foreign webmail  services, such as 
Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail, reportedly also continues to be disrupted. On 11 February 
2012, the semi-official Mehr news outlet reported that, since 9 February 2012, more than 30 
million people in the Islamic Republic of Iran had no access to their foreign e-mail 
accounts.55 Declaring Internet access a human right, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression has stressed that everyone has 
the right to express himself or herself through any media or new communication 
technologies such as the Internet; for that reason, restricting access completely was in 
breach of article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.56  
</p>
<p>36. During the period under review, a number of newspapers were banned and several 
others had their licenses revoked. On 5 November 2011, Iranian authorities reportedly 
banned <i>Rozgar</i> for two months for propaganda against the system and for having published 
classified information.57 Another daily newspaper, <i>Etemad</i>, was reportedly closed down for 
alleged propaganda against the system, acts against national security, publication of 
unfounded issues and insult. On 20 November 2011, the Tehran Prosecutor confirmed the 
suspension of activities of <i>Etemad</i>.58 In 2011, authorities also reportedly issued a blacklist 
of publishers and writers  and suspended the licenses of numerous publishers. Several 
publishers were allegedly prevented from exhibiting at the Tehran International Book Fair. 
Writers have also reportedly been subjected to harassment by tax authorities or censorship

<p>practices of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which have had an adverse 
impact on the publishing industry and resulted in number of writers postponing the 
publication of their books.  
</p>
<p>37. The Secretary-General notes with concern that human rights defenders continue to 
face a precarious situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 10 September 2011, 
authorities arrested Abdolfattah Soltani, a prominent lawyer and human rights activist in 
Tehran, on charges of collusion, propaganda against the system and acquisition of property 
through illegitimate means. He was reportedly taken to Evin Prison and placed in solitary 
confinement. His house and law office were searched and his computer and personal 
documents were confiscated. Mr. Soltani has represented many high-profile political and 
human rights activists; his arrest is believed to be linked to his profession as a human rights 
activist and lawyer. A court hearing scheduled for 31 December 2011 was postponed at the 
request of Mr. Soltani, and owing also to the absence of the prosecutor.59 In February 2012, 
Mr. Soltani was allegedly sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment and banned from 
practicing law for 20 years. On 16 November 2011, during a press conference in New 
York, the Head of the High Council for Human Rights in Iran, Dr. Mohammad Javad 
Larijani, stated that no lawyer was in prison for his/her profession, but accused Mr. Soltani 
of having had ties with terrorist groups.  
</p>
<p>38. The Secretary-General regrets the fact that, despite persistent calls from the High 
Commissioner and from special procedures mandate holders, Nasrin Sotoudeh, another 
prominent human rights lawyer, remains in prison. Ms. Sotoudeh was arrested on 4 
September 2010 and charged with having &#8220;acted against national security&#8221;, &#8220;not wearing 
<i>hijab</i> during a videotaped message&#8221;, &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and for being a 
member of the Centre for Human Rights Defenders. She was sentenced to 11 years of 
imprisonment, as well as a 20-year ban on practicing law and leaving the country. In 
September 2011, the Court of Appeal reduced her sentence to six years and the ban on 
working to 10 years. On 6 May 2011, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in its 
opinion 21/2011, found that depriving Ms. Sotoudeh of her liberty was arbitrary and in 
violation of various provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and requested the Government to 
release her immediately and provide her with adequate reparation. Furthermore, in 
September 2011, Nargis Mohammadi, a human rights activist and vice-president of the 
Centre for Human Rights Defenders, founded by Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, was 
sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment on charges of &#8220;assembly and collusion against 
national security&#8221;, membership of the Centre and propaganda against the regime. Ms. 
Mohammadi had been arrested at her home in Tehran on 10 June 2010 and taken to Evin 
Prison, where she was held incommunicado for 20 days before her release on bail on 1 July 
2010. Although Ms. Mohammadi is currently on bail, she remains at risk of arrest.

<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the  International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities &#8211; and the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography. It is also a signatory to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>40. The Human Rights Committee considered the third periodic report of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran60 at its 103rd session, on 17 and 18 October 2011, the State party&#8217;s first 
report submitted to the Committee in 18 years.  In its concluding observations,61 the 
Committee welcomed the opportunity to renew its constructive dialogue with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and noted various positive developments, such as the signing of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict, its accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention of the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee, however, expressed concern at the 
inequality of women with regard to marriage, family and inheritance; the cases of 
harassment, persecution and cruel punishment, including the death penalty, faced by 
members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community; the extremely high and 
increasing number of death sentences; the execution of minors; the widespread use of 
torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in detention facilities; the frequent 
violations of fair trial guarantees; and the discrimination faced by minority groups. The 
Committee encouraged the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that all obligations of the 
Covenant are fully respected and Iranian legislation and practices are brought into line with 
its provisions.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>41. There have been no visits by special procedures mandate holders since 2005, despite 
a standing invitation issued to all thematic mandate holders in 2002. The Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran has agreed in principle to a number of visits of special procedures, 
including that of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances,62 the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions63 and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.64 To date, however, the said visits have not 
been scheduled. Requests for country visits by other mandate holders, including the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, remain 
outstanding. Iranian authorities reconfirmed to OHCHR their plan to invite two mandate 
holders to visit in 2012, although the mandates have not yet been specified. 
</p>
<p>42. Since his appointment in August 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has appealed to the Government to extend full 
cooperation to his mandate and also officially requested a country visit, without obtaining a 
positive response. The Special Rapporteur stressed that engagement with the country

Republic of Iran has repeatedly expressed concern. In a positive move, the Permanent 
Missions of the Islamic Republic of Iran in New York and Geneva received the Special 
Rapporteur for a meeting and assured him of their cooperation. The Special Rapporteur 
presented his first report to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session 
(A/HRC/19/66), on 12 March 2012. Presenting the report, the Special Rapporteur regretted 
the unwillingness of Iranian authorities to cooperate substantively with human rights 
mechanisms, in particular with the country mandate holder. He also expressed his deep 
concern at the deteriorating situation of human rights in the country, in particular at the 
restrictions imposed on the freedoms of expression, association and assembly, the dramatic 
increase in the frequency of executions, the lack of due process and the discrimination 
against minorities. The Iranian authorities, however, stressed that the Special Rapporteur 
had repeated baseless allegations without paying any attention to the positive aspects of 
human rights in the country. The Special Rapporteur subsequently met with Khosro 
Hakimi, the Deputy Head of the High Council for Human Rights in Iran, and with 
Government officials visiting Geneva from Tehran.  
</p>
<p>43.  Special Procedures mandate holders sent a total of 17 communications to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in 2011, of which the Iranian authorities responded to only one.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>44. In February 2010, the Islamic Republic of Iran officially invited the High 
Commissioner to visit the country, which the High Commissioner accepted, but requested 
that a working-level mission be allowed to visit the country in advance to prepare for her 
visit. The Iranian authorities invited a working-level preparatory delegation to visit from 19 
to 22 December 2011.  
</p>
<p>45. While in Tehran, the working-level delegation held meetings with senior 
Government officials, members of the judiciary, Members of Parliament, the NAM Centre 
on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, the United Nations country team and diplomatic 
missions. Requests made before and during the visit for meetings with opposition figures 
under house arrest, access to other prisoners of concern, and a meeting with a range of 
independent civil society representatives, were declined. The delegation sought to raise 
individual cases of concern to the High Commissioner, and also offered technical assistance 
in relation to key legislation, such as the revised Islamic Penal Code, the Criminal 
Procedure Code, juvenile justice laws and a proposed new law on the establishment and 
supervision of non-governmental organizations. Following the discussions, it was agreed 
that a visit by the High Commissioner would require more in-depth preparation and 
outreach to different actors in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This could involve follow-up 
missions during which OHCHR staff members could interact with a broader range of 
officials, civil society and media, and further discuss priorities for a future programme of 
technical cooperation and the issues and cases that have been raised by the High 
Commissioner.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendation  
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> In the present report, the Secretary-General highlights many areas of 
continuing concern in relation to the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Iran. He is deeply troubled by reports of the increasing number of executions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in public, executions of juvenile offenders, amputations, flogging, arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrest and detention, unfair trials, torture and ill-treatment, and the severe </b></p>


<p><b>restrictions placed on media professionals, film-makers, human rights defenders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers and opposition activists.  
</b></p>
<p>47.<b> The Secretary-General notes that the authorities have taken some positive 
steps, for instance, the decision to revoke stoning as a method of execution and to limit 
</b></p>
<p><b>the application of the death penalty for juvenile offenders. The Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p><b>expresses, however, his concern that the new Islamic Penal Code fails to abolish 
</b></p>
<p><b>execution of juvenile offenders and has not raised the age of criminal liability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children. He strongly encourages the Government to revise the Islamic Penal Code 
</b></p>
<p><b>and juvenile justice laws to ensure compliance with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and to end punishments that are prohibited under international law. In the 
</b></p>
<p><b>meantime, the Secretary-General calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to institute a 
</b></p>
<p><b>moratorium on such executions. 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The Secretary-General welcomes the recent efforts made by the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to report to human rights treaty bodies. He encourages the country 
</b></p>
<p><b>to implement the concluding observations made in October 2011 by the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee with regard to the civil and political rights of the people of the Islamic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Iran, and ensure that all obligations of the Covenant are fully respected in 
</b></p>
<p><b>law and in practice. The Secretary-General calls upon the Government to ratify the 
</b></p>
<p><b>remaining core international human rights treaties, in particular, the Convention on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> The Secretary-General welcomes the expressed intention of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to invite two special procedures mandate holders for a visit in 2012. 
</b></p>
<p><b>He regrets, however, that despite requests for a country visit, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has not yet been 
</b></p>
<p><b>admitted to the country. The Secretary-General encourages the Government to fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate in the fulfilment of the Special </b>Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate by inviting him to the 
</p>
<p><b>country.   
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> The Secretary-General remains concerned about the low rate of replies to the 
large number of communications sent by other special procedures alleging very 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious human rights violations, and calls upon the Government to strengthen its 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration with the Human Rights Council in this particular area. The Secretary-
</b></p>
<p><b>General underscores the valuable contribution that special procedures mandates can 
</b></p>
<p><b>make to monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in the Islamic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Iran, as well as in facilitating technical assistance in relevant areas.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> The Secretary-General welcomes the cooperation extended by the Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran to OHCHR, including through the invitation of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>working-level preparatory delegation, which visited the country from 19 to 22 
</b></p>
<p><b>December 2011. The Secretary-General encourages the Government to continue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen such cooperation with a view to enhance further respect respect and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights in the country. 
</b></p>
