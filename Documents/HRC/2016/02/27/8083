<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 48/141, in which the General Assembly established the mandate of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Assembly decided that one 
of the responsibilities of the High Commissioner would be to promote and protect the 
realization of the right to development and to enhance support from relevant bodies of the 
United Nations system for that purpose. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 66/155, the General Assembly reaffirmed its request to the High 
Commissioner, in mainstreaming the right to development, to undertake effectively 
activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development among Member 
States, development agencies and the international development, financial and trade 
institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in her next report to the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 19/34, requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR) to continue to submit to the Council an annual report on its 
activities, including on inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system with 
regard to the promotion and realization of the right to development. Similarly, the General 
Assembly, in its resolution 66/155, requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to 
the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and an interim report to the Council on the 
implementation of resolution 66/155, including efforts made at the national, regional and 
international levels in the promotion and realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned requests 
and provides information on the activities undertaken by OHCHR in the period from 
December 2011 to June 2012. It supplements the report of the Secretary-General and the 
High Commissioner on the right to development submitted to the Council at its nineteenth 
session (A/HRC/19/45). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights relating to 
the promotion and realization of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>5. The programme of OHCHR on the promotion and realization of the right to 
development is set out in programme 19 of the strategic framework for the period 2012-
2013 and guided by a multidimensional strategy in accordance with the Declaration on the 
Right to Development, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Millennium 
Declaration and other relevant instruments, as well as by the above-mentioned mandates of 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. The implementation of this policy 
framework is undertaken within the framework of the OHCHR Management Plan for 2012-
2013: Working for results.1  
</p>
<p>6. The promotion and effective realization of the right to development remain a key 
objective of OHCHR that is fully supported by the Office&#8217;s thematic strategies. The 
thematic strategy in which the right to development is situated seeks to combat poverty and 
increase the integration of human rights standards and principles into the policies of the 
United Nations system at the national and international levels. In addition to the support

<p>given to the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council in their work on the right to 
development, the Office builds on the momentum gathered during the commemoration in 
2011 of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development to 
mobilize broader support for human rights-based policy coherence in strengthening the 
global partnership for development. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Advocacy, outreach and communications  
</b></p>
<p>7. Realizing the right to development of persons with disabilities requires the adoption 
of a human rights-based approach to disability that respects their active, free and 
meaningful participation in development, the fair distribution of resulting benefits, and their 
inclusion in society on an equal basis with others. This also requires a twin-track approach 
to development. The rights of persons with disabilities must be mainstreamed into 
development programmes in general. This includes both action at the national level and 
support through international cooperation, as specifically recognized in article 32 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. During the period under review, 
OHCHR published an information note on the right to development of persons with 
disabilities.2 
</p>
<p>8. In a letter addressed to the President of the thirteenth session of the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held in Doha in April 2012, the High 
Commissioner stated that human rights, including the right to development, can help fortify 
and reinforce development-centred globalization, the theme of the session. She underlined 
the fact that development would be inclusive and sustainable only when those who tend to 
be excluded have full participation in development. There was a need to allow for policy 
space for the concerns of poor, vulnerable and marginalized individuals and groups, and to 
give them a voice. The human rights framework, and, in particular, the Declaration on the 
Right to Development, presented a development paradigm aimed at the improved well-
being of all people, including through free, active and meaningful participation in 
development; the equitable distribution of the benefits of development, and the promotion 
of an equitable international order in which all human rights can be realized. Shared 
responsibilities, human rights-based policy coherence and systemic integration could 
strengthen further the global partnership for development.3  
</p>
<p>9. In April 2012, the High Commissioner addressed a letter to all Permanent Missions 
in Geneva concerning the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
(Rio+20).4 The High Commissioner called upon all Member States to integrate key human 
rights considerations fully into the outcome document. Member States should commit to 
ensuring full coherence between efforts to advance the green economy, on the one hand, 
and their solemn human rights obligations, on the other. They should recognize that all 
policies and measures adopted to advance sustainable development must be firmly 
grounded in, and respectful of, all internationally agreed human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, including the right to development. To those ends, all actors, in both public and 
private sectors, should exercise due diligence, including through the use of human rights 
impact assessments. Particular care must be taken to prevent and remedy any negative 
impact on the human rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups, including indigenous 
peoples, minorities, migrants, persons living in poverty, older persons, persons with 
disabilities and children. The empowerment of women, the protection of their rights and

 4  See www.OHCHR.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/WantedHumanRightsinRio.aspx. </p>


<p>their meaningful participation in decision-making must be assured. States should resolve to 
work to advance a human rights-based approach to the green economy, based on the 
principles of participation, accountability at both the national and international levels, non-
discrimination, empowerment and the rule of law, and to pursue a model of economic 
growth that is socially and environmentally sustainable, just and equitable, and respectful of 
all human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. In the period under review, new web stories were reported and widely disseminated 
by OHCHR through social media and on the Internet. Themes included Rio+20 and human 
rights on social media; human rights and development at the centre of globalization; human 
rights in Rio; and people-centred development in the context of the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p><b> B. Events and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>11. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
provided the international community with an opportunity to reflect on the lessons learned, 
achievements made and the potential of the right to development to help address 
contemporary global challenges in an increasingly interdependent and globalized world. 
The anniversary inspired an unprecedented amount of initiatives and activities by 
stakeholders, international organizations, academic institutions, non-governmental 
organizations and civil society. OHCHR organized 13 international events, including 
seminars, workshops, and panel and roundtable discussions, and developed and 
disseminated three new information notes and a video, including on social media platforms. 
Some 20 public statements were made in support of the right to development. Many of the 
discussions echoed the four key messages that the High Commissioner emphasized at the 
launch of the anniversary year: the right to development is a fundamental human right; the 
right to development belongs to everyone, without discrimination; the right to development 
is as relevant today as it was on the day the Declaration was adopted; and that we must act 
together in a determined and coherent manner in order to realize the right to development.6  
</p>
<p>12. In December 2011, OHCHR organized in New York an expert roundtable in 
commemoration of the anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development on the 
theme &#8220;People at the centre: human rights in global economics and development&#8221;, opened 
</p>
<p>by Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz.7 The discussion highlighted the need to pay 
serious attention to human rights-based approaches, with a focus on active, free and 
meaningful participation, higher levels of accountability, non-discrimination and attention 
to vulnerability, the political and economic empowerment of people, fair distribution and an 
explicit linkage to international human rights norms and standards, as well as effective 
international cooperation in support of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>13. The Non-Aligned Movement, in cooperation with OHCHR, the Friedrich Ebert 
Foundation and Nord-Sud XXI, organized a panel discussion in December 2011 on the 
theme &#8220;The relevance of the right to development in the context of global challenges&#8221;.8 The 
meeting underlined the current relevance of the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
the importance of renewing political commitment to its realization and overcoming the 
political impasse, in particular in the light of the popular uprisings in the Middle East and

<p>North Africa. Participants in the discussions also stressed the need to mainstream the right 
to development and human rights-based thinking into development policymaking, to move 
to an empirical framework and towards development-centred globalization.  
</p>
<p>14. In December 2011, OHCHR gave a presentation on the occasion of the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development at an event organized jointly 
by the Australian Council for International Development and the United Nations 
Information Centre in Canberra. The OHCHR representative highlighted the topicality of 
the Declaration and the need to analyse the economic crises from that perspective. She 
pointed to the need to include human rights considerations when assessing progress in 
development, and drew particular attention to the challenges for realizing the right to 
development in the Pacific.  
</p>
<p>15. The global commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development included a statement made by the Secretary-General,9 who called on 
world leaders to respond to the demands of people who seek to build their own future.10  
</p>
<p>16. The second seminar on the promotion and strengthening of the rights of people of 
African descent in Central America, organized by OHCHR in February 2012, devoted a day 
to a discussion on the issue of people of African descent and the right to development. 
During the discussion, ideas were exchanged on how to integrate a human rights-based 
approach to development for people of African descent in Central America and the 
Caribbean.  
</p>
<p>17. In March 2012, the Office organized a lecture on the right to development for 
professors and students of universities in the Russian Federation, who visited OHCHR 
within the framework of the human rights orientation programme of the OHCHR Human 
Rights Masters Programme. This is an example of numerous presentations, briefings and 
lectures that OHCHR continues to deliver at civil society gatherings, academic institutions 
and universities and to the general public on the right to development. 
</p>
<p>18. In March 2012, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights participated in 
the special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods Institutions, the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) and UNCTAD on the theme &#8220;Coherence, coordination and 
</p>
<p>cooperation in the context of financing for development&#8221;. Attention was drawn to the 
human rights dimension of this issue. Participants in the meeting stated that human rights 
establish minimum standards and provide criteria for prioritizing. Human rights policy 
coherence was therefore particularly important, for States as much as for the United 
Nations and other international actors, to ensure a credible and coherent response to 
economic and social challenges, with human rights as the baseline and yardstick. 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR co-sponsored a side event during the special high-level meeting on the 
theme &#8220;People-centred development: creating an enabling environment for productive 
investment and decent jobs&#8221;. Attention was particularly drawn to the need to avoid social 
</p>
<p>disruption as a result of budget cuts to the detriment of human rights, to the need to shift 
macroeconomic policies towards people-centred development, and to assess economic 
policy using the ethical lens of human rights standards. The Office placed a web-story on 
that occasion on its website.11

<p>20. The International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions 
held a panel discussion in March 2012 on national human rights institutions and the right to 
development. The main purpose of the discussion was to give the institutions the chance to 
exchange information and experiences on their activities at the national level on the right to 
development, and also to hear from relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms on 
their experience. Presentations were made by the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty 
and human rights, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the national 
human rights institutions of Cameroon, Nicaragua and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>21. In March 2012, the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Mission in South 
Sudan organized a two-day training workshop for civil society organizations on human 
rights and the role of such organizations in the realization of the South Sudan Development 
Plan. The scope of the discussion was based on, inter alia, the definition of development as 
included in the Declaration on the Right to Development. The three-year plan of the 
Mission aims at achieving security, development, economic growth and the reduction of 
poverty. Participants were trained on skills, techniques and approaches to monitoring the 
developmental goals spelled out in the Plan. Participants also learned how to work with 
other partners in South Sudan to promote the right to development. Participants in the 
workshop also looked at the role of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary in 
promoting and protecting the right to development and at the progressive realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights as laid out in the transitional Constitution of South 
Sudan. 
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR provided inputs to a number of events, such as a panel discussion on 
human rights mainstreaming and international cooperation organized during the nineteenth 
session of the Human Rights Council12 and the high-profile panel discussion hosted by the 
High Commissioner on International Women&#8217;s Day, on the theme &#8220;Capitalizing on 
women&#8217;s potential in times of crisis&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
during her visit to the Solomon Islands in March 2012, urged the Government and the 
country&#8217;s development partners to launch specific programmes targeting women and their 
right to development and the right to a life free from violence.13 The mission was 
underpinned by the recognition of the ongoing challenges faced by the Solomon Islands in 
overcoming poverty and underdevelopment, as well as the efforts made by the Government, 
together with its development partners, to achieve this important goal. 
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR provided secretariat support to the Open-ended Working Group on the 
Right to Development, which convened its thirteenth session in Geneva from 7 to 11 May 
</p><p>2012. At the session, the Working Group focused on a first reading of the criteria proposed 
by the high-level task force, collecting views thereon or on refinements to the proposed 
criteria, as well as proposals for additional criteria. The High Commissioner opened the 
session and underlined the fact that justice, dignity and freedom from fear and want were 
central tenets of the right to development. Human rights must be regarded as indispensible 
assets and indeed as the foundations of a global partnership for development that aims at 
achieving the well-being of all people without discrimination. The full integration of the 
right to development into all areas of the work of the United Nations system and of 
international financial and trade institutions, as well as its major processes, such as the 
follow-up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries), the 
thirteenth session of UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, the quadrennial comprehensive policy review and the development agenda

<p>beyond 2015, was important. She pointed out that the politicization, polarization and the 
impasse in the intergovernmental debate on the right to development had to end. A common 
objective should be to create a practical and operational framework for the implementation 
of the right to development so as to realize the potential of this right with open, sustained 
engagement, including through encouraging the participation and input of a wider 
constituency.14 
</p>
<p>25. While trade liberalization and negotiations around trade agreements are ongoing in 
the Pacific, the consideration of human rights in such processes and debates has been 
lacking. The draft guiding principles of human rights impact assessments of trade and 
investment agreements developed by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food15 provide a 
new modality to support interested States with concrete technical assistance. This 
potentially not only brings human rights into the debate but can prevent any potential 
negative impact of trade agreements on the enjoyment of human rights. This is particularly 
important in the case of small island developing States. A number of States in the Pacific 
currently conducting trade-related negotiations are showing interest in human rights impact 
assessments as well.  
</p>
<p>26. In August 2011, OHCHR initiated a project on human rights impact assessments 
relating to general trade liberalization. The overall objectives of the project were to collect 
further information on and examples of possible areas of impact, and to advocate for the 
inclusion of human rights in country- and agreement-specific trade discussions. Jointly with 
the UNDP Pacific Centre, a more comprehensive project was developed for accession by 
Vanuatu to WTO. The project, which is ongoing, comprises research, mapping and the 
identification of areas of possible impact, as well as a planned in situ visit. 
</p>
<p>27. OHCHR continues its efforts to mainstream human rights, including the right to 
development, into the United Nations system, including through the United Nations 
Development Group human rights mainstreaming mechanism. The High-Level Committee 
on Programmes, at its twenty-third session, held in March 2012, agreed to include human 
rights policy coherence as a regular agenda item and to discuss relevant human rights 
themes, as and when required, and to integrate human rights more systematically into joint 
advocacy statements and system-wide messages of the United Nations System Chief 
Executives Board for Coordination. 
</p>
<p>28. In June 2012, the High Commissioner addressed a letter to all heads of United 
Nations departments, bodies, funds and programmes, specialized agencies, as well as 
international financial and multilateral trading institutions, in an effort to identify 
opportunities or obstacles to the full mainstreaming of the right to development into the 
mandates, policies and operational programmes and activities of the respective 
organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations

right to development by means of research, analysis, public advocacy, technical
