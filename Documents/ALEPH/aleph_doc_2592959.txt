PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY
This prospectus supplement summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, and the documents we
incorporate by reference. It does not contain all of the information that you should consider before making an investment decision. For a more complete understanding of our
business and this offering, you should carefully read the entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein,
including our historical financial statements and the notes thereto, which are incorporated herein by reference from our 2015 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. You should read "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-14 of this prospectus supplement, on page 4 of the
accompanying prospectus and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
for more information about important risks that you should consider before making a decision to invest in our common stock.
Certain information with respect to our estimated proved reserves referred to and incorporated by reference herein is based in part upon the audit of our proved reserve
estimates by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., a firm of independent petroleum engineers. Such information is included and incorporated herein in reliance on the authority of such
firm as an expert in petroleum engineering.
SM Energy Company
We are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs in onshore North America. Our
core assets and active development positions are located in the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas, the Bakken/Three Forks in North Dakota and the Permian Basin in west
Texas. We also have a delineation and exploration program in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.
Our strategic objective is to profitably build our ownership and operatorship of North American oil, natural gas, and NGL producing assets that have high operating margins
and significant opportunities for additional economic investment. We pursue growth opportunities through both exploration and acquisitions, and we seek to maximize the value
of our assets through industry leading technology application and outstanding operational execution. We focus on achieving high full-cycle economic returns on our investments
and maintaining a simple, strong balance sheet through a conservative approach to leverage.
As of year-end 2015, our proved reserves were 471.3 MMBoe. In the second quarter of 2016, production averaged 157,200 Boe per day. As of the end of the second
quarter of 2016, our leasehold acreage totaled approximately 390,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas, the Bakken/Three Forks in North Dakota and the
Permian Basin in west Texas, approximately 171,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and 477,000 net acres in other areas, of which 79,000 acres we recently announced
were subject to contracts for sale.
We were founded in 1908 and incorporated in Delaware in 1915. Our initial public offering of common stock was in December 1992. Our common stock trades on the New
York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "SM." Our principal offices are located at 1775 Sherman Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80203, and our telephone number
is (303) 861-8140. Our website address is www.sm-energy.com; information included or referred to on our website is not part of this prospectus supplement.

Pending Acquisition
Recent Developments
On August 8, 2016, we entered into a definitive membership interest purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Rock Oil Holdings LLC (the "Seller") to acquire
(the "Acquisition") 100% of the membership interests in JPM EOC Opal, LLC (the "Target"), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller, which
owns undeveloped leasehold interests, producing wells and associated infrastructure assets in the Midland Basin of west Texas. The Acquisition will complement and
significantly expand our existing core position in the basin. The purchase price for the membership interests in Target is $980 million (the "Purchase Price"), subject to certain
customary purchase price adjustments.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will acquire approximately 24,783 net acres in Howard County, Texas that are predominantly contiguous; an estimated 6 MMBoe
of proved developed producing reserves (based on internal estimates); and approximately 4,900 Boe per day of net production (as of July 2016) that is approximately 77% oil.
The to be acquired leasehold has current production from wells in the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry formations, with a recently completed well producing
approximately 1,600 Boe/d in the last 30 days. We have demonstrated superior operational execution in the Midland Basin and plan to utilize our extensive experience and
expertise, including applying reservoir modeling, pad drilling and leading edge completion technologies to optimize the performance of the wells we expect to drill on the
acquired assets.
We intend to fund the Acquisition with net proceeds from this offering, net proceeds from our Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering (as defined below), proceeds from
asset sales pursuant to definitive agreements currently in place, proceeds from asset sales contemplated as part of our continued portfolio management (including the
divestiture of our outside-operated position in the Eagle Ford shale), borrowings under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement")
by and among the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, and the institutions named therein as lenders, or borrowings under the Bridge
Facility (as defined below). There can be no assurances that any asset sales will be consummated.
The Acquisition is scheduled to close October 4, 2016 with an effective date of September 1, 2016, and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
There can be no assurance that the transaction will close on the expected closing date or at all. Following the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we are required to deposit
$49.0 million into an escrow account as a deposit to be applied against the Purchase Price at the closing of the Acquisition.
Neither the closing of this offering nor the closing of the Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering are conditioned upon, nor are they a condition to, the consummation of the
Acquisition. If the Acquisition is delayed, not consummated or consummated in a manner different than described herein, the price of our shares of common stock may decline.
In addition, if the Acquisition is not consummated, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, if you decide
to purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you should be willing to do so whether or not we complete the Acquisition.
Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering
Concurrently with this offering of our common stock, we are also making a public offering of $100.0 million principal amount of our        % Convertible Senior Notes due
2021 ("Convertible Notes") pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement (the "Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering"). In that offering, we have granted the underwriters a 30-
day option to purchase up to an additional $15.0 million principal amount of Convertible Notes. In connection with the pricing of the Concurrent
S-2
Table of Contents
Convertible Notes Offering, the Company expects to enter into capped call transactions with option counterparties. The capped call transactions are generally expected to
reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the
principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The closing of this offering of our common stock is not
conditioned upon the closing of the concurrent offering of our Convertible Notes, and the closing of the concurrent offering of Convertible Notes is not conditioned upon the
closing of this offering of our common stock.
Bridge Facility
On August 8, 2016, we entered into a commitment letter by which a lender committed to make available to us a second lien bridge facility in a principal amount of up to
$500 million ("Bridge Facility") until November 11, 2016, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the commitment letter. If we decide to use this facility, the proceeds
would be used to fund a portion of the Purchase Price of the Acquisition and the payment of fees and expenses of the Acquisition.

Adjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before interest expense, other non-operating income or expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization, and
accretion expense, exploration expense, impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, change in the Net Profits
Plan liability, and gains and losses on divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude
items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we present
because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for
exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Agreement based on certain adjusted EBITDAX ratios.
In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the
oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Our credit facility
provides a material source of liquidity for us. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, if we fail to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of
senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDAX and a minimum permitted ratio of adjusted EBITDAX to interest, we will be in default, an event that would prevent us from borrowing
under our credit facility and would therefore materially limit our sources of
S-7
Table of Contents
liquidity. In addition, if we default under our credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under that facility and under the indentures
governing our outstanding Senior Notes would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for a default.
Adjusted EBITDAX has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations,
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, profitability, or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that
affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Limitations
to using adjusted EBITDAX as an analytical tool include:
•
•
•
•
•
Adjusted EBITDAX does not reflect current or future requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments;
Adjusted EBITDAX does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;
Adjusted EBITDAX does not reflect income taxes;
Although depletion, depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depleted, depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the
future, and adjusted EBITDAX does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDAX differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparison measure.

Oil and Gas Reserves
SUMMARY RESERVE, PRODUCTION AND OPERATING DATA
The following table presents summary data with respect to our estimated net proved oil, gas, and NGL reserves as of the dates indicated. At least 80 percent of the PV-
10 of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., which is a firm of independent reserve engineers.
Our estimated proved reserves and related PV-10 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were determined in accordance with the reserve disclosure rules of the SEC using
the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the periods of January 2015 through December 2015, January 2014 through December 2014
and January 2013 through December 2013, respectively, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves (Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X) as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data,
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is
reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
PV-10 is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a
computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to
investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income
taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis
for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our
oil and natural gas assets. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV-10 measure and the
S-10
Table of Contents
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. Please see the definitions of
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and PV-10 in the "Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms."
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
Add: 10 percent annual discount, net of income taxes
Add: future undiscounted income taxes

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our securities involves a significant degree of risk. Before you invest in our securities you should carefully consider those risk factors included in our
2015 Form 10-K, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, which are incorporated herein by reference, and those risk
factors set forth below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, and the documents we incorporate by
reference, in evaluating an investment in our securities. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and financial
condition. Please read "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
Risks Related to the Acquisition
The pending Acquisition may not be completed as anticipated, or if completed, may not be beneficial to us.
The Acquisition is scheduled to close on October 4, 2016, and is subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions and the satisfaction or waiver of other
conditions, many of which are beyond our control. However, completion of the Acquisition is not a condition to completion of this offering of our common stock.
There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Acquisition. For example, the Acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the time frame,
on the terms, or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to
closing. There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that the Acquisition will be consummated. In addition, the Purchase Agreement contains certain
termination rights for each of SM and the Seller, including SM's right to terminate the Purchase Agreement if: (a) Seller's representations and warranties in the Purchase
Agreement fail to be true and correct as of the closing date, except for such inaccuracies that would not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect, (b) Seller fails to
perform or comply, in all material respects, with all obligations, agreements and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement as to which such performance or compliance
is required by Seller prior to the closing date, (c) a third-party institutes a material legal proceeding seeking to restrain, prohibit, enjoin or declare illegal the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, (d) a governmental authority or arbitrator issues an order, award or judgment to restrain, prohibit, enjoin or declare illegal the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, (e) the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of all reductions to the Purchase Price for title defects prior to the closing, less
(ii) the aggregate amount of all title benefit amounts prior to closing, plus (iii) the aggregate amount of all reductions to the Purchase Price for environmental defects prior to the
closing, exceeds 15% of the unadjusted Purchase Price, or (f) Seller shall have failed to deliver, or be ready, willing and able to deliver, the necessary closing documents.
If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the transaction will not be consummated. There is no assurance that the Acquisition will close on or before that time, or at
all, and the closing of this offering is not conditioned on the closing of the Acquisition. Accordingly, if you decide to purchase our common stock, you should be willing to do so
whether or not we complete the Acquisition. The consummation of the Acquisition involves potential risks, including:
the failure to realize recoverable reserves;
regulatory compliance and permitting;
•
•
•
title issues or other unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities and costs;
S-14
Table of Contents
the incurrence of liabilities or other compliance costs related to environmental or regulatory matters, including potential liabilities that may be imposed without
regard to fault or the legality of conduct;
the diversion of management's attention from our existing properties;
a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage resulting from any additional debt incurred to finance the Acquisition, which could offset the
expected accretion from the Acquisition; and
•
•
•
•
the incurrence of significant charges, such as asset devaluation or restructuring charges.
If we consummate the Acquisition and if these risks or other unanticipated liabilities were to materialize, any desired benefits of the Acquisition may not be fully realized,
if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We cannot assure you that we will realize value from the Acquisition that
equals or exceeds the consideration paid.
If completed, the Acquisition may not achieve its intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities. To date, we have conducted only
limited diligence regarding the assets and liabilities we would assume in the Acquisition. These risks are heightened because the Acquisition, if consummated,
would involve our acquisition of a material amount of acreage relative to our current acreage position and a material purchase price relative to our prior strategic
activities.
We entered into the Purchase Agreement with the expectation that the Acquisition would result in various benefits, growth opportunities and synergies. Achieving the
anticipated benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, under the Purchase Agreement, we have the opportunity to conduct
customary environmental and title due diligence following the execution of the Purchase Agreement, but our diligence efforts to date have been limited. As a result, we may
discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions of which we are currently unaware. Environmental, title and other problems could reduce the value of the
properties to us, and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the Seller with respect to those problems. We would assume all of the Target's
liabilities and would be entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in only limited circumstances and in limited amounts. We cannot assure that such potential
remedies will be adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant.
The risks involved in the Acquisition are heightened due to the size of the acquisition. The Acquisition, if consummated, would involve our acquisition of approximately
24,783 net acres in Howard County, Texas, which is a material amount of acreage relative to our current acreage position in the Permian Basin and a material purchase price
relative to our prior strategic activities.
The anticipated future growth of our business will impose significant added responsibilities on management. The anticipated growth may place strain on our administrative
and operational infrastructure. Our senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of Seller's business operations
and the assets acquired in the Acquisition. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to apply our operational, financial and management controls, reporting
systems and procedures to the acquired business. We may also encounter risks, costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated liabilities, and
use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we anticipate. We may not be able to successfully integrate the Target's
operations into our existing operations, successfully manage this additional acreage or realize the expected economic benefits of the Acquisition, which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
S-15
Table of Contents
Actual reserves and production associated with the properties to be acquired in the Acquisition may be substantially less than we expect.
As with other acquisitions, the success of the Acquisition depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our assessment of the number and quality of the drilling
locations associated with the properties to be acquired, future oil and natural gas prices, reserves and production, and future operating costs and various other factors. These
assessments are necessarily inexact. Our assessment of certain of these factors is based in part on information provided to us by the sellers, including historical production
data. Our independent reserve engineers have neither provided a report regarding the estimates of reserves nor an audit of the reserves with respect to the properties subject to
the Acquisition. The assumptions on which our internal estimates have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in our not realizing the
expected benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the representations, warranties and indemnities of the Seller contained in the Purchase Agreement are limited, and we may not
have recourse against the Seller in the event that the acreage is less valuable than we currently believe. As a result, we may not recover the Purchase Price for the Acquisition
from the sale of production from the properties being acquired or recognize an acceptable return from such sales.
The development of the properties to be acquired will be subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with oil and natural gas activities as described in the "Risk
Factors" section of our 2015 Form 10-K.
A significant portion of the value of the Acquisition is associated with undeveloped acreage that may not be economic.
A large portion of the acreage we are acquiring in the Acquisition is undeveloped, and our plans, development schedule and production schedule associated with the
acreage may fail to materialize. As a result, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated
properties.
We will incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Acquisition, and completion of the acquisition will increase our indebtedness.
We expect to incur a number of significant transaction-related costs and expenses associated with the Acquisition. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs,
and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the properties to be acquired, which may be significant.
We intend to finance a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition and any transaction-related costs and expenses with the proceeds from this offering, and we expect
that the remaining portion of the purchase price and related fees and expenses will be funded with net proceeds from our Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering, proceeds from
asset sales pursuant to definitive agreements currently in place, asset sales contemplated as part of our continued portfolio management (including the divestiture of our
outside operated position in the Eagle Ford shale), borrowings under our Credit Agreement or borrowings under the Bridge Facility. This increase in our indebtedness may
reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to successfully consummate any divestitures, whether pending or contemplated.
The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Acquisition.
The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Acquisition if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if
the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of Seller's business are not realized, or if the aggregate transaction costs related to the Acquisition are
greater than expected. The market price also may
S-16
Table of Contents
decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the Acquisition on
our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors.
From January 1, 2016, to August 5, 2016, the low and high intraday trading prices per share of our common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange ranged
from a low of $6.99 per share in February 2016 to a high of $35.60 per share in June 2016. We expect our stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety
of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
changes in crude oil, natural gas, or NGL prices;
variations in drilling, recompletion, and operating activity;
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;
changes in market valuations of comparable companies;
additions or departures of key personnel;
future sales of our common stock; and
changes in the national and global economic outlook.
We may not meet the expectations of our stockholders and/or of securities analysts at some time in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result.
Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from receiving a takeover
premium on their investment, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or
our management. These provisions, among other things, provide for non-cumulative voting in the election of members of the Board of Directors and impose procedural
requirements on stockholders who wish to make nominations for the election of directors or propose other actions at stockholder meetings. These provisions, alone or in
combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a
premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if
doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
The potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have a materially adverse effect on our stock price. As of June 30, 2016,
68,183,128 shares of our common stock were freely tradable without substantial restriction or the requirement of future registration under the Securities Act. In addition,
restricted stock units ("RSUs") providing for the issuance of up to a total of 503,480 shares of our common stock and 710,030 performance share units ("PSUs") were
outstanding. The PSUs represent the right to receive, upon settlement of the PSUs after the completion of a three-year performance period, a number of shares of our common
stock that may be
S-17
Table of Contents
from zero to two times the number of PSUs granted, depending on the extent to which the underlying performance criteria have been achieved and the extent to which the
PSUs have vested. As of June 30, 2016, there were 68,274,551 shares of our common stock outstanding.
We may not always pay dividends on our common stock.
Payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will continue to depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and
other factors. In addition, the payment of dividends is subject to a covenant in our credit facility limiting our annual cash dividends to no more than $50.0 million, and to
covenants in the indentures for our Senior Notes that limit our ability to pay dividends beyond a certain amount. Our Board of Directors may determine in the future to reduce
the current semi-annual dividend rate of $0.05 per share, or discontinue the payment of dividends altogether.
We believe that we currently are, and we expect to continue to be for the foreseeable future, a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
Generally, a corporation is a United States real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests,
as defined in the Code and applicable Treasury regulations, equals or exceeds 50% of the aggregate fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We believe that we currently are, and we expect to continue to be for the foreseeable future, a "United States real property
holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, as long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, only a Non-U.S.
Holder that actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding
period for the common stock, more than 5% of the total fair market value of our common stock will be taxable on gain realized on the disposition of our common stock as a
result of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation. If our common stock were not considered to be so regularly traded during the calendar year in which the relevant
disposition by a Non-U.S. Holder occurs, such holder (regardless of the percentage of our common stock owned) would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a taxable
disposition of our common stock, and a 15% withholding tax would apply to the gross proceeds from such disposition. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and
we believe that, for as long as we continue to be so listed, our common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market. See "Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders—Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock."

USE OF PROCEEDS
We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and our estimated offering expenses, will be
approximately $            (or $            if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full).
If the Acquisition is consummated, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to partially fund the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated, we intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, reducing indebtedness, acquiring properties, and funding a
portion of our exploration and production activities and working capital. There can be no assurances that the Acquisition will be consummated or that the expected benefits of
such transaction will be realized. The closing of this offering is not conditioned on, nor is it a condition to, the consummation of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is delayed,
not consummated or consummated in a manner different than described herein, the price of our shares of common stock may decline. In addition, if the Acquisition is not
consummated, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, if you decide to purchase shares of our common
stock in this offering, you should be willing to do so whether or not we complete the Acquisition. See "Summary—Recent developments" for more information regarding the
Acquisition.

equity. The debt component accretes up to the principal amount over the expected term of the debt. ASC 470-20 (additional paid-in capital) does not affect the actual
amount that we are required to repay.

On August 5, 2016, the last reported trading price of our common stock on the NYSE was $29.30 per share. As of July 29, 2016, there were approximately 68 holders of
record of our common stock.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We have paid cash dividends to our stockholders every year since 1940. We paid annual dividends of $0.05 per share in each of the years 1998 through 2004. We paid
annual dividends of $0.10 per share in each of the years 2005 through 2015. We expect our practice of paying dividends on our common stock to continue, although the
payment and amount of future dividends will continue to depend on our earnings, cash flow, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors, including the discretion
of our Board of Directors.
In addition, the payment of dividends is subject to covenants in our credit facility that limit our annual dividend payment to no more than $50.0 million per year. We are
also subject to certain covenants under our Senior Notes that restrict certain payments, including dividends; however, the first $6.5 million of dividends paid each year are not
restricted by this covenant. Based on our current performance, we do not anticipate that these covenants will restrict future annual dividend payments in amounts not to exceed
$0.10 per share of common stock. Dividends are currently paid on a semi-annual basis. Dividends paid totaled $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and
$6.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS
The following discussion is a summary of the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the purchase, ownership and disposition
of our common stock by Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). This summary deals only with our common stock held as capital assets by holders who purchase common stock
in this offering. For purposes of this summary, a "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual,
corporation, estate or trust and is not any one of the following:
a citizen or an individual resident of the United States;
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
•
•
•
a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
This discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to the purchase, ownership or disposition of our common stock by
prospective investors in light of their particular circumstances. In particular, this discussion does not address all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types
of investors subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
dealers in securities or currencies;
financial institutions;
regulated investment companies;
real estate investment trusts;
tax-exempt or governmental entities;
qualified foreign pension funds;
insurance companies;
persons holding common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, synthetic, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle;
persons that acquire our common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;
persons liable for alternative minimum tax;
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding common stock;
investors whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar;
controlled foreign corporations;
S-23
Table of Contents
•
•
private foreign investment companies; or
common trust funds.
Furthermore, this summary is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. Such authorities may be repealed, revoked, modified or subject to differing
interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. This discussion does not
address any state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations or tax considerations as to U.S. federal non-income taxes (such as the U.S. estate and gift tax or the U.S. Medicare tax
on certain investment income) or any tax treaties. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with respect to the statements made or the
conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such statements or conclusions.
If a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner of a
partnership holding our common stock, we particularly urge you to consult your tax advisors.
If you are considering the purchase of our common stock, we urge you to consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock, as well as any consequences to you arising under state, local and non-U.S.
tax laws, under U.S. non-income tax laws and under any applicable tax treaty.
Dividends
Distributions paid to you on our common stock, other than certain pro rata distributions of common stock, will be included in ordinary dividend income when received (to
the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and generally will be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty as to which you appropriately claim the benefit. However, dividends that are
effectively connected with a trade or business you conduct within the United States, and, if certain tax treaties apply and you appropriately claim benefits thereunder, are
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States, are not subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax, but instead are subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net income basis at the applicable graduated individual or corporate rates. Special certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied for effectively
connected income to be exempt from withholding. If you are a corporation, any such effectively connected dividends that you receive may be subject to an additional branch
profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty as to which you appropriately claim the benefit. To the extent distributions
exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in our common stock
and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. See "—Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock."
If you wish to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate for dividends paid on our common stock, you must provide the withholding agent with a properly executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form), claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the applicable income tax treaty.
S-24
Table of Contents
If you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld
by timely providing the required information to the IRS.
Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock
Subject to the discussion below under "—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act," you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain
recognized on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock unless:
the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and, if certain tax treaties apply and you appropriately claim
benefits thereunder, is attributable to a permanent establishment you maintain in the United States;
if you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition, and
certain other requirements are met; or
•
•
•
we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period
ending on the date of such disposition and your holding period in the common stock, and (i) you beneficially own, or have owned, more than 5% of the total fair
market value of our common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding such disposition, or (ii) our common stock has ceased to be regularly traded
on an established securities market prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs.
If you are an individual and are described in the first bullet above, you will be subject to tax on any gain derived from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition at the
graduated U.S. federal income tax rates generally applicable to U.S. citizens or residents. If you are an individual and are described in the second bullet above, you will
generally be subject to a flat 30% tax on any gain derived from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition that may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though
you are not considered a resident of the United States). If you are a corporation and are described in the first bullet above, you will be subject to tax on your gain at the U.S.
federal income tax rates generally applicable to U.S. corporations and, in addition, may be subject to the branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and profits
for the taxable year, which would include such gain, at a rate of 30% or at such lower rate as may be specified by the applicable income tax treaty, subject to adjustments.
Generally, a corporation is a United States real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests,
as defined in the Code and applicable Treasury regulations, equals or exceeds 50% of the aggregate fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We believe that we currently are, and we expect to continue to be for the foreseeable future, a "United States real property
holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and we believe that, for as long as we continue to be so listed,
our common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market. If we are a United States real property holding corporation, and if our common stock
continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a Non-U.S. Holder that actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time during the shorter of the
five-year period ending on the date of the disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period for the common stock, more than 5% of the total fair market value of our common
stock will be taxable on gain realized on the disposition of our common stock as a result of our status as a United States real property holding corporation. If, during the
calendar year in which the relevant disposition by a Non-U.S. Holder occurs, we are a United States real property holding corporation and if our common stock ceases to be
regularly traded, you generally would be
S-25
Table of Contents
subject to U.S. federal income tax on a taxable disposition of our common stock (regardless of the amount of our common stock owned), and transferees of our common stock
generally would be required to withhold 15% of the gross proceeds payable to you. The gain from the disposition would be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if you were a
United States holder, and you would be required to file a U.S. tax return with respect to such gain.
You should consult your tax advisors with respect to the application of the foregoing rules to your ownership and disposition of our common stock.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Withholding at a rate of 30% will be required on dividends in respect of, and, after December 31, 2018, withholding at a rate of 30% will be required on gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution enters into
an agreement with the U.S. Treasury Department to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are
owned by certain U.S. persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments. An intergovernmental
agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or future Treasury regulations, may modify these requirements. Accordingly, the entity through which
our common stock is held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in respect of, and, after December 31, 2018, gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions will be subject
to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies that such entity does not have any "substantial United States owners" or (ii) provides certain information
regarding the entity's "substantial United States owners." Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on their
investment in our common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
You may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding with respect to any dividends on, and the proceeds from dispositions of, our common stock paid to
you, unless you comply with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing the appropriate form from the IRS Form W-8 series) or otherwise establish an
exemption. Additional rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the disposition of shares of our
common stock will apply as follows:
If the proceeds are paid to or through the U.S. office of a broker (U.S. or foreign), they generally will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting,
unless you certify that you are not a U.S. person under penalties of perjury (usually on the appropriate form from the IRS Form W-8 series) or otherwise establish
an exemption;
If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and is not a foreign person with certain specified U.S. connections,
they will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting; and
•
•
•
If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or a foreign person with certain specified U.S. connections, they generally
will be subject to information reporting (but not backup withholding), unless you certify that you are not a U.S. person under penalties of perjury (usually on the
appropriate form from the IRS Form W-8 series) or otherwise establish an exemption.
In addition, the amount of any dividends paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to you and the IRS.
The IRS may make such
Table of Contents
S-26
information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules are treated as a credit against your actual U.S. federal income tax liability and any amounts withheld in excess of your actual U.S. federal income tax liability
will be allowed as a refund provided the required information is timely furnished by you to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the filing of a
U.S. tax return for claiming a refund of such backup withholding.
The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of our common stock by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of
the Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, "Similar
Laws"), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include "plan assets" of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a "Plan").

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries or other interested parties of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an
"ERISA Plan") and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person
who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.
In considering an investment in our common stock of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary's duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.
Prohibited Transaction Issues
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are
"parties in interest," within the meaning of ERISA, or "disqualified persons," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in
interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition and/or holding of our common stock by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the underwriters are considered a party in interest or a disqualified
person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and
is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited
transaction class exemptions, or "PTCEs," that may apply to the acquisition and holding of our common stock. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14
respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38
respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting
S-27
Table of Contents
transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or
indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and
provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any
such exemptions will be satisfied.
Because of the foregoing, our common stock should not be purchased or held by any person investing "plan assets" of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will
not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.
Representation
Accordingly, by acceptance of our common stock, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of our common stock will be deemed to have represented and warranted
that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold our common stock constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding
of our common stock by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.
The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and
the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering
purchasing our common stock on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code
and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of our common stock. Further, this prospectus contains
no recommendation as to the suitability of our common stock as an investment in any Plan under ERISA and any Similar Laws.

The representatives of the underwriters have advised us that the underwriters propose to offer the shares of our common stock directly to the public at the public offering
price on the cover of this prospectus supplement and to selected dealers, which may include the underwriters, at such offering price less a selling concession not in excess of
$            per share. After the offering, the representatives may change the offering price and other selling terms. Sales of shares of our common stock made outside of the

of our common stock by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters' right to reject any order in whole or in part.

Option to Purchase Additional Shares
We have granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days after the date of the underwriting agreement, to purchase, from time to time, in whole or in part, up to
an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. To the extent that this option is exercised,
each underwriter will be obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase its pro rata portion of these additional shares of our common stock from us based on the
underwriter's percentage underwriting commitment in the offering as indicated in the table at the beginning of this Underwriting section.
Lock-Up Agreements
We have agreed that we will not (i) offer, sell, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or establish an open "put equivalent position within the meaning of
Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to, any shares
of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of our common stock, or publicly disclose the intention to make any offer,
sale, pledge, disposition, or filing or (ii) enter any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequence of ownership of
shares of our common stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) is to be settled by delivery of shares of our common stock or such other
securities, in cash or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the representatives for a period of 60 days after the date of this prospectus supplement, except that (1) we
may issue and sell shares of our common stock upon the conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding on the date of this prospectus
supplement, (2) we may issue and sell shares of our common stock upon the exercise of options or warrants outstanding on the date of this prospectus supplement or as a
result of permitted grants or issuances as described in the following clause (3), and (3) we may grant or issue stock options and warrants, restricted stock, phantom stock, and
other securities to our employees, officers, and directors pursuant to the terms of a plan in effect on the date of this prospectus supplement.
Our directors and certain of our executive officers have agreed that they will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of our common stock, enter into a transaction that would have the
same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge, or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of our common stock,
whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of our common stock or other securities, in cash, or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any
offer, sale, pledge, or disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge, or other arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC for a period of 60 days after the date of this prospectus supplement, except (i) that such executive officers and directors may sell shares acquired by such
executive officers and directors in the open market after the date of this prospectus supplement, provided that no filing under the Exchange Act, shall be required or shall be
voluntarily made in connection with any such sale, pledge or disposition (other than a filing on a Form 5, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G (or 13D/A or 13G/A) made after the
expiration of the 60-day restricted period) and (ii) such executive officers and directors may sell, pledge or dispose of any shares of our common stock to a family member,
family partnership (including a limited partnership), other family investment entity or trust, provided that in connection with any such sale, pledge or disposition (A) the recipient
agrees

to be bound in writing by the terms of such agreement prior to such sale, pledge or disposition and (B) the transfer is not a sale, pledge or disposition of value.
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, in its sole discretion, may release the shares of our common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above
in whole or in part at any time with or without notice. When determining whether or not to release our common stock and other securities from lock-up agreements, Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC will consider, among other factors, the holder's reasons for requesting the release, the number of shares of our common stock and other securities for which the
release is being requested and market conditions at the time.
Indemnification
We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the underwriters
may be required to make for these liabilities.
Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids
The representatives may engage in stabilizing transactions, short sales and purchases to cover positions created by short sales, and penalty bids or purchases for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the shares of our common stock, in accordance with Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act:
•
•
Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
A short position involves a sale by the underwriters of shares of common stock in excess of the number of shares of common stock the underwriters are
obligated to purchase in the offering, which creates the syndicate short position. This short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short
position. In a covered short position, the number of shares of common stock involved in the sales made by the underwriters in excess of the number of shares of
common stock they are obligated to purchase is not greater than the number of shares of common stock that they may purchase by exercising their option to
purchase additional shares of common stock. In a naked short position, the number of shares of common stock involved is greater than the number of shares of
common stock in their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The underwriters may close out any short position by either exercising their option
to purchase additional shares of common stock and/or purchasing shares of common stock in the open market. In determining the source of shares of common
stock to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares of common stock available for purchase in the open
market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares of common stock through their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. A
naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares of common
stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of shares of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
syndicate short positions.
•
•
Penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the shares of common stock originally sold by the
syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.
In addition, in these stabilizing transactions the underwriters may purchase our common stock prior to the pricing of this offering. These stabilizing transactions, syndicate
covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or
S-31
Table of Contents
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the shares of our common stock. As a result, the price of our shares of common stock sold in the offering may be higher
than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on the NYSE or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any
time.
Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may
have on the price of the shares of our common stock. In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation that the representatives will engage in these
stabilizing transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.
Electronic Distribution
This prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the Internet sites or through other online services
maintained by one or more of the underwriters and/or selling group members participating in this offering, or by their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view
offering terms online and, depending upon the particular underwriter or selling group member, prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may
agree with us to allocate a specific number of shares of our common stock for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be
made by the representatives on the same basis as other allocations.
Other than the prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter's or selling group member's web
site and any information contained in any other web site maintained by an underwriter or selling group member is not part of this prospectus supplement, the accompanying
base prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus form a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed
by us or any underwriter or selling group member in its capacity as underwriter or selling group member and should not be relied upon by investors.
Stamp Taxes
If you purchase shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, you may be required to pay stamp taxes
and other charges under the laws and practices of the country of purchase, in addition to the offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying base prospectus.
Relationships
The underwriters and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and
investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The underwriters and
certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the
issuer and its affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. An affiliate of each of the underwriters is a lender under our credit
facility. In addition, the underwriters in this offering are also serving as underwriters in our Concurrent Convertible Notes Offering.
In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and certain of their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and
such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer or its affiliates. If the underwriters or their affiliates have a
S-32
Table of Contents
lending relationship with us, certain of the underwriters or their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates, including potentially the shares of our common stock offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps
or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the shares of our common stock offered hereby. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates may also
communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

from the respective definitions under Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. The entire definitions of those terms under Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X can be
located through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Bbl.    One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
Bcf.    Billion cubic feet, used in reference to natural gas.
BOE.    Barrels of oil equivalent. Oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil or NGLs.
BTU.    One British thermal unit, the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a one-pound mass of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
Field.    An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic
condition.
MBOE.    One thousand barrels of oil equivalent.
Mcf.    One thousand cubic feet, used in reference to natural gas.
MMBbl.    One million barrels of oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
S-37
Table of Contents
NGLs.    The combination of ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasolines that when removed from natural gas become liquid under various levels of higher pressure
and lower temperature.
Proved reserves.    Those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at
which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods
are used for the estimation. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined, and the price to be
used is the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-
day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
PV-10.    The present value of estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of estimated net proved reserves, net of estimated production and
future development costs, based on prices used in estimating the proved reserves and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such costs are subject to change
pursuant to contractual provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax
expenses, or depreciation, depletion, and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of ten percent. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes
as it would in the use of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the
Company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period.
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.    The discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves based on prices used in estimating the
reserves, year-end costs, and statutory tax rates, and a ten percent annual discount rate. The information for this calculation is included in the note regarding disclosures about
oil and gas producing activities contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our securities involves a significant degree of risk. Before you invest in our securities you should carefully consider those risk factors included in our
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any subsequently filed Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are
incorporated herein by reference, and those risk factors that may be included in any applicable prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information included in this
prospectus, any prospectus supplement and the documents we incorporate by reference, in evaluating an investment in our securities. If any of these risks were actually to
occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe
are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and financial condition. Please read the information under the caption "Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements."
Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the periods indicated is as follows:

The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed by dividing earnings available for fixed charges (earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus
fixed charges and amortization of capitalized interest, less capitalized interest) by fixed charges (interest expense, plus capitalized interest plus our estimate of the
interest component of rental expense).
Earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges for the six months ended June 30, 2016 by a deficiency of $810.8 million.
Earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 by a deficiency of $738.8 million.
Earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2012 by a deficiency of $86.6 million.

USE OF PROCEEDS
Unless otherwise indicated in an accompanying prospectus supplement, we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by this prospectus for
general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things:
•
•
•
•
the repayment of outstanding indebtedness;
working capital;
capital expenditures; and
acquisitions.
The precise amount and timing of the application of such proceeds will depend upon our funding requirements and the availability and cost of other funds.
General
DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of July 27, 2016, there were 68,466,823 shares of common
stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Common Stock
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held in the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not
have cumulative voting rights. Holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for
election.
Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor. Upon
the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the net assets of the Company available after payment of
all debts and other liabilities. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The outstanding shares of common stock are, and
the shares offered by the Company in this offering will be, when issued and paid for, fully paid and non-assessable.
Delaware corporate law and the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of
control of the Company or its management. These provisions, among other things, provide for non-cumulative voting in the election of members of the Board of Directors and
impose procedural requirements on stockholders who wish to make nominations for the election of directors or propose other actions at stockholder meetings.
The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval,
subject to various limitations imposed by the NYSE. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise
additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock could make it more difficult or
discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.
In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), which applies to the Company as a corporation organized in the State of Delaware, imposes restrictions
on business combinations with interested parties. Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law, prevents Delaware corporations
5
Table of Contents
under certain circumstances from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" (generally, a holder of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of
the corporation). A "business combination" includes a merger or sale of 10% or more of a company's assets. However, the provisions of Section 203 do not apply if (1) the
board of directors approves the transaction; (2) after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder," that stockholder
owned at least 85% of the company's voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by officers and directors and certain employee
benefit plans; or (3) on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders
by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the "interested stockholder." These provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company, even if the change in control might be beneficial to
Company stockholders.
Our certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (1) for any breach of a director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derives
an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of directors' liability, then the liability of our
directors will automatically be limited to the fullest extent provided by law. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions to indemnify our directors and
officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions and agreements may have the practical effect in certain cases of eliminating
the ability of stockholders to collect monetary damages from our directors and officers. We believe that these the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws are
necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers.
Transfer agent and registrar
The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company N.A.
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
The following description of the debt securities sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the debt securities to which this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement may relate. The particular terms of any series of debt securities and the extent to which the general provisions may apply to a particular series of debt securities
will be described in a prospectus supplement relating to that series. References in this section to "SM Energy" mean SM Energy Company and not its subsidiaries.
Any debt securities offered by this prospectus will be issued under an indenture between SM Energy and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "indenture"),
which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We have summarized selected provisions of the indenture
below. You should read the indenture for provisions that may be important to you.
Because we have included only a summary of the indenture terms, you must read the indenture in full to understand every detail of the terms of the debt securities.
The indenture will not limit the amount of debt securities we may issue under it, and will provide that additional debt securities of any series may be issued up to the
aggregate principal amount that we authorize from time to time.
6
Table of Contents
Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will issue the debt securities in denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof.
Principal and any premium and interest in respect of the debt securities will be payable, and the debt securities will be transferable, at the corporate trust office of the
trustee, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. At our option, however, we may pay interest by mailing checks to the registered holders of the
debt securities at their registered addresses.
We will describe any special U.S. federal income tax and other considerations relating to the debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.
General
The indenture provides that SM Energy may issue separate series of debt securities under the indenture from time to time without limitation as to aggregate principal
amount. We may specify a maximum aggregate principal amount for the debt securities of any series. We will determine the terms and conditions of the debt securities,
including the maturity, principal and interest, but those terms must be consistent with the indenture. The debt securities will be unsecured obligations of SM Energy.
The prospectus supplement relating to the particular series of debt securities being offered will specify the amounts, prices and terms of those debt securities. These
terms may include:
the title of the debt securities;
the designation, aggregate principal amount and authorized denominations of the debt securities;
the date or dates on which the debt securities will mature;
the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities will be issued;
the date on which the principal and premium, if any, of the debt securities will be payable;
whether any subsidiary guarantor will guarantee the debt securities;
the annual rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, or the method of determining the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear any interest;
the date or dates from which any interest will accrue and the date or dates on which such interest will be payable;
the specified currency of the debt securities;

terms and provisions of such a redemption, exchange or conversion;
any sinking fund terms;
any events of default or covenants of SM Energy with respect to the debt securities of a certain series that are different from those described in this prospectus;
whether and under what circumstances any covenants in the indenture will be subject to either or both covenant defeasance and legal defeasance with respect to
the debt securities;
any deletions from, or modifications or additions to, the provisions of the indenture relating to satisfaction and discharge in respect of the debt securities;

if applicable, that the debt securities will be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities and, in such case, the name of the respective
depositaries for such global securities, the form of any legend or legends which will be borne by any such global security in addition to or in lieu of those set forth
in the indenture and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in the indenture in which any such global security may be exchanged in whole or
in part for debt securities registered, and any transfer of such global security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of persons other than
the depositary for such global security or a nominee thereof; and
•
•
any other specific terms of the debt securities.
We are not obligated to issue all debt securities of any one series at the same time. The debt securities of any one series may not bear interest at the same rate or
mature on the same date.
If we sell any of the debt securities for foreign currencies or foreign currency units or if the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any series of debt securities is
payable in foreign currencies or foreign currency units, we will describe the restrictions, elections, tax consequences, specific terms and other information with respect to those
debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, SM Energy's obligation to pay the principal of, and any premium and interest on, its senior debt
securities will be unsecured and will rank equally with all of SM Energy's other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness.
Interest Rates and Discounts
The debt securities will earn interest at a fixed or floating rate or rates for the period or periods of time specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless
otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will bear interest on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
We may sell debt securities at a substantial discount below their stated principal amount, bearing no interest or interest at a rate that at the time of issuance is below
market rates. We will describe the federal income tax consequences and special considerations that apply to those debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.
Exchange, Registration and Transfer
Unless otherwise specified, debt securities of any series will be exchangeable for other debt securities of the same series and of like aggregate principal amount and tenor
in different authorized denominations.
You may present debt securities for registration of transfer, together with a duly executed form of transfer, at the office of the transfer agent designated by us for that
purpose with respect to any series of debt securities and referred to in the applicable prospectus supplement. This may be done without service charge but upon payment of
any taxes and other governmental charges as described in the indenture. The security registrar or the transfer agent will effect the transfer or exchange upon being satisfied
with the documents of title and identity of the person making the request. We may at any time designate additional transfer agents with respect to any series of debt securities.
In the event of any redemption, we will not be required to:
•
execute, register the transfer of or exchange debt securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of
debt securities of that series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing of the relevant notice of redemption; or
8
Table of Contents
•
execute, register the transfer of or exchange any debt security, or portion thereof, called for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any debt security being
redeemed in part.
Payment and Paying Agents
Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will pay the principal of, and any premium and interest on, the debt securities at the office of the
paying agent or paying agents that we designate at various times. At our option, we may, however, make interest payments by check mailed to the address, as it appears in
the security register, of the person entitled to the payments. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the Corporate Trust Office of the trustee in
Denver, Colorado, will be designated as our sole paying agent for payments with respect to debt securities that are issuable solely as registered securities.
All monies we pay to a paying agent for the payment of principal of, and any premium and interest on, any debt security that remains unclaimed at the end of two years
after becoming due and payable will be repaid to us. After that time, the holder of the debt security will look only to us for payments out of those repaid amounts.
Global Securities
Some or all of the debt securities of any series may be represented, in whole or in part, by one or more global securities that will have an aggregate principal amount equal
to that of the debt securities they represent. Each global security will be registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable prospectus
supplement, will be deposited with such depositary or nominee or its custodian and will bear a legend regarding the restrictions on exchanges and registration of transfer thereof
referred to below and any such other matters as may be provided for pursuant to the indenture.
Events of Default
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, any one of the following events will constitute an "event of default" under the indenture with respect
to the debt securities of any series issued under the indenture:
any failure by us to pay any interest on any debt security of that series when due that continues for 30 days;
any failure by us to pay principal of, or any premium on, the debt securities of that series when due and payable, either at maturity or otherwise;
any failure by us to perform, or breach by us of, any of our other covenants or warranties in the indenture, and that breach or failure continues for 60 days (subject
to extension under certain circumstances for another 120 days) after written notice as provided in the indenture;
the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving us or certain of our subsidiaries; and
•
•
•
•
•
the occurrence of any other event of default provided with respect to the debt securities of that series.
If we fail to pay the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the debt securities of any series or we fail to perform or breach any of the other covenants or warranties
applicable to the debt securities of that series, and such event of default is continuing, the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt
securities of that series (or with respect to covenant and warranty defaults, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt
securities of that series) may declare the principal amount of, and any premium and
9
Table of Contents
interest on, the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. If an event of default occurs involving certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, and the event of default is continuing, then the principal amount of all of the debt securities of such series then outstanding under the indenture will become due
and payable immediately, without notice or other action by any holder or the trustee, to the full extent permitted by law. At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been
made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of money has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt
securities of any series may rescind and annul any declaration of acceleration with respect to such series of debt securities if we deposit with the trustee an amount sufficient
to pay all overdue interest on the debt securities of that series, the principal of and premium, if any, on the debt securities of that series that have become due and payable
otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and all amounts due to the trustee and if all other events of default with respect to the debt securities of that series have
been cured or waived.
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any event of default under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series issued under the indenture, the trustee
must transmit notice of the event of default to the holders of the debt securities of that series unless the event of default has been cured or waived. The trustee may withhold
the notice, however, except in the case of a payment default, if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or responsible
officers of the trustee has in good faith determined that the withholding of the notice is in the interest of the holders of debt securities of that series.
If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the debt securities of any series, the trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights
and the rights of the holders of debt securities of that series by all appropriate judicial proceedings.
Subject to the duty of the trustee during any default to act with the required standard of care, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of debt securities issued under the indenture, unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity.
Subject to indemnifying the trustee, and subject to applicable law and certain other provisions of the indenture, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of a series issued under the indenture may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, with respect to the debt securities of that series.
Defeasance
Unless the applicable prospectus supplement provides otherwise, any debt securities, or portion of the principal amount of the debt securities, will be deemed to have
been paid for purposes of the indenture, and, at our election, our entire indebtedness with respect to the debt securities, or portion thereof, will be deemed to have been
satisfied and discharged, if we have irrevocably deposited with the trustee or any paying agent other than us, in trust, money, certain eligible obligations, as defined in the
indenture, or a combination of the two, sufficient to pay principal of and any premium and interest due and to become due on the debt securities or portions thereof, and have
met certain other conditions set forth in the indenture.
In addition, unless the applicable prospectus supplement provides otherwise, we shall be released from our obligations under certain covenants set forth in the indenture
(or certain additional covenants applicable to a particular series of debt securities) if we have irrevocably deposited with the trustee or any paying agent other than us, in trust,
money, certain eligible obligations, as defined in the indenture, or a combination of the two, sufficient to pay principal of and any premium and interest due and to become due
on the debt securities or portions thereof, and have met certain other conditions set forth in the indenture.

Modification and Waiver
The trustee and SM Energy may, without the consent of holders, modify or waive provisions of the indenture for certain purposes, including, among other things, curing
ambiguities and maintaining the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The trustee and SM Energy may modify or waive certain
provisions of the indenture with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each series issued under the
indenture affected by the modification or waiver. The provisions of the indenture may not, however, be waived or modified without the consent of each holder of each debt
security of the series affected thereby if the modification or waiver would:
•
•
•
•
•
•
change the stated maturity of the principal of, or a scheduled date for the payment of any interest on, any such debt security;
reduce the principal amount of, or interest on, or any premium payable upon the redemption of, any such debt security;
change the specified currency in which the principal of any such debt security or any premium or any interest on that debt security is payable;
impair or affect the right of any holder of such debt security to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, or interest on or with
respect to any such security on or after the stated maturity of such debt security;
with respect to any such series of debt securities the terms of which provide for the making and consummation of an offer to repurchase such debt securities in
connection with a change of control (as defined in such terms), amend, change or modify our obligation to make and consummate such offer to repurchase after
the related change of control has occurred, including amending, changing or modifying any definition relating thereto;
reduce the percentage and principal amount of such outstanding debt securities, the consent of the holders of which is required for any such supplemental
indenture, or the consent of which is required for any waiver of certain defaults under the indenture and their consequences provided for in the indenture, or reduce
the requirements of such debts securities for quorum or voting under the indenture; or
•
modify any of the provisions of the indenture relating to modifying the indenture, waiving certain covenants and waiving past defaults.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of any series issued under the indenture may, on behalf of the holders
of all debt securities of that series, waive our compliance with certain restrictive provisions of the indenture. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of debt securities of any series issued under the indenture may, on behalf of all holders of debt securities of that series, waive any past default and its consequences
under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of that series, except:
a continuing payment default with respect to debt securities of that series; or
•
•
a continuing default of a covenant or provision of the indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each debt security of that
series.

Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
We may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease or convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and properties and
the assets and properties or our subsidiaries (taken as a whole) in one or more related transactions to any person (as defined in the indenture) unless:
either (a) SM Energy is the surviving entity or (b) the entity formed by or surviving the consolidation or merger (if other than us), or the person that acquires by
sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition, substantially all of our properties and assets is organized and validly existing under the laws of
the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;
the entity formed by or surviving the consolidation or merger (if other than us), or the person that acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition, substantially all of our properties and assets expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and any premium and
interest on, and every other obligation under the debt securities and the indenture; and
•
•
•
immediately after the transaction becomes effective, no event of default, and no event that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of
default, will have occurred and be continuing.
Governing Law
The indenture and the debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The indenture is subject to the provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act that are required to be part of the indenture and will, to the extent applicable, be governed by those provisions.
The Trustee
We may appoint a separate trustee for any series of debt securities. In the description of a series of debt securities, the term "trustee" refers to the trustee appointed with
respect to such series of debt securities. The trustee may be a depository for funds and perform other services for, and may transact other banking business with, SM Energy
and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business.
BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will issue securities, other than our common stock, to investors in the form of one or more book-
entry certificates registered in the name of a depository or a nominee of a depository. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the depository will
be DTC. We have been informed by DTC that its nominee will be Cede & Co., or Cede. Accordingly, Cede is expected to be the initial registered holder of all securities that are
issued in book-entry form.
No person that acquires a beneficial interest in securities issued in book-entry form will be entitled to receive a certificate representing those securities, except as set
forth in this prospectus or in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless and until definitive securities are issued under the limited circumstances described below, all
references to actions by holders or beneficial owners of securities issued in book-entry form will refer to actions taken by DTC upon instructions from its participants, and all
references to payments and notices to holders or beneficial owners will refer to payments and notices to DTC or Cede, as the registered holder of such securities.
12
Table of Contents
DTC has informed us that it is:
a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking laws;
a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York banking laws;
a member of the Federal Reserve System;
a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and
•
•
•
•
•
a "clearing agency" registered under the Securities Exchange Act.
DTC has also informed us that it was created to:
hold securities for "participants" and
•
•
facilitate the computerized settlement of securities transactions among participants through computerized electronic book-entry changes in participants' accounts,
thereby eliminating the need for the physical movement of securities certificates.
Participants have accounts with DTC and include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect access to the DTC system
also is available to indirect participants such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either
directly or indirectly.
Persons that are not participants or indirect participants but desire to buy, sell or otherwise transfer ownership of or interests in securities may do so only through
participants and indirect participants. Under the book-entry system, beneficial owners may experience some delay in receiving payments, as payments will be forwarded by our
agent to Cede, as nominee for DTC. These payments will be forwarded to DTC's participants, which thereafter will forward them to indirect participants or beneficial owners.
Beneficial owners will not be recognized by the applicable registrar, transfer agent, trustee or depositary as registered holders of the securities entitled to the benefits of the
certificate, the indenture or any deposit agreement. Beneficial owners that are not participants will be permitted to exercise their rights as an owner only indirectly through
participants and, if applicable, indirect participants.
Under the current rules and regulations affecting DTC, DTC will be required to make book-entry transfers of securities among participants and to receive and transmit
payments to participants. Participants and indirect participants with whom beneficial owners of securities have accounts are also required by these rules to make book-entry
transfers and receive and transmit such payments on behalf of their respective account holders.
Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act only on behalf of other participants or indirect participants, and on behalf of certain banks, trust
companies and other persons approved by it, the ability of a beneficial owner of securities issued in book-entry form to pledge those securities to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC system may be limited due to the unavailability of physical certificates for the securities.
DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a registered holder of any securities under the certificate, the indenture or any deposit agreement
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose accounts with DTC the securities are credited.
According to DTC, it has provided information with respect to DTC to its participants and other members of the financial community for informational purposes only and is
not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind.
13
Table of Contents
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, a book-entry security will be exchangeable for definitive securities registered in the names of persons
other than DTC or its nominee only if:
DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the book-entry security or DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act at a time when DTC is required to be so registered; or
•
•
we execute and deliver to the applicable registrar, transfer agent, trustee and/or depositary an order complying with the requirements of the certificate, the
indenture or any deposit agreement that the book-entry security will be so exchangeable.
Any book-entry security that is exchangeable in accordance with the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for securities registered in such names as DTC directs.
If one of the events described in the immediately preceding paragraph occurs, DTC is generally required to notify all participants of the availability through DTC of
definitive securities. Upon surrender by DTC of the book-entry security representing the securities and delivery of instructions for re-registration, the registrar, transfer agent,
trustee or depositary, as the case may be, will reissue the securities as definitive securities. After reissuance of the securities, such persons will recognize the beneficial
owners of such definitive securities as registered holders of securities.
Except as described above:
a book-entry security may not be transferred except as a whole book-entry security by or among DTC, a nominee of DTC and/or a successor depository
appointed by us; and
•
•
DTC may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any beneficial interest in a book-entry security unless the beneficial interest is in an amount equal to an authorized
denomination for the securities evidenced by the book-entry security.
None of SM Energy, the trustee, any registrar and transfer agent or any depository, or any agent of any of them, will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of
DTC's or any participant's records relating to, or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a book-entry security.
We may sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement:
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
•
•
•
•
through agents;
through underwriters or dealers;
directly to one or more purchasers, including existing shareholders; or
any combination of the foregoing methods.
We will prepare a prospectus supplement for each offering that will disclose the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents,
the purchase price of the securities and the proceeds to us from the sale, any underwriting discounts and other items constituting compensation to underwriters, dealers or
agents and any delayed delivery arrangements.
The distribution of the securities may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at
prices related to such prevailing market prices at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices.
14
Table of Contents
By Agents
Securities offered by us pursuant to this prospectus may be sold through agents designated by us. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, any such
agent is acting on a best efforts basis for the period of its appointment.
By Underwriters or Dealers
If underwriters are used in the sale, the offered securities will be acquired by the underwriters for their own account. The underwriters may resell the securities in one or
more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. The obligations of the underwriters to
purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the underwriters must purchase all the securities of the
series offered by a prospectus supplement if any of the securities are purchased. Any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or re-allowed or paid
to dealers may be changed from time to time.
Direct Sales
Securities offered by us pursuant to this prospectus may also be sold directly by us. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. We may sell the securities
directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any sale of those securities. We will
describe the terms of any such sales in the prospectus supplement.
Delayed Delivery Arrangements
We may authorize agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers by certain institutional investors to purchase offered securities providing for payment and delivery on a
future date specified in the prospectus supplement. Institutional investors to which such offers may be made, when authorized, include commercial and savings banks,
insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, education and charitable institutions and such other institutions as may be approved by us. The obligations of any
such purchasers under such delayed delivery and payment arrangements will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the offered securities will not at the time of
delivery be prohibited under applicable law. The underwriters and such agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of such contracts.
General Information
Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the offered securities may be underwriters as defined in the Securities Act, and any discounts or
commissions received by them from us and any profit on the resale of the offered securities by them may be treated as underwriting discounts and commissions under the
Securities Act. Any underwriters or agents will be identified and their compensation described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
The securities (other than common stock) offered by this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, when first issued, will have no established trading market. Any
underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold by us for public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents will
not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of the trading market for any such
securities.
15
Table of Contents
We may have agreements with the underwriters, dealers and agents to indemnify them against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to
contribute with respect to payments that the underwriters, dealers or agents may be required to make.
Underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us or our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their businesses.
In connection with offerings of securities under the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and in compliance with applicable law, underwriters,
brokers or dealers may engage in transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at levels above those that might otherwise prevail in the open market.
Specifically, underwriters, brokers or dealers may over-allot in connection with offerings, creating a short position in the securities for their own accounts. For the purpose of
covering a syndicate short position or stabilizing the price of the securities, the underwriters, brokers or dealers may place bids for the securities or effect purchases of the
securities in the open market. Finally, the underwriters may impose a penalty whereby selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other brokers or dealers for
distribution of the securities in offerings may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed securities in transactions to cover short
positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities, which may be higher than the
price that might otherwise prevail in the open market, and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
Certain legal matters in connection with the securities will be passed upon for us by Holland & Hart LLP or by legal counsel named in the prospectus supplement and for
any underwriters by legal counsel named in the prospectus supplement.
