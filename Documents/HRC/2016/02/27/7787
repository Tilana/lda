<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 
17/119, in which the Council requested the secretariat to provide an annual written update 
on the operations of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review and on the resources available to it. 
Subsequently, the Secretary-General informed the Council in a note (A/HRC/23/60) that a 
consolidated annual written update on the operations of the Voluntary Fund would be 
submitted to the Council at its twenty-fourth session. In its resolution 23/3, the Council 
took note of the above-mentioned note by the Secretary-General. The present report 
provides an overview of contributions and expenditures as at 31 May 2013, together with a 
description of actions undertaken to operationalize the Fund. It also provides a description 
of the activities funded since the establishment of the Fund in 2009.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/17, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
establish a new financial mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance in order to provide, in conjunction with multilateral funding mechanisms, a 
source of financial and technical assistance to help countries implement recommendations 
emanating from the universal periodic review in consultation with, and with the consent of, 
the country concerned. In its resolution 16/21, the Council requested that the Voluntary 
Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal 
Periodic Review be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of 
financial and technical assistance to help countries, in particular least developed countries 
and small island developing States, to implement the recommendations made during their 
review. The Council also requested that a board of trustees be established in accordance 
with the rules of the United Nations.   
</p>
<p>3. Furthermore, in its resolution 16/22, the Human Rights Council requested the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to seek the views 
of States and relevant stakeholders on the contribution of the Voluntary Fund, in particular 
with regard to its sustainability and accessibility, to the implementation of 
recommendations accepted by States as part of their universal periodic review that require 
financial support, and also requested OHCHR to provide the Council with a compilation of 
those views at its nineteenth session.1  
</p>
<p>4. States have commenced making contributions to the Voluntary Fund. OHCHR has 
also begun to operationalize the Fund by providing financial and technical assistance to 
States that request support. Support is provided by OHCHR in the spirit of the universal 
periodic review, in accordance with the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, in 
particular subparagraphs 4 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) (see also paragraphs 15 to 29 below).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p>5. The mandate of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review, as specified by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 6/17, is to provide, in conjunction with multilateral funding 
mechanisms, a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries to implement 
recommendations emanating from the universal periodic review in consultation with, and 
with the consent of, the country concerned. On the basis of this broadly defined mandate, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See A/HRC/19/50. </p>


<p>OHCHR has further elaborated the terms of reference of the Voluntary Fund in order to 
provide funding for (a) the integration of universal periodic review outcomes into United 
Nations common country programming documents, including the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework and the dissemination of information on review 
outcomes with a view to mobilizing support for the countries concerned; (b) the 
coordination of United Nations, multilateral and bilateral action in support of review 
outcomes, including the conduct of needs assessments and the formulation of programmes 
and projects aimed at implementing review outcomes; (c) the exchange of information and 
the sharing of best practices, including through the organization of regional and subregional 
meetings, seminars, consultations and other forms of interaction; (d) the development of a 
national capacity and expertise for the implementation of review outcomes; (e) the co-
funding of programmes and projects aimed at implementing review outcomes; and (f) 
regular follow-up, with the national bodies and institutions concerned, of action taken to 
implement the universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>6. OHCHR has also developed broad principles with a view to guiding the formulation 
of requests for assistance and its review of such requests, and to ensuring a clear, coherent, 
transparent and consistent process. These principles also took into account the request made 
by the Human Rights Council that OHCHR make clear the process by which States request 
assistance from the Fund, and to process such requests in a timely and transparent manner 
that adequately responds to the requesting States.2 Accordingly, requests for funding 
should:  
</p>
<p>(a)  Be made by the requesting State directly to OHCHR or one of its field 
offices, the office of the Resident Coordinator or other appropriate channel. Requests may 
also be submitted on the State&#8217;s behalf by another entity provided it is engaged in 
</p>
<p>supporting the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations and with the 
consent of that State. These entities may include United Nations organizations, national 
human rights institutions, civil society organizations or other development actors;  
</p>
<p>(b) Support the implementation of, or contribute to implement, one or several 
universal periodic review recommendations with a measurable impact on the improvement 
in the enjoyment and exercise of human rights in general or of those of specific groups;  
</p>
<p>(c)  Aim at building the State&#8217;s human and technical resources to strengthen 
national mechanisms to promote and protect human rights in a particular area of concern;  
</p>
<p>(d)  Be guided by the broad principle that effective technical 
assistance/cooperation is based on the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, 
and include both the promotion and the protection of human rights;  
</p>
<p>(e)  Be guided by the principle that technical cooperation ought to be formulated 
and implemented with the participation of relevant sectors of national societies, including 
State institutions (judicial, legislative and executive branches of government), national 
human rights institutions and civil society.  
</p>
<p>7. Priority attention will be given to requests from least developed countries and/or 
small island developing States to help them to implement their universal periodic review 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>8.  Since effective technical assistance and cooperation should focus on building and 
strengthening national frameworks and institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including the rule of law, legal and political accountability, democratically 
elected parliaments, independent courts and independent national human rights institutions, 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Human Rights Council resolution 23/3, para. 15. </p>


<p>requests should focus in priority on the strengthening of these national protection 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>9.  Requests should propose a coherent set of activities that contain clear objectives 
with corresponding strategies to implement them, and an identification of beneficiary target 
groups and outcomes. The objectives should be realistic, achievable and time-bound. A 
detailed budget should be accompanied to the request. It is also expected that costs will be 
incurred during the implementation period and comply with the principles of sound 
financial management designed to optimize the use of the resources requested.  
</p>
<p>10. Requests may also aim at building the country&#8217;s human and technical capacities to 
strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights in a particular area of concern. 
Considering the complementarity of the universal periodic review with other international 
mechanisms, including treaty bodies and special procedures, and the legal obligations 
contracted by States when ratifying human rights instruments, it would be advisable that 
universal periodic review recommendations that correspond to similar recommendations by 
treaty bodies, special procedures or other international or regional human rights institutions 
be selected for implementation under the proposal.  
</p>
<p>11.  Attention will also be given to requests reflecting OHCHR global thematic priorities 
and contribute to the achievement of its expected accomplishments.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Operationalization of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strategic vision for follow-up to the universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>12. In accordance with its priority to strengthen human rights mechanisms and the 
progressive development of human rights law as elaborated in its Management Plan 2012-
2013,3 OHCHR has adopted a holistic approach to universal periodic review follow-up, 
which consists in supporting the implementation of the recommendations of all United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, including those made during the universal periodic 
review. As highlighted by the Human Rights Council, the review is complementary to and 
should strengthen other United Nations human rights mechanisms, the bedrock of the 
international system of human rights promotion and protection built over the past six 
decades. This holistic approach is the spirit of efforts by OHCHR to operationalize the 
recommendations of international human rights mechanisms in all countries. In practice, 
OHCHR has been integrating the recommendations from all international human rights 
mechanisms into its planning and programming at all levels in accordance with the 
objectives and priorities of its mandate. With this approach in mind, OHCHR, in the past 
two years, has been developing its capacity to provide strengthened support to States in 
their efforts to engage in and implement the outcome of their universal periodic review, 
including through the operationalization of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>13. The purpose of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review is in substance very similar to that of the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See 
</p>
<p>www2.ohchr.org/english/ohchrreport2011/web_version/media/pdf/11_Human_rights_mechanisms.pdf. </p>


<p>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights established in 
</p><p>1987. Consequently, after consultation with the Board of Trustees of the latter Fund, and 
upon the request of OHCHR, on 30 May 2013, the Secretary-General appointed the 
members of the Board of Trustees serve as members of the Board of Trustees for the 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to oversee its management. This 
arrangement is both cost-effective and efficient, and will help to ensure complementarity 
between the activities supported by both funds. 
</p>
<p>14. In close consultation with the various work units of OHCHR, the Board of Trustees 
will focus its attention on:  
</p>
<p>(a) Guiding the operationalization of the Fund;  
</p>
<p>(b) Examining, advising and guiding field presences in the area of technical 
cooperation, taking into account the specificities of countries and regions;  
</p>
<p>(c) Identifying best practices in the implementation of technical cooperation;  
</p>
<p>(d) Ensuring that the Fund is managed with due regard for geographic balance 
and the needs and expectations of least developed countries and small island developing 
States.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities supported by the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>15. Since the formal establishment of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review in 2009, a number of 
proposals have been supported by it. The effort began in 2009 with a major focus on 
assisting States in developing plans of action or road maps to implement universal periodic 
review recommendations at the country level. At the regional level, in the Pacific region, a 
regional strategy to follow up on the outcomes of all international human rights 
mechanisms was supported. The strategy has been implemented by the OHCHR Regional 
Office for the Pacific in close cooperation with the Governments of the region and United 
Nations country teams, and with the participation of national stakeholders. This effort will 
continue throughout 2013.   
</p>
<p>16. In 2012, when the second cycle of the universal periodic review started, OHCHR 
provided States with support on a variety of themes by means of different frameworks of 
cooperation. It further strengthened cooperation with entities of the United Nations system, 
in particular with United Nations country teams providing States with support to in follow-
up to their universal periodic review.  For instance, OHCHR supported follow-up efforts of 
country teams in both the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Thailand in the 
framework of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. The Development 
Assistance Frameworks of the two countries contain specific outcomes geared to assist 
them in implementing prioritized universal periodic review recommendations. Participating 
country team members jointly provided both substantive and financial support to achieve 
those outcomes. 
</p>
<p>17.  In accordance with the broad principles described in the terms of reference above, 
the Fund has been used as a source of financial and technical assistance to support the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations at the country level. Since 
the review is a process of national and international human rights dialogue and cooperation 
aimed at developing and strengthening national capacities to promote and protect human 
rights at the country level, OHCHR has focused its work on supporting efforts at that level. 
In all the 58 countries where it has a field presence, it has strengthened its support for the 
universal periodic review as a national process of dialogue and cooperation to implement 
the commitments made by State authorities in Geneva.  In other countries, it has supported </p>


<p>the review process through its regional office, and collaboration or partnerships with United 
Nations country teams and the office of the Resident Coordinator.  
</p>
<p>18. In 2010 and 2011, 22 projects in 14 States4 were funded by the Voluntary Fund 
either to inform, advise and guide the States in the preparation of their review or to support 
their effort to implement the recommendations made. In addition, four regional workshops 
on the universal periodic review supported by the Voluntary Fund were organized or co-
organized with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) by the Office in 
Senegal (for West African countries), South Africa (for Southern African countries), 
Ethiopia (for Eastern African countries) and in the Republic of Moldova (for Eastern 
European countries), which benefited most countries in these regions. These activities were 
implemented through OHCHR field presences, including its regional offices for West 
Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa, Eastern Africa and the Pacific. 
</p>
<p>19. In 2012, Voluntary Fund projects to assess needs, to provide advice and guidance or 
to support the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations were carried 
out in Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Ecuador, Fiji, Jamaica, the Marshall Islands, Pakistan, 
Tonga and Vanuatu. Regional follow-up workshops were organized or co-organized jointly 
with UNDP in South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Arab regions, benefiting several dozen 
countries.  
</p>
<p>20. Since the beginning of 2013, the Office has reviewed more than 20 new requests for 
funding under the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to support 
implementation by countries of their universal periodic review recommendations. In doing 
so, it has paid special attention to least developed countries, small island developing States 
and other countries. Funding for new activities was approved for Argentina, Barbados, 
Brazil, Chile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic, Paraguay, Peru, the Republic of Moldova, Thailand, Ukraine and Uruguay. Also 
since January, technical assistance assessment missions with regard to universal periodic 
review follow-up funded by the Voluntary Fund were undertaken to the Dominican 
Republic, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Proposals to be implemented later in 2013 or in 2014 
are being reviewed with regard to Guinea, Madagascar, the Niger, Panama, Serbia and 
Sierra Leone.    
</p>
<p>21. As an example of its activities, in late 2012, the Voluntary Fund supported the 
recruitment in Barbados of a national human rights officer placed in the office of the 
Resident Coordinator to assess, in close collaboration with the national authorities, the 
potential and challenges of universal periodic review recommendations with a view to 
providing the support necessary for their effective implementation.  
</p>
<p>22. The OHCHR Regional Office for South America has begun to implement a project 
aimed at assisting Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay in implementing the 
universal periodic review recommendations by recruiting human rights advisers who 
conduct training on the review process, integrate review recommendations into national 
strategies and plans of action, and enhance the capacities of civil society and other relevant 
stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>23. In the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to the ongoing support provided to a number 
of island States in the Pacific region through the above-mentioned regional strategy, 
OHCHR has been provided support to several countries in South-east Asia, including 
Indonesia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and 
Thailand. In December 2012, the Voluntary Fund contributed to an OHCHR assessment 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Congo, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, 
</p>
<p>Mali, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tonga and Vanuatu. </p>


<p>mission to Bahrain, at the invitation of the Government, to identify capacity-building needs 
and areas of possible cooperation for technical assistance to implement universal periodic 
review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2012, in Ecuador, the human rights adviser supported the Ministry of Justice in 
the development and implementation of a system of human rights indicators to help the 
national authorities to assess, analyse and follow-up on the implementation of the country&#8217;s 
human rights obligations. Indicators on the rights to work and to integrity were developed 
during the pilot phase of the project.  
</p>
<p>25.  In April and May 2012, in Pakistan, through the office of the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, OHCHR supported the convening 
by the Ministry of Human Rights of four regional consultations between the Government 
and civil society actors to assess progress in the implementation of universal periodic 
review recommendations emanating from the first cycle, human rights developments that 
have arisen since, and to prepare the national report for the second cycle. 
</p>
<p>26.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a proposal was approved to support the 
implementation of several universal periodic review recommendations encouraging the 
country to establish a national human rights institution. Implementation of the project will 
commence during the second half of 2013.  
</p>
<p>27. In Paraguay, through the Human Rights Adviser in the office of the Resident 
Coordinator and in close in cooperation with the Government, the Voluntary Fund supports 
activities designed to implement six prioritized universal periodic review recommendations 
relating to the development of a system of human rights indicators aimed at analysing, 
monitoring and reporting on progress in implementing the recommendations made by 
human rights mechanisms, and at improving the human rights record of the country. The 
project is being implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
governmental human rights network responsible for implementing the country&#8217;s human 
rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>28. In early 2013, the Voluntary Fund supported the convening of a subregional 
workshop on follow-up to the universal periodic review for South-east Asia with a view to 
identify good practices in follow-up efforts at the country level. During the workshop, key 
elements of an effective and inclusive process to follow up on review recommendations 
were examined, including the establishment of a mechanism to review, follow up on and 
monitor the implementation of recommendations, consultation with and the involvement of 
national human rights institutions and civil society organizations in the implementation of 
recommendations, and United Nations system-wide cooperation in supporting States in 
follow-up at the country level. 
</p>
<p>29. OHCHR has provided a great deal of support to States in universal periodic review 
follow-up activities at the country and regional levels through other forms of engagement 
and cooperation.5

<p>32.  The reception, review and approval of projects slowed down in 2012 owing to the 
focus of OHCHR on the internal reorganization of its resources for the universal periodic 
review, to ensure their more cost-effective use, and greater efficiency. As at 
December 2012, approximately $1.7 million were available to the Fund. The OHCHR cost 
plan for the universal periodic review in 2013 provided for the disbursement of 1.2 million 
to support ongoing and newly approved projects.  It would be advisable to expand the 
donor base of the Fund so that all interested Member States, including developing 
countries, may contribute from within their means.    
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>33.<b> The Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance for the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review provides valuable support for States 
</b></p>
<p><b>wishing to implement their pledges and commitments made at their universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review. Through such an effort, they have a further opportunity to implement their 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations under the treaties they have ratified. In the spirit of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate and terms of reference, the Voluntary Fund has provided funding and 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical advice and guidance by means of a variety of projects and activities designed 
</b></p>
<p><b>to follow up on the recommendations made during the universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p><b>While regional meetings have focused on information, advice and guidance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the universal periodic review process and the sharing of experiences 
</b></p>
<p><b>between review actors in their efforts to implement their commitments, most activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been directed at supporting States in their effort to implement review 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations at the national level, directly or through a variety of frameworks of 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation, including common country assessments and the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development Assistance Frameworks. The said activities have also helped to 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstream review recommendations into the planning and programming of entities 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the United Nations system.  In providing such assistance and funding, a primary 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration was whether they would help States to bring about concrete and 
</b></p>
<p><b>tangible institutional changes in law, policy and practice, thereby strengthening their 
</b></p>
<p><b>national systems in the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>34.<b> Thanks to the Voluntary Fund and other sources of funding, OHCHR is 
pursuing its effort to provide universally objective and reliable information, advice 
</b></p>
<p><b>and guidance to Member States and other actors with regard to the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review process, either directly or through international, regional or subregional 
</b></p>
<p><b>events. It will continue to support efforts by States, including their institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights bodies, civil society actors and the people themselves, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement their commitments made during their review and other human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations and, crucially, to foster dialogue, cooperation and the sharing of 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience at all levels. The efforts made by the Voluntary Fund to enhance its 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity, however, and in particular to document best universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices at the country level, to develop tools and to organize events to share them </b></p>


<p><b>among all stakeholders concerned will continue to be limited by the constraints in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources. The Voluntary Fund has played and will continue to play a key supporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>role for States in improving human rights domestically and for OHCHR to support 
</b></p>
<p><b>this effort internationally.  
</b></p>
<p>35.<b> The universal periodic review is an intergovernmental process. The Human 
Rights Council, in its resolutions, has stressed that the primary responsibility for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of review recommendations lies with the State and, as appropriate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with other relevant stakeholders. The participation and the role of other stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the process, in particular national human rights institutions and civil society actors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been increasingly recognized by the Council as an important contribution to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>process. Their role in the assessment and documentation of the domestic situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, drawing attention to important human rights concerns, involving all
