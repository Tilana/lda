ALTONA TO EXPAND EXPLORATION FOOTPRINT IN MT ISA REGION
•  Altona strategy of leveraging existing position and knowledge of the Mt Isa Inlier  
•  A total of 1,868 square kilometres of new Exploration Permit applications made 
•  Altona  tenement  position  is  one  of  the  largest  in  the  region  at  2,800  square  kilometres
including the proposed SRIG JV on the Cloncurry Project
•  Targeting base metals and gold using exploration approach developed to delineate major
targets at Roseby South and the Turkey Creek discovery
Altona Mining Limited (“Altona” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce it is seeking to expand its 
exploration presence in the Mt Isa Inlier in Northwest Queensland.  
 
The  Company  has  applied  for  10  new  Exploration  Permits  (“EPM’s”)  in  the  region  surrounding  its 
Cloncurry  Project  and  the  100%-owned  Roseby  South  Project  (“Roseby  South”)  near  Mt  Isa  in 
Queensland.  The  new  applications  cover  an  area  of  1,868  square  kilometres  and  are  illustrated  in 
Figure 1.  
 
The first of the applications which adjoins Roseby South (EPM 26182) was granted in July 2016. It 
secures extensions of the target corridor that contains the new Hobby anomaly and anomalies at an 
early stage of definition to the north.  
 
The new project areas are being targeted for copper-gold (IOCG) as well as gold only and lead-zinc-
silver deposit types. 
 
The Cloncurry Project is the subject of a US$235.5 million proposed joint venture (“JV”) with Sichuan 
Railway Investment Group (“SRIG”). Please refer to  the ASX release dated 2 June 2016 for further 
information regarding the SRIG JV. 
 
Roseby  South  immediately  adjoins  the  southern  boundary  of  the  Company’s  Cloncurry  Project  and 
MMG's major underground zinc mine development at Dugald River (Figure 1). Roseby South is 100% 
Altona-owned exploration tenure and does not form part of the arrangements with SRIG.  
 
Altona Mining’s managing director Dr Alistair Cowden said:  
 
“The application provides Altona with further exposure to the Mt Isa Inlier, one of the world’s premium 
base metal producing provinces. 
 
“With expansion of its exploration activities in the region and the potential development of a new major 
copper-gold mine through the SRIG JV, Altona will be strategically well placed in the region.” 
 
Altona has a track record of discovery in the region (Turkey Creek deposit), while Altona’s campaign 
to expand its exploration activities beyond the proposed SRIG JV is delivering results with the recent 
identification of the Harvest and Hobby anomalies (refer to ASX release dated 1 August 2016).

Interest in the Mt Isa region has recently taken an upturn with major international miners acquiring new 
positions  in  the  region  (for  example  Newmont’s  JV  with  Hammer  Metals  and  Rio  Tinto  Exploration 
applying for EPM’s areas adjacent to the Roseby Project).

About Altona 
 
Altona  Mining  Limited  is an ASX listed company focussed on  the  Cloncurry  Project in Queensland, 
Australia.  The Project has Mineral Resources containing some 1.65 million tonnes of copper and 0.41 
million ounces of gold. The first development envisaged is the 7 million tonnes per annum Little Eva 
open  pit  copper-gold  mine  and  concentrator.  Altona  has  completed  a  Framework  Agreement  with 
Sichuan Railway  Investment Group to fully fund and develop Little  Eva.  Little  Eva is permitted  with 
proposed annual production(1) of 38,800 tonnes of copper and 17,200 ounces of gold for a minimum of 
11 years. A Definitive Feasibility Study was published in March 2014.   
 
1Refer to the ASX release ‘Cost Review Delivers Major Upgrade to Little Eva’ dated 13 March 2014 
which  outlines  information  in  relation  to  this  production  target  and  forecast  financial  information 
derived from this production target.  The release is available to be viewed at www.altonamining.com or 
www.asx.com.au.    The  Company  confirms  that  all  the  material  assumptions  underpinning  the 
production target and the forecast financial information derived from the production target referred to 
in the above-mentioned release continue to apply and have not materially changed.  
 
Competent Persons Statement 
 
The  information  in  this  report  that  relates  to  Exploration  Targets,  Exploration  Results,  Mineral 
Resources  or  Ore  Reserves  is  based  on  information  compiled  by  Mr  Roland  Bartsch,  BSc  (Hons), 
MSc, MAusIMM, and Mr George Ross, MSc, MAIG. Mr Bartsch and Mr Ross are full time employees 
of the Company and have sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type 
of deposit under consideration and to the activity being undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person 
as defined in the 2012 Edition of the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves’.  Mr Bartsch and Mr Ross consent to the inclusion in the report of the 
matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears. 
 
Copper equivalence 
 
When used, copper equivalent refers to copper in concentrate produced, or planned to be produced. It 
does  not  refer  to  metal  contained  within  in-situ  resources,  reserves  or  drill  results.  The  copper 
equivalent grade is calculated by factoring the copper grade by revenue from all metals (NSR) being 
copper, gold and silver.

A This information was prepared and first disclosed under the JORC Code 2004 Edition. It has not been updated since to comply with the JORC Code 2012 on the basis that the information has not 
materially changed since it was last reported. All other resources classified and reported in accordance with JORC Code 2012 edition.  
Note:Tonnages are dry metric tonnes and have been rounded, hence small differences may be present in the totals. 
See ASX release of 23 October 2007 and 26 July 2011 (Longamundi, Great Southern, Caroline and Charlie Brown), 23 April 2012 (Bedford, Ivy Ann and Lady Clayre), 03 July 2012 (Blackard and 
Scanlan) and 22 August 2012 (Legend) for full details of resource estimation methodology and attributions. 
Little Eva is reported above a 0.2% copper lower cut-off grade, all other deposits are above 0.3% lower copper cut-off.
