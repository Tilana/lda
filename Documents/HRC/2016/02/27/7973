<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-second session</b> 
Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent international commission of 
inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The depth of the Syrian tragedy is poignantly reflected in the accounts of its victims. 
Their harrowing experiences of survival detail grave human rights violations, war crimes 
and crimes against humanity. The destructive dynamics of the civil war not only have an 
impact on the civilian population but are also tearing apart the country&#8217;s complex social 
fabric, jeopardizing future generations and undermining peace and security in the entire 
region.  
</p>
<p> The situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic has continued to 
deteriorate. Since 15 July 2012, there has been an escalation in the armed conflict between 
Government forces and anti-Government armed groups. The conflict has become 
increasingly sectarian, with the conduct of the parties becoming significantly more 
radicalized and militarized. 
</p>
<p> For the present report, 445 interviews were conducted. The continued lack of access 
to the Syrian Arab Republic significantly limited the commission&#8217;s ability to fulfil its 
mandate of investigating all alleged violations of international law and all massacres. This 
was particularly the case with regard to information concerning crimes and abuses 
committed by anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p> Government forces and affiliated militia committed the crimes against humanity of 
murder, torture, rape, enforced disappearance and other inhumane acts. War crimes and 
gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law &#8212; including arbitrary 
arrest and detention, unlawful attack, attacking protected objects, and pillaging and 
destruction of property &#8212; were also committed. 
</p>
<p> Anti-Government armed groups have committed war crimes, including murder, 
torture, hostage-taking and attacking protected objects. They continue to endanger the 
civilian population by positioning military objectives inside civilian areas. Where armed 
groups carried out bombings in predominantly civilian areas, it had the effect of spreading

</p>
<p>terror and amounted to the war crime of attacking civilians. The violations and abuses 
committed by anti-Government armed groups did not, however, reach the intensity and 
scale of those committed by Government forces and affiliated militia. 
</p>
<p> Both Government-affiliated militia and anti-Government armed groups were found 
to have violated the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict, to which the Syrian Arab Republic is a party. 
Government-affiliated militia used children under the age of 18 in direct hostilities. 
Children under the age of 15 actively participated in hostilities as part of anti-Government 
armed groups, conduct that constitutes the war crime of using, conscripting and enlisting 
children. 
</p>
<p> The commission reiterates that the only solution to the Syrian conflict is a political 
one, based on the framework set forth in the final communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for 
Syria of 30 June 2012 (Geneva communiqu&#233;) (A/66/865-S/2012/522). 
 Ensuring the accountability of all parties for crimes committed is imperative. The 
quest for peace and justice is a shared responsibility at the national, regional and 
international levels. The commission&#8217;s detailed recommendations &#8212; to the Syrian 
Government, anti-Government armed groups, the international community, the Human 
Rights Council and the Security Council &#8212; serve to emphasize the need to counter a 
growing culture of impunity, through referral to justice at the national and international 
levels, in addition to other channels to promote truth and reconciliation, and the social 
recovery and integration of victims. 
</p>
<p> A confidential list of individuals and units believed to be responsible for crimes 
against humanity, breaches of international humanitarian law and gross human rights 
violations will be submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at 
the close of the commission&#8217;s current mandate, in March 2013.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The depth of the Syrian tragedy is poignantly reflected in the accounts of its victims. 
Their harrowing experiences of survival detail grave human rights violations, war crimes 
and crimes against humanity. The destructive dynamics of the civil war not only have an 
impact on the civilian population but are also tearing apart the country&#8217;s complex social 
fabric, jeopardizing future generations and undermining peace and security in the entire 
region. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the independent international commission of inquiry on the 
Syrian Arab Republic1 sets out its findings based on investigations conducted from 15 July 
2012 to 15 January 2013. The report builds upon the periodic update released on 20 
December 2012 and the oral statement presented by the chairperson at interactive dialogue 
of the Human Rights Council on 17 September, during its twenty-first session. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council in its resolution 21/26 of 28 September 2012 extended 
the mandate originally established by the Council in its resolution S-17/1 of 23 August 
</p><p>2011. In extending the mandate, the Council requested the commission to investigate all 
massacres and to periodically update its findings, including by means of an assessment of 
casualty figures. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report should be read in conjunction with the previous reports of the 
commission (S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50) with regard to the interpretation 
of its mandate and working methods, as well as its factual and legal findings concerning 
events in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and 15 July 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>5. Lack of physical access to the country undermined the commission&#8217;s ability to fulfil 
its mandate. Its access to Government officials and to members of the armed and security 
forces was limited. Victims and witnesses inside the country, especially those allegedly 
abused by anti-Government armed groups, could not be interviewed in person. 
</p>
<p>6. On 22 June 2012, the commission addressed a request to President Bashar Al Assad 
seeking access to undertake investigations within the Syrian Arab Republic. No response 
was received. Since October, repeated requests for meetings with the Permanent 
Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic in Geneva have been unsuccessful. The 
information received from the Government is reflected in the present report (see annex I). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. The methodology employed was based on the standard practices of commissions of 
inquiry and human rights investigations, adapted to the above challenges.2 
</p>
<p>8. The commission relied primarily on first-hand accounts to corroborate incidents. 
Owing to a lack of access to the country, staff were deployed elsewhere in the region to 
collect first-hand accounts from refugees. The present report is based on 445 interviews 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chairperson), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Carla Del 
</p>
<p>Ponte and Vitit Muntarbhorn. The latter two members joined the commission for the period of its 
current mandate.

</p>
<p>conducted in the region and from Geneva, including via Skype and telephone, with victims 
and witnesses inside the country. The total number of interviews conducted since the 
mandate began in September 2011 stands at 1,391. 
</p>
<p>9. Photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery and forensic and medical records 
were collected and analysed. Reports from Governments and non-Governmental sources, 
academic analyses, as well as United Nations reports, including from human rights bodies 
and mechanisms and humanitarian organizations, formed part of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>10. The standard of proof used in previous reports remained. Such a standard was met 
when incidents were corroborated to a level where the commission had reasonable grounds 
to believe that incidents had occurred as described. 
</p>
<p>11. The commission is grateful to all those who cooperated in the fulfilment of its 
mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political context 
</b></p>
<p>12. In the last six months of the period under review, the conflict became increasingly 
violent and complex, and efforts to achieve a political settlement stalled. In supporting 
various parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, regional and international actors hampered the 
prospects of a negotiated settlement owing to their divergent interests. The position of key 
international actors remains unchanged.  
</p>
<p>13. After a unanimous vote by the Security Council supporting a ceasefire in the Syrian 
Arab Republic on 24 October 2012, both the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and 
anti-Government armed groups, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA) accepted to abide 
by the terms of a truce over the Eid al-Adha religious holiday from 26 to 30 October. The 
truce, however, did not hold, as hostilities continued between the parties. 
</p>
<p>14. The creation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition 
Forces on 12 November was a significant development within the Syrian opposition. The 
coalition is made up of representatives of external Syrian opposition groups and &#8220;internal 
revolutionary forces&#8221;, including the FSA. Moaz al-Khateeb was elected to lead the 
coalition. The head of the Syrian National Council, George Sabra, was elected as one of the 
coalition&#8217;s vice-presidents. Reactions to the coalition have been mixed. The League of Arab 
States recognized the coalition as the &#8220;representative and main interlocutor with the Arab 
League&#8221;. More than 13 anti-Government armed groups, including the al-Nusra Front, 
announced their rejection of the legitimacy of the coalition. 
</p><p>15. On 11 December, the State Department of the United States of America declared the 
al-Nusra Front to be a &#8220;foreign terrorist organization&#8221; and an affiliate of Al-Qaida in Iraq. 
16. On 6 January 2013, President Al Assad delivered a speech ruling out any 
negotiations with &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, stating that a political settlement was only possible with a 
nationalist opposition that was not seeking &#8220;to divide Syria&#8221;. He also outlined his vision of 
a political settlement whereby outside countries would stop arming &#8220;terrorist groups&#8221; inside 
the country, after which the Syrian army would halt its military operations but reserve the 
right to respond to any attacks by armed groups. He proposed the holding of a national 
conference with the aim of establishing a national charter leading to parliamentary elections 
and the formation of a new Government.  
</p>
<p>17. The Secretary-General expressed his disappointment at the speech, as it had not 
addressed the final communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria (Geneva communiqu&#233;) of 30 </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>June 2012 (A/66/865-S/2012/522), which called for a political transition, sustained 
cessation of hostilities and establishment of a transitional governing body with full 
executive powers. The Syrian opposition rejected any settlement or transition that included 
President Al Assad. 
</p>
<p>18. On 18 January 2013, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
briefed the Security Council and requested a referral of the situation in the Syrian Arab 
Republic to the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>19. The Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab 
States for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, continued to encourage stakeholders to work towards 
ending the violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to enter into inclusive negotiations 
leading to a comprehensive settlement. A number of meetings between the United States 
and the Russian Federation were facilitated by the Joint Special Representative to support 
the implementation of the Geneva communiqu&#233;. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Military context</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. In recent months, the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has continuously 
escalated, albeit unequally, reaching new levels of violence and spreading to new regions. 
Whereas the Government remained in control of the southern and coastal governorates, 
anti-Government armed groups made substantial military gains in central and northern 
regions, forcing the Government to cede control of several localities and strategic junctions. 
An escalation was observed in the north-eastern governorates with the involvement of 
Kurdish militia. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Government, with affiliated militia, adopted a &#8220;contraction&#8221; of forces strategy in 
facing the mounting insurgency. While focusing on holding major cities, Government 
forces also besieged restive towns with layers of security. Towns under armed group 
control suffered intensified artillery and aerial shelling. Other, mostly rural, areas were 
abandoned completely by Government forces, but continued to be shelled. Besides 
conventional ammunition, other types of ammunition were used, including cluster aerial 
bombs and artillery shells. No credible evidence was documented on the use of chemical 
weapons by either side. 
</p>
<p>22. Armed self-defence groups formed by pro-Government communities &#8212; also known 
as popular committees &#8212; continued to protect their neighbourhoods and localities from 
anti-Government armed groups and to participate in military operations alongside 
Government forces. They were allegedly armed and equipped by the Government and, in 
some areas, by external sympathisers. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>23. Despite its persistent divisions, the insurgency continued to mature into a fighting 
force increasingly able to challenge Government control of the country and to strike at 
strategic targets, such as oil fields and airports. In the northern and central provinces, these 
groups extended their control over increasing swathes of territory, while struggling in the 
southern and coastal governorates. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See also annex II. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>24. Despite multiple endeavours to unify and structure its ranks, the armed opposition 
remained fragmented and unable to designate a reliable leadership. This fragmentation was 
aggravated by &#8212; if not the result of &#8212; the fact that the financial and material external 
support delivered by different sponsors, instead of promoting integration, has generated 
divisions and exacerbated competition among different groups.  
</p>
<p>25. The FSA has remained a brand name only, despite efforts of its leadership and 
supporters to create a central command and to link it to regional and local military councils. 
Meanwhile, there are also independent military alliances, which vary from more moderate 
to more extreme groups, which have managed to integrate several armed groups in specific 
circumstances and areas. The differences between the self-identified FSA and independent 
groups have not, however, significantly hindered their cooperation as they have continued 
to cooperate operationally to achieve their common objectives. 
</p><p>26. The intervention of external sponsors has contributed to the radicalization of the 
insurgency as it has favoured Salafi4 armed groups such as the al-Nusra Front, and even 
encouraged mainstream insurgents to join them owing to their superior logistical and 
operational capabilities. The support provided by external sources usually depends on the 
operational effectiveness of the groups and their willingness to embrace the language and 
symbols of their sponsors. 
</p>
<p>27. The number of foreign fighters has increased, but still accounts for a small 
proportion of the ranks of anti-Government armed groups. Their expertise and experience 
in insurgency warfare has been important to the opposition&#8217;s tactical effectiveness. They 
are drawn from countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, with many 
from Libya, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt.  
</p>
<p>28. Anti-Government armed groups have improved their access to weaponry, albeit 
unequally. Besides the military equipment looted from army bases, weapons and 
ammunition have also been provided by external sources and smuggled in across borders 
with neighbouring countries in significant quantities and on an increasingly regular basis. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other forces 
</b></p>
<p>29. Tensions between anti-Government armed groups and Kurdish militia mainly 
affiliated to the Democratic Union Party have increased in the predominantly Kurdish 
areas. After capturing most of the Kurdish towns without major resistance, the new Kurdish 
Popular Protection Units have periodically clashed with anti-Government armed groups 
owing to the latter&#8217;s unwanted intrusion into what they consider to be their territory. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Socioeconomic and humanitarian situation</b>5<b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. The conflict has wrought havoc on the economic, social and cultural rights of 
Syrians. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, power and 
water utilities exacerbates pre-existing hardships, pushing whole communities to the brink 
of collapse.  
</p>
<p>31. The onset of severe winter conditions, coupled with a growing displaced population 
and increasing difficulty in the delivery of humanitarian relief &#8212; including food, medical 
supplies and fuel &#8212; was cause for grave concern. In urban centres, the risk of epidemics 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Salafi refers to a wide range of groups who adopt a literal view of Sunni canonical texts. In the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic, it often denotes groups who use this interpretation to promote a militant activism 
against a ruling establishment deemed non-Islamic. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>and diseases has risen, compounded by the decreasing availability of support systems, 
facilities and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>32. Basic commodity prices, including for bread, have soared. Over the past four months 
of the period under review, inflation exceeded 50 per cent. The crippling effects of the 
sanctions regime remain. Coping mechanisms among the population, and particularly 
communities hosting internally displaced persons, are collapsing, leaving those trapped by 
and fleeing the conflict in appalling conditions. Hostilities have denied people access to 
basic necessities, including food and water. Food sources, such as bakeries, have been 
deliberately targeted. 
</p>
<p>33. Education continues to suffer in the conflict. In December 2012, the Syrian Ministry 
of Education reported that 1,468 schools were being used as collective centres, while 
another 2,362 (10 per cent of the total number of schools) had been damaged or looted. 
</p><p>34. The delivery of medicine has been hindered in some situations, and the denial of 
medical care continues to be reported. Government forces have attacked hospitals and field 
clinics and prevented physical access to hospitals by snipers.  
</p>
<p>35. Attacks on hospitals, medical units and personnel aggravate the socioeconomic cost 
of violence. Health-care staff are leaving their posts, hospitals are running out of supplies 
and vaccination campaigns have ceased in some areas. These effects substantially limit 
access to health care, including for the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>36. On 7 January 2013, the Government reported that factories in Aleppo had been 
looted or destroyed. It provided further information on attacks by armed groups on 
warehouses of medical supplies, and stated that medicines had been destroyed or sold 
overseas. The Government also alleged that crops had been destroyed and grain had been 
stolen from warehouses. 
</p>
<p>37. The humanitarian situation has deteriorated alarmingly. The number of casualties is 
on the rise. In December, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights reported 60,000 deaths since March 2011 based on an external assessment of figures 
from six non-governmental organizations6 and the Government. The latter put the number 
of casualties at 11,713. There is a need for further disaggregation of data from all sources. 
The number of deaths verified by the commission on the basis of 1,391 interviews was 
1,190. 
</p>
<p>38. Armed actors inside the Syrian Arab Republic are not upholding their shared 
responsibility to ensure access to humanitarian aid. On the contrary, attacks against 
humanitarian staff, aid buildings and supply routes are frequent amid the ongoing fighting, 
severely constraining humanitarian operations. 
</p>
<p>39. Syrians are fleeing their homes in ever increasing numbers. By 6 January 2013, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 2 million 
people had been internally displaced. By 21 January, an estimated 671,262 Syrian refugees 
were present in five neighbouring countries and North Africa, further destabilizing the 
region, both economically and politically. 
</p>
<p>40. Prior to the conflict, the Syrian Arab Republic played host to various groups of 
refugees, including 500,000 Palestinians and 150,000 Iraqis. Both groups were already 
living in precarious conditions. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) estimates that 400,000 Palestine refugees across the 
Syrian Arab Republic are now in urgent need of assistance. Approximately 17,000 have 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 The numbers provided by individual non-governmental organizations ranged from 36,000 to 50,000. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>approached UNRWA for assistance in Lebanon and another 3,300 have fled to Jordan. It is 
essential that neighbouring States adhere to the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p>41. In November 2012, the Syrian Humanitarian Forum appealed for funds for aid 
operations, concluding that the deepening humanitarian situation, coupled with the loss of 
life and displacement, required an urgent response. Humanitarian appeals have, however, 
been funded at only 50 per cent. In December 2012, responding to the Syrian refugee crisis, 
the United Nations system declared a level 3 emergency.7 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations in the treatment of civilians and hors de combat 
fighters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres</b>8<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. Acting upon the request of the Human Rights Council to investigate all massacres,9 
the commission adopted the following working definition of massacre:  
</p>
<p>An intentional mass killing of civilians not directly participating in hostilities, or 
hors de combat fighters, by organized armed forces or groups in a single incident, in 
violation of international human rights or humanitarian law.10 
</p>
<p>43. Specific investigative resources were dedicated to respond to the request of the 
Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>44. The massacres described below were investigated within the current reporting 
period.11 
</p>
<p>45. First-hand information was collected concerning a military operation in Jedaydet 
Artouz on 1 August 2012. During the operation, soldiers conducted house-to-house 
searches, mainly in the Sunni-majority southern parts of the city. After the operation, 
residents discovered the bodies of approximately 60 male residents, who appeared to have 
been summarily executed. In one case, residents found a group of 17 dead bodies of adult 
males, most of whom had their hands tied behind their back and had been shot at close 
range. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government soldiers perpetrated the 
war crime of murder.  
</p>
<p>46. Government forces shelled Daraya from 20 to 24 August, targeting anti-Government 
armed group fighters. Following the shelling, Government forces moved into the town 
together with members of the <i>Shabbiha</i>. Many young men, some of whom may have been 
defectors or anti-Government armed group members who had put down their arms, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 A level 3 (L3) emergency is a major humanitarian crisis triggered by a natural disaster or conflict that 
</p>
<p>requires system-wide mobilization.

 HRC resolution 21/26, para. 19.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 Massacres include multiple instances of the war crime of murder, the war crime of attacking civilians, 
</p>
<p>and the war crime of sentencing or execution without due process. When murder is committed as part 
of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population, perpetrated pursuant to or 
in furtherance of a State or organizational policy, the commission of massacres may amount to the 
crime against humanity of murder.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 The massacre in Tremseh on 12 July, previously investigated by the commission, is included with 
</p>
<p>additional findings in annex IV. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>reportedly fled to an area referred to as &#8220;the gardens&#8221; (<i>Mazare</i>), where Government forces 
killed more than 100 people. Further accounts describe <i>Shabbiha</i> conducting house 
searches, looking for fighting-aged men. Bodies bearing clear signs of summary execution 
were later found in various shelters around Daraya. 
</p>
<p>47. Video footage and photographs of the aftermath of the events in Daraya show scores 
of bodies, including those of women and children. Syrian State media reported that Daraya 
had been &#8220;cleansed&#8221; of armed &#8220;terrorist&#8221; groups. There are reasonable grounds to believe 
that Government forces perpetrated the war crime of murder against hors de combat 
fighters and civilians taking no active part in hostilities, including women and children.  
</p>
<p>48. Multiple sources provided accounts of events that took place in Harak, Dara&#8217;a 
governorate between 18 and 26 August. After eight days of hostilities with the FSA, 
Government forces re-established control in the town. Local residents returned to Harak to 
find houses burned and bodies with injuries caused by shrapnel, close-range gunfire and 
severe knife wounds. Some bodies had been burned. Among the dead bodies were women 
and children. It is alleged that bodies were removed from Harak and buried in 52nd Brigade 
Headquarters of the Syrian army nearby. There are reasonable grounds to believe that 
Government forces and Government-affiliated militia committed the war crime of murder. 
</p>
<p>49. Based on first-hand accounts, Deir Baalbeh, Homs, was indiscriminately shelled 
between 22 and 24 December. In the course of confrontations between the FSA and 
Government forces, the latter trapped civilians in Deir Baalbeh, preventing their exit from 
the town and, in one instance, killing a family that attempted to flee. The sequence of 
events suggests that, in Deir Baalbeh, on 29 December, the civilian population was the 
object of an attack by Government forces, which amounted to a war crime. The commission 
notes that this is a violation concerning the conduct of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>50. On 7 January 2013, Government forces regained control of Al-Mastomah after 
indiscriminately shelling the town and after three days of clashes with the FSA. They 
entered the village and conducted house-to-house searches, executing civilians or persons 
hors de combat at close quarters. The video footage of those killed indicated that 
Government forces executed women, children and the elderly, thus committing the war 
crime of murder.  
</p>
<p>51. The investigations into massacres that are alleged to have taken place in Al 
Muhassan, Dayr az-Zawr in July, Sad Street in Dara&#8217;a city in August, and in Duma outside 
Damascus in October, are ongoing.  
</p>
<p>52. From the range of incidents identified, Government forces are responsible for war 
crimes and may be responsible for crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>53. Eyewitnesses making credible admissions against their own interest provided an 
account of a mass killing of the Al-Barri clan in Aleppo on 28 or 29 July 2012. In the 
context of hostilities, the FSA captured five members of the Al-Barri family, interrogated 
them and found them guilty of a range of crimes. The witness stated that a sharia court in 
Aleppo, a quasi-judicial body established by the FSA-affiliated Liwa al-Tawhid, had 
sentenced all five people to death. Their execution was filmed and the footage released on 
the Internet. An anti-Government armed group, probably Liwa al-Tawhid, perpetrated the 
war crime of sentencing and execution without due process. 
</p>
<p>54. An FSA fighter confirmed that he had been part of a brigade that had captured &#8220;five 
Alawites&#8221; on a road into al-Haffa in Latakia in late July, then had interrogated and executed 
them shortly afterwards. He stated that &#8220;Sunni captives were kept. Alawites were </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>executed.&#8221; In this instance, the FSA perpetrated the war crime of execution without due 
process. 
</p>
<p>55. Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions prohibits the passing of sentences and 
the carrying out of executions without a previous judgement pronounced by a regularly 
constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees that are recognized as indispensable 
under international law. 
</p>
<p>56. Investigations are ongoing into allegations that anti-Government armed groups 
summarily executed captured Government soldiers and affiliated militia members.  
</p>
<p>57. The above incidents indicate that anti-Government armed groups have committed 
war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other unlawful killing</b>12<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Unlawful killings, not falling within the above definition of massacres, continue to 
be recorded. Cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, contrary to international human rights 
law, such as extrajudicial or summary executions, were reported throughout the period 
under review, frequently overlapping with the war crime of murder. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>59. Many of those interviewed witnessed executions perpetrated by Government forces 
and affiliated militia first-hand. Others witnessed the aftermath, learned of the death from 
an eyewitness or were family members of those killed. Killings were recorded in Homs city 
(8 August), in an unnamed village close to Homs city (1&#8211;2 October) and Dahadeel (19 
October) in Homs; in Namer (3 October) and Musayfrah (28 October) in Dara&#8217;a; in Iblin 
(July) and Mare&#8217;a (23 August) in Idlib; and in Damascus (July). In all these cases, the 
killings took place in the context of house searches. 
</p>
<p>60. Government forces and affiliated militia committed extrajudicial executions, 
breaching international human rights law. This conduct also constitutes the war crime of 
murder. Where murder was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against 
a civilian population, pursuant to an organizational policy, it is a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>61. There were comparatively more reports of killings by anti-Government armed 
groups during the period under review. Most accounts emanated from Damascus and 
Aleppo governorates. Several of those interviewed also spoke about killings in Dara&#8217;a, 
Homs and Dayr az Zawr. 
</p>
<p>62. One of those interviewed was an eyewitness to a killing at a factory with a 
predominantly Christian workforce. In early September, members of an armed group 
entered the factory, shouting &#8220;We know who you are and which region you come from. We 
ask you to leave this factory and your region. Otherwise you will be in danger.&#8221; The 
director of the factory was then shot dead. Another eyewitness detailed the execution of 
pro-Government Sunnis by the Al-Omari brigade in villages outside Dara&#8217;a city. 
</p>
<p>63. As the State law enforcement and justice system have disintegrated in certain areas 
of the country, anti-Government armed groups have turned to traditional social structures, 
often based around religious institutions, to fill the vacuum. According to descriptions 
</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>GE.13-10627 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>received, these mechanisms do not meet international judicial standards as defined under 
international humanitarian law. Passing sentences or executing without due process is a war 
crime. 
</p>
<p>64. Anti-Government armed groups killed persons who were either hors de combat 
fighters or civilians taking no active part in hostilities, thereby committing the war crime of 
murder. Such killings also breach international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and detention</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. Incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention continued apace despite their international 
legal prohibition. Hostage-taking for ransom or exchange by armed groups was also 
recorded. State personnel must, at a minimum, inform an arrestee of the reasons for their 
arrest, bring the person promptly before a judge and provide them with an opportunity to 
challenge the lawfulness of detention.  
</p>
<p>66. Both State and non-State actors choosing to detain persons during armed conflict 
must treat them humanely, avoiding any cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. No party 
may take hostages. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>67. Five men who worked as guards at official detention centres prior to defecting 
conveyed details of Government strategies and means of arbitrary arrest. Suspects were 
seized during house searches, military operations or immediately following demonstrations. 
They were taken to detention centres and tortured to reveal information on others possibly 
involved in the opposition. The information gathered through these coercive techniques was 
used to compile lists of future arrestees. 
</p>
<p>68. Twenty-two persons were victims of arbitrary arrest. They were held 
incommunicado for extended periods without their families being notified. They were 
forced to pay bribes for their release, and were held solely for the purpose of extracting 
information or to force others to surrender. No interviewee reported being informed of the 
reasons for their arrest.  
</p>
<p>69. Others reported being taken before a judge and being given an order for release. In 
eight cases, however, those interviewed stated that their family members had paid bribes to 
secure their release. One defector who had worked for an intelligence branch in Hama 
stated &#8220;Detainees pay money to secure their release. It is a systematic practice in Syria 
nowadays. Arresting people is done very often for this particular purpose.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>70. Security forces holding one former Latakia resident stated to his brother through 
intermediaries that, &#8220;unless you surrender, your brother will remain in detention&#8221;. Multiple 
accounts corroborated the practice of arresting someone else in the family if the person 
wanted was not at home. 
</p>
<p>71. Official statistics on the number of detainees and detention centres have yet to be 
provided by the Government. It did provide information concerning the release of 2,289 
persons detained during the period under review.  
</p>
<p>72. Government forces arbitrarily arrested and detained individuals in violation of 
international law. They held people without charge and without a legal basis, exacting 
bribes for their release. Arresting people on the basis of information obtained by torture

<p><b>14</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>undermines the legality of the arrest. To the extent that these violations amount to 
inhumane treatment, they violate international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>73. Anti-Government armed groups increasingly apprehended members of Government 
forces, &#8220;informants&#8221; and their family members. Although access to victims was limited, 
multiple accounts of armed groups taking hostages solely for ransom or exchange were 
investigated.  
</p>
<p>74. In August 2012, 48 Iranian citizens were apprehended by the Al-Bara brigades in 
Damascus. The Islamic Republic of Iran asserted that the men were pilgrims, while the 
armed group claimed they were members of the Revolutionary Guard of the Islamic 
Republic. The men were allegedly threatened with execution unless the Government 
released detainees. Such a threat constitutes hostage taking, a war crime. 
</p>
<p>75. A former resident of Damascus living near Sayyidah Zaynab stated that &#8220;the FSA do 
the same [as the army]. They also arrest and detain people. The FSA would only arrest 
&#8216;informants&#8217;. We don&#8217;t know what happened to them. They&#8217;d take them away and we&#8217;d 
never see them again.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>76. Anti-Government armed groups apprehended persons solely for ransom or 
exchange, which is a war crime. To the extent that they inflict cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment on the detainees, such groups violate international humanitarian 
law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearance</b>14<b> 
</b></p>
<p>77. One of the most insidious aspects of the Syrian conflict is the disappearance of 
thousands of people from their homes, at checkpoints and from the street, as they go about 
their daily lives.  
</p>
<p>78. While the Syrian Arab Republic is not a party to the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, it is a party to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, provisions 
of which are infringed by enforced disappearance. Enforced disappearance places its 
victims outside the law, violating their right to recognition as a person before the law, to 
liberty and security and freedom from arbitrary detention. It is often a gateway to the 
commission of further crimes, such as torture.  
</p>
<p>79. The investigation of enforced disappearance is often particularly difficult because 
families &#8212; living in hope that their relatives will be safely returned to them &#8212; do not wish 
to provide names and other details of disappeared persons. Lack of access to the Syrian 
Arab Republic hindered further investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>80. There were multiple reports of enforced disappearance committed by Government 
forces and affiliated militia. No information was provided to families who enquired about 
their relatives&#8217; whereabouts. Relatives of some detainees who approached officials were 
themselves arrested, justifying a fear in others who might undertake similar enquiries. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 See also annex VII.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>81. The whereabouts of many victims remain unknown. In cases where the relative was 
returned to his family, those interviewed indicated that the relative had been tortured, and in 
one case raped, while detained. In three cases, families later received the bodies of their 
relatives. 
</p>
<p>82. Government forces have engaged in enforced disappearance in violation of their 
international legal obligations. Where committed as part of a widespread or systematic 
attack against a civilian population, such disappearances constitute crimes against 
humanity. 
</p>
<p>83. There was insufficient information to make a finding with regard to affiliated militia. 
Investigations are ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>84. One person reported that an anti-Government armed group had perpetrated an act of 
enforced disappearance. Families whose relatives had been arrested or abducted by armed 
groups have likely remained in the Syrian Arab Republic. While interviews are conducted 
by means of telephone and Skype, contacting families inside the country remains a 
challenge. 
</p>
<p>85. Although anti-Government armed groups are per se not a party to the Convention, 
their actions may be assessed against customary international legal principles, and they are 
subject to criminal liability for enforced disappearance amounting to a crime against 
humanity.  
</p>
<p>86. There was insufficient information to make a finding with regard to anti-
Government armed groups and enforced disappearance. Investigations are ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>87. Under international human rights and humanitarian law, torture and other forms of 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited. Such conduct is a war 
crime. Torture and other inhumane acts may also constitute crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>88. Numerous reports were received of the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
by Government forces and affiliated militia. The majority described abuses during 
interrogations by intelligence agencies.  
</p>
<p>89. Many reporting torture and other forms of ill-treatment in official detention centres 
were detained in intelligence agencies in Damascus and Aleppo. Several described being 
tortured in Military Security Branch 235, also known as &#8220;Palestine branch&#8221;, in Damascus. 
Almost all those who detailed torture in Aleppo governorate indicated that their relatives 
were held at the Air Force Intelligence branch in Aleppo city.  
</p>
<p>90. Others described torture at the military security facility in Izra, Dara&#8217;a, and in Homs 
city; at Military Security Branch 215, in Damascus; the political intelligence facility in 
Hama; and the Military Security and Air Force Intelligence branch in Latakia city. Some 
had undergone multiple interrogations and assaults while being transferred between 
detention centres and governorates. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 See also annex VIII.  </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>91. Methods of torture, detailed by the commission in previous reports, remained 
consistent across the country. For many, scars and wounds, consistent with their accounts, 
were still visible.  
</p>
<p>92. Abuses were also reported in unofficial detention centres. People were physically 
assaulted by soldiers in locations such as shops or schools before their transfer to an 
intelligence agency. Others described perpetrators as members of the <i>Shabbiha</i> from nearby 
&#8220;Alawite&#8221; or &#8220;Shia&#8221; locales.  
</p>
<p>93. Multiple reports were received of people beaten at checkpoints, particularly in 
Dara&#8217;a and Latakia governorates. Others described assaults inside military barracks. 
</p>
<p>94. Several people reported being beaten or witnessing the beating of others during 
house searches. There are corroborated reports of men beaten and killed by soldiers during 
house searches in Mare&#8217;a, Idlib, between 23 and 28 August, as well as in villages in Dara&#8217;a, 
in October. Reports were also received of individuals beaten during house searches in Jabal 
Al-Zawiya in Idlib (July), Saqba in Damascus (July), Qastal Ma&#8217;af and other Turkmen 
villages in Latakia (early September) and the Al-Ghadam area of Damascus (December). 
</p><p>95. It is of grave concern that, in the majority of cases reported, beatings were a prelude 
to executions.  
</p>
<p>96. Detainees were held in overcrowded cells, some of which were underground. None 
received medical care during detention. There were two reports of detainees dying in cells 
from their injuries. Most were provided with inadequate food and water, with one stating 
that he and other detainees drank their own urine to survive. The accounts, if verified, 
would breach the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. 
</p>
<p>97. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
were perpetrated by Government forces and affiliated militia as part of a widespread attack 
directed against a civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of an organizational 
policy. Torture in official detention centres is also part of a systematic attack on a civilian 
population. Torture and other inhumane acts as crimes against humanity were committed. 
Such conduct is also prosecutable as a war crime. 
</p>
<p>98. Intelligence agencies, in particular Military, Political and Air Force Intelligence, are 
primarily responsible for torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>99. The conditions of detention described would, if verified, constitute cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>100. Credible reports were received indicating that Government soldiers or members of 
affiliated militia were tortured while detained by anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>101. Several interviews centred on the treatment of captured Government soldiers and 
members of the <i>Shabbiha</i> (or those perceived to belong to local <i>Shabbiha</i> groups) in 
Aleppo governorate. Methods of torture included beating with electric wires and sticks. In 
one case, a man detained with 54 others in a house in Aleppo stated that he had seen 8 
detainees die from their injuries. Others had sustained severe injuries, including broken 
bones, during their interrogations. An FSA commander in Damascus stated that he had 
beaten a detainee in order to get him to &#8220;confess&#8221;. The detainee was later executed. 
</p>
<p>102. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
were committed by anti-Government armed groups during interrogations of captured 
members of Government forces and those they believe to be members of the <i>Shabbiha</i>.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>103. Torture and other inhumane acts were not committed as part of either a widespread 
or systematic attack on the civilian population. Although they do not constitute crimes 
against humanity as such, they are prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual Violence</b>16<b> 
</b></p>
<p>104. Direct accounts of sexual violence were sought from victims and eyewitnesses. 
Further interviews were conducted with organizations and individuals who assisted or were 
likely to have assisted victims of sexual violence. Limited weight was given to hearsay 
accounts of sexual violence, though many such accounts were received.  
</p>
<p>105. The particular difficulties of collecting evidence of sexual violence against women 
and girls are detailed in annex IX. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>106. Sexual violence was perpetrated in two distinct contexts: against women by 
Government forces and affiliated militia (usually described as members of the <i>Shabbiha</i>) 
during house searches and at checkpoints; and against men and women in detention centres, 
where it was used as a means to extract information during interrogations, as well as to 
humiliate and punish.  
</p>
<p>107. Sexual violence was also used as a means to coerce male relatives fighting with anti-
Government armed groups to surrender themselves in return for the release of the detainee. 
Methods of sexual violence and torture consisted of rape, electrocution of genitals by live 
wires and the burning of the genitals by cigarettes, lighters or melted plastic. 
</p>
<p>108. Children were also victims of sexual violence. A 14-year-old girl was raped and 
otherwise brutalized in an unofficial detention centre in Idlib. 
</p>
<p>109. In the context of detention centres, rape and other inhumane acts were perpetrated as 
part of a widespread attack directed against a civilian population, pursuant to or in 
furtherance of an organizational policy. This conduct was also perpetrated as part of a 
systematic attack on a civilian population. Rape and other inhumane acts, as crimes against 
humanity, were committed by Government forces and affiliated militia. Rape, torture and 
inhuman treatment are also prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p>110. Sexual violence, including rape, was committed against women and girls during 
house searches and checkpoints by Government forces and affiliated militia. The searches, 
which often followed aerial bombardments, were military operations constituting an attack 
on the civilian population. Rapes and other acts of sexual violence, which formed part of 
the attack or which were intended to be part of the attack, are crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>111. On the basis of the limited information received, it was not possible to reach a 
finding concerning crimes of sexual violence committed by anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16

<p><b>18</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> G. Violations of children&#8217;s rights</b>17<b> 
</b></p>
<p>112. During the last six months of the period under review, children faced widespread 
violation of their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>113. Children have been denied special protections afforded in international law requiring 
them to be detained separately from adults, and which orients their detention towards 
rehabilitation. Children as young as 8 years old were imprisoned with adults. The 
conditions amounted to inhuman treatment. Children were also tortured and some may have 
died as a result.  
</p>
<p>114. Government attacks on more than 17 schools were documented. Anti-Government 
forces were present in some instances. Hospital admission wards denied treatment to 
children wounded in hostilities, and doctors were coerced to inform on the children.  
</p>
<p>115. Official Syrian conscription systems are disintegrating. Children under 18 years of 
age are seized at checkpoints, and Government-affiliated militia use sectarian affiliation, 
kinship systems and cash to fill their ranks. These methods may have led to the recruitment 
of underage soldiers. Children are used as informers; both sides punish &#8220;informants&#8221; with 
judicial or extrajudicial execution. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>116. Anti-Government armed groups frequently use schools as barracks or offices. These 
occupations are not always justified by military necessity, and have spread the belief that 
schools are not safe. More than 2,400 of the 20,000 schools in the Syrian Arab Republic 
have been damaged by military operations. Thousands more have been converted into 
shelters for displaced persons, undermining access to education. 
</p>
<p>117. Anti-Government armed groups enlist volunteers under 18 years of age. Children 
have been used in combat and have undertaken other active roles. Some armed groups use 
children as guards, potentially drawing them into ill-treatment of detainees. An 
uncorroborated video apparently showed a child associated with an anti-Government armed 
group beheading a prisoner.  
</p>
<p>118. Detention facilities controlled by anti-Government armed groups hold children 
together with adults.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations in the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks</b>18<b> 
</b></p>
<p>119. The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has evolved into a war of attrition that has 
increasingly put civilians at risk. Urban areas have come under indiscriminate attack. 
During the reporting period, Damascus suffered aerial bombardment for the first time since 
the beginning of the conflict. Anti-Government armed groups conduct their operations from 
within densely populated civilian areas, putting civilians in the line of fire and forcing them 
to flee their homes. Government forces conduct their military operations in disregard of the

<p>GE.13-10627 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>distinction between civilians and persons directly participating in hostilities. Insider 
accounts collected from high-ranking defectors from Government forces indicate that 
military commanders had given orders to directly target civilians and the civilian 
population as such. 
</p>
<p>120. The dynamics of the conflict have become increasingly complex. The war has 
become coloured by sectarianism, permeated by opportunistic criminality and aggravated 
by the presence of foreign fighters and extremist groups. The lack of access to the Syrian 
Arab Republic has significantly hampered investigations in to the conduct of hostilities by 
anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>121. Incidents of indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardment were recorded across 
Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a, Damascus, Idlib, Dayr az Zawr, Hama, Homs, Al-Hasakah and Latakia 
governorates. 
</p>
<p>122. In Aleppo, Hama and Dayr az Zawr, bakery queues were targeted, resulting in the 
death and injury of civilians, including women and children. Attacks were often conducted 
in the morning when the concentration of civilians was highest or just before iftar, the 
breaking of the fast during Ramadan. In most cases, bakery queues were attacked the day 
after flour was delivered to the bakery following a protracted shortage. 
</p>
<p>123. The aerial bombardment of densely populated urban areas, such as Azaz, has been 
corroborated by satellite imagery (see annex XI, figures 1&#8211;3). Defector accounts indicate 
that certain cities and towns were deliberately targeted in an indiscriminate manner. Those 
carrying out attacks on civilian areas exhibited a disregard for the loss of civilian life. In 
some incidents, such as in the assault on Harak, indiscriminate shelling was followed by 
ground operations during which Government forces perpetrated mass killing. 
</p>
<p>124. Several instances were documented in which it is clear that civilians were the object 
of attack. Government forces fired on civilian gatherings, such as funeral processions. 
During the attack on Al-Habit, Idlib, on 28 July, army helicopters fired at the streets of the 
town in order to prevent movement, killing civilians attempting to escape the shelling. On 9 
November, the air force shelled the market of Al Quriyah village on women&#8217;s market day, 
killing 21 civilians, including 19 women. 
</p>
<p>125. Entire neighbourhoods of suburban Damascus were shelled and destroyed by 
Government forces. A defector from a special forces branch of the infantry that operated in 
Damascus stated that his commander considered all areas in which the FSA and other anti-
Government armed groups operated to be &#8220;areas supportive of terrorists&#8221;. In attacking 
Zabadani, the commander allegedly gave orders to &#8220;destroy the town&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>126. As a result of such unrestrained violence, hundreds of thousands of civilians fled 
their homes. Taftanaz, a city subject to intense bombardment, was described by former 
residents as &#8220;a ghost city&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>127. The bombardment of bread lines and bakeries amounts to violence aimed at 
spreading terror among the civilian population, in violation of customary international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>128. Insiders stated that the air force targeted areas that were perceived to be supportive 
of the opposition &#8220;as a kind of punishment&#8221;. If confirmed, individuals who order attacks 
against civilians would be individually criminally responsible for the war crime of attacking 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>129. Indiscriminate and widespread shelling, the regular bombardment of cities, mass 
killing, indiscriminate firing on civilian targets, firing on civilian gatherings and a </p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>protracted campaign of shelling and sniping on civilian areas have characterized the 
conduct of the Government. Syrian armed forces have implemented a strategy that uses 
shelling and sniper fire to kill, maim, wound and terrorize the civilian inhabitants of areas 
that have fallen under anti-Government armed group control. Shelling and sniper fire by 
Government forces have killed and wounded civilians of both sexes and all ages, including 
children and the elderly. The attacks amount to war crimes and appear to constitute a 
campaign against civilians in anti-Government armed group-controlled areas, which may 
amount to crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>130. Anti-Government armed groups claimed responsibility for five bombings in Aleppo 
and Damascus documented during the reporting period. The use of improvised explosive 
devices, suicide bombers and car bombs has spread throughout the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>131. There is reason to believe that anti-Government armed groups regularly use civilian 
objects such as schools for bases, accommodation or meeting points, exposing civilians to 
the dangers of war. 
</p>
<p>132. Aleppo has been divided between Government forces and anti-Government armed 
groups, with both parties positioning snipers on top of buildings and at the entry to main 
roads to control the movement of people. Snipers regularly fired at civilians. In the 
incidents examined, it is evident that the conduct of those injured ought to have led to the 
presumption of their civilian status. 
</p>
<p>133. By operating from within civilian objects, anti-Government armed groups endanger 
the civilian population and violate their obligation under international humanitarian law to 
avoid positioning military objectives within or near densely populated areas, to the extent 
feasible. The use of snipers to control the movement of people and assert control over areas 
has caused considerable civilian casualties as snipers fail to distinguish between civilians 
and those participating in hostilities. The targeting of individuals from concealed positions 
in urban areas imbues the civilian population with terror. Staging attacks with improvised 
explosive devices in predominantly civilian areas spreads terror among the civilian 
population and is in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, amounting to the 
war crime of attacking civilians. Investigations relating to the conduct of hostilities by anti-
Government armed groups are ongoing.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>134. There has been an increase in attacks in which no parties claim responsibility and 
which do not appear to have any military or strategic objective, beyond the primary purpose 
of spreading terror among the civilian population. Of particular concern are attacks that 
may foment sectarian tensions. Such attacks are not motivated by any military or strategic 
gain, but rather by a general disregard for human life. It has become increasingly evident 
that the proliferation of foreign fighters and extremist groups has altered the character of 
the conflict. More than ten incidents were documented in which improvised explosive 
devices, whether body- or vehicle-borne, were set off in minority neighbourhoods or in the 
vicinity of religious sites. 
</p>
<p>135. Owing to the proliferation of armed factions in the Syrian conflict, there has been an 
increase in acts of unrestrained violence, which are clearly intended to spread terror among 
the civilian population. The perpetrators of such acts cannot always be determined. Such 
conduct is in violation of the rules and customs of international humanitarian law and may 
heighten sectarian tensions. This trend risks becoming a malignant feature of the conflict. 
</p>
<p>136. While these may be crimes in domestic law, they may also amount to war crimes 
where the perpetrators are parties to the conflict. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Specifically protected persons and objects</b>19<b> 
</b>137. Escalating violence in densely populated urban areas has increasingly affected 
persons and objects specifically protected under the laws of armed conflict. 
138. The deliberate targeting of medical personnel and hospitals, and the denial of 
medical access have been one of the most alarming features of the conflict, and continued 
unabated throughout the period under review.  
</p>
<p>139. Hospitals and medical personnel, journalists and cultural property have been treated 
as military objectives by both sides to the conflict and viewed in terms of strategic gain.  
</p><p>140. The satellite imagery examined showed the extensive destruction of hospitals in 
densely populated urban areas, as well as munitions craters, barricades and debris in areas 
around hospitals in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>141. During the period under review, State hospitals, field hospitals and medical units 
across Aleppo, Damascus, Idlib and Dayr az Zawr came under attack, often repeatedly.  
</p>
<p>142. Government forces have attacked hospitals in which wounded FSA members were 
receiving treatment. This pattern was observed in the attacks on Al-Huda hospital in 
Sbeneh in September, on Al-Saeed hospital in Al-Arfi, Dayr az Zawr between July and 
November and Tafas, Dara&#8217;a, in December.  
</p>
<p>143. Medical personnel came under attack. In early September, a medical emergency 
worker was hit by sniper fire in Aleppo while in medical uniform with the Red Crescent 
emblem. Around the same time in Aleppo, snipers targeted an ambulance that was 
evacuating wounded hors de combat FSA fighters. In Dara&#8217;a, an ambulance driver was 
arrested at a Government checkpoint and tortured to death. In Damascus governorate, a 
physician was detained, tortured and tried for having given medical care to anti-
Government armed groups and civilians in opposition areas. 
</p>
<p>144. In Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a, Damascus and Hama, wounded and sick persons were refused 
treatment on sectarian or political grounds, or avoided seeking treatment in Government-
administered hospitals owing to a well-founded fear of arrest and torture. Consistent 
accounts indicate that, in Dara&#8217;a and Homs, snipers positioned at checkpoints in front of 
hospitals impeded access to treatment.  
</p>
<p>145. Dar Al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo was repeatedly targeted during the period under 
review. These attacks caused death and injury to civilians present in the hospital, 
significantly damaged its infrastructure and substantially reduced the hospital&#8217;s ability to 
treat patients. Attacks on hospitals in Aleppo appear to constitute part of a campaign against 
civilians in anti-Government armed group-controlled areas.  
</p>
<p>146. Hospitals and medical units were deliberately targeted by Government forces to gain 
military advantage by depriving anti-Government armed groups and those perceived to 
support them of medical assistance. Government forces committed the war crime of 
attacking protected objects and the war crime of attacking objects or persons using the 
distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions.

<p><b>22</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>147. Anti-Government armed groups have taken medical supplies and equipment from 
Government-administered hospitals, possibly for use in field hospitals. In one incident, the 
National Military Hospital in Homs was destroyed when it was incorrectly identified as a 
military objective. Such attacks are in violation of the law of armed conflict and amount to 
the war crime of attacking protected objects.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Cultural property 
</b></p>
<p>148. Cultural property in the Syrian Arab Republic, such as the ancient city of Bosra, 
classified a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization, has been used for military purposes by Government forces and subsequently 
attacked by anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>149. In Aleppo, the historic souk was burned in October, when the Umayyad mosque and 
Saint Kevork Church were also significantly damaged. Looters broke into one of the 
world&#8217;s best-preserved Crusader castles, Krak des Chevaliers. Artifacts in museums in 
Palmyra, Bosra and Homs were looted while ruins in the ancient city of Palmyra were 
damaged.  
</p>
<p>150. All parties to the conflict have an obligation under international humanitarian law, in 
particular the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
Conflict, to respect cultural property and to take special care to avoid any damage to 
cultural property in the context of military operations. 
</p>
<p>151. In instances where buildings dedicated to religion or historic monuments have been 
the intended object of attack and were not military objectives, the war crime of attacking 
protected objects has been committed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Pillaging and destruction of property</b>20<b> 
</b></p>
<p>152. Appropriating property for private or personal use (pillaging) in the context of an 
armed conflict is a war crime.21 Deliberately destroying the property of an adversary in the 
absence of military necessity is illegal under international humanitarian law. Instances of 
both violations were recorded during the period under review.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>153. Government forces and affiliated militia intentionally destroyed the homes and 
businesses of suspected anti-Government members and supporters during raids. Overt 
destruction included burning, explosions and inflicting damage beyond repair. Looting was 
a frequent precursor to destruction. 
</p>
<p>154. The above pattern was recorded in Bosra, Lihraq and Mhajjah, in Dara&#8217;a, in October 
</p><p>2012. The same pattern was reported in August, in Qastal Ma&#8217;af, a village in Latakia, by 
&#8220;popular committees&#8221;. In Dahadeel, Damascus, on 19 October, a witness saw his 
neighbour&#8217;s house burned by Government forces. In Kanshikam village, Idlib, a former 
police officer stated that soldiers &#8220;stole his valuables and destroyed everything else&#8221;. In 
November, Government forces and affiliated militia entered Tafas, in Dara&#8217;a, and burned a 
number of houses and shops.  
</p>

 Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(e)(v).  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>155. Government forces and affiliated militia have perpetrated the war crime of pillaging. 
They also deliberately burned and destroyed property believed to belong to opposition 
members or supporters, thereby committing destruction of property of an adversary. Human 
rights provisions relating to the right to privacy and home were violated.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>156. No first-hand accounts of anti-Government armed groups appropriating property for 
their own use were received. Second-hand accounts, reports from Governments, video 
footage and other materials provided evidence of looting. It was unclear whether the goods 
taken were for personal gain or to support the opposition&#8217;s war effort. Looting by 
individuals or gangs not party to the conflict was not investigated. 
</p>
<p>157. On 7 January 2013, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic provided a 
note verbale briefly describing looting by &#8220;armed gangs&#8221; in Aleppo (see annex I). Attempts 
to reach sources inside the Syrian Arab Republic to verify the allegations were 
unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>158. No legal finding with respect to acts by anti-Government armed groups was possible 
owing to difficulties in determining whether the appropriations were by a party to the 
conflict or for personal gain.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Razing 
</b></p>
<p>159. The commission documented three instances of razing in urban locations in the 
Syrian Arab Republic. Typically, after shelling and bombarding an area, Government 
forces bulldozed civilian homes and shops. 
</p>
<p>160. In July 2012, 300 homes were destroyed by explosives and bulldozers in Al-
Tadamon, Damascus. The razing followed shelling, which had caused the residents to flee. 
Anti-Government groups may have staged attacks from Al-Tadamon. Satellite imagery 
showed approximately 1,000 structures destroyed. Qaboon, north of Damascus, and Hey el 
Arbeen in Hama (October), experienced the same (see annex XIII, figures 1 and 2).  
</p><p>161. The Government justified the above-mentioned demolitions as pre-existing urban 
plans to remove illegal buildings. 
</p>
<p>162. Customary international humanitarian law obliges parties to a conflict to prevent 
displacement and to respect the right of displaced persons to return to their homes. The 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic may be violating these obligations with respect to 
the right of return of displaced persons. These issues require further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Accountability</b>22<b> 
</b></p>
<p>163. In conferring the commission&#8217;s mandate, the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 21/26, sought to hold to account those responsible for violations and abuses of 
international law. 
</p>
<p>164. Crimes against humanity, breaches of international humanitarian law and gross 
human rights violations have been perpetrated in the Syrian Arab Republic. As noted in 
previous reports, States are responsible for violations of international human rights law 
attributable to its agents.23 Individuals may also bear criminal responsibility for perpetrating

<p><b>24</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>the crimes identified in the present report. Where possible, individuals in leadership 
positions who may be responsible were identified alongside those who physically carried 
out the acts. A list of individuals and units believed to be responsible will be conveyed by 
the commission to the High Commissioner at the end of its mandate. Collected materials 
may also be made available where consent and protection matters are properly addressed.  
</p>
<p>165. Possible accountability mechanisms invoking criminal prosecution are set out in 
annex XIV to the present report, each of which bears its own strengths and weaknesses. 
Truth commissions, forms of restorative justice, or other Syria-led processes could be 
considered at a later stage.  
</p>
<p>166. The Government retains the primary role in this respect, but it has yet to demonstrate 
the willingness or the ability to fulfil this imperative. In the absence of national action in 
this regard, it is incumbent upon the Security Council, influential Member States and 
regional organizations to act urgently to ensure accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>167. <b>The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic is deteriorating rapidly, with untold 
suffering and widespread disarray among the population. There is an evident 
escalation of the armed conflict between the Government and anti-Government armed 
groups. This situation is aggravated by increased sectarianism.</b> 
</p>
<p>168. <b>Another key concern is the radicalization of the conflict owing to the growing 
presence of foreign fighters. The conflict is becoming more militarized because of the 
proliferation of weapons and types of weapons used (see annex XV). It is regrettably 
the civilian population that suffers most. 
</b></p>
<p>169. <b>The commission is especially aware of the need for a comprehensive framework 
based upon humanitarian considerations for all parties. First, it is important to insist 
that there is no military solution to the conflict. A sustained cessation of hostilities 
remains of paramount importance to end the violence and gross human rights 
violations and abuses. 
</b></p>
<p>170. <b>Second, there is no alternative to a political solution. A key document that 
would enable such a solution is the final communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria of 
June 2012 (A/66/865-S/2012/522). The commission reiterates that the best solution 
continues to be a negotiated settlement involving an inclusive and meaningful dialogue 
among all parties, leading to a political transition that reflects the legitimate 
aspirations of all segments of Syrian society, including ethnic and religious minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>171. <b>Third, the shared responsibility of the international community and the various 
actors in the country should be underlined in the search for peace and the 
commitment to international human rights and humanitarian law. This complements, 
and is complemented by, the State&#8217;s responsibility to protect its population. 
</b></p>
<p>172. <b>Fourth, the issue of accountability for those responsible for international 
crimes deserves to be raised in a more robust manner to counter the pervasive sense of 
impunity in the country.  
</b></p>
<p>173. <b>Fifth, there is a need to ensure and enlarge the humanitarian space based upon 
the principles of impartiality and neutrality in the country and in neighbouring 
countries affected by the spillover of the conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>174. <b>The commission renews the recommendations made in previous reports, in 
particular those set out below.  </b></p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>175. <b>The commission of inquiry recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support the peace process for the country based upon the final 
communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria and the work of the Joint Special 
Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Curb the proliferation and supply of weapons, and address the sources 
thereof, bearing in mind the regional implications and related responsibility in the 
vicinity and beyond; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Enhance the humanitarian space based on assistance and protection for 
the victims and respect for international human rights and humanitarian law, 
facilitated by effective technical, financial and other support; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Address the challenge of radicalization of the conflict, taking into 
account the various actors and constituencies bearing on the situation. 
</b></p>
<p>176. <b>The commission recommends that the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Participate in and help to propel the peace process based upon the final 
communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria; 
 (b) Abide by international human rights and humanitarian law, bearing in 
mind that the State is a party to most of the international human rights treaties and a 
broad range of humanitarian law treaties, and grant the international community 
access to the affected areas to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Assist and protect the victims, underlining the fact that rules of 
engagement in an armed conflict, based on international law, should be implemented 
effectively and that indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population are forbidden; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure the accountability of those who violate international human 
rights and humanitarian law, including through effective and accessible national 
justice systems, and provide redress for victims based on international standards;  
 (e) Allow the commission to have access to the country. 
</b>177. <b>The commission recommends that anti-Government armed groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Abide by human rights law and humanitarian law, commit effectively to 
rules of conduct in line with international standards, and participate in the peace 
process; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Allow access by humanitarian actors to help those in need of assistance; 
 (c) Recall that indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population are 
forbidden; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure the accountability of those who violate international human 
rights and humanitarian law, and provide effective redress for victims based on 
international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Detach themselves from the foreign fighters, particularly extreme 
elements that fail to comply with international human rights and humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>178. <b>The commission recommends that OHCHR consolidate a presence in the region 
to strengthen efforts to promote and protect human rights in the Syrian Arab 
Republic. 
</b></p>
<p>179. <b>The commission recommends that the Human Rights Council: </b></p>


<p><b>26</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Support the recommendations made by the commission, including 
through transmission of the present report to the Secretary-General for the attention 
of the Security Council in order that appropriate action may be taken in the light of 
the deteriorating situation, and through a formal reporting process to the General 
Assembly and to the Security Council, bearing in mind the added value of the United 
Nations as an impartial body committed to human rights and the rule of law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Underline the need to implement international human rights and 
humanitarian law effectively in all situations and by all parties to the conflict;

the national and international levels, in addition to other channels to promote truth 
and reconciliation, and social recovery and reintegration of victims. 
</b></p>
<p>180. <b>The commission recommends that the Security Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support its recommendations; 
 (b) In the light of the gravity of the violations and crimes perpetrated by 
Government forces and anti-Government groups, take appropriate action and commit 
to human rights and the rule of law by means of referral to justice, possibly to the 
International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that, in the context of the Syrian Arab 
Republic, only the Security Council is competent to refer the situation to the Court; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Enhance the enforcement and implementation of international human 
rights and humanitarian law through the range of powers and measures at its 
disposal, including to address effectively the violations of the rights of the child, 
particularly in relation to the impact of armed conflicts on children and their 
involvement in hostilities.</b> </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Military situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. General situation 
</b>1. During recent months, the Syrian conflict has continuously escalated, albeit 
unequally, reaching new levels of violence and spreading to new regions. Armed clashes 
between Government forces and anti-Government armed groups have intensified along 
with the involvement of multiple actors in what is becoming a protracted civil war. Levels 
of violence have varied geographically due to the interplay of a number of factors, in 
particular the sectarian composition of the affected areas and the armed groups&#8217; operational 
capabilities.  
</p>
<p>2. Violence has particularly increased in and around major cities, in particular 
Damascus and Aleppo, where recurring assaults by parties to the conflict have moved 
frontlines closer to the cities&#8217; centers but insubstantially. Whereas the Government 
remained in control of the southern and coastal governorates due to the heavy presence of 
military units and security services, anti-Government armed groups made substantial 
military gains in central and northern regions driving the Government out of parts of the 
territory and forcing it to cede the control of several localities, neighbourhoods and 
strategic intersections. Except for major towns, Government forces no longer try to 
recapture those areas considered as &#8220;liberated&#8221; by the opposition, instead causing extensive 
destruction through heavy artillery shelling and aerial bombardment. An escalation was 
also observed in north-eastern governorates, namely Al-Raqqah and Al-Hasakah, where 
Government forces have ceded control of several Kurdish localities to a Kurdish militia. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b>3. The Government, along with supporting militia, have progressively adopted a 
strategy based on &#8220;contraction&#8221; of its forces in facing the mounting insurgency threat. 
Whereas continuing to focus on securing control of major cities such as Aleppo and 
Damascus, they have besieged number of other restive localities with layers of security and 
limited their actions in the countryside to the shelling of areas under armed groups&#8217; 
influence.  
</p>
<p>4. The Syrian army ground operations have mostly taken place inside major towns like 
Hama and Idlib cities, or in the countryside of governorates that are still under the 
Government&#8217;s control such as Dara&#8217;a and Latakia. In central governorates such as Hama 
and Homs, army units have imposed prolonged blockades of towns located amongst areas 
under opposition influence purportedly to prevent the anti-Government armed groups from 
establishing in additional urban zones and to cut the insurgents from their potential popular 
support. Armed clashes have regularly taken place around these towns &#8212; like Khan 
Sheikhoun or Halfaya &#8212; between the army checkpoints and the insurgents operating in the 
surrounding countryside.  
</p>
<p>5. Opposition strongholds like Rastan, Zabadani and Maarat An Numan, have also 
been extensively besieged and shelled by army units in their attempt to limit the anti-
Government armed groups&#8217; geographical influence, cut their logistical lines, and prevent </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>them from geographically connecting with other localities held by other groups. Other areas 
such as Aleppo northern countryside, Dayr az Zawr southern countryside and Jabal Al-
Zawiya in Idlib were ceded to the opposition but continuously targeted by indiscriminate 
airstrikes.  
</p>
<p>6. Efforts were also engaged to reinforce army positions along Lebanese and Jordanian 
borders in an attempt to block the flows of weapons and fighters.  
</p>
<p>7. Disinclined to put overstrained troops into hazardous urban operations, the 
Government forces intensified its use of air force, artillery and mortars shelling. Intense and 
brutal bombing has targeted opposition strongholds as well as areas newly infiltrated by 
armed groups including in many cases intentional targeting of non-military facilities such 
as bakeries and gas stations. Different types of ammunition were used in the shelling 
including explosive barrels, cluster aerial bombs and artillery cluster shells. The 
commission documented the increased use of cluster ammunition by Government forces 
including since early December, artillery cluster shells fired by units equipped with BM-21 
Grad Multi Rocket Launchers near the cities of Idlib and Latamnah. No credible evidence 
of the use of chemical weapons was documented. 
</p>
<p>8. In comparison with the first half of 2012, defections have decreased likely due to the 
Government forces limited ground engagements, increased control of military and security 
personnel movements, and possible perception among potential defectors that the time for 
defection was over. As a direct consequence, proportion of civilians among insurgency 
ranks have augmented over 70 percent forcing their way to most leadership positions as 
well.  
</p>
<p>9. Some minority communities, notably Alawites and Christians, have formed armed 
self-defence groups supposedly to protect their neighbourhoods from anti-Government 
fighters by establishing checkpoints around their areas. Some of those local groups &#8212; also 
known as Popular Committees &#8212; were allegedly armed and equipped by the Government 
and have participated alongside Government forces in military operations in Damascus and 
Homs. Statements indicated that some of these groups were also supported by external 
sponsors in neighbouring countries. Armed clashes have occurred between these 
Committees and anti-Government armed groups in multi sectarian localities and 
neighbourhoods or cases where armed insurgents have reached areas inhabited by minority 
communities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Anti-Government armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>10. Despite its persistent fragmentation and inability to unify under a single command, 
the Syrian armed opposition has continued to mature into a fighting force increasingly able 
to challenge the State&#8217;s control of the country and to strike at strategic targets. During 
recent months, anti-Government armed groups have reached strategic regions and were able 
to challenge Government forces control of sensitive infrastructure such as oil fields, major 
highways, as well as military bases and airports. Unable to progress in key cities because of 
Government forces&#8217; airstrikes, anti-Government armed groups have recently started 
targeting the Government forces&#8217; main supply routes and fighting for control of bases and 
airports mainly across the north of the country. 
</p>
<p>11. In northern, eastern and central provinces, armed groups have extended their control 
over increasing swathes of territory due to, among other reasons, an increased access to 
efficient military assets allowing them to seriously challenge the army&#8217;s tactical superiority. 
Meanwhile, armed groups in the southern and coastal governorates have struggled to 
establish themselves and are able only to briefly attack isolated checkpoints and bases.  </p>


<p><b>40</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>11. Anti-Government armed groups have improved their access to weaponry, though 
those in the south tend to be less well armed. While important quantities of lethal military 
equipment were looted from army bases, weapons and ammunition have also been provided 
by external sources and smuggled in across borders with neighbouring countries in 
significant quantities and on an increasingly regular basis. Currently, most armed groups 
are equipped with individual light weapons and small arms, typical to any insurgency, and 
seem to benefit from an increased availability of munitions that allowed them in many 
occasions to sustain combat against the army for days. Some armed groups also possess 
mortars, heavy machine guns and heavy anti-aircraft machine guns. A few have obtained 
anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles though in limited quality and quantity but enough to 
affect Government forces&#8217; use of armoured vehicles and air assets.  
</p>
<p>12. Despite the numerous endeavours made to unify and structure the indeterminate 
number of anti-Government groups, the armed opposition is still largely fragmented and 
unable to coalesce behind a reliable leadership. Among these groups, the lines of separation 
between the Salafi, FSA and other armed groups are ambiguous with fighters shifting from 
one group to another based on the availability of funds and weapons.  
</p>
<p>13. Fragmentation of the armed opposition has been aggravated by &#8212; if not the result of 
&#8212; the fact that the financial and material external support delivered by different sponsors, 
instead of promoting integration, has been provided to different armed groups in exchange 
for rival loyalties. However, differences between the FSA and independent groups, Salafi or 
not, have not significantly hindered their cooperation. In general, they have collaborated 
and coordinated their actions in a pragmatic approach aiming at using all available forces to 
achieve the ultimate declared objective, namely the ousting of the regime. 
</p><p>14. The escalation of violence and increasing intervention of external sponsors has also 
led to radicalisation among the anti-Government armed groups, and the proportion of 
fighters with Salafi inclinations has augmented including local and foreign extremists. The 
financial support provided by donors not only strengthened Salafi factions but also pushed 
mainstream insurgents toward joining them due to their better ability to provide them with 
the necessary logistical supplies. Statements indicated that the level of the financial support 
provided by external conservative sponsors to an armed group depends on its operational 
efficiency, numbers of fighters and particularly its willingness to embrace Salafi ideology 
with the associated symbols and speech.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Free Syrian Army 
</b></p>
<p>15. The FSA has remained a brand name despite its leadership and supporters&#8217; efforts to 
create a central command and link it to regional and local command structures. Due to its 
inability to logistically sustain its followers, FSA leadership failed to produce and maintain 
a leadership hierarchy capable of uniting field commanders and units fighting under its 
banner. A new initiative sponsored by external supporters was launched on December in 
Antalya with the creation of the &#8220;Supreme Joint Military Command Council&#8221; and its 
General staff Committee led by Brigadier General Salim Idriss &#8212; promoted to Major 
General &#8212; and linked to five geographical regions regrouping major local revolutionary 
councils. It is still attempting, with limited success as of yet, to unify all opposition fighting 
forces and secure the loyalty of all local military and revolutionary councils. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Independent alliances  
</b></p>
<p>16. Besides the FSA, independent military alliances have managed to unify the efforts of 
several armed groups engaged in military operations in specific circumstances and areas. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>The Al-Tawhid Brigade which formed before the anti-Government armed groups&#8217; 
campaign in Aleppo represents the most advanced attempt yet in uniting local brigades 
under a single command hierarchy. Some others like the Union of Homs Rebels have even 
tried to establish a governance structure including military, security, judicial and 
administrative components to fill the gap left by Government authorities in &#8220;liberated 
areas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Salafi groups</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. Increasingly radical ideologies are gradually defining the character of the conflict. 
The accompanying radicalisation favours armed groups that openly adopt Salafism. The Al-
Nusra Front stands out among these groups due to its superior level of operational 
effectiveness and its use of more aggressive tactics clearly benefiting from better financial 
support. Other independent Salafi groups, like the Ahrar Al-Sham Battalions in Idlib and 
the Al-Islam Brigade in Damascus eastern suburbs have also attracted more radical 
elements of the opposition and subsequently gained more legitimacy among the opposition 
armed groups. 
</p>
<p>18. Foreign fighters constitute an important faction of the insurgency but their numbers 
and organisation are still hard to assess with accuracy. It is sure that they represent a small 
proportion within the anti-Government armed groups&#8217; ranks but their expertise and 
experience in matter of IEDs and insurgency warfare have brought a substantial 
contribution to the opposition&#8217;s tactical effectiveness. They have integrated armed groups 
all over the country and contributed to the radicalisation of anti-Government insurgents. 
According to several statements, foreign fighters are drawn from countries in the Middle 
East, North Africa and Central Asia, many from Libya, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, 
Iraq and Egypt.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other forces  
</b></p>
<p>19. The predominantly Kurdish areas of Syria have been marked by mounting tensions 
between the PYD and anti-Government armed groups. The newly created Kurdish Popular 
Protection Units, commonly known as the YPG, responsible for maintaining order and 
protecting the lives of residents in Kurdish neighbourhoods have captured most of the 
Kurdish towns in the North, as Syrian security forces withdrew without any major 
resistance. Since July, clashes have periodically erupted in Aleppo Kurdish neighbourhoods 
and other Kurdish towns between the YPG and the Free Syrian Army because of the latter&#8217;s 
intrusions into Kurdish territories.

 Salafi refers to a wide range of groups who adopt a literalist view of Sunni canonical texts. In Syria it

<p>often denotes groups who use that literalism to promote a militant activism against a ruling

</p>
<p><b>  Socioeconomic and humanitarian situation 
</b>1. The conflict in Syria is increasing in intensity and severity, particularly in major 
urban centres. It further exacerbates pre-existing long-term poverty and unemployment and 
directly impacts the ability of Syrians to realise their economic, social and cultural rights.a 
The onset of severe winter conditions, coupled with a growing displaced population and the 
increasing difficulty in delivery of humanitarian relief &#8212; including food and medical 
supplies and fuel &#8212; was cause for grave concern. With regard to livelihoods, vast areas of 
agricultural land have been destroyed in recent fighting leading to increased food 
insecurity.b In urban centres, the risk of epidemics and diseases is compounded by the 
destruction of civilian facilities and infrastructure, including housing, medical facilities, 
schools, power and water utilities.  
</p>
<p>2. Market distortions have led to sharp price increases in basic commodities, including 
for bread. During the past four months, inflation has reached unprecedented levels, 
exceeding 50 percent.c Despite the commission&#8217;s recommendations to the contrary, the 
sanctions regime remains intact and coping mechanisms among the general population and 
particularly communities hosting IDPs, are collapsing, leaving those trapped by and fleeing 
the conflict in appalling conditions. The hostilities prevent people from accessing basic 
necessities including food and water. The commission also documented Government 
targeting of food sources, such as bakeries.  
</p>
<p>3. The Syrian crisis presents a highly challenging humanitarian operational 
environment, given the proliferation of armed actors now operating inside Syria, the severe 
constraints on humanitarian access, the escalating security risks and attacks against 
humanitarian staff,d the urban context in which much of the fighting takes place, and the 
widespread human rights violations perpetrated. The impact of the crisis is felt in particular 
in neighbouring countries. The scope and scale of the conflict has increased significantly 
and continues to negatively affect and destabilise the region. There is an urgent need for all 
sides to enable such access, as well as to ensure a UN presence in the humanitarian field. 
</p>
<p>4. Protracted armed violence has led to thousands of internally displaced Syrians and 
others fleeing in increasing numbers to neighbouring countries. As of 6 January 2013, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 2 million 
people had been internally displaced. By 21 January, there were 671,262 Syrians registered 
as refugees or awaiting registration, in five neighbouring countries and North Africa

Egypt and 5,417 in North Africa.h 
</p>
<p>5. The situation for Syria&#8217;s 500,000 Palestine refugees is precarious. UNRWA, the UN 
Agency for Palestine refugees, estimates that 400,000 Palestine refugees across Syria are 
now in urgent need of assistance and 17,000 have approached UNRWA for assistance in 
Lebanon and there are reportedly 3300 in Jordan.i It is essential that the principle of non-
refoulement by neighbouring States be ensured. 
</p>
<p>6. The humanitarian situation has deteriorated alarmingly. The number of casualties is 
on the rise. In December, the OHCHR reported 60,000 deaths since March 2011 based on 
an external assessment of figures from six NGOsj and the Government. The latter places the 
number of casualties at 11,713. There is potential for further disaggregation of data from all 
sources. The number of deaths verified by the Commission from 1,391 interviews is 1,190. 
The intensification of violence in Damascus over recent weeks has severely impacted the 
Palestine refugee community, as about three-quarters of the community live in this area. 
Shelling and clashes in and around Yarmouk camp south of Damascus city forced most of 
the approximately 150,000 Palestine refugees living there to flee. Many are reported to 
have fled to other parts of Damascus and rural Damascus, while others have left for Homs 
and Lebanon.k 
</p>
<p>7. Syria&#8217;s education system has paid and continues to pay a heavy toll in the conflict. 
In December, the Syrian Ministry of Education informed its partners that about 1,468 
schools across the country are being used as collective centres hosting a large number of the 
two million people who have left their homes because of the current events, and that by 
now 2,362 schools are reported targeted, damaged or looted corresponding to more than 10 
percent of Syria&#8217;s total number of 22,000 public and private schools. The numbers of 
schools damaged or occupied by people who have left their homes continues to increase. 
The movement of affected students in perceived &#8220;safe&#8221; areas has strained schools&#8217; capacity, 
both in terms of physical capacity and schools&#8217; ability to provide quality education.l School 
attendances ranges from 38 to 100 percent across Government controlled areas and appears 
severely limited in opposition controlled areas and is cited as one of the reasons refugees 
leave the country. 
</p>
<p>8. In all neighbouring countries education for Syrian refugees remains a priority of host 
Governments and the international community.m 
</p>
<p>9. The Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP-January-to June 2013) 
launched in December, jointly with the revised Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) 
identifies damage and destruction to housing has one of the critical impacts of the current 
emergency in Syria. Accounts from Syrian interviewees demonstrated multiple reports of 
shortages of food, water, fuel, electricity, medicine and lack of shelter. The Commission

<p>Aleppo governorate documented accounts of medicine delivery being refused and denial of 
medical care. Furthermore, it documented Government forces attacking hospitals and field 
clinics and preventing physical access to hospitals by use of snipers.  
</p>
<p>10. The attacks on hospitals, medical units and personnel do not capture the 
compounded socio-economic cost of violence &#8211; health care staff leaving their posts, 
hospitals running out of supplies and vaccination campaign ceasing. These effects 
substantially limit access to health care for entire communities including the most 
vulnerable amongst the population, such as women, childrenn and the elderly.  
</p>
<p>11. On 7 January 2013, the commission received information from the Government 
stating that factories in the city of Aleppo had been deliberately looted or destroyed, in an 
attempt to destroy the Syrian industrial sector. The Government provided information on 
attacks by armed groups on warehouses of medical supplies and that medicines had been 
destroyed or sold overseas. The Government also provided information on destruction of 
agricultural crops and theft of grain from warehouses.o

<p>12. The sixth meeting of the Syrian Humanitarian Forum, held on 9 November,

community and appealed for urgent funds for aid operations. By 31 December, the two 
humanitarian assistance appeals for refugees in neighbouring countries and the internally 
displaced persons and others in need inside the Syrian Arab Republic were only 69% and 
55% funded respectively.p During December, the international community launched two 
appeals for four million people, to provide life-saving emergency assistance inside Syria 
and to refugees in neighbouring countries, UN humanitarian agencies and partners seek 
US$1.5 billion for interventions until 30 June.q In response to the Syrian refugee crisis, in

</p>
<p><b>  Unlawful killing: &#8220;massacres&#8221;</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 19 of resolution A/HRC/21/L.32, the Human Rights Council 
condemned in the strongest terms the increasing number of massacres taking place in Syria 
and requested the commission to investigate all massacres.b  
</p>
<p>2. The commission responded to the extended mandate by dedicating specific 
resources to the investigation. Considering the absence of a legal definition, the 
commission presents the following working definition of massacre.  
</p>
<p>3. A massacre is an intentional mass killing of civilians not directly participating in 
hostilities or hors de combat fighters by organized armed forces or groups in a single 
incident, in violation of international human rights or humanitarian law.c  
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Tremseh, 12 July 
</b></p>
<p>1. A massacre occurred in Tremseh, Hama, on 12 July, immediately prior to the current 
reporting period. Due to a lack of access to Syria, it was possible to collect more 
information only in the weeks and months following the massacre. The gravity of the 
events in Tremseh warrants its inclusion within this report.  
</p>
<p>2. The offensive of Tremseh appears to have been a Government intervention to root 
out anti-Government armed groups that had been involved in a series of tit-for-tat 
kidnappings with <i>Shabbiha</i>, reportedly from the neighbouring Alawite town of Al-
Safsafiyah. The operation was a continuation of a military campaign targeting populated 
urban areas north of Hama city, such as Khan Sheikhoun and Souran.  
</p>
<p>3. At 04:00, Government forces cordoned the town with checkpoints from three 
directions, the east, north and south. The western side of Tremseh is adjacent to Al-
Safsafiyah. Supplies of electricity, water and communications were cut off.  
</p>
<p>4. At 05:00 on 12 July, FSA positions in the town came under attack by Government 
forces using shelling, helicopter gunships and ground troops. Credible accounts indicate 
that at 08:00 following the Government attack, Government ground forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> 
entered Tremseh from its western periphery, receiving support from the neighbouring 
villages of Selheb, Al-Safsafiyah, Tel Sekin, and Asila among others. The presence of

<p> 
</p>
<p>c
 Thus included are multiple instances of the war crime of murder, and killings that result from conduct 
</p>
<p>of hostilities in which civilians or the civilian population as such is the object of the attack, amounting 
to the war crime of attacking civilians. When murder is committed as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack directed against a civilian population, perpetrated pursuant to or in furtherance of a 
State or organisational policy, the commission of massacres can amount to the crime against 
humanity of murder. </p>


<p><b>46</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><i>Shabbiha</i> was consistently noted by interviewees, who described them as closely 
cooperating with Government forces. 
</p>
<p>5. Individuals attempting to flee were shot in the fields on the outskirts of Tremseh, 
although the commission could not determine whether they were civilians or fighters.  
</p>
<p>6. UNSMIS observers attempting to reach Tremseh on 12 July were stopped outside 
the town by Government forces. When UNSMIS reached the village on 13 July, they 
reported that civilian objects, including over 50 homes and a school, were affected. They 
also observed and documented pools of blood and brain matter in a number of instances.  
</p>
<p>7. Collected accounts relayed how Government forces conducted house-to-house 
searches seeking &#8216;terrorists&#8217; by looking for men and their ID cards. Interviewees alleged 
that after their identification, numerous men were executed. UNSMIS interviewed 27 
villagers who gave highly consistent accounts of extra-judicial executions of men arrested 
by Government forces. 
</p>
<p>8. One interviewee describes how the youth of Tremseh attempted to defend the village 
against Government forces, although whether any armed clashes occurred could not be 
determined. The raid led to the arrest of around 100 people and the killing of dozens. 
Among those arrested were four persons, including a medical doctor, who were 
subsequently featured on Syrian state television as &#8216;terrorists.&#8217; Their fate and whereabouts 
remain unknown. Government forces set a number of houses on fire, claiming they 
belonged to &#8216;terrorists.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>9. Following the raid by Government forces, the <i>Shabbiha</i>, armed with guns, knives 
and machetes entered Tremseh from its western periphery. The <i>Shabbiha</i> looted shops and 
commercial buildings and caused extensive damage to residential property. Hostilities 
continued throughout the day until Government forces regained control of the town. 
Government forces and the <i>Shabbiha</i> withdrew around 20:00. After Government forces left, 
survivors emerged from hiding. Interviewees relayed eyewitness accounts of how they 
found tens of bodies in the streets and tens of houses and shops set on fire.  
</p>
<p>10. First-hand information was received indicating that indiscriminate shelling, shooting 
and setting fire on buildings and shops resulted in full destruction of tens of the houses and 
shops in Tremseh. At least six houses were completely destroyed, 13 burnt down, and four 
shops looted and set on fire. Additionally, there was reliable information that three schools 
were looted, destroyed and at least one of them set on fire. 
</p>
<p>11. Interviewees stated that more than a hundred bodies were collected in Tremseh&#8217;s 
mosque following the attack. The commission documented and corroborated 46 victims of 
the attack by name. Casualties included 39 persons killed, three of whom are believed to be 
under 18 years old and one 60 year old man; seven burnt bodies, including four persons 
under 18. A father stated that, among the burnt bodies, he identified his seven year old son 
by his unique front teeth. Another young man was identified by a steel belt he was wearing. 
The whereabouts of at least 15 people remain unknown.  
</p>
<p>12. It has not yet been possible to ascertain if all those killed, arrested and detained were 
connected with armed groups. However, the high number of children killed indicates that 
civilians had been inadequately protected, or deliberately targeted. 
</p>
<p>13. Other uncorroborated reports blamed anti-Government armed groups for the civilian 
deaths in this incident. Video material purportedly from Tremseh was broadcast on Russian 
television and showed two FSA members captured by the army confessing to having killed 
civilians in the town. It was not possible to assess whether these confessions were obtained 
voluntarily.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>14. Government forces attacked civilians in Tremseh in the conduct of their military 
operations. The heavy bombardment of the town in the early hours of 12 July was 
indiscriminate, causing the destruction of civilian objects. There are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the arrest and extra-judicial execution of men and boys, following house-to-
house searches, and their identification by Government forces, amounts to the war crime of 
murder.d Government forces killed persons who were either hors de combat fighters or 
civilians taking no active part in hostilities.  
</p>
<p>15. There are reasonable grounds to believe that <i>Shabbiha</i> murdered persons who were 
hors de combat fighters or civilians, using knives and guns, spreading terror among the 
civilian population of Tremseh. The number of children among the casualties indicates that 
while not all those killed were necessarily civilians, a substantial number were, indicating 
that civilians were likely targeted. Government forces and Government affiliated militias 
perpetrated the war crime of murder. The 15 unaccounted persons documented raise the 
spectre of the occurrence of the crime of enforced disappearance, which may amount to the 
crime against humanity of enforced disappearance if committed as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack directed against a civilian population.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Jedaydet Artouz, 1 August 
</b></p>
<p>16. First-hand information was collected concerning events that took place on 1 August 
in Jedaydet Artouz, a town on the southern outskirts of Damascus. Jedaydet Artouz has a 
heterogeneous population of Sunni Muslims, Christians, Druze and Alawites.  
</p>
<p>17. According to interviewees, a massacre took place a few days after an incident in 
which FSA fighters assassinated a high-ranking officer, living in a neighbourhood adjacent 
to Jedaydet Artouz. In retaliation, army troops composed of hundreds of soldiers 
accompanied by tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy machine guns, launched a military 
operation in the town that lasted from 05:00 until the late afternoon on 1 August. During the 
operation, soldiers conducted house-to-house searches, mainly in the Sunni-majority 
southern parts of the city.  
</p>
<p>18. During the house searches, residents of Jedaydet Artouz said they heard sporadic fire 
in different locations of the city. Interviewees stated that Syrian army troops were raiding 
homes and detaining male residents, especially those belonging to families known for their 
anti-Government positions and who had participated in peaceful demonstrations. The 
commission received consistent accounts that Government forces looted shops and homes 
during the raid. 
</p>
<p>19. At around 17:00 when the army left, residents of the town discovered the bodies of 
approximately 60 male residents (all adults, except one), who were allegedly summarily 
executed, after being arrested by army troops. In one case, an interviewee stated that 
residents found a group of 17 dead bodies of adult males, who had been rounded up in a 
warehouse next to an agricultural field bordering the Sunni neighbourhood south-east 
Jedaydet Artouz. One eyewitness said that most of those who were found had their hands 
tied behind their backs and had been shot at a close range. Some had their T-shirts removed 
and pulled over to cover their heads. Other bodies were found across different locations in 
the town, and all appeared to have been summarily executed. 
</p>
<p>20. All the bodies that were found were taken to an area adjacent to a local mosque and 
buried shortly thereafter in a mass grave.  
</p>

</p>
<p>21. The information collected and corroborated indicates that the conduct of 
Government forces in Jedaydet Artouz on 1 August had a strong punitive element. The 
military operation, apparently in retaliation for an assassination, was focused on a majority-
Sunni neighbourhood, raising concerns that there was a sectarian vein to the conduct of 
Government forces.  
</p>
<p>22. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Syrian soldiers perpetrated the war 
crime of murder, as they conducted house-to-house searches, arrested male residents, and 
summarily executed them. The death of 60 residents, all of them male bar one, amounts to a 
mass perpetration of a war crime, in violation of the Common Article 3 prohibition on 
killing persons hors de combat or civilians not taking active part in hostilities. It is clear that 
the 17 adult males killed in close quarters with their hands tied behind their back were 
either civilians or hors de combat fighters.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Daraya, 25 August 
</b></p>
<p>23. In Damascus governorate, investigations focused on the widely reported killings in 
Daraya. Allegations were made against anti-Government armed groups, though most 
accounts attributed responsibility to Government forces. Credible and corroborated 
accounts indicate that anti-Government fighters sought refuge in Daraya, fleeing from 
fighting in other areas. Government forces shelled Daraya from 20 to 24 August, after 
which they moved into the town together with <i>Shabbiha</i>. Interviewees described how anti-
Government armed group fighters fled Daraya, Government forces executed civilians who 
had decided to stay in their homes.  
</p>
<p>24. Many young men, some of whom may have been defectors or anti-Government 
armed group members who had put down their arms, reportedly fled to an area referred to 
as &#8220;the gardens&#8221; (<i>Mazare</i>). Government forces attacked &#8220;the gardens&#8221; on 25 August killing 
over one hundred people, reportedly through extensive gunfire and shooting at close range 
at those hiding in the area. Further accounts describe <i>Shabbiha</i> conducting house searches, 
looking for fighting aged men. Bodies bearing clear signs of summary execution were later 
found in various shelters around Daraya. Video footage and photographs of the aftermath of 
the events in Daraya show scores of bodies, including those of women and children. Syrian 
state media reported that Daraya had been &#8220;cleansed&#8221; of armed &#8216;terrorist&#8217; groups. This 
incident requires further investigation. 
</p>
<p>25. While the massacre in Daraya requires further investigation, there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that Government forces perpetrated the war crime of murder against hors 
de combat fighters, or civilians taking no active part in hostilities, including women and 
children. The credible and corroborated evidence collected indicates that fighting aged 
males were sought out for execution, in violation of Common Article 3 to the Geneva 
Conventions, which prohibits violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, 
of persons taking no active part in hostilities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Harak, 18&#8211;26 August 
</b></p>
<p>26. Multiple sources from Harak in Dara&#8217;a Governorate provided accounts of events that 
took place between 18 and 26 August 2012. Harak was once home to 40,000 Sunnis. The 
population of Harak has reduced to around 5,000 by the end of 2012. Most sources 
interviewed were civilians who fled Harak when Government forces approached the town 
on 18 August and returned when Government forces withdrew on 26 August. One source 
interviewed was an FSA fighter present in Harak from 18 to 25 August. All interlocutors 
accused Government forces of mass killing in Harak at this time. All interviewees placed </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>the number of civilians killed at over 500. The FSA source claimed that Government forces 
killed 565 people, of whom 30 were FSA fighters. 
</p>
<p>27. Government forces that came to Harak on 18 August included the Syrian Army&#8217;s 52 
Brigade, Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence and Political Intelligence. Members of 
the <i>Shabbiha</i> and possibly members of the Iranian Republican Guard accompanied the 
army. Government forces remained in Harak for nine days. For the first eight days they 
encountered resistance from the FSA. Having exhausted their ammunition, the FSA 
withdrew. Government forces re-established control in the town, while local residents 
returned to Harak to find many burned homes. The corpses of some civilians who had 
remained in Harak during the military operation were found throughout the town. Others 
who stayed behind had gone missing. 
</p>
<p>28. The FSA fighter described how he and his colleagues moved into areas following 
Government forces. This source claims to have seen 400 civilian corpses. Some of the 
civilian casualties were caused by shrapnel, some by close range gunfire and some bore 
severe knife injuries. Some bodies had been burned. Among the dead bodies were women 
and children.  
</p>
<p>29. Interlocutors accused the <i>Shabbiha</i> of removing many bodies from Harak. It is 
alleged that the corpses were buried in the nearby 52 Brigade Headquarters, to cover up the 
killing. According to the FSA fighter, &#8220;Government forces tried to hide the bodies of dead 
civilians, but we could smell them.&#8221; Another interviewee suggested that the Syrian Army 
commanders responsible for the operation presented the civilian dead as killed FSA 
fighters. 
</p>
<p>30. The level of brutality unleashed on Harak may be connected to its location. As 
mentioned above, the 52 Brigade headquarters is located near the town and there are other 
military bases in the area. As such, Harak became a port of call for defecting soldiers. 
Recognising this, the Syrian Army established a base in Harak in May 2011. Despite this, 
defectors continued to seek refuge in Harak. In May, the defectors forced the army out of 
Harak, killing around 10 soldiers. The commission continues to seek additional verification 
of events in Harak from 18 to 26 August, in particular from Government soldiers involved 
in the operation at the time.  
</p>
<p>31. It was determined that some civilian casualties in Harak bore injuries caused by 
shrapnel. Considering the presence of FSA fighters in Harak and the direct hostilities 
between Government forces and FSA fighters over the span of eight days, during which 30 
FSA fighters were killed in combat, the commission is unable to conclude whether 
Government forces shelled Harak indiscriminately during the period between 18 and 25 
August. However there are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces and 
<i>Shabbiha</i>, committed the war crime of murder, killing persons hors de combat and civilians 
taking no active participation in hostilities at close range with gun fire and knives.  
</p>
<p>32. The burning of bodies, among them women and children, is particularly 
condemnable. It is not clear whether the persons whose bodies were burnt were killed by 
burning or the bodies were burned later. Combined with credible allegations that bodies of 
those killed in Harak were buried in a mass grave in the 52 Brigade Headquarters, indicates 
that Government forces and affiliated militias are disregarding their obligation under 
international humanitarian law to dispose of the dead in a respectful manner. The 
concealment or disfiguration of bodies hinders the rehabilitation of victim communities and 
prevents identification of the dead.  </p>

<p><b> E. Deir Baalbeh, 22&#8211;30 December 
</b></p>
<p>33. Several first-hand accounts of events that occurred in Deir Baalbeh, a town to the 
east of Homs between 22 and 30 December were received. Intermittent skirmishes had 
occurred between Government forces and FSA elements on the outskirts of Deir Baalbeh 
during December. On 22 December, FSA elements successfully attacked the &#8220;Ishara&#8221; 
checkpoint at the eastern edge of the city and managed to take control of it for a few hours. 
Shortly after, Government forces shelled the eastern flank of the city using mortars and 
tanks, causing civilian families to flee towards the centre of Deir Baalbeh. The shelling 
intensified throughout the night of 22 to 23 December. According to some of the accounts 
collected, that night &#8220;was the worst shelling that the city witnessed since the outset of 
events in March 2011.&#8221; The shelling was indiscriminate and caused significant damage to 
civilian houses and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>34. On 23 December, Government tanks and armoured personnel carriers pushed 
through the southern and northern parts of the city as confrontations intensified with 
various FSA elements who attempted to push back Government forces using light weapons 
and rocket-propelled grenades. Civilians, including families, were trapped in these areas as 
they attempted to leave through regular checkpoints by foot or by other means of 
transportation including cars and buses. According to corroborated accounts, Government 
forces effectively blocked many of the exit points out of the city and forced families to 
return. In one instance, a family of three was killed as it attempted to leave through the Tal 
Nasr checkpoint manned by Government forces to the east of the city. 
</p>
<p>35. Throughout the period from 24 until 28 December, hostilities continued between the 
FSA and Government forces at various locations, as Government forces gradually gained 
ground. Accounts confirm that the FSA light weaponry could not match the overwhelming 
firepower of Government tanks, armoured personnel carriers and shelling. Groups of FSA 
fighters, who were running low on ammunition, attempted unsuccessfully to smuggle some 
of the families who were trapped inside the city to other locations before Government 
forces could regain control of the city. Credible accounts confirm that Government forces 
were able to push all FSA elements outside the city and take over Deir Baalbeh on 29 
December. Investigations of the incident continue, including into reports stating that 
civilians &#8212; numbering between 220 and 400 &#8212; were killed by Government forces as they 
established control over the city on 29 December. 
</p>
<p>36. It is clear from the information obtained from credible and corroborated witness 
accounts that Deir Baalbeh was attacked by Government forces. There are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the shelling of the town during the night of the 22 to 23 December 
was indiscriminate, causing significant damage to civilian houses and infrastructure. On 23 
December, in the course of confrontations between the FSA and Government forces, 
Government forces trapped civilians within Deir Baalbeh, blocking their exit from the town 
and in one documented instance, killing a family that attempted to flee. Trapping civilians 
within an area that is subsequently attacked suggests that Government forces made the 
civilian population the object of their attack. There are reasonable grounds to believe that 
Government forces committed the war crime of attacking civilians in Deir Baalbeh. 
Investigation into this incident continues, with efforts to establish the number of casualties 
and those responsible for issuing orders and implementing the military operation against 
Deir Baalbeh.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Al-Mastomah, 7 January 
</b></p>
<p>37. Al-Mastomah is a predominantly Sunni village located seven kilometres south of 
Idlib. Prior to hostilities, Al-Mastomah had a population of 8,000, most of whom have fled </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>due to protracted and escalating fighting. The village is located near the largest Government 
military base in the area, a scout camp. The camp is located on the southern edge of Al-
Mastomah. A Government checkpoint in Al-Tal borders Al-Mastomah to the north. 
</p>
<p>38. On 3 January 2013, FSA fighters from the neighbouring villages moved into Al-
Mastomah and attacked the scout camp. After three days of intensive fighting, during which 
the village was heavily shelled by mortars, artilleries and tanks from the scout camp and al-
Tal checkpoint, the FSA withdrew from the village. The majority of the residents fled from 
the shelling, with only a few remaining in the village. According to one interviewee, around 
70 persons remained in the village, most of them elderly. 
</p>
<p>39. On 7 January 2013, in the early morning, Al-Mastomah came under attack by 
Government forces using shelling and ground troops. Prior to the offensive, Government 
forces had shelled the village from the scout camp and Al-Tal checkpoint for two hours. 
Reports from credible sources suggest that <i>Shabbiha</i> deployed together with the army. 
</p>
<p>40. An eyewitness stated that troops conducted house-to-house searches before 
establishing a base at a school on the eastern side of the village and set checkpoints around 
it. An eyewitness who returned to village after the raid, recounted how bodies of summary 
executed persons were collected and buried before dawn. The commission was able to 
examine video footages of the deceased before their burial. The footage shows bodies of 
women, children and elderly people among the deceased. It also appears that some of the 
bodies were executed in close quarters. 
</p>
<p>41. Government forces subjected Al-Mastomah to indiscriminate shelling, which caused 
the majority of the town&#8217;s residents to flee. Government forces regained control of Al-
Mastomah after three days of clashes with the FSA. They entered the village and conducted 
house-to-house searches. The majority, if not all FSA fighters fled Al-Mastomah after three 
days of combat and their defeat by Government forces. The remaining civilians were made 
the target of the ground assault by Government troops, which, there are reasonable grounds 
to believe, executed civilians or persons hors de combat in close quarters. The video 
footage of those killed indicated that Government forces executed women, children and the 
elderly. There are reasonable grounds to believe that Government forces perpetrated the 
war crime of murder in Al-Mastomah.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Incidents currently under investigation 
</b></p>
<p>42. Investigations into a massacre that is alleged to have taken place on Sad Street in 
Dara&#8217;a city in August and a massacre that is alleged to have taken place in Duma outside 
Damascus in October, are on-going.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>43. Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions, which applies in armed conflicts not 
of an international character, prohibits the passing of sentences and the carrying out of 
executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, 
affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognised as indispensable under 
international law.  
</p>
<p>44. Anti-Government armed groups exercise limited control over territory and 
population. The massacres perpetrated by anti-Government armed groups must be viewed 
in this context.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> A. Execution of members of the Al-Berri clan, Aleppo, 28/29 July 
</b></p>
<p>45. Interviews with persons who made credible admissions against their own interest, 
provide an account of a mass killing that took place in Aleppo on 28 or 29 July.  
</p>
<p>46. An interviewee explained that there had been an agreement between the FSA and the 
Awlad Al-Berri in Aleppo to not engage in hostilities. Following this agreement, the FSA 
raided the police station of Bab Al-Naireb in Aleppo. Awlad Al-Berri, according to the 
FSA, &#8220;committed treason,&#8221; violating their agreement and attacking the FSA, resulting in the 
deaths of 11 FSA fighters. In retaliation, FSA reinforcements attacked Awlad Al-Berri, 
killed several members in combat, besieged Bab Al-Naired and captured five members of 
the Al-Berri family, including Zaino Al-Berri, a prominent Syrian parliamentarian. 
According to the interviewee, the FSA interrogated the five members of Awlad Al-Berri 
and found them to be &#8220;drug dealers, <i>Shabbiha</i> who oppress demonstrations and who arm 
citizens to oppress demonstrations, rapists of female students at Aleppo University and 
murders of youths.&#8221; According to the interviewee, one member of the Awlad Al-Berri 
confessed to raping 14 young women at Aleppo University. Following the interrogation, the 
five persons were referred to the &#8216;Shari&#8217;a Court&#8217; in Aleppo, a quasi-judicial body 
established by Liwa Al-Tawhid. The &#8216;Shari&#8217;a Court&#8217; sentenced all five persons to death. 
Liwa Al-Tawhid executed the sentence by gunning down those &#8220;convicted.&#8221; The event was 
filmed and the footage release on the internet.  
</p>
<p>47. The persons sentenced and executed by the &#8216;Shari&#8217;a Court&#8217; in Aleppo were either 
hors de combat or civilians taking no active part in hostilities. The perpetrators, namely 
Liwa Al-Tawhid and the FSA, were aware of their status, having captured them in combat. 
The sequence of events, the lack of an appeal, combined with other accounts of &#8216;Shari&#8217;a 
Courts&#8217; and councils amount to reasonable grounds to believe that the &#8216;Shari&#8217;a Court&#8217; of 
Aleppo was not regularly constituted and did not afforded the essential guarantees of 
independence and impartiality and other judicial guarantees recognised as indispensable 
under international law. Consequently, there are reasonable grounds to believe that an anti-
Government armed group, likely the Liwa Al-Tawhid, which is affiliated with the FSA, 
perpetrated the war crime of sentencing and execution without due process. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Execution of five soldiers in Latakia, post-July 2012 
</b></p>
<p>48. One interviewee, an FSA fighter, confirmed that he had been part of a brigade that 
had captured &#8220;five Alawites&#8221; on a road into Al-Haffa. He could not provide the date of the 
incident but stated it had happened after his defection to the FSA in late July. He stated that 
those captured were soldiers who had surrendered. The five captives were interrogated and 
&#8220;confessed to committing rape and killing civilians in Al-Haffa.&#8221; He confirmed that they 
were executed shortly afterwards. The interviewee noted that not all captured soldiers were 
executed by his FSA-affiliated group: &#8220;Sunni captives were kept. Alawites were executed.&#8221; 
In this instance, the FSA perpetrated the war crime of execution without due process.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Incidents currently under investigation 
</b></p>
<p>49. Video footage of anti-Government armed groups summarily executing captured 
Government soldiers and affiliated militia members, informers and people believed to be 
members of the <i>Shabbiha</i> is publicly available. Namely, under investigation is the 
execution of 10 to 28 Government soldiers near Saraqeb, Idlib on 1 November. It is alleged 
that the execution was conducted by the Mountain Shield Brigade, an anti-Government 
armed group. Investigations are also continuing into the execution of 21 Government 
soldiers in Aleppo on 10 September. It is alleged that anti-Government armed groups </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>affiliated with the FSA are responsible. The execution of eight to ten hors de combat 
Government soldiers in Ras Al-Ayn in mid to late November, is also being investigated. It 
is alleged that the execution was perpetrated by the Al-Nusra Front. There incidents, if 
confirmed, would amount to war crimes. Attempts to interview perpetrators or eyewitnesses 
have so far been unsuccessful, however, investigations are on-going. </p>

<p><b>  Other unlawful killing</b>a<b> 
</b>1. Unlawful killings, which did not fall within the above definition of massacres, 
continue to be recorded. Arbitrary deprivations of life contrary to international human 
rights law, such as extra-judicial or summary executions, occurred throughout the reporting 
period, frequently overlapping with the war crime of murder. Unlawful killing attributable 
to both Government forces and anti-Government armed groups in five governorates were 
recorded.  
</p>
<p>2. The practice of summarily executing people suspected of supporting or being part of 
anti-Government armed groups continued during this reporting period. Forty-one 
individuals provided information on executions conducted by Government forces in 
violation of international law. Ten interviewees witnessed the executions first-hand. The 
remaining witnessed the aftermath, learned of the death from an eyewitness, or were family 
members of those killed. The incidents were spread geographically.  
</p>
<p><b>  Homs 
</b></p>
<p>3. A recently-defected interviewee watched a raid in Homs led by General [name 
withheld] on 8 August. Several persons were arrested and brought to Bilal mosque. Twelve 
men were allegedly shot execution style; the interviewee saw their bodies later in the 
hospital. The interviewee identified the commander of the operation as being from the air 
force intelligence in Homs, Brigadier [name withheld].  
4. In a small village east of Homs, on 1 or 2 October, an interviewee witnessed a 
ground operation conducted by a mixture of army, security agencies and local <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
The interviewee recognised the army from their uniforms and tanks, and the intelligence 
agency personnel because they drove civilian cars. He said he recognised the <i>Shabbiha</i> 
because &#8220;we are particularly afraid of them &#8211; especially for the women and girls.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>5. The interviewee stated that most people &#8220;panicked and ran for the farms.&#8221; The army 
entered the village and appeared to be searching for a specific person as they went 
immediately to one house. From his hiding place, the interviewee saw a young man drive 
into the village, apparently unaware of the operation. After the operation the villagers found 
the body of this young man tied to a tree. He had been shot through the head. 
</p>
<p>6. On 19 October, one of those interviewed was in Dahadeel when &#8220;over 1,000 
military, intelligence and <i>Shabbiha</i> entered the area.&#8221; He identified the <i>Shabbiha</i> by their 
shaven heads and long beards with moustaches, explaining that Sunni Muslims have beards 
&#8220;but not moustaches.&#8221; Some of the <i>Shabbiha</i> wore military fatigues, others were in civilian 
clothes. They came to his house, searched it, and asked him for his ID. They checked it 
against a list of names and as his name was apparently not on the list they departed. He then 
saw the security forces go to his neighbour&#8217;s house. Either his neighbour did not have his 
ID or his name was on the list because they arrested him and set the house on fire. Once the 
security forces left, the interviewee and other neighbours tried to extinguish the fire. He

<p>said that the security forces then returned to see who was helping this family. Then they 
went to the house of a man known as &#8220;the sheikh.&#8221; The interviewee witnessed <i>Shabbiha</i> 
take the sheikh into the street and kill him, shooting him in the stomach and in the head. 
Some of the military appeared disgusted by this and left the scene. They appeared 
powerless to stop the <i>Shabbiha</i>, however and did not try. 
</p>
<p><b>  Dara&#8217;a 
</b></p>
<p>7. An interviewee from Namer, Dara&#8217;a, described a military operation in the village by 
Government forces on 3 October. She related how two tanks entered her street with some 
50 <i>Shabbiha</i> accompanying them. Approximately 10 men knocked on their door, and the 
interviewee&#8217;s husband, aged 34 years old, opened it. One of the <i>Shabbiha</i> entered, slapped 
her husband, and asked him about his mobile phone and his identity cards. The <i>Shabbiha</i> 
continued to slap her husband as they pushed him outside where other soldiers began 
hitting him. The interviewee was made to stay home. Fifteen minutes later she heard the 
sound of shooting nearby. When the forces withdrew, she went out and found her husband 
lying dead in their compound face down. He had been shot three times. 
</p>
<p>8. In Musayfrah, on 28 October, an interviewee stated that 30&#8211;40 men entered the 
village. Some were wearing military uniforms while others were in civilian clothes. The 
military men had the badges of the 4th Air Force Division on their uniforms. The 
interviewee believed the civilians to be <i>Shabbiha</i>. When the men came into his home they 
forced all the women and children outside. The interviewee remained in the house with the 
other males of his family where they were tied to chairs. The house was searched. Finding 
nothing the soldiers began torturing the interviewee&#8217;s elderly father, asking him where &#8220;the 
terrorists&#8221; were and accusing them of supporting the insurgency. &#8220;They cut off two of my 
father&#8217;s fingers and they slit his wrists. Eventually they shot my father dead. They also 
killed my brothers and my brother&#8217;s son. They killed them with knives.&#8221; The interviewee 
said he was also questioned and tortured until he lost consciousness. The interviewee 
believes he may have survived the attack because he was unconscious and the security 
forces must have believed him to be dead.  
</p>
<p><b>  Idlib 
</b></p>
<p>9. In July, Syrian military forces entered Iblin village in the Jabal Al-Zawiya region of 
Idlib. The residents of Iblin are Sunni. An interviewee recounted that she was at home with 
her husband, six children, her sister and mother-in-law at the time. Approximately 20 
armed military personnel broke down the door of their home and arrested her husband. 
Together with her mother-in-law, they tried to prevent the soldiers taking her husband 
outside the house, but the soldiers beat them back. After the men were outside, they closed 
the door to keep the women away. A few hours later when the soldiers had left, her mother-
in-law went outside the house and found the interviewee&#8217;s husband dead in front of their 
house. He had been shot in his chest and neck.  
</p>
<p>10. An older interviewee from Mare&#8217;a, in Idlib, stated that when a raid on his village 
began on 23 August, he and his extended family were at home together. He had four sons, 
two of whom were there with their wives and children. Security forces knocked on the 
door, saying, &#8220;we want to see who is inside the house. Where are your children? Where are 
your children?&#8221; The interviewee eventually opened the door and two soldiers entered. They 
were in full Syrian Army fatigues, including helmets, and the interviewee described the two 
in detail. They addressed his sons, accusing them of participating in anti-Government 
armed groups. One of the soldiers took a hatchet that was hung on his waist and hit the </p>


<p><b>56</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>closest son in the head killing him instantly. He then turned on the second son and killed 
him.  
</p>
<p><b>  Damascus 
</b></p>
<p>11. In a case detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, annex XII, during a house raid 
conducted allegedly by military intelligence personnel in July in Damascus, a women and 
two children were killed as they attempted to prevent the arrest of their family member.  
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>12. Government forces and affiliated militias have committed extra-judicial executions, 
breaching international human rights law. This conduct also constitutes the war crime of 
murder. Where murder was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against 
a civilian population, with knowledge of that attack, it is a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>13. There have been increased reports of anti-Government armed groups killing 
captured Government soldiers or those they believe to have collaborated with the 
Government. Most of the accounts collected during this reporting period emanated from 
Damascus and Aleppo governorates. Several interviewees also spoke about killings in 
Homs and Dayr az Zawr. 
</p>
<p>14. The killing of five members of the Al-Berri clan in Aleppo and the killing of five 
Alawite soldiers in Latakia constitute massacres and are discussed above. 
</p>
<p>15. As the state law enforcement and justice system have disintegrated in certain areas 
of the country, anti-Government armed groups have turned to enduring social structures, 
often based around religious institutions, to fill the lacunae. Eighteen interviewees indicated 
that detainees had appeared before such &#8220;tribunals&#8221;, which had ordered their executions. 
</p>
<p>16. Common Article 3 prohibits the passing of sentences and the carrying out of 
executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, 
affording all the judicial guarantees, which are recognised under international law. The 
collected information indicates that persons who are detained by anti-Government armed 
groups are not afforded the judicial guarantees recognized under international law to which 
they are entitled. According to insider accounts, courts and tribunals are being established 
on an ad hoc basis in areas in which anti-Government armed groups are able to establish 
sufficient control. A mix of imams and judges who have defected run the courts, applying a 
hybrid of Syrian criminal and Islamic law. The accused are not afforded a right to appeal 
and are not provided or allowed a defense. As a result, detainees who face this quasi-
judicial system are often deprived of contact with the outside world, making it difficult if 
not impossible for their families to know of their fate and for humanitarian organisations to 
track their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>17. Consistent accounts paint a punitive quasi-judicial system in which the participation 
in hostilities is punishable by death. Detainees who are affiliated with the Government but 
have taken no direct part in hostilities are released. Anti-Government armed groups also 
appear to be heavily involved in this process, operating &#8220;interrogation committees&#8221; that 
present the evidence against the accused to the court. There is strong evidence that indicates 
that detainees are tortured during the interrogation process. In failing to meet the standards 
under international law for regularly constituted courts and judicial guarantees, the </p>

<p>execution of hors de combat Government soldiers and militiamen, anti-Government armed 
groups commit the war crime of sentencing or executing without due process. 
</p>
<p><b>  Aleppo 
</b></p>
<p>18. Five interviewees detailed killings by anti-Government armed groups in Aleppo. All 
but one of those interviewed are members of anti-Government armed groups affiliated with 
the FSA. Three indicated that the killings occurred only after tribunal, made up of local 
religious leaders, had passed sentence. 
</p>
<p>19. Two interviewees stated that captured &#8220;Alawite officers&#8221; had been killed after 
having a death sentence passed on them by a tribunal. In one case, two soldiers were 
captured and executed after defectors had indicated that one had perpetrated a rape at the 
other&#8217;s orders. In the second case, the interviewee was at pains to say that while &#8220;many&#8221; 
captured officers had been executed, that the tribunal did not pass such sentences on those 
who did not have &#8220;blood on their hands&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>20. An interviewee who lived in Atarib described detainees held at an FSA prison in the 
village being taken to a location outside of the village and executed. The interviewee had 
seen the body of one of those executed dumped on the roadside. 
</p>
<p>21. In late October and early November, there were a series of running battles between 
Kurdish militias and anti-Government armed groups in north east Aleppo. There were 
reports of two killings of Kurds during this time. The first, taking place on 29 October, 
involved the capture and assault of Kurdish man who later died from his injuries. The 
second, an execution of a senior female Kurdish commander in the city of Aleppo on 1 
November. It has not yet been possible to corroborate these reports. Investigations continue. 
</p>
<p>22. Several videos available on Youtube purport to show killings by anti-Government 
armed groups in Aleppo. These include videos purporting to show anti-Government 
fighters cutting the throat of a regime supporter in Aleppo on 12 August, members of armed 
groups throwing Government loyalists off the roof of a post office in Al-Bab in Aleppo on 
1 September, and members of anti-Government armed groups executing captured soldiers 
in the Aleppo military barracks of Masakin Hananou. It has not been possible to verity 
these videos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Damascus 
</b></p>
<p>23. Five interviewees, including two perpetrators and one survivor, provided details 
about killings of captured soldiers and civilians believed to be collaborating with the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>24. One interviewee recounted his role in interrogating those captured by his FSA-
affiliated group. He stated that, in July, a man with an Iranian passport was captured in the 
area of Sayyidah Zaynab. The interviewee stated &#8220;when we tortured&#8221; the man, he 
&#8220;confessed&#8221; to the presence of multiple Hezbollah intelligence centres and snipers in 
Damascus. The interviewee confirmed he had beaten the man until he had answered the 
questions. The Iranian man was shot six days later and buried near Sayyidah Zaynab. The 
interviewee emphasised that a death sentence had been passed by a tribunal, which reached 
its verdict after considering the man&#8217;s &#8220;confession&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. Another interviewee detailed how he and other members of the FSA kidnapped and 
killed &#8220;an Alawi&#8221; soldier in Zamalka in October. He stated that the soldier had been 
involved in the rape of a woman at a checkpoint. </p>


<p><b>58</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>26. One of those interviewed was a survivor of a killing at a factory in an area of 
Damascus predominantly populated by Christians. He indicated that the vast majority of the 
factory&#8217;s workers were Christian. On 3 September, he and the other workers were on the 
factory floor when &#8220;20 armed men with their faces covered&#8230; broke into the room with 
Kalashnikovs&#8221;. The men were dressed in civilian clothes. One of the armed men shouted 
&#8220;we know who you are and which region you come from. We ask you to leave this factory 
and your region. Otherwise you will be in danger.&#8221; The factory&#8217;s director came on to the 
floor and was shot dead by one of the armed men, who then left. The interviewee believes 
that the workers of the factory were targeted specifically because of their religious 
affiliation. He never returned to factory and fled Syria shortly afterwards. 
</p>
<p><b>  Dara&#8217;a 
</b></p>
<p>27. Two interviewees, both from FSA-affiliated groups, provided accounts of killings 
which their particular groups had perpetrated. One detailed the execution of pro-
Government Sunnis by the Al-Omari brigade in villages outside of Dara&#8217;a city.  
</p>
<p>28. The second stated that he was part of a group operating in a town 10 kilometres 
north of Dara&#8217;a city. He stated that he and six other fighters captured six Iranians who 
&#8220;under interrogation&#8221; stated that they were members of the Republican Guard there to fight 
&#8220;foreign terrorists&#8221; on behalf of the Government. The interviewee stated that two of the 
captives were killed when they tried to seize weapons in order to escape. The remaining 
four were later reportedly exchanged for FSA prisoners. The killing of captives attempting 
an armed escape would be considered lawful. Investigations into this incident are on-going. 
</p>
<p><b>  Homs 
</b></p>
<p>29. One interviewee, who joined the Al-Nusra Front in April, described the overrunning 
of an army checkpoint in a hospital in western Homs governorate. Two soldiers were left 
wounded while others were abducted. In relation to the soldiers wounded in the attack, he 
stated &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, they were only two and we left them to die. We had no possibility to 
take them, and they killed others so they deserve to die&#8221;. The abducted soldiers were taken 
before a tribunal which would have passed sentence. The interviewee did not know the 
sentence passed in this instance but stated they would only have been executed if they had 
been found guilty of killing civilians. 
</p>
<p>30. Customary international law requires that the wounded receive, to the fullest extent 
practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required by 
their condition. No distinction may be made on any grounds other than medical ones. That 
the wounded soldiers were left to die, and that no one was called to administer aid to them &#8211; 
in the event that the fighters were unable to take them to their field hospital &#8211; may 
constitute a violation of international humanitarian law. This interviewee provides no 
account of any specific deaths and consequently, there is insufficient evidence to make a 
finding related to any killings. 
</p>
<p><b>  Dayr az Zawr 
</b></p>
<p>31. Two FSA members confirmed the existence of interrogation committees and a 
tribunal in Dayr az Zawr. They stated that only those convicted of &#8220;serious crimes&#8221; would 
be executed on order of the council. One interviewee confirmed that during interrogations, 
confessions were beaten out of detainees. He is aware of four recent executions, those of </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>two Government soldiers who confessed to killing civilians, an FSA fighter who confessed 
to providing information to Government forces and a drug-dealer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>32. It has been noted in several instances, those captured were brought before a quasi-
judicial mechanism to determine their guilt and to pass sentence. It is apparent however, 
that many of the confessions that these councils heard had been obtained through torture, 
such as beating and were highly unreliable.  
</p>
<p>33. With the exception of the killing of the two Iranians in Dara&#8217;a where investigations 
are on-going, anti-Government armed groups killed persons who were either hors de 
combat fighters or civilians taking no active part in hostilities, thereby committing the war 
crime of murder or the war crime of sentencing or execution without due process. Such 
killings are also a breach of international human rights law. </p>

<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Arbitrary arrest and detention</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. International human rights law forbids detaining someone without a legal basis,b yet 
incidents of arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention continued apace over the reporting 
period. Accounts described not only an arbitrary substantive basis for the detention, but also 
numerous and serious procedural shortcomings. Armed groups seized individuals and held 
them hostage for ransom or exchange.c Fifty interviewees described their own or their 
relatives&#8217; apprehension &#8212; by both Government forces and anti-Government armed groups 
&#8212; in circumstances that violate international law.  
</p>
<p>2. Almost all of those arrested were males, some of whom were children. In nearly one 
third of the cases, money changed hands prior to release, while nearly all described torture 
and conditions of detention amounting to inhumane treatment.d  
</p>
<p>3. Human rights provisions applicable in Syria require State personnel, at a minimum, 
to inform an arrested person of the reasons for their arrest, to bring the person promptly 
before a judge or similar independent body and to provide the detainee with an opportunity 
to challenge the lawfulness of detention.e During states of emergency, these provisions are 
derogable. To date, the Government has not filed a notice to the Office of the UN Secretary 
General informing of an intention to derogate.  
</p>
<p>4. Non-State actors are generally not permitted to detain people during peacetime 
under applicable domestic law. However, given that the threshold for armed conflict has 
been reached, international humanitarian law also applies. Thus, parties to the conflict who 
choose to detain a person must treat them humanely. They must avoid any cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, and cannot hold them hostage. Indeed, individual 
criminal liability attaches to individuals who take hostages in relation to the conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b>5. Five interviewees worked as guards at official detention centres prior to defecting. 
They conveyed details behind the Government strategies and means of arbitrary arrest. 
Most often such arrests by Government forces were recorded during raids on a 
neighbourhood or village. Persons suspected of involvement in opposition activities were 
rounded up and taken to detention centres. Those arrested were often tortured to reveal 
information on others possibly involved (see A/HRC/22/59, annex VIII). The information 
gathered through these coercive techniques was used to compile lists of future arrestees.

<p>GE.13-10627 <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>6. Twenty two interviewees were themselves arbitrarily arrested and recounted a range 
of detention-related violations attributable to Government forces and affiliated militias. In a 
minority of cases, young men and boys were arrested either at or immediately following 
demonstrations. No interviewee reported being informed of the reasons for his arrest.  
</p>
<p>7. Individuals were held incommunicado for extended periods without their families 
being notified, they were forced to pay bribes for their release, were held solely for 
purposes of extracting information from them, or to force others to surrender. No 
interviewee was provided legal counsel, though some managed to secure counsel through 
their own efforts.  
</p>
<p>8. Questions asked during interrogations strongly suggested that, in the majority of 
cases, interviewees had been targeted for arrest. One man, a bread seller from a northern 
governorate, was interrogated about allegedly supplying bread to anti-Government armed 
groups. Other interviewees were questioned specifically about providing fuel or medical aid 
to the armed groups. Three interviewees, two of whom were children, stated they had been 
taken off the street after participating in demonstrations. One interviewee, a low-ranking 
soldier in the Syrian army, was accused of sympathising with the opposition by fellow 
soldiers. In only three cases, was it unclear why the interviewees had been arrested, though 
later questioning suggested that the interrogating agency believed that they were members 
of anti-Government armed groups or that they were assisting these groups. 
</p>
<p>9. One such detainee from Dara&#8217;a was arrested on a Friday in July after watching a 
demonstration that erupted after prayers. Four armed men in military uniforms seized him 
from a side street, blindfolded and handcuffed him, and took him in a military jeep to 
checkpoint where he was seriously maltreated. &#8220;Give me the names of the members of the 
coordination committees who mobilised you to demonstrate?&#8221; When he did not provide a 
name he was physically assaulted.  
</p>
<p>10. In ten cases, interviewees reported being taken before a judge and given an order for 
release. In eight cases, however, interviewees stated that they or their family members had 
paid bribes in order to secure their release. One interviewee, a defector who had worked at 
one of the intelligence branches in Hama, stated that in many cases bribes were the primary 
motivating factor behind the arrests: &#8220;Detainees pay money to secure their release. It is a 
systematic practice in Syria nowadays. Arresting people is done very often for this 
particular purpose.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>11. The commission recorded two cases in Damascus (700,000 August, 1 million, no 
date), 1 in Dara&#8217;a (200,000, no date); two in Latakia (500,000 November, and 300,000 
August), one in Homs (350,000 July), and two in Aleppo (100,000 July and 350,000 
September).  
12. One young man from Dara&#8217;a, arrested in April, was released in September, after his 
father sold land and paid 300,000 Lira (approximately 3,000 USD) to his Government 
captors. Similar accounts were received from Latakia where both <i>Shabbiha</i> and security 
forces arrested people and released them only after bribes were paid.  
</p>
<p>13. At other times, it was neither information nor money the captors sought. The 
security forces holding one former Latakia resident stated to his brother through 
intermediaries that &#8220;unless you surrender, your brother will remain in detention.&#8221; Multiple 
accounts corroborated the practice of arresting someone else in the family, if the person 
wanted was not at home. 
</p>
<p>14. Official statistics on the number of detainees and detention centres have yet to be 
provided by the Government. It did, however, provide periodically information concerning 
the release of 2,289 detainees over the reporting period. The information was accompanied 
with the note that those released &#8220;have surrendered themselves and their weapons, and </p>


<p><b>62</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>made written commitments that they will not carry weapons or do anything that could 
prejudice the security and stability of Syria.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>15. Anti-Government armed groups have increasingly apprehended members of the 
Government forces, perceived collaborators (&#8220;informants&#8221;), their family members and 
foreigners aligned with the Government. While detention is clearly preferable to execution 
&#8212; a phenomenon prevalent in the commission&#8217;s previous reports &#8212; still the fundamental 
principles set out in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions are not being met. 
</p>
<p>16. The commission received multiple accounts of armed groups taking hostages for the 
sole purpose of ransom or exchange. On 4 August, 48 Iranian citizens were apprehended by 
the Al-Bara Brigade in Damascus. The Islamic Republic of Iran asserted that the men were 
civilian pilgrims en route to the Sayyidah Zaynab shrine, while the armed group claimed 
they were members of the Revolutionary Guard sent to assist the Government. Media 
reported in October that the men had been threatened with execution unless the 
Government released detainees. If true, such threat would constitute &#8216;hostage taking&#8217;, a war 
crime. The men were reported to have been exchanged for some 2,000 detained civilians in 
January 2013.f  
</p>
<p>17. A former resident of Damascus living near Sayyidah Zaynab, stated, &#8220;After the army 
has come and gone, the FSA come back and do the same. They also arrest and detain 
people. The FSA would only arrest &#8216;informants.&#8217; We don&#8217;t know what happened to them. 
They&#8217;d take them away and we&#8217;d never see them again.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>18. Another interviewee in his early twenties who had fought with anti-Government 
armed groups explained what happened to detainees taken during operations, &#8220;some got 
killed, others were injured and the rest were abducted.&#8221; When asked what happened to the 
injured ones he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, they were only two and we left them to die we had no 
possibility to take them, and they killed others so they deserved to die&#8221;. He then clarified 
that the abducted soldiers were taking to a &#8216;Shari&#8217;a council&#8217;.  
</p>
<p>19. Two former detainees held by anti-Government groups in Aleppo, one in October 
and the other in November, told the Commission that they were invited to join the group 
upon their release. Also in Aleppo anti-Government armed groups seized a man for ransom 
and while holding him tried to exploit his technical skills for use in their operations. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>20. Government forces arbitrarily arrested and detained individuals in violation on 
international human rights law. Of particular concern are holding individuals without 
charge, the failure to provide detainees with legal counsel, the ability of detainees to 
challenge the lawfulness of their detention, or family visits. Arresting people on the basis of 
information received under circumstances amounting to torture seriously undermined the 
legality of such arrest. To the extent these violations amount to inhumane treatment they 
violate international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>f
 The commission addressed the Islamic Republic of Iran via Note Verbale on 10 January, 2013 
</p>
<p>requesting to interview those released. By 21 January, no reply had been received. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>21. Anti-Government armed groups are detaining persons solely for ransom or exchange 
which is a war crime. To the extent they inflict on the detainees cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment, such groups violate international humanitarian law. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Annex VII 
</b></p>
<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Enforced disappearance</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. One of the most insidious aspects of the Syrian conflict has been the disappearance 
of thousands of people from their homes, at checkpoints and from the street as they went 
about their daily lives.  
</p>
<p>2. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance requires, <i>de minimus</i>, a person&#8217;s arrest, detention or abduction and a refusal, 
either at the time at which the person is deprived of his liberty or afterwards, to give 
information on his fate or his whereabouts. These acts and omissions must be carried out by 
or with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State.b While Syria is not a party to 
the Convention, it is a party to the ICCPR and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, 
provisions of which are infringed by enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>3. Enforced disappearance places its victims outside the law, violating their right to 
recognition as a person before the law, to liberty and security and freedom from arbitrary 
detention, including the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other official for 
review of the lawfulness of detention. It is also often a gateway to the commission of 
further crimes such as torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and murder.  
</p>
<p>4. The prohibition against enforced disappearance in international law, however, serves 
to punish harms that are distinct from, for example, arbitrary arrest or torture. It is rooted 
not only in the paramount protection of the individual, but in the protection of the family 
during armed conflict.c Indeed, investigations of enforced disappearance are often 
particularly difficult because families &#8212; living in hope that their relatives will be safely 
returned to them &#8212; do not wish to provide names and other details of the disappeared. Lack 
of access to Syria has further hindered investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b>5. There were 19 reports of enforced disappearance committed by Government forces 
&#8212; both army and intelligence agents &#8212; and affiliated militia, occurring since 15 July. The 
majority of the disappeared were adult men though three reports relating to the 
disappearances of women and two relating to children were received. 
</p>
<p>6. In eleven of those incidents, the whereabouts of the person or persons arrested or 
abducted remains unknown. Five returned to their families after lengthy detentions, with 
four indicating they had suffered serious physical abuse &#8212; and in one case a rape &#8212; during 
their detention. In three cases, the bodies of those who had been taken were later recovered. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>a
 See A/HRC/21/50, Annex II for the applicable law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>b
 Additionally, the International Criminal Court, in its Elements of Crimes, indicated that such acts and 
</p>
<p>omissions can be carried out by or with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of &#8220;a political 
organisation&#8221; and that an intention to remove the person from the protection of the law for &#8220;a 
prolonged period of time&#8221; must be present.

<p>GE.13-10627 <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>In two cases, the bodies bore marks of torture while in the third case, the body was so 
decomposed it was identified through documents found in clothing. 
</p>
<p>7. One interviewee stated the intelligence agents had come to her house in Damascus 
on several occasions, looking for her husband but he had evaded them. After a week her 
husband failed to return from work and has not been seen since. Fearing rape, she has made 
inquiries of the police only through intermediaries and reported that the police refused to 
confirm whether her husband was held by the Government, commenting only that &#8220;if he has 
done nothing wrong, then he&#8217;ll be okay.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>8. Another interviewee, whose son was arrested during a house search by Military 
Security in late October in Damascus, also used intermediaries in an effort to locate the 
whereabouts of his son. He stated that he did not go to the branch of Military Security 
himself as he feared that, by making the inquiry, he would also be subject to arrest. This 
fear &#8212; expressed by several interviewees &#8212; appears rooted in fact. Another interviewee, 
this time describing events in a Jabal Al-Zawiya, Idlib governorate, stated that three women 
were arrested &#8220;and taken away in a military vehicle&#8221; after having complained about the 
arrests and subsequent killing of their husbands. 
</p>
<p>9. In three cases, it was reported that family members &#8212; a son, brother and brother-in-
law, respectively &#8212; disappeared after passing through army checkpoints in Latakia and 
Homs. None of the families were informed of their relatives&#8217; whereabouts. In two of those 
cases, the families have made multiple unsuccessful inquiries. In the third case, the father, 
who had been arrested, detained and reportedly tortured by Air Force Intelligence in Dara&#8217;a 
in early 2012, was too frightened of further arrest to make inquiries. 
</p>
<p>10. One child, a 14 year old boy, was arrested immediately following a demonstration in 
Damascus. His treatment while in detention is detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, annex 
X. He was released after several months and told investigators that his family had not been 
informed of the fact of his detention or of his whereabouts. His father had consistently 
attempted to find him, even having his photograph shown on a local television channel as a 
&#8220;missing person&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. In two instances, interviewees reported that their relatives had been abducted by 
Government affiliated militia, described in interview as <i>Shabbiha</i>, in Latakia and Homs 
respectively. Their whereabouts of their relatives remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>12. One interviewee reported information that indicated an anti-Government armed 
group had perpetrated an enforced disappearance. The arrest and treatment of this 
interviewee, a former work at Political Intelligence in Aleppo, is detailed in document 
A/HRC/22/59, annex VIII. This interviewee was held in Hritan for approximately six 
weeks with 54 men who were predominantly captured soldiers but which also included 
others who were suspected of being <i>Shabbiha</i>. His family was not informed of his 
whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>13. It is likely that families whose relatives have been arrested or abducted by anti-
Government armed groups have remained within Syria. While the commission does 
conduct interviews through telephone and Skype, contacting families within Syria remains 
a challenge. 
</p>
<p>14. Government forces have engaged in enforced disappearance in violations of their 
international legal obligations. The commission is gravely concerned that a significant 
number of people are being held outside the protection of the law for extended periods. No 
information was provided to families who inquired as to their relatives&#8217; whereabouts. </p>


<p><b>66</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>Relatives of some detainees who approached the Government security apparatus were 
themselves arrested, justifying a fear in others who might undertake the same inquiry.  
</p><p>15. Given the geographic spread of the documented cases and the consistent manner in 
which abductions and arrests were carried out, there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
enforced disappearances were committed by Government forces, as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack against a civilian population, constituting crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>16. There is currently insufficient information to make a finding in respect of <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
These affiliated militia are likely to be viewed as agents of the State acting with the State&#8217;s 
authorisation, support or acquiescence. 
</p>
<p>17. Although anti-Government armed groups are per se not a party to the Convention, 
their actions can be assessed against customary international legal principles, and they are 
subject to criminal liability for enforced disappearance that amounts to a crime against 
humanity. There is currently insufficient information to make a finding with respect to anti-
Government armed groups and enforced disappearance; investigations are on-going. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Torture and other forms of ill-treatment</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. Sixty-eight interviews were collected regarding the use of torture and other forms of 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in Syria since 15 July 2012. 
</p>
<p>2. Under international human rights law, there is a clear prohibition on torture and 
other forms of ill-treatment. Syria is a party to the ICCPR, Article 7 of which reads, &#8220;No 
one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>3. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment, to which Syria is also a signatory, provides a more detailed definition of 
torture.b This definition, however, requires that pain and suffering be &#8220;inflicted by or at the 
instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting 
in an official capacity&#8221; and so would not encompass the conduct of anti-Government armed 
groups. Similarly, the prohibition set out in Article 13 of the Arab Charter of Human Rights 
imposes an obligation only on State parties. 
</p>
<p>4. International humanitarian law explicitly prohibits torture and other forms of ill-
treatment. Such conduct is a war crime. Torture and other inhumane acts may also 
constitute crimes against humanity.c 
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b>5. The commission received 62 reports of the use of torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment by Government forces and affiliated militia, occurring 
since 15 July 2012. The majority &#8212; 36 &#8212; indicated that the abuses took place during 
interrogations by the Government&#8217;s intelligence agencies. There were also multiple reports 
of civilians being tortured in unofficial detention centres, at army checkpoints and military 
barracks, and during house searches by Government forces, sometimes accompanied by 
members of affiliated militia, notably local <i>Shabbiha</i>.  
</p>
<p>6. Twenty-nine interviewees indicated that they, or their family members, had been 
arrested and subsequently detained at official detention centres. The initial arrests took 
place at checkpoints, during house-searches and on the street (see A/HRC/22/59, annex VI). 
In two instances, the person arrested received a call from Political Intelligence demanding 
he come in for questioning. A further six interviewees were guards, or worked in other

person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is

<p>capacities, at official detention centres. The doctor of one of the interviewees who sought 
medical treatment also provided a statement. 
</p>
<p>7. Questions asked during interrogations strongly suggested that, in the majority of 
cases, interviewees had been targeted for arrest. One man, a bread seller from a northern 
governorate, was interrogated about supplying bread to anti-Government armed groups. 
Other interviewees were questioned specifically about providing fuel or medical aid to the 
armed groups. Three interviewees, two of whom were children, stated they had been taken 
off the street after participating in demonstrations. One interviewee was a member of the 
Syrian army who had been accused of sympathising with the opposition by fellow soldiers. 
In only three cases was it unclear why the interviewees had been arrested, though later 
questioning suggested that the interrogating intelligence agency believed that they were 
members of anti-Government armed groups or that they were assisting these groups. 
</p>
<p>8. According to those interviewed, interrogations were carried out under the auspices 
of Syria&#8217;s four principal intelligence agencies: Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, 
Political Security Directorate and the General Security Directorate. All four have central 
offices in Damascus as well as a network of regional, city and local sub-offices across the 
country. The majority of those interviewed indicated that they had been interrogated by 
members of Military and/or the Political Security Directorate. Interviews emanating from 
Aleppo governorate, however, referred most often to Air Force Intelligence. 
</p>
<p>9. Several interviewees could not, however, confirm which agencies conducted the 
interrogations and, in some instances, the precise location of their interrogations. Reported 
reasons for this included being blindfolded during transport into detention facilities, being 
blindfolded during interrogations, being transferred among different facilities and 
undergoing multiple interrogations.  
</p>
<p>10. A further five of those interviewed reported that they were also held for short 
periods in unofficial detention facilities, such as schools or shops, as a prelude to being 
transferred to an official centre. While held in unofficial centres, interviewees reported 
abuse by members of the army and by local <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
</p>
<p>11. In eleven cases, interviewees stated that they have been assaulted or had witnessed 
the assault of others at army-run checkpoints. Two others had been abused inside military 
barracks. A further ten interviewees described their or their family members being beaten 
or otherwise assaulted during house searches.  
</p>
<p>12. Few of those arrested in house searches were taken to official detention centres. 
Indeed, in seven of ten cases where assaults were reported in the context of house searches 
by Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i>, interviewees stated that execution of the victim (or 
victims) took place shortly afterwards. 
13. Due to a continued lack of access, it has not been possible to visit detention centres 
to interview detainees, those responsible for the detention centres or to observe detention 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment taking place in 
official detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>14. Many of the interviewees who reported torture and other forms of ill-treatment in 
official detention centres were detained in intelligence agencies in Damascus and Aleppo 
governorates. Several interviewees were tortured in Damascus&#8217; Military Security Branch 
235, also known as the &#8216;Palestine branch&#8217;. Six of the eight interviewees speaking about 
torture in Aleppo governorate indicated that their relatives had suffered abuse at the Air 
Force Intelligence building inside the Al-Zahra complex in Aleppo City.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>15. Other interviewees spoke about torture taking place at Military Security in Izra, 
Dara&#8217;a; Military Security in Homs city; Military Security Branch 215 in Damascus; 
Political Intelligence in Hama; and Military Security and Air Force Intelligence in Latakia 
city. Five interviewees stated that they (and in one case, the interviewee&#8217;s son) had 
undergone multiple interrogations and assaults while being transferred among detention 
centres and governorates. 
</p>
<p>16. Reported methods of torture remained consistent across the country. Interviewees 
described being placed in prolonged stress positions; severe beatings about the head and 
body with electric cables, whips, metal and wooden sticks and rifle butts; electric shocks 
applied to sensitive parts of the body, including the genitals and ears; burnt with cigarettes; 
and kicked. 
</p>
<p>17. The commission received 15 reports of detainees being placed in prolonged stress 
positions, such as hanging from walls or ceilings by their wrists (<i>shabah</i>) and hanging by 
wrists tied behind their backs. Eleven interviewees stated that they had been subjected to 
electric shocks to various parts of their bodies; four interviewees reported being beaten on 
the soles of the feet (<i>falaqa</i>). Other methods reported were forcing detainees to bend at the 
waist and place their head, neck and legs through a car tire while beatings were 
administered (<i>dulab</i>); tying the detainees to a flat board with their head unsupported and 
either stretching them (as on a rack) or folding the board in half (<i>Bishat al-Rih</i> or the 
&#8220;flying carpet&#8221;). Incidents of sexual violence in detention centres are detailed in document 
A/HRC/22/59, annex IX. For many interviewees, scars and wounds, consistent with their 
accounts, were still visible.  
</p>
<p>18. One interviewee, arrested in mid-July during a house search and taken to the 
&#8216;Palestine branch&#8217; of Military Security in Damascus, reported that he had been hung from 
the ceiling; given electric shocks to his genitals, had cigarettes extinguished on his body, 
including on his anus; and was beaten with a hose. Another interviewee, who worked at the 
Palestine branch, stated that between June and August, he witnessed detainees hung from 
the ceiling by the wrists for extended periods of time; having electric shocks applied to their 
genitals and ears; and beaten. Further, he indicated that he witnessed one detainee being 
thrown off the roof of the building by intelligence officers, causing his death. 
</p>
<p>19. Six interviewees reported family members suffering abuse during their detention at 
Air Force Intelligence in Aleppo city. One detailed how his relative and two other men, 
which travelling through a &#8220;pro-Government village&#8221; where detained by Government 
affiliated militias and taken to Air Force Intelligence. They were reportedly hung from the 
wrists and stabbed. Two of them, including the interviewee&#8217;s relative, were shot in the head 
and their bodies dumped in Aleppo. The third, who had been stabbed multiple times, was 
found still alive after having been left on the street near the intelligence branch. Another 
interviewee stated that his brother had been held for less than a week and had been beaten 
and suffered electric shocks to his face, chest and genitals. Another, whose brother had 
been arrested and was later found dead, was informed that the deceased had also been held 
at Air Force Intelligence. The commission viewed a post-mortem video of the body of the 
deceased, which bore clear marks of beatings and cuts, particularly on the deceased&#8217;s back.  
</p>
<p>20. A further interviewee worked as a guard at Air Force Intelligence in Aleppo between 
May and October. He stated he could hear detainees screaming and crying and saw several 
detainees with injuries following interrogation. He recalled several instances where 
detainees had to be carried from the interrogation rooms to their cells as they were unable 
to walk. One interviewee described the dumping of bodies, including one of a child, outside 
Air Force Intelligence in Aleppo, with their bodies showing evidence of beatings and 
mutilation. </p>


<p><b>70</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>21. One interviewee, detained with four others in Air Force Intelligence in Latakia, 
stated that all were beaten and one of those with whom he was arrested later in custody. 
Some detainees died in suspicious circumstances while in the custody of the intelligence 
agencies. One interviewee &#8212; whose two cousins were arrested in late October during a 
house search in a Damascus neighbourhood &#8212; was told by the Military Police that they had 
died as a result of &#8220;suffocating&#8221; while in detention.  
</p>
<p>22. The commission recorded the torture of children as well as the detention of those 
under 18 years in the same cells as adult detainees (see A/HRC/22/59, annex X). Children 
were also subjected to the conditions of detentions described below.  
</p><p>23. Five of those interviewed had been moved among multiple detention facilities. 
Where there had been multiple transfers, interviewees stated that they had suffered physical 
violence in each location. 
</p>
<p>24. One such interviewee was arrested and beaten at a checkpoint in Latakia 
governorate in late August before being taken to Military Security in Latakia. During a two 
month detention, the interviewee was transferred between Military Security Branches in 
Latakia, Homs and Damascus. In all three locations, he underwent multiple interrogations 
during which he was hung from the ceiling by his arms and beaten with electrical wire; put 
in a car tire and beaten; hit about the face, causing the breaking of teeth; and denied food 
and water for days at a time. In Latakia, he observed other detainees in his cell with marks 
on their bodies from beating. While held in one of the Military Security Branches in 
Damascus, he stated that he saw bodies of eleven other detainees as he was taken in for 
interrogation. Another interviewee, held for a month at the Military Security Branch in 
Latakia, stated he had also been beaten and given electric shocks while being interrogated 
by military security officers. 
</p>
<p>25. Several forms of torture and other forms of ill-treatment meted out to detainees did 
not result in physical evidence. Two interviewees stated that they had been forced to strip 
and remain naked for prolonged periods. One was threatened with sexual assault. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment taking place in 
unofficial detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>26. Five interviewees reported being held in unofficial detention centres. In late 
December, one interviewee, a 14 year old girl, was abducted by four men, two of whom 
were in uniform, and held a building in Idlib by people she described as &#8220;Shiites from her 
neighbourhood&#8221;. She was interrogated about her mother&#8217;s work with the FSA. Her 
treatment &#8212; which included her being raped &#8212; is detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, 
annex IX. She described being beaten, burnt with cigarettes and injected with an unknown 
substance. In interview, her doctor stated that she had injuries highly consistent with her 
account. 
</p>
<p>27. One interviewee was stopped while driving in Homs city in mid-July by <i>Shabbiha</i> 
who he said were &#8220;Alawites from the Zahra neighbourhood&#8221; of the city. He stated he was 
taken to a building where there were 12&#8211;15 other captives, including an 8 year old boy. He 
was given electric shocks and the <i>Shabbiha</i> attempted to blind him with a screwdriver. He 
lost the use of sight in his right eye. At the time of interview, the damage to his left eye, as 
a result of untreated infection, was apparent. 
</p>
<p>28. In August, two interviewees reported their or their family members being stopped 
while driving in Latakia governorate. One stated that he had been stopped by soldiers who 
accused him of supplying the anti-Government armed groups with fuel. He described being 
taken, blindfolded, to a school where he was beaten for several hours before his transfer to </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>71 
</b></p>
<p>a Military Security branch. The second stated that his nephew had been kidnapped and 
beaten by <i>Shabbiha</i> while travelling in Latakia governorate.  
</p>
<p>29. Another interviewee said that he had been stopped by uniformed soldiers in 
Damascus and required to produce his identification. After it showed him to be from Homs, 
he was taken to a shop where the soldiers stripped him, beat him and extinguished 
cigarettes on him. He was later taken to Political Intelligence in Harasta, Damascus. In a 
fourth case, one man was abducted in July from his village near Tremseh in Hama 
governorate by <i>Shabbiha</i> from a neighbouring &#8220;Alawite village&#8221;. He stated that he was 
severely beaten and released only after payment of a substantial ransom. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment taking place at army 
checkpoints and military barracks 
</b></p>
<p>30. Multiple reports were received of people beaten and otherwise assaulted at 
checkpoints, particularly in Dara&#8217;a and Latakia governorates. Two interviewees described 
physical assaults inside military barracks. 
</p>
<p>31. In late October, one interviewee reported having been stopped by intelligence agents 
at a checkpoint in Mhajjah, Dara&#8217;a governorate after a word, which was perceived to be 
pro-opposition, was observed written in dust on one of the windows. The interviewee stated 
he was taken to a room where he was beaten, given electric shocks and forced to remain on 
all-fours, imitating a donkey. He was released after being made to lick the windows of his 
car clean. Another interviewee reported that her husband was asked to report to the Mhajjah 
checkpoint for questioning and did not return. She stated that his body was delivered to a 
local hospital the following evening, with puncture wounds to his chest and back, and facial 
bones, including his jaw, broken. Another interviewee described soldiers beating and then 
executing an unarmed man at a checkpoint in Harak in mid-November. A former worker at 
one of the intelligence agencies stated in interview that he regularly witnessed the beating 
and humiliation of &#8220;Sunni commuters&#8221; at checkpoints in Dara&#8217;a governorate. 
</p>
<p>32. Three interviewees described abuse of civilians at checkpoints in Latakia 
governorate in August. The first was beaten, including with metal objects, by soldiers as 
they questioned him about the presence of anti-Government armed groups in the area. 
Another described his neighbour being held at a checkpoint run by local <i>Shabbiha</i> and 
having to contribute money to &#8220;purchase&#8221; his neighbour&#8217;s release. The interviewee stated 
that he saw evidence of beatings on his neighbour&#8217;s back after he was released from the 
checkpoint. The third described his being detained with four friends by what he described 
as <i>Shabbiha</i> from a &#8220;nearby Alawite village&#8221;. They were held for three days, during which 
his friends were beaten, before they were handed to Air Force Intelligence in Latakia. 
</p>
<p>33. A former soldier who, prior to his defection, was deployed at a checkpoint in Hama, 
gave numerous accounts of soldiers beating civilians passing through the checkpoint, 
stating, &#8220;I cannot possibly count all such incidents.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>34. There were two reports of persons being physically assaulted inside military 
barracks. One interviewee was taken to a barracks in Idlib, where he was hung by his wrists 
and beaten while he was interrogated about other soldiers&#8217; plans to defect. The second 
interviewee described people being detained at military barracks in Aleppo city. While 
investigations are on-going, there is information emerging which suggests that people are 
assaulted not only while held in detention by Syria&#8217;s intelligence agencies, but also while 
held by regular army units inside army camps and under the supervision of army officers. </p>


<p><b>72</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment taking place during 
house searches  
</b></p>
<p>35. Ten of those interviewed reported being beaten or witnessing others being beaten 
during house searches. There are corroborated reports of adult men being beaten &#8212; and 
killed &#8212; by members of the army during house searches in Mara&#8217;and, Idlib governorate 
between 23 and 28 August, as well as in villages in Dara&#8217;a governorate during October. 
Reports were also received of individuals being beaten during house searches in Jabal al-
Zawiya in Idlib governorate (July), Saqba in Damascus governorate (July), Qastal Ma&#8217;af 
and other Turkmen villages in Latakia governorate (early September) and the Al-Ghadam 
area of Damascus (December). 
</p><p>36. The commission notes with concern that in seven of the ten incidents reported, the 
beatings were a prelude to executions. One interviewee, speaking about house searches in 
Mare&#8217;a, Idlib stated that the adult males &#8212; including her husband &#8212; were taken outside the 
house. Their bruised bodies were later found, with their eyes gouged out. 
</p>
<p>37. In a house search in a village in Dara&#8217;a governorate in early October, men were 
beaten before being taken away from the house and executed. In another search, also taking 
place in a village in Dara&#8217;a governorate in early October, <i>Shabbiha</i> entered a house and 
began beating the interviewee&#8217;s husband before taking him outside and killing him by firing 
multiple shots at his chest and abdomen. In a third house search which took place in a 
different Dara&#8217;a village in late October, three adult men were tortured, including being cut 
with knives. Only one, the interviewee, survived as a result, he believes, of being mistaken 
for dead while unconscious.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>38. Most detainees described being held in over-crowded cells. The size of the cells 
varied, as did the number of detainees being held in each cell. Ten interviewees reported 
that the cells were so overcrowded that it was impossible to lie prone, with two saying it 
was also not possible to sit. Five interviewees reported that they were held in underground 
cells, with no access to light. Two stated that cold water was thrown on them at intervals 
during the night by the guards. 
</p>
<p>39. Interviewees highlighted the lack of medical care provided to them during their 
detention. Several described returning to their cells, or seeing cell mates returned to their 
cells, with untreated injuries. Two interviewees stated that other detainees in their cells died 
as a result of their wounds and the bodies remained in the cells for several hours before 
being removed by guards. None was seen by any medical personnel. 
</p>
<p>40.  Multiple detainees stated that they were provided with inadequate food and water 
during their detention. One detainee stated that he and detainees held with him went 
without food and water for days at a time. Another stated that he and other detainees had to 
drink their own urine in order to survive. Four detainees reported that their cells were not 
equipped with toilets and that detainees often had to relieve themselves in the cells as they 
were not permitted to exit the cells to go to the bathrooms. 
</p>
<p>41. These accounts, if verified, would amount to the breach of the Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>73 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>42. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
have been committed by Government forces and affiliated militia, notably local <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
This is in violation of Syria&#8217;s obligations under international human rights and 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>43. Severe pain was inflicted upon persons in official detention centres, in unofficial 
detention centres, at checkpoints and during house searches. As was found in previous 
reports, torture was inflicted to punish, humiliate or to extract information from detainees. 
Much of the physical violence described by interviewees &#8212; including kicking, hitting, 
beating (including beating on the soles of the feet), flogging, inflicting electric shocks, 
burning, extended hanging from the wrists, and threatening the victim with rape in 
circumstances where the interrogators had the power to carry out this threat &#8212; have been 
found to constitute torture by various international tribunals.d  
</p>
<p>44. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
have been perpetrated by Government forces and affiliated militia as part of a widespread 
attack directed against a civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. Torture in 
official detention centres was also perpetrated as part of a systematic attack on a civilian 
population, with knowledge of that attack. Consequently, torture and other inhuman acts as 
crimes against humanity have been committed. This conduct is also prosecutable as the war 
crimes of torture and inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>45. On the basis of interviews conducted, members of the intelligence agencies, in 
particular Military, Political and Air Force Intelligence are primarily responsible for torture 
and ill-treatment. The names of direct perpetrators, the heads of branches where torture has 
been found to have occurred and the Directors of the relevant intelligence branches have 
been withheld. 
</p>
<p>46. The conditions of detention as described in interviews conducted would, if verified, 
constitute the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of those detained. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>47. The commission received five reports of the use of torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by anti-Government armed groups. A sixth 
interview, with a FSA prison guard, detailed conditions of detention at one facility in 
Duma, Damascus governorate. 
</p>
<p>48. Three interviews centred on the treatment of captured Government soldiers and 
<i>Shabbiha</i> (or those perceived to belong to local <i>Shabbiha</i> groups) in Aleppo governorate. 
One interviewee, who had worked at Political Intelligence in Aleppo, described his 
kidnapping, detention and torture by members of anti-Government armed groups. He stated 
he was taken by force from his house in Aleppo city to a heavily guarded house in another 
neighbourhood. There he was interrogated about his treatment of detainees while being 
kicked and beaten with electrical cables and sticks by at least seven men. He was then 
placed in a room with five other detainees before being transferred to a larger detention 
centre in Hritan which held 54 other people, most of whom were captured soldiers. Some 
stated they were civilians suspected of collaborating with the Government. He remained 
there until late November when he was released. During that time he suffered multiple

</p>
<p>interrogations and beatings. He stated that he witnessed eight detainees die from their 
injuries and numerous others return to the cells with severe injuries including broken bones. 
Injuries to his legs and hands were visible at the time of interview. 
</p><p>49. The same interviewee was released after having been brought before &#8220;an FSA 
court&#8221;, where three men heard his case and levied a fine. He stated that an FSA member 
who knew him before the conflict had also been allowed to speak. 
</p>
<p>50. One interviewee provided an account of his role as a commander of an FSA military 
unit in Damascus, where he was charged with interrogating captives. He indicated he had 
extracted information from one particular detainee by beating him, adding that the detainee 
was then executed after appearing before a tribunal.  
</p>
<p>51. Another interviewee, speaking about a detention centre in Dayr az Zawr, described 
confessions beaten out of detainees before they appeared before a tribunal for sentence. The 
interviewee who had been held at an FSA prison in Hritan described being held in 
overcrowded rooms where detainees were given little food or water. He stated that he and 
other detainees had to drink from the toilet located in the room.  
</p>
<p>52. A guard at an FSA prison in Duma in Damascus governorate described captives 
being given the same food as was provided to the guards. He stated that the young person 
held at the centre was a 16 year old boy who had been arrested after being seen 
photographing demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>53. The commission has received 18 interviews which speak, in varying levels of detail, 
about the quasi-judicial mechanisms being run by some anti-Government armed groups 
(see A/HRC/22/59, annex V). While investigations are continuing, the substantive or 
procedural frameworks currently employed do not appear to comply with international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>54. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
have been committed by anti-Government armed groups during interrogations of captured 
members of Government forces and those they believe to be members of the <i>Shabbiha</i>. 
Severe pain was inflicted to punish, humiliate or to extract information from detainees. 
</p>
<p>55. Torture and other inhumane acts were not committed as part of either a widespread 
or systematic attack on a civilian population. Therefore, they do not constitute crimes 
against humanity but may be prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p>56. There is currently insufficient information to determine whether the conditions of 
detention constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of those detained. </p>

<p><b>Annex IX 
</b></p>
<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual violence</b>a<b> 
</b>1. Forty-one interviews were conducted in relation to sexual violence. Direct accounts 
were sought from victims and eyewitnesses. Further interviews were conducted with 
treating doctors or nurses, psychologists, social workers, immediate family members, 
defectors, anti-Government fighters, and other individuals and organisations who have 
assisted or were likely to have assisted victims of sexual violence. Limited weight was 
given to hearsay accounts of sexual violence, though many such accounts were received.  
</p>
<p>2. There were particular difficulties in collecting evidence in cases of sexual violence 
against women and girls due to cultural, social and religious beliefs surrounding marriage 
and sexuality. The concept of honour, not only of the individual but also of her family, is 
constructed around notions of female virginity before marriage and sexual fidelity 
afterwards. At least three of those interviewed were of the view that it is worse for a girl to 
be raped than to be killed in Syrian society. Five stated that they were aware of instances 
where young women had committed suicide after they had been raped. Male victims also 
often failed to report sexual violence, though some were willing to speak about such 
violence occurring in detention centres. 
</p>
<p>3. Syrian refugees, NGOs, and relief organisations reported that one of the reasons that 
families from Homs, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, and Idlib governorates fled was because of a 
perceived increased risk of kidnapping and rape. This perception was bolstered by stories 
from neighbours, family members, FSA soldiers, Syrian news stations, international media 
and the internet. The widespread fear of rape appears to have contributed to the less 
credible hearsay reports of rape. 
</p>
<p>4. Lack of access prevented interviews with victims and eye-witnesses still in Syria, as 
well as serving members of the Syria military and intelligence agencies or those fighting 
with affiliated militia.

</b>5. Sexual violence during the conflict occurred in two distinct contexts: against women 
by Government security and military forces and affiliated militia (usually described in 
interview as <i>Shabbiha</i>) during house searches and at checkpoints; and against men and 
women in detention centres, where it was used as a means to extract information during 
interrogations, as well as to humiliate and punish. It was also used as a means to coerce 
male relatives fighting with anti-Government armed groups to surrender themselves in 
return for the release of the detainee. Methods of sexual violence and torture usually 
consisted of acts of rape, electrocution of genitals by live wires and burning of genitals by 
cigarettes, lighters or melted plastic.

</p>
<p><b> A. Sexual violence committed during house searches and at checkpoints 
</b></p>
<p>6. An FSA fighter stated that he and other fighters searched houses that had been 
invaded by Government security forces in Damascus after a ground operation in July 2012. 
They believed that &#8220;<i>Shabbiha</i>&#8221; had raided houses once the operation had concluded. In one 
house they found three dead bodies and one 17 year old girl who was alive and had been 
shot in the leg. Her head scarf had been removed and she was naked from the waist down. 
She survived the attack and remains living in Syria. 
</p>
<p>7. A woman from Homs described a ground invasion by the army and <i>Shabbiha</i> in 
October 2012. During house searches, &#8220;six or seven <i>Shabbiha</i>&#8221; enter her neighbour&#8217;s house. 
She then heard her female neighbour screaming, &#8220;They&#8217;re raping me. Someone help me.&#8221; 
She also heard the woman&#8217;s 14 year old son scream, &#8220;Stop raping my mother.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>8. A young woman from Dara&#8217;a described &#8220;<i>Shabbiha</i> and security forces&#8221; invading her 
town on 22 November. Between twenty and thirty soldiers and <i>Shabbiha</i> &#8212; who she knew 
by name and who she described as &#8220;Shi&#8217;as&#8221; from her village &#8212; entered her house looking 
for the men. Her aunt, three female cousins, and three sister-in-laws were in the house, 
while the men were hiding in the basement. They beat the elderly aunt when she told them 
the men were in Lebanon. One of the <i>Shabbiha</i> took two of her cousins upstairs to a 
separate room and locked the door while the others stayed downstairs. After the <i>Shabbiha</i> 
left, the two stated that they had been beaten, but she noticed the cousins couldn&#8217;t walk 
properly afterwards and couldn&#8217;t explain why they were separated from the rest if they had 
only been beaten.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence in detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>9. A former worker at Air Force Intelligence in Homs city, described an incident where 
an intelligence officer pointed to a female detainee and was told by the senior commander 
[name withheld] &#8220;&#8220;Take her. Do anything you want with her.&#8221; He described female 
relatives of anti-Government armed group fighters and demonstrators being detained and 
raped by officers as retribution.  
</p>
<p>10. A 14 year old boy, whose treatment at a Military Security branch in Damascus is 
detailed in document A/HRC/22/59, annex X was threatened with rape during his 
interrogation. He also stated that while detained, he saw a cellmate who returned from 
interrogation crying and then refused to eat for two days. The cellmate later told him that he 
had been raped.  
</p>
<p>11. Three of those interviewed reported suffering other forms of sexual violence, such as 
electricity shocks and cigarette burns to their genitals, while held in official detention 
centres. One, arrested in Damascus in the latter half of 2012 and transferred to Political 
Intelligence in Harasta, described having electric shocks to genitals. He was told &#8220;we do 
this so you won&#8217;t have children.&#8221; The full extent of the abuse suffered is detailed in 
document A/HRC/22/59, annex VIII. He also saw two women imprisoned, who were held 
in order to force their husband and son to give themselves up in exchange. 
</p>
<p>12. An interviewee described having electric shocks to his genitals during his 
interrogation at Damascus&#8217; Military Security Branch 235 (see A/HRC/22/59, annex VIII). 
A former employee of the same branch stated that, during interrogations, he had witnessed 
electric shocks being applied to the genitals of male detainees. 
</p>
<p>13. A former worker from the Political security branch in Hama said he witnessed 
intelligence officer&#8217;s applying electric shocks to sensitive organs, including the genitals, 
during the interrogation of detainees. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>77 
</b></p>
<p>14. A Sunni Muslim man who lived in Damascus returned home from work in July to 
discover his wife missing. He had recently moved into the neighbourhood, not knowing 
<i>Shabbiha</i> lived there. They were watched and followed by the <i>Shabbiha</i>. He believes the 
<i>Shabbiha</i> took her and raped her. She was returned the next day and they immediately fled 
the area. 
</p>
<p>15. Reports of sexual violence occurring in unofficial detention centres were also 
received. A 14 year old girl described her kidnapping and rape in [location withheld] in 
December. Her mother had worked with the FSA. The girl had been abducted from the 
street by four men, two in military uniforms and two in civilian clothing. She was taken to 
an unknown building where she was kept and questioned by people she described as 
&#8220;Shi&#8217;as from her neighbourhood&#8221;. While there she was interrogated by a woman about the 
work her mother did with the FSA. During the interrogation, she was beaten with electrical 
wire, given injections, beaten and had cigarettes extinguished on her chest. She was denied 
food and water for extended periods of time. On the fifth day of her detention, four young 
men were brought into the room where they raped her. Two days later, she was released. 
Her father took her to a gynaecologist outside Syria. In a separate interview, the doctor 
confirmed bruises, cigarette burns, injection marks on arms, and sexual injuries to the 
victim. This 14 year old girl has tried to commit suicide three times, saying, &#8220;My life has no 
value. I lost everything, what has gone will never come back.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. In September, a neighbourhood in Homs was searched by Government security 
forces and &#8220;<i>Shabbiha</i>&#8221;. A local resident stated that the security forces went from house to 
house detaining men. If men were not found in the house, the soldiers claimed they must be 
fighting with the FSA. The resident said that his aunt had been one of the women captured 
by <i>Shabbiha</i> along with between 40 and 50 other women from different streets and taken to 
a wedding hall in the town. He said women were raped, and daughters raped in front of 
their mothers. Some were kept for hours and others were kept for a few days with one 
woman kept up to 12 days. The interviewee knew some of the women but would not 
divulge their names so as not to &#8220;shame&#8221; them.  
</p>
<p>17. In a third case, an interviewee stated he had paid a ransom on behalf of his 
neighbour who had been detained at a checkpoint in Latakia by <i>Shabbiha</i> from a nearby 
&#8220;Alawite village&#8221;. He stated that he saw marks of beatings on his neighbour&#8217;s back. When 
he asked the neighbour about how he had been treated, he started to cry. The interviewee 
was informed by the man&#8217;s brother that he had been raped during his abduction.  
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>18. Sexual violence, including rape and forms of sexual torture, has been perpetrated by 
Government forces and affiliated militia against men, women, girls and boys during the 
Syrian conflict.  
</p>
<p>19. In the context of detention centres, rape and other inhumane acts have been 
perpetrated as part of a widespread attack directed against a civilian population, with 
knowledge of the attack. This conduct was also perpetrated as part of a systematic attack on 
a civilian population. Rape and other inhumane acts, as crimes against humanity, have been 
committed by Government forces and affiliated militia. Rape, torture and inhuman 
treatment are also prosecutable as war crimes. 
</p>
<p>20. Acts of sexual violence &#8212; including rape &#8212; were committed against women and 
girls during house searches and checkpoints during the reporting period. The searches, 
which often follow shelling and aerial bombardments, are military operations constituting 
an attack on the civilian population. Rapes and other acts of sexual violence which formed </p>


<p><b>78</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>part of the attack or which were intended to be part of the attack are crimes against 
humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>21. One interviewee spoke about sexual violence committed by anti-Government armed 
groups. A member of the FSA stated that in mid-October in Aleppo he and other FSA 
fighters came across a car containing four FSA members from a different unit. In the car 
was a young boy who said he had been abducted by them. Upon interrogation, the four FSA 
in the car admitted to raping a woman and a girl in Aleppo. The FSA fighters were taken 
before a &#8216;Shari&#8217;a court&#8217; in Aleppo. The interviewee commented that &#8220;actions like this 
proved to be detrimental to the revolution in Aleppo.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>22. Another FSA fighter from Jobbar stated that there had been incidences of &#8220;Alawites 
kidnapping Sunni girls&#8221; in Baba Amr, a neighbourhood of Homs city. The FSA&#8217;s Al-
Farouk brigade responded by kidnapping Alawite women to exchange for the Sunni girls. 
The interviewee stated that the Alawite women are treated well and any mistreatment of 
them would be punished. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>23. Based on limited information received, it was not possible to reach a finding 
concerning crimes of sexual violence committed by anti-Government armed groups. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>79 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex X 
</b>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Violations of children&#8217;s rights</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. Forty-four percent of Syria&#8217;s population were under 18 in 2010. In the protracted 
conflict that has overtaken their country since then, children have faced widespread 
violations of their rights. Children of both sexes have been unlawfully killed and wounded; 
they have been subjected to, and possibly singled out for, sexual violence. They have been 
subjected to other forms of torture in detention facilities, checkpoints and during military 
and security force operations. 
</p>
<p>2. Parties to the conflict have undermined children&#8217;s rights to health and education, 
putting hospitals and schools at the front line of the conflict and reversing painstaking gains 
in social services over many decades.  
</p>
<p>3. Children&#8217;s lives have been misshapen by violence, political and sectarian 
polarisation, impoverishment and the enforced isolation and idleness that conflict creates. 
Many have fled the country as a result. Others have been drawn into the hostilities. Both 
parties have used children in hostilities, exposing them to and implicating them in intense 
violence. The commission is particularly concerned about many reports of anti-Government 
armed groups enlisting children for active participation in the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p>4. The commission has documented a substantial number of deliberate and 
indiscriminate attacks, and disproportionate attacks where civilian casualties were clearly in 
excess of the anticipated military advantage. Fifty interviewees described the death and 
injury to children during shelling and aerial bombardments by Government forces. The use 
of artillery and air power against refugee camps, bakeries, schools, village houses and other 
everyday locales; and the use of excessive force against demonstrators by Government 
forces is well documented. Street fighting, house-to-house attacks and massacresb have 
devastated contested areas such as peri-urban Damascus and Homs, or rural Dara&#8217;a and 
Idlib.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>5. Victims of sexual violence have little incentive to report on the crimes committed 
against them. They may face stigma, alienation or worse from their families. There are few 
services to help them, and perpetrators of sexual violence apparently enjoy impunity. For 
these reasons, clear evidence of sexual violence against children is scarce, but there are 
troubling indications that conflict has deepened the vulnerability of both girls and boys to 
such violence. Several accounts from victims and witnesses illustrated this trend.c

<p><b>80</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>6. Previous reports of the commission have documented boys&#8217; vulnerability to sexual 
violence in detention. In late 2012, one interviewee, a 14 year old boy, stated that he was 
threatened with rape while detained by Military Security in Damascus. Girls also reported 
sexual violence in detention and in the course of operations by Government forces. A 14 
year old girl said that she had been detained by a Government affiliated militia in December 
and sexually assaulted in detention. She was held with another girl her own age, and 
according to her mother, she has made three attempts on her life since her release. An FSA 
fighter from rural Damascus said that after an attack on his neighbourhood by a 
Government affiliated militia, he found his neighbour&#8217;s half-naked grand-daughter, aged 17 
in her house. Most of the rest of her family had been killed and he believed she had been 
raped. A defecting Government intelligence operative said that security services sometimes 
capture the mothers and sisters of wanted males to pressure their male relatives into 
surrendering themselves to the authorities. In detention, these women and girls faced forced 
nudity and rape.  
</p>
<p>7. There are partially corroborated accounts of young women or girls who committed 
suicide after being raped. A woman from Homs reported that around May, a young woman 
aged about 17 or 18 was detained by a Government intelligence agency in Homs. She was 
released to her father one month later, but before being released, she was forced to serve tea 
to her father and her captors while naked. When she returned home, she bid goodbye to her 
mother and then committed suicide by throwing herself from the roof of her home. A 
defector from Air Force Intelligence and a young woman from Homs confirmed some of 
the details of this story. A second incident took place in Harak, a town in Dara&#8217;a 
governorate, which was attacked by a large government force between 18 and 25 August. A 
woman who left Harak after the attack said that one young woman aged between 17 and 20 
was among girls and women reportedly raped during the attack, and she later killed herself. 
In December, Government personnel later visited schools and told schoolgirls &#8220;Go home 
and tell your families that if the FSA shoot any bullets then we will kidnap you.&#8221; Girls 
stopped attending schools as a result.  
</p>
<p>8. Visiting these horrors on younger women is a means of disorienting a society in 
which many people build their beliefs about honour and shame around notions of female 
virginity. This disorientation is clear in (possibly apocryphal) stories of fathers killing their 
daughters rather than surrendering them to armed attackers; in accounts collected from 
families that have gone into displacement because of fears for their daughters; accounts of 
children present during the rape of their mothers; and in accounts of kidnappings and 
counter kidnappings of young women from the sectarian constituencies of opposing armed 
groups and militia.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Unlawful detention of children and ill-treatment of children in 
detention 
</b></p>
<p>9. Detained children have special protections in international law, which requires them 
to be detained separately from adults and which orients their detention towards 
rehabilitation. The Syrian Juvenile Justice Act (1974, number 18) allows for punitive 
detention of children aged 15&#8211;17 if they have committed serious offences &#8211; but requires 
that they be detained in special wings of juvenile reformatories. Detained children are being 
denied these protections today.  
</p>
<p>10. Many credible informants said that children are routinely detained with adults in the 
detention facilities of the intelligence services. One 17 year old boy who had spent almost 
two years in detention estimated that about 50 of 350 prisoners in any given centre were 
under 18 and that some were as young as eight years. Another interviewee, an adult, 
described boys &#8220;as young as 12&#8221; being held in cells with adults in the Military Security </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>81 
</b></p>
<p>Branch in Harasta, also in Damascus. Two other interviewees stated that boys aged between 
12 and 15 years old were held in cells with adult male detainees in Air Force Intelligence in 
Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>11. Some interviewees described conditions in detention. A 14 year old boy held in 
detention in Damascus said that he had been held in an over-crowded cell, in which it was 
impossible to lie down and that the detainees were provided with little food or water. He 
added that he and other detainees had had to drink from the toilet inside the cell in order to 
survive. A 17 year old boy, also detained in Damascus, said that each detainee had about 
one floor-tile of space each, pointing at floor tiles 35cm2. 
</p>
<p>12. Children have been subjected to the same conditions of detention as adults. The 
conditions of detention as described in interviews presented here would, if verified, 
constitute the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of those detained (see A/HRC/22/59, 
annex VIII).  
</p>
<p><b> D. Torture of children 
</b></p>
<p>13. Boys &#8212; as well as some girls &#8212; have been subjected to torture and other forms of 
ill-treatment in Government detention centres, at checkpoints and during house searches. 
One interviewee, a 14 year old boy, was arrested in early July after participating in a 
demonstration that had erupted outside his local mosque after Friday prayers. Soldiers 
reportedly blindfolded and forced him into a vehicle, beating him as he was taken to a 
branch of the Military Security in Damascus. He was released in late October. In the 
intervening four months, the interviewee stated he had been interrogated multiple times 
about the organizers of demonstrations, with most of the questioning taking place in a small 
underground room. He described being beaten with electric wire and a hosepipe while 
being hung, suspended from the ceiling; being burnt with cigarettes and hot metal; being hit 
in the face resulting in a broken nose; and being threatened with rape. He stated he could 
hear other detainees screaming in nearby rooms, both during his interrogations and while 
held in cells. Marks, including cigarettes burns and other scars, were visible on the 
interviewee&#8217;s body at the time of interview.  
</p>
<p>14. A 17 year old boy interviewed by the commission had also been arrested after 
participating in a demonstration in southern Damascus in January 2012. Held until late 
October, he described being hung by his wrists and being given electric shocks in an Air 
Force Intelligence detention facility in Damascus.  
</p>
<p>15. Some children may have died under torture. The sister of a detainee in Aleppo said 
that her brother had informed her that in July, a boy aged about 15 died in a crowded cell of 
the Air Force Intelligence detention facility in Aleppo apparently after being tortured. 
Another Aleppo citizen reported finding the body of a child bearing the marks of torture 
near an Air Force Intelligence detention facility.  
</p>
<p>16. Physical assaults also took place at checkpoints and in the course of attacks by 
security forces. A former soldier, now defected, said he was deployed at a checkpoint in 
Hama in July and witnessed a 17 year old boy, who was a cancer patient, being beaten, 
after being found with revolutionary songs stored on his mobile phone.  
</p>
<p>17. There are reasonable grounds to believe that children are tortured at checkpoints, in 
house searches and in detention. Children&#8217;s detention in the same conditions as adults 
contravenes Syrian and international law. One outcome of this mixed detention regime is 
that children have been routinely subjected to the same systems of torture that adults face.  </p>


<p><b>82</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> E. Attacks on schools and hospitals; children&#8217;s rights to health and 
education 
</b></p>
<p>18. Syria has over 20,000 schools, and in 2010 its school enrolment, attendance and 
completion rates compared favourably with those of the region. In the current conflict, 
various credible reports suggest that between 2,400 and 3,900 schools have been damaged 
by military operations. Thousands more have been converted into shelters for displaced 
persons, undermining access to education particularly in contested areas where 
displacement is high. The pace of displacement is likely to bring further pressure to bear on 
educational infrastructure. Other schools have been taken over by anti-Government armed 
groups (see below).  
</p><p>19. The commission has collected accounts of Government attacks on at least 17 
schools. In some cases, schools were reportedly being used as bases for anti-Government 
armed groups, thereby losing their status as protected civilian objects. However, there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that other attacks on schools were unlawful and in some 
cases deliberate. One soldier from an army brigade stationed in Dara&#8217;a said that his 
commanding officer had verbally given an order to hit schools harshly &#8220;so that they don&#8217;t 
go out on demonstrations.&#8221; The soldier said that he had defected because the army was 
attacking children and schools without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>20. Areas contested or held by anti-Government armed groups have significantly lower 
attendance rates. Security forces have a presence around some schools, and families 
sometimes prevent their children from attending out of fear for their safety &#8211; in some cases 
school children have been threatened directly. Attacks on schools sometimes lead to 
displacements of entire families: a woman from rural Dara&#8217;a said that families had left her 
village one week after the girls&#8217; secondary school was shelled in January 2013, killing one 
student and injuring another. Many had moved to a nearby village which they believed the 
Government was protecting for sectarian reasons.  
</p>
<p>21. The conflict has deeply affected health services. Hospitals have come under direct 
attack (see A/HRC/22/59, annex XII). A worker at Dar Al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo said 
that a Government helicopter had fired nine missiles at the hospital in August. Syrian 
security forces have forced medical staff to inform on children wounded in Government 
offensives and deny them treatment. One 12 year old boy who was helping evacuate 
wounded children on a city street in Damascus in July was seriously injured by 
indiscriminate fire from an army vehicle. He said that the young people who took him to 
hospital, his father, and medical staff all told him to say that he had been shot by 
&#8220;terrorists,&#8221; but he insisted on telling the truth. Doctors there continued to treat him while 
warning him of the risks that he was bringing on himself.  
</p>
<p>22. Elsewhere, doctors and others have refused treatment to wounded children. One man 
from rural Dara&#8217;a said that when a school in rural Dara&#8217;a was shelled, his fleeing 11 year 
old sister was hit and seriously injured. Rescuers tried to take her to hospital in the garrison 
town from where the shelling came, but military checkpoints on the way refused to let her 
pass. Her rescuers reached the hospital by back roads, and staff at the hospital there refused 
to treat her, saying that it was a military hospital (her rescuers believed that it was in fact 
civilian). Although she lost consciousness there, doctors insisted that she be moved to a 
hospital in a bigger town, where she died shortly after arrival.  
</p>
<p>23. In 2010, child health indicators in Syria compared favourably with those in the 
wider region. This progress is being threatened by the protracted conflict. Syrian 
pharmaceutical factories used to produce much of the country&#8217;s supply, but Syrian mothers 
of young children in northern Jordan told the commission that vaccines for children ceased 
to be available in Dara&#8217;a around June, and in Damascus around November. Imported </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>83 
</b></p>
<p>medication is no longer available, they said, and children requiring complex or continuous 
treatment face serious difficulties.  
</p>
<p><b> F. The use of children in hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>24. When Syria acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2003, it made a declaration 
which said that the enlistment of under-18s was prohibited. The draft Military Law (1953), 
which regulates recruitment, states that males are liable for recruitment in the year that they 
reach the age of 19. Before the conflict began, prospective conscripts would present 
themselves to local conscription offices to collect their military service papers on reaching 
</p><p>18. Within 12 months, these conscripts would join different units after a medical 
examination, for 21 or 24 months of compulsory service. Today, official conscription 
systems are disintegrating, at the same time that the Government&#8217;s need for military 
personnel becomes ever more urgent. The Government&#8217;s approaches to addressing this 
need for soldiers may lead it to disregard formerly well-established age distinctions.  
</p>
<p>25. With many young men evading official conscription systems, the Government is 
enlisting young men arrested at checkpoints or during attacks on civilian areas. As 
Government control over Syrian territory shrinks, checkpoints play ever more important 
roles in the relationship between Government and people. Interviewees from rural Dara&#8217;a 
said that security forces check payment of water and electricity bills at checkpoints. 
Security forces sometimes separate very young children from their parents and ask them 
leading questions, such as &#8220;What do you think of President Bashar Al-Assad?&#8221; Checkpoints 
have become part of the conscription system in areas where Government control is tenuous. 
A 19 year old evading conscription said that he was subjected to humiliating treatment in 
checkpoints in the Dara&#8217;a area. Another interviewee said that boys aged 12 and over would 
face such harassment. One woman with a well-built 14 year old son said that he would be 
questioned about conscription at each of the checkpoints separating her village from Dara&#8217;a 
city.  
</p>
<p>26. Some (but not all) interviewees believed that this method of recruitment was 
bringing under-18s into the Syrian armed forces. A defector from Dara&#8217;a stated: &#8220;They 
arrest youth aged from 16&#8211;18 at the checkpoints ... They take them to the military security 
branch in Dara&#8217;a and then they beat them up. Some of them who have problems [with the 
authorities] are taken to Air Force Intelligence where they may be detained or liquidated. If 
you&#8217;re not proved to have taken part in the events, they take you to the army. They take you 
to the [local branch of the] military police &#8230; to the military conscription department, and 
they send you to distant governorates. That [new] system started from the beginning of the 
events. Military service was from 18, now it&#8217;s anyone who turns up at checkpoints.&#8221; Other 
defectors stated that leaving the army had never been an easy task, and was now practically 
impossible, so great was the need for soldiers. 
</p>
<p>27. The Government&#8217;s establishment of militia is linked to its need for military 
personnel. These militia are often drawn from sectarian constituencies. They use a mix of 
sectarian affiliation, kinship systems and ready cash to fill their ranks. This may lead to the 
recruitment of under-age soldiers.  
</p>
<p>28. The Government&#8217;s different affiliated militia are not always easy to distinguish from 
each other. Popular Committees are often seen as local, self-defence groups formed in 
Government-aligned neighbourhoods. They are sometimes conflated with <i>Shabbiha</i>, 
although that term is sometimes associated with harsh, muscled fighters drawn from the 
core of the security apparatus or the Government&#8217;s most trusted sectarian constituencies, 
rather than from under-age youth. The evidence suggests that both these groups are using 
children for active participation in hostilities.  </p>


<p><b>84</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>29. A soldier who recently defected from a military base in an area where the majority 
of the population comes from the Alawi sect, with which many of the highest officials in 
the Government and security forces are associated, said that local young people would 
come and take weapons from the base. He believed that they were part of a Government 
affiliated militia. &#8220;Every day people came, fifty to a hundred. People would identify 
themselves with civilian IDs [no regular soldiers have civilian IDs]. Some of them were 
aged 16. When I saw them I asked, &#8216;What are you doing here?&#8217; They answered, &#8216;We are 
here to fight as volunteers.&#8217;&#8221; Recruits received one week&#8217;s weapons training, or no training 
at all.  
</p>
<p>30. Kinship groups, called houses (Arabic <i>buyut</i>, singular <i>bayt</i>) are used to identify 
sectarian affiliation and loyalty, and the use of kinship groups may lead to the recruitment 
of children. One refugee who had witnessed the start of a house-to-house attack by 
Government affiliated militia on Deir Baalbeh, a largely Sunni area in Homs said that many 
of the attackers were drawn from Alawite and Shi&#8217;a areas nearby, and he listed the <i>buyut</i> 
from which they were drawn. He said that the youngest attackers were 15 or 16 years of 
age. This recruitment takes place in a society that has been rapidly impoverished by conflict 
&#8211; some people can afford only one meal a day. Participation in Government affiliated 
militia brings immediate cash rewards, payable by shift or by month, according to different 
observers.  
</p>
<p>31. The commission has collected accounts of the use of under-age children as 
informers. One former soldier who defected to an anti-Government armed group said that 
the youngest informers used by the government were 12 years old. Some of these young 
informers are caught and detained in prisons run by anti-Government armed groups. One 16 
year old who was probably his family&#8217;s main breadwinner, was reportedly paid 5,000 
Syrian pounds a month. All parties to the conflict punish spies and informers severely, 
often with judicial or extra-judicial execution. 
</p><p>32. Using children under 15 for active participation in hostilities is a war crime under 
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and &#8220;active participation&#8221; covers 
activities such as scouting, spying, sabotage and the use of children as decoys or couriers.  
</p>
<p><b>  Findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p>33. Children have been killed in many of the recent explosions in Syria&#8217;s larger cities 
over the reporting period. Reports of multiple instances of children killed by snipers were 
received (see A/HRC/22/59, annex XI). As all parties to the conflict employ snipers, it is 
frequently unclear which party is responsible for any given child&#8217;s death. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>34. The threat of sexual violence is often implied in the abduction of women and girls. 
An FSA soldier stated that the FSA had abducted the mother and daughters of a sniper who 
was part of a Government affiliated militia, in Dara&#8217;a in late 2012. The sniper was detained 
by the Government in order to prevent him from surrendering to the FSA; the women were 
reportedly released unharmed. Another FSA soldier stated that four members of the FSA </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>had taken part in a rape in Aleppo in October&#8211; they may have subsequently been prosecuted 
in a court linked to an armed faction.  
</p>
<p>35. The commission has come across many reports at second-hand that suggest that 
sexual violence has become routinized in operations by the security forces. One woman 
said that she believed that a thousand women had been raped in an attack on Al-Ihraq in 
Dara&#8217;a governorate in August. She said that local leaders ask a young man to marry an 
unmarried survivors of rape, &#8220;if he is willing to protect her&#8221; (using the Arabic phrase <i>yustur</i> 
<i>&#8216;alayha</i>, which connotes protecting, covering and condoning). Other interviewees from 
Homs and Dara&#8217;a said that several unmarried women or girls were married to FSA fighters 
after being subjected to rape. Many perceive these marriages as an attempt to come to terms 
with a crisis of sexual violence. However, such marriages may skirt important questions of 
consent and run the risk of re-victimising the women and girls concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Use of schools 
</b></p>
<p>36. Anti-Government armed groups occasionally occupy schools as barracks or bases. 
This has contributed to a widespread belief that schools are not safe, and undermined rights 
to education in areas controlled or contested by anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Use of children in hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>37. Closing schools, or putting them on the front-line of the conflict in this way imposes 
a life of isolation and idleness on thousands of children, which can push children towards 
conflict. Children have relatively limited analytical resources for understanding a conflict 
which has taxed the interpretative abilities of many &#8211; yet they have to try and understand 
their coercive environment, and incidents of violence which transform their lives for the 
worse. One 11 year old girl, who lost a close friend and her father in shelling said she 
believed they were martyrs, and that she wanted to be a martyr herself. 
</p>
<p>38. Teenage boys face particular pressures because they attract the attention of security 
forces early on. Interviewees from Dara&#8217;a said that boys aged as young as 12 attracted 
apprehension and violence from Government soldiers at checkpoints. This kind of 
challenge can push young males towards a fascinated preoccupation with violence, or a 
desire to act as a protector. For many parents, the fear that their young sons will start 
experimenting with violence is a reason to send their sons out of the country. One refugee 
camp near the Syrian border had received almost 500 unaccompanied children at the 
beginning of 2013. Ninety-seven percent of them were boys, nearly all of them over 14. 
Many of them are leaving their country and the protection of their families because they 
fear enlistment.  
</p>
<p>39. For some under-age boys, the harassment at checkpoints, or the loss of a family 
member pushes them towards active participation in the conflict. One boy who said he was 
17, but looked significantly younger, joined the Al-Nusra Front in early 2012. He said he 
had made the decision to join after his sister died and his home was destroyed in shelling. 
He believed that the armed group was the only means by which his family could be 
protected from further loss. Several interviewees said that this participation was voluntary 
and some said that it may happen with the encouragement of parents. The commission 
spoke to one father who supported the decision of two sons, both aged under 18, to join the 
FSA as fighters. Both died within weeks.  
</p>
<p>40. There is little tangible evidence to suggest that under-age boys are forcibly 
conscripted into anti-Government armed groups, which draw many of their recruits from 
defecting adult soldiers. However, both adult and child members of these armed groups </p>


<p><b>86</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>stated that volunteers under 18 are enlisted. In order to join an armed group, a recruit 
merely needs to present himself to a local commander, who can be contacted through any 
armed man in a neighbourhood where anti-Government armed groups operate. Most 
recruits join in their own neighbourhood, where family members can vouch for them. Many 
interviewees associated with anti-Government armed groups said that it was very 
straightforward to leave them &#8211; recruits need only hand in their weapon to the commander. 
This suggests that participation in these groups remains voluntary.  
</p>
<p>41. The 17 year old boy who joined the Al-Nusra Front said that at first, he participated 
by delivering food and water to fighters. Eventually, he was given a weapon and took part 
in attacks. He described one attack on a checkpoint when Government soldiers who were 
injured were left to die. Other Government soldiers were captured and he believed that they 
would be tried by a court organized by the armed group, and executed if found guilty of 
killing civilians. The interviewee eventually left active participation in hostilities because of 
an injury sustained in combat. But there are no safe jobs in anti-Government armed groups 
&#8211; Government agents arrest and torture people carrying too much bread or medicine. Under 
18s have not undergone military training and consequently some are put to work as guards 
in detention centres, potentially drawing them into the ill-treatment of detainees. A member 
of the Government security forces who said that he had been detained and tortured by an 
anti-Government armed group near Aleppo in October said that he was guarded by very 
young men, aged 17 to 20. An uncorroborated video posted on the internet at the beginning 
of January 2013 apparently shows a child associated with an anti-Government armed group 
beheading a prisoner. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Unlawful detention of children 
</b></p>
<p>42. There is some evidence suggesting that detention facilities controlled by anti-
Government armed groups detain children. The commander of a detention facility run by an 
anti-Government armed group in rural Damascus said that he had detained a 16 year old 
informer. A soldier in an anti-Government armed group said that he had arrested members 
of an allied group who were abducting a 14 year old boy in Aleppo in October. The boy 
shouted to them from inside a vehicle that he had been abducted, and his abductors claimed 
he was a member of the <i>Shabbiha</i>, and from a <i>Shabbiha</i> family. The other anti-Government 
soldiers at the scene established that this was not the case, and the boy was released. 
Investigations are on-going. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>43. The rights of children have been violated by Government forces, in particular 
violating the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) by detaining them with adults, 
violating the Convention against Torture (CAT) and Common Article three of the Geneva 
Conventions by subjecting them to torture and other ill-treatment, and using them in 
hostilities in violation of international criminal law and possibly also the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict (CRC-OPAC). Other crimes are visited upon children, such as unlawful killing, 
sexual violence, and indiscriminate attack, as detailed in other sections of this report. 
Evidence indicates their rights to education have also been infringed. 
</p>
<p>44. Anti-Government armed groups are also responsible for using children under the age 
of 18 in hostilities in violation of the CRC-OPAC, which by its terms applies to non-State 
actors. Where those children are under the age of 15, those recruiting them may be liable 
under international criminal law. Other crimes perpetrated against children by anti-</p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>87 
</b></p>
<p>Government armed groups, such as unlawful killing, torture and sexual violence may 
amount to war crimes. </p>

<p><b>Annex XI 
</b></p>
<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Unlawful attacks</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. This reporting period has been characterised by increasingly violent and 
indiscriminate attacks on densely populated urban areas, with Damascus suffering aerial 
bombardment for the first time since the beginning of the conflict. The intensification of 
shelling and aerial bombardments has caused significant civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>2. The conflict in Syria has evolved into a war of attrition that has increasingly put 
civilians at risk. Anti-Government armed groups conduct their operations from within 
densely populated civilian areas, putting civilians in the line of fire and causing them to flee 
their homes. By using civilian objects, such as schools for military purposes, anti-
Government armed groups subject civilians to the dangers of war.  
</p><p>3. Government forces conduct their military operations in flagrant disregard of the 
distinction between civilians and persons directly participating in hostilities.  
</p>
<p>4. The dynamics of the conflict have become increasingly complex. The war has 
become coloured by veins of sectarianism, permeated by opportunistic criminality, and 
aggravated by the presence of foreign fighters and extremist groups.  
</p>
<p>5. Extensive aerial and long-range mortar and artillery capabilities remain in the hands 
of Government forces. One hundred and seventy-eight interviewees spoke about shelling 
and aerial bombardments by Government forces. One third of all victims recorded by the 
commission are children.  
</p>
<p>6. Anti-Government armed groups have gained some artillery and mortar capability, 
which have so far been recorded as utilised only in attacks against military objectives such 
as airfields and bases. Lack of access to Syria has significantly hampered the investigation 
into the conduct of hostilities by anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Aleppo governorate 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Aleppo city 
</i></p>
<p>7. In the first days of Ramadan, starting 20 July, FSA and other anti-Government 
armed group fighters entered Aleppo city. Soon thereafter, the city was subjected to heavy 
shelling and aerial bombardment by Government forces. Mash-had, Salah Al-Din, Al-
Shaar, and Al-Sukri neighbourhoods whose residents were supportive of the opposition, 
were heavily shelled by mortar and artillery from army bases in Al-Zahra, Al-Ramousi, 
Nayrab airport and Masakin Hananou. Syrian military airplanes and helicopters were 
reported as having indiscriminately dropped &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; on civilian objects causing loss 
of life and significant destruction of civilian property, failing to take the necessary 
precautions in attack. Interviewees consistently cited the danger and destruction caused by 
indiscriminate shelling as the reason they fled Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>a
 See A/HRC/21/50, Annex II for the applicable law. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>89 
</b></p>
<p>8. Several defectors interviewed provide insight into the conduct of the armed forces&#8217; 
military operations. According to one, a commander in an Aleppo-based airfield ordered 
the shelling of civilian neighbourhoods with artillery and from helicopters. He indicated 
that the current commander [name withheld] ordered civilian neighbourhoods to be fired 
upon at close range. Their first target was Al-Hanafiyeh neighbourhood, near the base, 
which was shelled to prevent anti-Government armed groups from using it to attack the 
airport. If confirmed, these individuals would be individually criminally responsible for the 
war crime of attacking civilians.  
</p>
<p>9. Ten of those interviewed provided evidence of systematic attacks on bread lines and 
bakeries in Aleppo. A bakery near Al-Hilwaniya was hit by artillery fire in early August, 
killing 11 people who had been queuing for bread, many of them children. On 16 August at 
05:00, Al-Zarrah bakery in Qadi Askar was shelled with mortar fire from the nearby Al-
Ramousa military compound. The mortars hit queues of people lining up for bread, killing 
25 and injuring over 50 persons. In Mare&#8217;a, northern Aleppo, a line of people queuing for 
bread was hit on 22 August by a &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; dropped 25 metres away from the bakery. 
Between August and December, Qadi Askar, Iderbi, Al-Sakhour, Aguoir, Masakin 
Hananou and Al-Moysar bakeries were all bombarded during the morning hours, when 
people were lining up for bread. One interviewee witnessed the aerial bombardment of a 
bakery in Aleppo in August, describing in detail the scene of the attack which resulted in 
the deaths of 20 people. On 23 October, a bakery in Masakin Hananou was shelled at 
sunset, killing 4 persons, one of whom was a young girl who was decapitated as a result of 
the mortar attack. An interviewee who worked as a volunteer in Dar Al-Shifa hospital in 
Aleppo said that the hospital received victims of the bread line bombings, many of whom 
were women and children who suffered from severe injuries.  
</p><p>10. Several interviews indicated the presence of anti-Government armed group members 
during bread distribution. One interviewee stated that the owner of one of the bakeries had 
requested the FSA to be present to organize and maintain the order of persons queuing for 
bread. Other sources suggested that anti-Government group members were gathering bread 
either to distribute to the population or for their own consumption.  
</p>
<p>11. The bombardment of bread lines and bakeries amounts to violence aimed at 
spreading terror among the civilian population in violation of customary international 
humanitarian law. The bakeries have consistently been attacked when most crowded. The 
timing of the attacks has often been in the morning when the concentration of civilians was 
highest or right before iftar, the breaking of the fast during Ramadan. In most cases, such as 
the Halfaya bakery attack discussed below, the attacks were conducted the day after flour 
was delivered to the bakery, following a protracted shortage. As a result of the shelling and 
aerial bombardment of bakeries, dozens have closed in Aleppo, contributing to the 
shortages of food and deterioration of the humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p>12. The maintenance of order by members of armed groups in the vicinity of the 
breadlines does not legitimise the targeting of breadlines as such. The presence of large 
numbers of civilians (interviewees consistently describe queues of hundreds of people) 
renders any attack on a breadline disproportionate and clearly in excess of the concrete and 
direct military advantage anticipated from killing a small number of anti-Government 
members engaged in non-combatant activities. Syrian armed forces have attacked civilians 
engaged in a typical civilian activity, in areas where civilians in high concentrations were 
expected to be found.  
</p>
<p>13. Interviews with members of the Syrian Air Force, now defected, indicate that the 
aerial bombardment of Al-Sakhour and Masakin Hananou, where bakery queues were 
bombed in August, was carried out from the Rasm Al-Aboud military base under the 24th 
Division of the Air Force. Orders for the bombardment of these localities were given 
directly by the commander of the base, [name withheld] and his deputy [name withheld].  </p>


<p><b>90</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>14. The same interviewees described the Air Force&#8217;s failure to take measures to avoid 
civilian casualties in their targeting of civilian areas. Airstrikes were directly targeted at 
populated areas. Loss of civilian life was reportedly expected, and at times intended. No 
warnings were given to the civilian population, nor were any other precautions in attack 
taken. One interviewee described how areas in which the armed groups operated or where 
people had previously demonstrated against the regime, were viewed as an incubator of the 
insurgency and thus targetable. The Air Force targeted these areas, he stated, &#8220;as a kind of 
punishment.&#8221; The aerial bombardment and shelling of civilian areas and objects, such as 
densely populated areas, farms, commercial areas and civilian vehicles, was intentional, 
aiming to force civilian residents of an area to ask anti-Government armed groups to leave 
their area. Civilian vehicles entering or departing opposition-held areas were targeted as 
they were considered suspicious and possibly transporting fighters or supplies for anti-
Government armed groups. The commission recalls that the intentional targeting of 
civilians is a war crime. 
</p>
<p>15. Aleppo has been divided between Government forces and anti-Government armed 
groups, with both parties positioning snipers on top of buildings and at the entry to main 
roads to control the movement of people. The majority of interviewees injured by sniper 
fire stated that they had been hit by Government snipers. This belief stemmed from their 
having been struck by bullets that were fired from the direction of visible military bases 
and, in one instance, from snipers on top of a government hospital. In such instances, the 
conduct of the persons was such that they should have been presumed to be civilians. 
Interviewees who were in Aleppo during the reporting period described how snipers 
targeted people passing certain areas, regardless of whether they were fighters or civilians. 
Dar Al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo received persons, including women and children, whose 
injuries were typical of sniper fire.  
</p><p>16. The firing on an individual by a sniper is inherently deliberate and targeted. There is 
a reasonable basis to believe that the firing on civilians by snipers constitute attacks that 
are, at the very least, indiscriminate as to their target, and were carried out recklessly, or the 
deliberate targeting of civilians as the object of the attack. Patterns of sniping continue to be 
investigated.  
</p>
<p><i>  Andan 
</i></p>
<p>17. The town of Mia&#8217;arat Al-Artiq near Andan was heavily shelled on a daily basis in 
early September by mortar fire from Jamiat Al-Zahraa, an army base. In interviews, former 
residents of the town described the fear experienced by civilians hiding from the incessant 
mortar fire and the devastation that the shelling caused, killing and injuring civilians who 
were looking for shelter following the destruction of their homes.  
</p>
<p>18. The shelling of Andan from Jamiat Al-Zahraa continued from late September into 
late October. Interviewees provided the names of persons killed by shrapnel from mortar 
fire while at home or attempting to evacuate their families.  
</p>
<p>19. Information collected indicates that the attacks carried out on Andan did not 
distinguish between civilian and military objectives. The Syrian military forces carrying out 
the attacks did not assess whether their conduct would cause excessive incidental loss of 
life, in violation of customary principles of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><i>  Azaz 
</i></p>
<p>20. In the afternoon of 15 August, the town of Azaz was subjected to heavy aerial 
bombardment from two fighter jets. The aerial bombardment caused the deaths of tens of 
civilians, many of whom were children and elderly persons. Dozens of residential homes </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>91 
</b></p>
<p>were destroyed. The house of the Danoun family was directly hit, killing 20 family 
members.  
</p>
<p>21. According to interviewees who were residents of Azaz and who witnessed the 
bombardment on 15 August, the FSA had occupied two positions in Azaz, the former 
prison building and the former office of the Ba&#8217;ath Party.  
</p>
<p>22. According to UNITAR/UNOSAT, satellite imagery (see Figure 1), collected on 13 
August and 17 August 2012, shows the likely location of a munitions impact (see Figure 2). 
The imagery shows that the impacts caused the total destruction of at least six structures 
and the partial destruction and serious damage of 5&#8211;10 additional proximate structures. 
According to UNITAR/UNOSAT analysis, the pattern of destruction visible from satellite 
imagery is consistent with reports indicating that one or more air dropped munitions 
impacted the site. Further, UNITAR/UNOSAT identified imagery that shows a nearby 
cemetery possibly with 20 bodies prepared for burial on 17 August 2012 (see Figure 3). 
</p><p>23. Recorded accounts indicate that the town of Azaz was deliberately targeted in an 
indiscriminate manner from the Rasm Al-Aboud base north of Aleppo, operated by the 24th 
Division of the Syrian Air Force. 
</p>
<p>24. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the attack on Azaz was indiscriminate. 
In particular, the bombardment of the Danoun family home, which killed 20 members of 
the family, is indicative of a failure to take precautions in attack and verify targets. As 
recorded accounts indicate, the FSA had established itself in identifiable locations, which 
could have been targeted without causing such excessive loss of civilian life. The intended 
targeting of Azaz by the 24th Division of the Syrian Air Force without discriminating 
between military and civilian targets is a gross violation of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Tal Rifaat 
</i>25. Since Tal Rifaat came under FSA control in May 2012, the town has been shelled 
and subjected to aerial bombardment on an almost daily basis from Menag military airport 
approximately 5km north of Tal Rifaat. Since late July, Tal Rifaat has come under 
increasing aerial bombardment from fighter jets.  
26. On 4 August, the house of the Elbaw family was hit around 6:00 by a &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; 
dropped from a fighter jet, killing seven persons, including women and children. 
Information was collected from multiple individuals who helped those wounded in the 
attack and collected the bodies of those killed. Consistent accounts emphasised the 
devastation of the strike on the Elbaw family home. The individuals killed in the strike 
were decapitated and had limbs severed; one interviewee said, &#8220;It was impossible to 
recognise the bodies.&#8221; On 10 August, a fighter jet dropped a &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; on a residential 
house in Tal Rifaat, killing eight persons, among them an elderly man. The &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; 
also hit nearby houses, killing 16 persons, among them four children and five women. 
These residential areas were all located near Al-Shaheed Mohamed Aboud School, which 
the FSA had been using as accommodation.  
</p>
<p>27. In late July and early August, the market place and commercial areas in Tal Rifaat 
were also hit by rockets, killing civilians who were going about their daily activities.  
</p>
<p>28. The commission was unable to ascertain whether the aerial bombardment of the 
Elbaw family house was excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military 
advantage of attacking the nearby school, which was used by the FSA, and is thus unable to 
find sufficient grounds that the attack was disproportionate. The attacks on the market place 
and commercial areas in Tal Rifaat, however, are in violation of the obligation to do 
everything feasible to verify that targets are military in nature and distinguish civilian from 
military objectives.  </p>


<p><b>92</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><i>  Bab Al-Salama crossing 
</i></p>
<p>29. As civilians fled their homes from across Aleppo governorate to refugee camps in 
Turkey, many approached the border at the Bab Al-Salama crossing in northern Aleppo. 
There were consistent documented accounts that in early October, there was an airstrike on 
Sajou, a small village adjacent to Bab Al-Salama crossing. An estimated 200&#8211;300 people 
had sought shelter in a school in Sajou village. Around 06:00, civilians in the school heard 
the sound of an approaching fighter jet and in a panic, began to run out to seek shelter 
elsewhere. The fighter jet dropped a &#8220;barrel bomb,&#8221; killing over a dozen persons, many of 
whom were women and children. Approximately 10 were members of the Shahoud family.  
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Sahara 
</i></p>
<p>30. The village of Al-Sahara, due to its geostrategic location, has been used by the FSA 
and other anti-Government armed groups &#8212; including the Al-Nusra Front &#8212; as a 
recruitment and training location. On 3 August, the village came under sustained and heavy 
shelling and aerial bombardment, with shells and bombs hitting residential homes, farms 
and parks. Around 60 shells hit the village in one day, killing approximately 10 persons, 
among them women and children. The FSA and other anti-Government armed groups, 
including the Al-Nusra Front had been occupying residential homes and schools. According 
to interviewees who witnessed the shelling, the shelling and aerial bombardment was not 
targeted at any specific area and according to one former resident of Al-Sahara, the shelling 
appeared to be &#8220;like revenge or punishment to all the residents.&#8221; As a result of the shelling 
and aerial bombardment of the entirety of Al-Sahara, most of the houses in the village were 
destroyed or partially damaged. The shells were fired from Aurom Al-Sugra where the 46th 
Regiment is based.  
</p>
<p>31. An attack by bombardment (whether aerial or shelling) which treats as a single 
military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a 
city, town, village or area containing a concentration of civilians or civilian objects, 
amounts to &#8220;area bombardment,&#8221; which under international humanitarian law is 
indiscriminate and as such, prohibited. Such conduct, perpetrated by the Syrian armed 
forces is in violation of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Mare&#8217;a 
</i></p>
<p>32. Throughout this reporting period, Mare&#8217;a has been regularly attacked by 
Government forces. Accounts indicate that the area was shelled from the Infantry Military 
School in Aleppo. Recorded incidents demonstrate a pattern of indiscriminate and 
widespread shelling as well as indiscriminate firing on civilian targets. In August, shrapnel 
from mortar shelling injured civilians in Mare&#8217;a. On or about 1 September, a bus carrying 
civilians, among them women and children, from Mare&#8217;a to Azaz, was hit by shrapnel from 
the aerial bombardment of a nearby school and upon returning to Mare&#8217;a, the bus was hit 
directly by a &#8220;barrel bomb.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>33. On 11 September at 11:30, a fighter jet dropped a &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; on a gathering of 
workers loading potatoes into a cold storage warehouse, killing five and injuring many 
others. An interviewee who witnessed the attack said that the fighter jet had first dropped a 
&#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; on a nearby bakery that resulted in no casualties since the bakery was empty. 
According to the same interviewee, the fighter jet then returned, flying at a lower altitude 
before dropping the &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; on the workers at the warehouse, appearing to target any 
concentrated gathering of persons. In late December, the village of Harbal near Mare&#8217;a was 
subjected to aerial bombardment, with fighter jets dropping &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; on civilian 
areas. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>93 
</b></p>
<p>34. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the protracted campaign of shelling on 
Mare&#8217;a has been indiscriminate and in violation of the law of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Dara&#8217;a governorate 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Dara&#8217;a city 
</i></p>
<p>35. By late October, the shelling of Dara&#8217;a city had become unbearable for many 
residents. Interviewees cited the intensity of the shelling as the main reason they fled to 
Jordan. Multiple interviews documented incidents in August and November where 
Government snipers, positioned around Dara&#8217;a city, targeted and killed civilians, often 
when civilians were in walking in large crowds. In one incident on 24 August at 15:30, an 
unarmed man, wearing civilian clothes, was hit by sniper fire while participating in a 
peaceful demonstration. In another incident, on 30 November, civilians were hit by sniper 
fire while returning from Friday prayers at mosque at 11:30. Late at night, civilians were 
shot who violated the curfew. One victim of sniper fire in Dara&#8217;a was able to identify the 
sniper by name and noted that the sniper appeared to have license to &#8220;shoot whenever he 
wants.&#8221; Other interviewees confirmed that &#8220;snipers stay in their positions for months.&#8221; 
Several of the cases indicated that snipers had fired on people who were clearly engaged in 
civilian activities. 
</p>
<p><i>  Bosra 
</i></p>
<p>36. The town of Bosra has been subjected to heavy shelling and aerial bombardment 
since late August. Several interviewees who were witnesses to the bombardment of Bosra 
described how &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; were dropped on civilian gatherings, such as a funeral 
procession that was held in early September. The bombs were dropped from such a height 
as to make accurate targeting impossible.  
</p>
<p>37. Interviewees have described that in response to the presence of anti-Government 
armed groups in Bosra, Government forces have shelled the town without discriminating 
between those groups and civilian objectives. The humanitarian condition of Bosra and the 
occupation and targeting of Old Bosra Castle, addressed in the section on specifically 
protected objects and persons, are also of concern. Interviewees relayed accounts of how 
family members were targeted and killed by snipers positioned within Old Bosra Castle.  
</p>
<p>38. The documented instance of the bombardment of a funeral procession is in violation 
of the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law. The method, namely 
the use of a &#8220;barrel bomb&#8221; from a high altitude, demonstrates a failure to take all feasible 
precautions in attack. Firing on civilian gatherings has been adjudicated as an example of 
violence aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population, in violation of the laws of 
armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><i>  Mhajjah 
</i>39. The shelling of Mhajjah began on 10 August and intensified in late September and 
early October in the lead up towards a ground attack on 14 October. According to 
interviewees, the town was shelled as retaliation against defectors. Victims described how 
they and their family members were injured by mortar fire and shrapnel while they were in 
their homes. One interviewee, whose wife and two nephews were killed when a shell hit 
their home at 22:00, said that Mhajjah was shelled daily between 20:00 and 24:00 and that 
the shelling was &#8220;random.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>40. The accounts collected by the commission indicate that the shelling of Mhajjah 
amounted to a protracted campaign of indiscriminate and widespread shelling, during </p>


<p><b>94</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>which the Government forces failed to take feasible precautions to avoid or minimise the 
incidental loss of life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. 
</p>
<p><i>  Harak 
</i></p>
<p>41. The shelling of Harak began in July and continued into January 2013. Government 
armed forces took control of key strategic checkpoints within Harak on 25 August, and 
since then, have continued shelling areas of the town that remain under the control of anti-
Government armed groups. Recorded accounts indicate that the systematic and protracted 
shelling of Harak is at the very least indiscriminate and appears to be targeted at primarily 
if not entirely residential neighbourhoods. Those carrying out the shelling exhibit a 
disregard for the loss of civilian life.  
</p>
<p><i>  Tafas  
</i>42. Multiple accounts have been collected of the shelling of Tafas, which was followed 
by ground operations carried out by various Government security forces and affiliated 
militia. The intensity of the shelling was noted by each interviewee, with estimates that 
between 260&#8211;350 munitions were fired at the town for days at a time. The shelling 
intensified around mid-November and continued into December. The shelling caused the 
deaths and injuries of hundreds of civilians in Tafas as many civilian targets were 
repeatedly hit. On 19 December, two shells hit a crowded marketplace in Tafas, killing at 
least 10 civilians, among them young children. Thirteen civilians were killed and more than 
80 injured from shelling and shrapnel on 25 December.  
43. The firing of 260&#8211;350 munitions into populated areas is a method of warfare that is 
indicative of a failure to take all feasible precautions with a view to avoiding or minimizing 
the incidental loss of life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. Tafas was 
shelled for a protracted period, during which civilian targets suffered indiscriminate fire, in 
violation of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Villages of Al-Karak, Umsifra, Um Walad, Lajjah and Kherbet Ghazallah 
</i>44. The villages of Al-Karak, Umsifra and Um Walad, located south and southwest of 
Al-Thaala military airport, controlled by the 24th Air Force Division and Battalion 1023, 
have been subjected to sustained shelling for a considerable period of the conflict. The 
villages were shelled by mortar, tank fire and from helicopter gunships. A defector from the 
Air Force described how he was given orders by [name withheld] to shell the villages if he 
heard any gun fire, making no distinction between civilians and military targets. The 
interviewee stated, &#8220;We bombarded and shelled to chase the FSA out of the village, 
because if they stayed they could attack us. The Commander, [name withheld] wanted to 
protect the base regardless of method, that is why his orders were to shell heavily.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>45. The information collected, including the above first-hand account, indicates that 
Government forces are conducting hostilities in violation of the principles of the law of 
armed conflict, making no distinction between civilians and fighters, conducting area 
bombardment, and taking no precautions in the choice of means and methods of warfare.  
</p>
<p>46. There are corroborated accounts that the village of Lajjah has been used by the FSA 
as a base. FSA fighters and defectors had sought shelter in the Lajjah area due to its rugged 
terrain. The village itself and surrounding towns such as Izra, have been indiscriminately 
bombarded with &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; from fighter jets and subjected to intense shelling, as a 
result of which the villages are almost completely destroyed. The FSA has located military 
objectives within densely populated civilian areas, violating the principle of distinction 
under international humanitarian law.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>95 
</b></p>
<p>47. The village of Kherbet Ghazallah, which is located along the Damascus &#8211; Dara&#8217;a 
highway, was heavily shelled on 5 August, after an FSA unit attempted to capture and 
ultimately killed the Chief of Political Security in Dara&#8217;a while he was travelling along the 
highway. This incident provoked Government forces to shell the village, killing civilians, 
among them women and children. One interviewee described how schools in Kherbet 
Ghazallah were targeted. Another interviewee, who was an FSA fighter in the Kherbet 
Ghazallah area, relayed that when an intermediary well-respected by both Government 
forces and anti-Government armed groups, attempted to diffuse the conflict, he was told by 
Government forces to pass on the message that &#8220;for each bullet the FSA fires on the 
[Damascus &#8211; Dara&#8217;a] highway, we will fire ten artillery shells into the town.&#8221; Other villages 
in the area, such as Western Garyiah, were also subject to heavy and indiscriminate mortar 
shelling.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Damascus governorate 
</b></p>
<p>48. Twenty-two interviews conducted paint a picture of entire neighbourhoods of 
suburban Damascus being shelled and destroyed by Government forces as part of their 
urban warfare against elements from anti-Government armed groups. Between late July and 
November, the neighbourhoods of Dahadeel, Al-Midan, Sayyidah Zaynab, and Al-
Tadamon were heavily shelled and subject to aerial bombardment from helicopters. These 
attacks were often followed by ground offenses and by further large scale destruction (see 
A/HRC/22/59, annex XIII). During the ground offensives, snipers were positioned at 
strategic locations, such as on top of buildings and at the entrance to main roads, to control 
movement. According to interviewee accounts, many civilians were killed by sniper fire.  
</p>
<p>49. In late August, a ten-day Government offensive on Al-Tal against the FSA resulted 
in high casualties among anti-Government armed groups operating in the area. Witnesses to 
the attack, which was carried out through heavy mortar shelling and firing from helicopters, 
described how Government forces deliberately attacked civilian objects, including bakeries, 
make-shift hospitals, commercial areas and infrastructure, motivated by a fear that the FSA 
would use them. Interviewees noted that during the offensive, most civilian casualties were 
caused by sniper fire.  
</p>
<p>50. An interviewee who defected from the brigade that operated from the military base 
at Al-Mazzah Airport, described how in their planning of hostilities, namely airstrikes in 
Duma, Arbin and Daraya, the commanders within the armed forces were aware of the 
presence of civilians in areas under attack, but did not take any precautions to avoid the 
incidental loss of civilian life. The interviewee also described how civilians in areas where 
the FSA operated, were considered by Government forces to be cooperating with the FSA 
and thus targetable. The interviewee said that the commander of the brigade, [name 
withheld] ordered: &#8220;there are some terrorist groups in the area, go and bomb them.&#8221;  
</p><p>51. A defector from a Special Forces branch of the infantry that operated in Damascus 
governorate, relayed accounts of how the Major that led their division, [name withheld], 
considered all areas in which the FSA and other anti-Government armed groups operated to 
be &#8220;areas supportive of terrorists.&#8221; These areas were surrounded by Government forces. 
Orders were given to shell these areas to force the terrorists out.  
</p>
<p>52. In attacking Zabadani, the abovementioned Major allegedly gave orders to &#8220;destroy 
the town.&#8221; In the planning and execution of military operations, the presence of a civilian 
population was not considered and no estimates were made as to collateral damage. The 
interviewee said that the operations were guided by the view that if civilians &#8220;happened to 
be&#8221; in the areas where the FSA or other anti-Government armed groups are operating, they 
were supporting the FSA and thus legitimate targets.  </p>


<p><b>96</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>53. The Al-Ghutah area east of Damascus has been the scene of confrontations between 
Syrian armed forces and anti-Government armed groups during the reporting period. On 31 
October, the entire area was subject to heavy aerial bombardment resulting in considerable 
civilian casualties. A civilian nurse from Zabadani in western Damascus governorate noted 
that the many civilians injured in November and December 2012 were victims of sniper 
fire.  
</p>
<p>54. Such conduct violates the principle of distinction and amounts to a violation of 
international humanitarian law. Further investigation is required to determine how such 
orders were conveyed and implemented within the chain of command. However, there 
exists a prima facie case that the war crime of attacking civilians was perpetrated, and that 
the individuals who were responsible for ordering the attacks and military commanders 
who carried them out are individually criminally responsible for the commission of this war 
crime.  
</p>
<p>55. As noted, attacks by bombardment (whether aerial or by shelling) on a 
neighbourhood, which treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and 
distinct military objectives located in a neighbourhood containing a concentration of 
civilians or civilian objects, is &#8220;area bombardment&#8221;, which is inherently indiscriminate and 
in violation of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Idlib governorate 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Al-Habit 
</i></p>
<p>56. The town of Al-Habit, the western part of which was occupied by FSA elements, 
was shelled on 28 July by tanks positioned at nearby checkpoints. According to residents of 
Al-Habit and witnesses to the attack, the shelling targeted only the western part of Al-
Habit, indicating that the Syrian military was selective in its targeting. The shelling, 
however, killed civilians who were in their homes in the western part as well as those who 
were out on the streets. The attack was conducted at 15:00 after the <i>Dhur</i> prayer. Among 
those killed and injured were women and children. One interviewee described how bodies 
of 8 and 10 year old children were strewn about the area.  
</p>
<p>57. During the attack on Al-Habit, army helicopters fired at the streets of the town in 
order to prevent movement, killing civilians who were attempting to escape the shelling. 
The shelling of Al-Habit was notably intense. One interviewee stated that in one day, 48 
shells landed within a one-kilometre perimeter, raising the spectre of area bombardment 
and indiscriminate attack.  
</p>
<p><i>  Taftanaz 
</i>58. Five consistent accounts were received relating to the intense shelling and aerial 
bombardment of Taftanaz, which began in July and continued throughout the month of 
Ramadan. Most of the residents of Taftanaz fled, unable to find shelter from the shelling 
and airstrikes within the town. One interviewee, a former resident of Taftanaz described the 
situation, stating, &#8220;It is like a ghost city. From 20,000 inhabitants there are hardly some 200 
people left in the city.&#8221; Snipers were positioned around Taftanaz, particularly on the road 
leading to the airport, which led to the deaths of civilians. One account described how a 
woman was shot by a sniper and bled to death on the street. Persons attempting to assist her 
were also injured by sniper fire.  
59. Sniper fire, as the direct targeting of individuals at a distance using small calibre 
weapons, is highly accurate. There is evidence to suggest that civilian victims of sniper fire 
have been deliberately targeted, a war crime. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>97 
</b></p>
<p>60. The commission recorded an account from a defector from the Air Force in 
Taftanaz. The commanders of the Air Force Brigade in Taftanaz, [names withheld], 
reportedly gave orders to pilots, &#8220;There are armed terrorist groups operating [in a particular 
village or area]. Go destroy them all.&#8221; The interviewee emphasised that no additional orders 
were given on targeting and there was no target selection. The interviewee said that the 
pilots given such orders understood them to mean to destroy a village or area in its entirety. 
The weapons and means of warfare used were indiscriminate. Another interviewee 
described how the missiles and bombs used were unguided, and, when combined with the 
height at which helicopters flew, made targeting impossible, or at best, inaccurate. The 
flying height was determined by officers in the control tower of the air base, and was 
usually between 1&#8211;2 kilometres above the ground. According to an interviewee, &#8220;There is 
no way that you could pick out targets from this height and with these weapons. An 
unguided bomb dropped from a helicopter flying at a height of one kilometre could land 
anywhere within a 100m radius.&#8221; &#8220;We would drop bombs randomly.&#8221; The reasoning behind 
this approach to the conduct of hostilities was, according to one of the commanders of the 
air base, &#8220;If they [the civilians] didn&#8217;t want the terrorists, they would have forced them out 
before we got there. Anyone who supports the terrorists is a terrorist themselves.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Karnfbel 
</i>61. The town of Karnfbel was subject to heavy aerial bombardment on 17 October, 
hitting civilians in a commercial area of the town. The commission has recorded the names 
of 10 civilians killed in the attack, among them women and children.  
</p>
<p><i>  Sarmin 
</i></p>
<p>62. On 28 September, a peaceful demonstration was targeted from a helicopter, which 
fired several missiles at the gathered crowd of demonstrators and at a group of people who 
had just left the mosque and were heading towards the demonstration. The attack destroyed 
the mosque, caused the deaths of three civilians and the injury of many others. While 
residents of Sarmin attempted to rescue those wounded, the area was subjected to another 
round of aerial bombardment. Two hours later, Sarmin was hit with airstrikes for a third 
time. Sarmin was bombarded again in late December. Interviewee accounts describe how 
the village is being bombarded with &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; on an almost daily basis. The extent of 
the presence of anti-Government armed groups remains under investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Dayr az Zawr governorate 
</b></p>
<p>63. The city of Dayr az Zawr has been the site of confrontations between Government 
forces and anti-Government armed groups since late June 2012. Neighbourhoods in which 
armed groups are based, namely Al-Hamidia, Al-Ardi, Al-Shiekh Yasin, Jubiela, 
Mouwthafeen, and Al-Omal, have been subjected to heavy mortar and artillery shelling and 
airstrikes from helicopters and fighter jets. The shelling of these neighbourhoods was 
conducted from army bases located in Al-Joura and Al-Dhara neighbourhoods. Snipers 
controlled all movement along the roads leading to these and other army positions. In order 
to avoid passing through snipers&#8217; lines of fire, civilians made doors in the walls between 
houses to avoid using the roads, developing alternate routes to traverse the city, which 
offered a greater degree of cover from sniper fire from Government-held areas. Despite 
such efforts, civilians were killed by snipers, while undertaking civilian activities and 
moving in civilian areas.  
</p>
<p>64. There were reports of several incidents, between August and November, where 
civilians were killed by sniper fire in Jubiela neighbourhood in Dayr az Zawr. One 
interviewee described how the bodies of civilians shot by snipers would remain on the </p>


<p><b>98</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>streets until they could be retrieved at night. The interviewee stated that in Dayr az Zawr, 
there were too many casualties of sniper fire to count, but that he saw many bodies, 
&#8220;unidentified,&#8221; lying on the streets.  
</p>
<p>65. During late July and August, Al-Muhassan was subjected to heavy aerial 
bombardment and shelling on a daily basis, from a nearby airport, often after the breaking 
of the Ramadan fast, iftar or early in the morning. The attacks, which often hit or affected 
civilians gathered for the evening meal, caused high civilian casualties. According to a 
former resident of Al-Muhassan, much of the civilian population of the town fled due to the 
shelling and aerial bombardment.  
</p>
<p>66. In September, a military plane fired four rockets at Mohamed Al-Issa bakery in Al-
Muhassan. The attack occurred at 07:00, killing eight civilians who had lined up to buy 
bread, among them women and children, and severely injuring 16 others. Soon after the 
attack, the military plane returned to the area and fired a rocket at a residential home, 
killing two women.  
</p>
<p>67. The shelling and heavy aerial bombardment of Al-Muhassan continued into late 
September. According to a victim of the attacks, Al-Muhassan was shelled during the night 
from Dayr az Zawr airport, and bombarded from fighter jets and helicopters during the day, 
which dropped &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; at random.  
</p>
<p>68. On 9 November at around 08.00, the Air Force shelled the market of Al-Quriyah 
village. The attack occurred on a women&#8217;s market day, killing 21 civilians, 19 of whom 
were women. An interviewee who ran to the market after hearing the attack described the 
scene, &#8220;I saw scattered bodies, scattered limbs and heads, and remains of bodies. One body 
was a mere pile of flesh. No one was able to identify the body.&#8221; According to witnesses to 
the attack, the shelling came from a Syrian Artillery Battalion of the 17th Division stationed 
in Al-Mayadin city.  
</p>
<p>69. The attacks described by interviewees are often indiscriminate by their nature and 
method. The shelling and aerial bombardment of Al-Muhassan raises the spectre of area 
bombardment, with the entirety of the town targeted by Government forces as a single 
military target. The attack on the bread line and bakeries in Al-Muhassan, in addition to the 
general indiscriminate shelling and bombardment of civilian objects, has the effect of 
spreading terror among the civilian population, which is a serious violation of international 
humanitarian law. The bombardment of the market in Al-Quriyah was indiscriminate. In so 
far as the attack was deliberately carried out, in the knowledge that the market was a 
civilian object and contained a high concentration of civilians who were not directly 
participating in hostilities, the attack could amount to the war crime of attacking civilians.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Hama governorate 
</b></p>
<p>70. Qalaat Al-Madiq was heavily and indiscriminately shelled on 21 December. In the 
context of the hostilities, a 12 year old child was killed by sniper fire.  
</p>
<p>71. On 23 December at 16:00, the Alfourn Albalai (Baladi Bakery) in Halfaya was 
targeted by at least four rockets by a fighter jet. Accounts indicate that around 1000 people 
were queuing outside the bakery. As one interviewee explained, &#8220;We hadn&#8217;t received flour 
for several days, there wasn&#8217;t a single loaf in the city, so almost everyone was going to the 
bakery that day, and many of them were women and children.&#8221; One interviewee described 
how 15 minutes prior to the attack, a helicopter hovered above the area. Another 
interviewee, who arrived at the bakery following the attack, described the scene, &#8220;When I 
got there, I could see bodies all over the road. There were women and children ... Corpses 
could not be identified as the bodies were disfigured.&#8221; The heavy shelling of Halfaya 
continued into January 2013.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>99 
</b></p>
<p>72. The indiscriminate firing on civilian targets is a violation of international 
humanitarian law. The firing on civilian targets has been adjudicated as a violation of the 
principle of distinction inherent within the law of armed conflict. The commission was 
unable to ascertain whether the attack on the Alfourn Albalai (Baladi Bakery) in Halfaya 
was targeted at a military objective. However, there were reasonable grounds to believe, 
that in the context of the protracted campaign of shelling on Halfaya, in conducting the 
attack, Syrian armed forces were in violation of their obligation under international 
humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions. In addition, the firing of four rockets on a 
concentrated gathering of around 1000 people suggests that the attack caused excessive 
incidental death and injury to civilians and was disproportionate to the overall military 
advantage of the attack. The sequence of the attack, with all four rockets hitting the bakery, 
indicates that it was the target of a deliberate attack. 
</p>
<p>73. Following the attack on Tremseh on 12 July, residents of Tremseh said that the Air 
Force has continued to shell the town twice a week, forcing civilians to leave the town to 
nearby villages. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Homs governorate 
</b></p>
<p>74. There were multiple accounts throughout Homs governorate, of civilian deaths from 
sniper fire. An interviewee from the town of Telkalakh noted that between November and 
December, most injuries of civilians were as a result of sniper fire, &#8220;Which targets mostly 
civilians as FSA fighters operate at night.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Qusayr 
</i>75. After anti-Government armed groups took control of Al-Qusayr, the town has been 
subject to daily shelling, which is on-going. The armed groups occupy residential homes in 
the town, located in the midst of civilians and civilian objects. According to a former 
resident of Al-Qusayr, armed groups keep their locations secret to avoid being targeted and 
locate themselves within civilian areas in order to &#8220;protect civilians from attack.&#8221; One 
interviewee, who provided humanitarian assistance in Al-Qusayr, was injured by shrapnel 
in late October while transporting victims of shelling from the site of the attack to a field 
hospital. Al-Qusayr remains the site of regular confrontations between Government forces 
and anti-Government armed groups.  
</p>
<p>76. Throughout December, Shoumarieh and Baida villages in Al-Qusayr were daily 
bombarded with &#8220;barrel bombs.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>77. The presence of anti-Government armed groups within civilian areas violates the 
obligation under international humanitarian law for parties to the conflict to avoid locating 
military objectives within or near densely populated areas, to the extent feasible. In 
situations where military objectives cannot feasibly be separated from densely populated 
areas, parties to the conflict have an obligation to remove civilian persons and objects under 
their control from the vicinity of military objectives.  
</p>
<p><i>  Rastan and Talbiseh 
</i></p>
<p>78. In late July, after the FSA gained control of Talbiseh, Government forces began to 
shell and bombard the town. In mid-September, Rastan was heavily shelled. In both towns, 
witness and victim accounts describe shelling and aerial bombardment that was 
indiscriminate. Military airplanes dropped &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; in civilian areas and shelled 
residential neighbourhoods from a military base north of Rastan, killing and injuring 
civilians in their homes.  </p>


<p><b>100</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>79. The protracted and widespread shelling of Rastan and Talbiseh was conducted in an 
indiscriminate manner, in violation of the law of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><i>  Deir Baalbeh 
</i></p>
<p>80. In the course of confrontations between anti-Government armed groups and 
Government forces in Deir Baalbeh, the area was subjected to heavy shelling. Interviewees 
who had witnessed or been victims of the confrontations reported that shelling intensified 
between late October and December, and that on 26 December, after armed groups 
conducted an operation on Ishara Military base and a prominent member of the military 
police from Deir Baalbeh defected, Deir Baalbeh was subjected to &#8220;the worst shelling since 
the start of events, with missiles and mortars,&#8221; throughout the night. The heavy and 
concerted shelling was followed by a ground operation, examined in full in the section on 
massacres.  
</p>
<p>81. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the heavy, protracted and widespread 
shelling of Deir Baalbeh is indicative of a planned operation that was indiscriminate and in 
violation of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Al-Hasakah governorate 
</b></p>
<p>82. There are corroborated witness and victim accounts of the aerial bombardment of 
Hay Al-Horanah, Ras Al-Ayn on 12 November. Hay Al-Horanah was attacked at around 
15:00, the aerial bombardment destroying around 35 houses in a residential area of the 
town, killing and injuring civilians.  
There are reasonable grounds to believe that the attack on Hay Al-Horanah was conducted 
in a manner that failed to take feasible precautions to avoid the incidental loss of civilian 
life, injury and destruction of civilian property. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Latakia governorate 
</b></p>
<p>83. Eight interviewees provided a detailed picture of the indiscriminate shelling of 
Turkmen villages from nearby Government bases, set up in predominantly Alawite 
enclaves. A consistent pattern emerged from the accounts of the interviewees. Once the 
FSA or other anti-Government armed groups gain control of a village, Government forces 
begin heavy shelling, often dropping &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; on residential areas both during the 
day and at night (see A/HRC/22/59, annex II). The shelling of towns was so regular and 
consistent that residents were able to identify the bases from which the mortar and artillery 
shells were being fired. Interviewees consistently identified the Syrian military stationed in 
Ras Al-Basit as the source of indiscriminate shelling.  
</p>
<p>84. The protracted and regular bombardment of cities and densely populated civilian 
areas, without the taking of feasible precautions, is in violation of principles of international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Khadra 
</i></p>
<p>85. There were several reports of heavy shelling on Al-Khadra, a majority Turkmen 
village near the Syrian-Turkish border. According to an interviewee to an attack in late 
July, around 06:00, the village was hit by shelling, which appears to have been directed at 
the village indiscriminately.  
</p>
<p>86. In late August, Government forces began shelling Al-Khadra at 06:30. Witnesses to 
the shelling relayed accounts of civilians decapitated and severely injured by shrapnel from </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>101 
</b></p>
<p>the shelling. Following the shelling, the Syrian military operations on Al-Khadra escalated 
to airstrikes and dropped &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; from fighter jets.  
</p><p>87. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the widespread shelling of Al-Khadra 
was conducted in an indiscriminate manner in violation of the laws of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><i>  Al-Rabia district 
</i></p>
<p>88. Around 15 July, the village of Al-Hilwa was shelled. According to victims of the 
shelling, Syrian armed forces were targeting the FSA who were attempting to take control 
of a security compound in the village, but that the shelling was so heavy that it hit 
residential areas, indicating that Government forces did not take the necessary precautions 
in attack to minimise the incidental loss of life and destruction of civilian objects.  
</p><p>89. There were multiple consistent accounts of snipers targeting civilians in Al-Rabia 
between 21&#8211;22 July. One sniper was positioned on top of the police station and another on 
top of the Military Security building in Al-Rabia. A family that was driving past the police 
station was shot by snipers, injuring children inside the car. A man collecting milk from the 
farms in Al-Rabia on 22 July at 10:30 was hit by sniper fire in the back. Government 
snipers in Al-Rabia targeted civilians, deliberately firing at persons who were engaged in 
civilian activities. 
</p>
<p><i>  Jabal Al-Turkman 
</i></p>
<p>90. In mid-July, villages in Jabal Al-Turkman came under intense shelling. The village 
of Shakria was shelled daily with mortar and artillery shells. Interviewees described how 
helicopters were used to bombard the village alongside shelling by artillery. An FSA fighter 
interviewed described how the FSA operated in the Jabal Al-Turkman area, noting that 
while there were attempts to use buildings away from residential areas, a civilian house that 
was bombarded in Rabia village in mid-July was located near a house used by the FSA. The 
Jabal Al-Turkman area continued to be hit by &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; dropped by helicopters, as the 
area is too close to the Turkish border for armed forces to use fighter jets. 
</p><p>91. The particular use of means and methods of warfare by the Government forces, 
namely the use of &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; dropped from fighter jets at high altitudes, contributes to 
the indiscriminate nature of hostilities and amounts to serious violations of international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Qastal Ma&#8217;af 
</i>92. The shelling of Sarayha, a village in Qastal Ma&#8217;af, began on 20 August. The village 
was shelled with mortars and artillery during the night and subjected to aerial bombardment 
during the day. One interviewee account described that an anti-Government armed group 
was present in the village but that the buildings they used were not targeted in the shelling. 
Entire civilian areas of Sarayha were shelled.  
</p>
<p>93. Another interviewee, a former resident of Al-Shakiriyah village in Qastal Ma&#8217;af, 
described the situation at the beginning of Ramadan, &#8220;When the FSA rebel groups came to 
the village and the village gave them shelter, shelling by the Syrian army started targeting 
the entire village.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>94. In early September, Beit Alwayli, a Turkman village near Qastal Ma&#8217;af was shelled. 
A victim of the shelling described how her family home was hit at 12:30, while she was 
with her children. This incident, among others, indicates that Government forces did not 
take adequate precautions during their operations in Qastal Ma&#8217;af. The widespread 
bombardment of an area as a single military target, without distinguishing civilian objects is 
a violation of the principle of distinction under the laws of armed conflict.  </p>


<p><b>102</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>95. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Government has conducted 
hostilities in a manner that has spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>96. Indiscriminate and widespread shelling, the regular bombardment of cities, mass 
killing, indiscriminate firing on civilian targets, firing on civilian gatherings, and a 
protracted campaign of shelling and sniping on civilian areas, has characterised the conduct 
of the Government. Syrian armed forces have implemented a strategy, which uses shelling 
and sniper fire to kill, maim, wound and terrorise the civilian inhabitants of areas which 
have fallen under anti-Government armed group control. Shelling and sniper fire by 
government forces have killed and wounded civilians of both sexes and all ages, including 
children and the elderly.  
</p>
<p>97. Information collected indicates that many of the aerial and shelling attacks by 
Government forces are conducted indiscriminately. In incidents where an objective 
determination of the expected military advantage of an attack and the collateral damage 
expected by any reasonable commander, and whether the latter was excessive could be 
made, the commission found there were reasonable grounds to believe that certain attacks, 
such as those on bread lines outside bakeries, in particular Halfaya in Hama, were 
disproportionate. 
</p>
<p>98. The commission has collected and corroborated information from first-hand 
accounts. Many of the interviewees provided the names of the dead, including those of 
women and young children. Details of Syrian military entities responsible for the shelling 
and aerial bombardments and names of their commanders have also been recorded in some 
instances.  
</p>
<p>99. The use of snipers to control the movement of people and assert control over areas 
has caused considerable civilian casualties as snipers fail to distinguish between civilians 
&#8212; or those whose status should be presumed to be civilian &#8212; and those participating in 
hostilities. The targeting of individuals from concealed positions in urban areas infuses a 
degree of terror within the civilian population. Investigations relating to the conduct of 
hostilities by anti-Government armed groups are on-going. 
</p>
<p>100. There are reasonable grounds to believe that some of these attacks amount to the war 
crime of attacking civilians. The commission has identified a pattern that appears to amount 
to a concerted campaign against civilians in anti-Government armed group-controlled areas. 
The killing of persons, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack 
directed against a civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State policy, 
amounts to the crime against humanity of murder. Investigation into this pattern of conduct 
continues.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Bombings 
</b></p>
<p>101. Named anti-Government armed groups claimed responsibility for a number of 
bombings in Aleppo and Damascus during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>102. On 9 September, two bombs exploded in Aleppo, reportedly targeting a makeshift 
barracks in a stadium and the military police headquarters. Both were located in two 
adjacent sealed off districts in the centre of the city. The number of civilians killed and 
injured was disputed. According to media reports, the FSA&#8217;s Noble Brigade claimed </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>responsibility for the bombing of the stadium, claiming to have killed or wounded 200 
soldiers.  
</p>
<p>103. The bombs were directed at military targets. It has not been possible to verify the 
fact and number of civilian casualties. Consequently, it has not been possible to determine 
whether the attack was disproportionate to the direct and concrete military advantage 
anticipated from the attack. 
</p>
<p>104. On 3 October, three suicide bombs exploding near Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square killing 
48 people. The bombs affected the Officers&#8217; club, a hotel and a caf&#233;. The caf&#233; bore the 
brunt of the bombing though a building within the Officers&#8217; club complex was also ruined. 
The Government reported 48 deaths, with 122 injuries. Media reports did not indicate 
whether civilians were among the dead and injured. The Al-Nusra Front claimed 
responsibility for the attack.  
</p>
<p>105. There is currently insufficient information available to determine the lawfulness of 
this attack, but the commission notes with concern the fact that the suicide bombings, while 
they may have been directed at the Officers&#8217; Club, occurred in a busy area of Aleppo, near 
to civilian locations such as the hotel and caf&#233;. 
</p>
<p>106. A bomb exploded near the offices of the headquarters building of the General 
Federation of Trade Unions in Damascus on 4 November. The intended target was unclear 
though several military and security installations were in the area. There were no casualties; 
11 people were lightly wounded by shattering glass.  
</p>
<p>107. Arabic media reported that the Ahfad Al-Rasoul Brigade had claimed responsibility. 
With no military target clearly selected and with damage done to a hotel and its civilian 
guests, this bombing constitutes an unlawful attack. 
</p>
<p>108. On 5 November, there was a suicide bombing at a rural development centre in Sahl 
Al-Ghab in Hama, reportedly being used by Government forces as a military base, killing 
two people. The Al-Nusra Front claimed responsibility for this attack. 
</p>
<p>109. A car bomb exploded in the Mezzeh 86, a predominantly Alawite neighbourhood in 
western Damascus on 5 November. Reports indicated that 11 people were killed and dozens 
injured. An anti-Government group called Seif Al-Sham claimed responsibility for the 
attack, saying that it targeted a meeting point for the army, police and <i>Shabbiha</i>. It is 
unclear whether this was the case. 
</p>
<p>110. Media reports did not specify whether civilians were among the dead and injured. 
There is currently insufficient information available to determine the lawfulness of this 
attack, the staging of such an attack in a civilian neighbourhood is deeply troubling. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Failure to distinguish: locating military objectives in civilian areas 
</b>111. Anti-Government armed groups regularly use civilian objects such as schools as 
bases, accommodation or meeting points. By operating within such objects, anti-
Government armed groups are endangering the civilian population and violating their 
obligation under international humanitarian law to avoid locating military objectives within 
or near densely populated areas, to the extent feasible. 
</p>
<p>112. This was found to have occurred during: (i) the aerial bombardment of Tal Rifaat on 
4 and 10 August, where the FSA had based in a nearby school; (ii) the shelling of Lajjah, a 
village in Dara&#8217;a which anti-Government armed groups were using as a base during the 
reporting period; and (iii) aerial attacks on Al-Qusayr, Homs where anti-Government armed 
groups based in residential houses. </p>


<p><b>104</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> C. Use of snipers in Aleppo city 
</b></p>
<p>113. As detailed above, both Government forces and anti-Government armed groups are 
using snipers to control movement of people in Aleppo city. A limited number of reports 
were received which indicated that interviewees were hit by fire from anti-Government 
armed group fighters. In such cases, it was apparent that the conduct of those injured ought 
to have led to the presumption of their civilian status. 
</p>
<p>114. The firing on an individual by a sniper is inherently deliberate and targeted. There is 
a reasonable basis to believe that the firing on civilians by snipers constitute attacks that 
are, at the very least, indiscriminate as to their target, and were carried out recklessly, or the 
deliberate targeting of civilians as the object of the attack. Patterns of sniping continue to be 
the subject of further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>115. There are reasonable grounds to believe that anti-Government armed groups have 
conducted hostilities in a manner that is in violation of international humanitarian law. The 
use of car bombs and improvised explosive devices in densely populated urban areas 
spreads terror among the civilian population and can amount to the war crime of attacking 
civilians.  
</p>
<p>116. Organized anti-Government armed groups have concrete obligations under the law 
of armed conflict. In conducting hostilities against Government forces and affiliated militia, 
anti-Government armed groups have exposed civilians to the ravages of war.  
</p>
<p>117. The use of snipers to control movement of persons and assert control over urban 
areas has endangered civilians and hindered civilian activity in densely populated urban 
areas, particularly Aleppo city. The conduct of anti-Government armed groups has 
contributed to the increase in violence and danger to civilians that has characterized the 
evolving dynamics of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>118. There are reasonable grounds to believe that anti-Government armed groups have 
committed the war crime of attacking civilians. Investigations relating to the conduct of 
hostilities by anti-Government armed groups are on-going.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Other perpetrators 
</b>119. There has been an increase in attacks in which no parties claim responsibility and 
which do not appear to have any military or strategic objective, beyond their primary 
purpose to spread terror among the civilian population. Of particular concern are attacks 
that may foment sectarian tensions. Such attacks are not motivated by any military or 
strategic gain, but rather by a wanton and menacing disregard for human life. It has become 
increasingly evident that the proliferation of foreign fighters and extremist groups has 
altered the character of the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Bombings and other attacks 
</b></p>
<p>120. On 21 October, at least one car bomb was reported as having exploded outside a 
police station in Bab Touma, a predominantly Christian neighbourhood in Damascus. 
Media reported that 13 people were killed and 29 injured.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>105 
</b></p>
<p>121. Police exercising civilian law enforcement functions are not a legitimate target for 
attack. Moreover, the attack occurred in a busy civilian neighbourhood, with resulting 
civilian casualties. This bombing is an unlawful attack on a civilian population. 
</p>
<p>122. A bomb exploded in the southern Damascus neighbourhood of Daf Al-Shok on 26 
October. It reportedly was detonated near a children&#8217;s playground, killing five people and 
wounding 23. There was no evidence of a legitimate military target in the vicinity and the 
explosion resulted in civilian casualties. This bombing is an unlawful attack on a civilian 
population. 
</p>
<p>123. On 29 October, two car bombs exploded in different places in Damascus. The first 
was detonated outside a bakery in Jaramana, a predominantly Christian and Druze area of 
the city. There were some indications that a nearby police station may have been the 
intended target. There were no reported casualties, though 32 people were said to have been 
injured. 
</p><p>124. As above, police exercising civilian law enforcement functions are not a legitimate 
target for attack. This bombing is an unlawful attack on a civilian population. 
</p>
<p>125. On the same day, 29 October, a car bomb exploded in Al-Hajar Al-Aswad in 
southern Damascus, reportedly resulting in an unknown number of deaths. It was unclear if 
there had been an intended target. Based on the information currently available, this attack 
may be considered unlawful. 
</p>
<p>126. A bomb exploded near a Shi&#8217;a Muslim shrine, in the Sayyidah Zaynab area of 
Damascus on 31 October. Reports indicated that six people were killed and 13 were 
injured. There was no obvious intended military target. This bombing constitutes an 
unlawful attack. 
</p>
<p>127. Three bombs exploded in the Al-Wuroud district of Damascus, a predominantly 
Alawite neighbourhood on 6 November. The blasts occurred near housing for the elite 
Republican Guard. Reportedly at least 15 people were killed. It was unclear whether any of 
the injured were civilians. 
</p><p>128. A Republican Guard compound is a legitimate military target. However there is 
currently insufficient information to determine how the attack was staged and its impact, if 
any, on civilians. Consequently, it has not been possible to determine whether the attack 
was disproportionate to the direct and concrete military advantage anticipated from the 
attack. 
</p>
<p>129. On 6 November, a car bomb was detonated near a shopping mall in the mixed 
neighbourhood of Ibn Al-Nafis, killing and injuring several people. There was no obvious 
intended military target. On the information currently available, this bombing is likely to 
constitute an unlawful attack. 
</p>
<p>130. A car bomb exploded near a mosque in the Sunni working-class district of Al-
Qadam in southern Damascus on 7 November. There were reportedly dozens of casualties. 
There was no obvious intended military target. On the information currently available, this 
bombing is likely to constitute an unlawful attack. 
</p>
<p>131. On 18 November, a car bomb exploded after midnight in Mezzah, a predominantly 
Alawite area of Damascus. There were no casualties. There was no obvious intended 
military target. This bombing constitutes an unlawful attack. 
</p>
<p>132. Two car bombs exploded outside the State Security Directorate and a regional 
military office in Damascus on 23 December. The Government stated that 44 people had 
been killed, many of them civilians. The FSA released a statement denying its involvement 
and suggesting that the Government had staged the bombing, which came during the visit 
of the League of Arab States. </p>


<p><b>106</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>133. The State Security Directorate and a military office are legitimate military targets. 
Should the majority of the 44 dead be civilians, it is likely that a finding could be made that 
the attack was disproportionate to the direct and concrete military advantage anticipated 
from the attack, and therefore unlawful. Investigations are on-going. 
</p>
<p>134. There was an explosion at the University of Aleppo, near its halls of residence and 
its architecture faculty on 15 January 2013. Over 80 people are said to have been killed. 
Both the Government forces and anti-Government armed groups denied responsibility. As 
of 23 January, investigations are on-going with preliminary findings indicating that the 
university was hit by a missile rocket. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Assassinations 
</b></p>
<p>135. On 6 November, Mohammed Osama Laham, brother of the Speaker of the 
Parliament, was killed by gunmen in Midan, a neighbourhood of Damascus. Laham 
appeared to have no military function and would not, on the information available, be 
considered a legitimate military target.  
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>136. As the conflict in Syria has become characterised by the proliferation of armed 
factions, there has been an increase in acts of wanton and unrestrained violence, which are 
clearly intended to spread terror among the civilian population. The perpetrators of such 
acts cannot always be determined. Such conduct is in violation of the rules and customs of 
international humanitarian law and may result in the instigation of sectarian tensions. This 
trend risks becoming a malignant feature of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>137. The above incidents may be crimes in domestic law and where the perpetrators are 
parties to the conflict, may also amount to war crimes.  </p>

<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Specifically protected persons and objects</b>a<b> 
</b>1. Escalating violence in densely populated urban areas has increasingly affected 
persons and objects specifically protected under customary and treaty laws of armed 
conflict. In some incidents, protected persons and objects appear to have been deliberately 
targeted.  
</p>
<p>2. First-hand accounts from victims and eyewitnesses indicate that hospitals and 
medical personnel, journalists and cultural property, are at times treated as military 
objectives by both sides to the conflict. Satellite imagery examined shows the extensive 
destruction of hospitals in densely populated urban areas, as well as munitions craters, 
barricades, rubble, fortifications and debris in areas around hospitals in Damascus, Aleppo, 
and Homs cities. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Medical personnel and objects 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Aleppo governorate 
</i></p>
<p>3. State hospitals, field hospitals and medical units in Aleppo have come under attack.  
</p>
<p>4. A field hospital in Tal Rifaat was bombarded twice, on 27 July and 19 August. A 
volunteer who had been working at the hospital at the time said that most patients were 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>5. On 29 July, the Syrian army shelled a field hospital run by the FSA in a school 
building in Al-Sheikh Najar. The field hospital was shelled twice in succession. The first 
shell hit the field hospital, damaging the building and medical infrastructure. The second 
shell killed approximately 15 civilians fleeing from the field hospital. 
</p>
<p>6. Dar Al-Shifa hospital has been subject to regular shelling and aerial bombardment 
attacks throughout the reporting period. On 12 August, Dar Al-Shifa hospital was hit by 
nine rockets fired from a helicopter, damaging the first three floors on the southeast side of 
the hospital and destroying the ambulance entrance. A witness to the attack noted that there 
was an FSA unit to protect the hospital present and that one of the FSA members attempted 
to fire at the helicopter. Dar Al-Shifa hospital was attacked again with several rockets 
during the first week of October, damaging the third, fourth and fifth floors on the southern 
side of the hospital. On the morning of 28 October, a fighter jet dropped several &#8220;barrel 
bombs&#8221; on the general area around Dar Al-Shifa hospital. 
</p>
<p>7. One interviewee, who was hospitalised at a field hospital in Ansar after being hit by 
sniper fire, relayed how on 7 September, the hospital was shelled, causing significant 
damage to the building and its infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>a
 See A/HRC/21/50, Annex II for the applicable law. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>111 
</b></p>
<p>8. On 16 September, a Syrian fighter jet dropped two &#8220;barrel bombs&#8221; on two 
residential buildings in Bustan Al-Qasr next to Al-Sukari hospital, which were being used 
by the FSA to treat wounded fighters and civilians. 
</p>
<p>9. Al-Farabi hospital in Hritan, on the outskirts of Aleppo, was shelled in late October. 
An interviewee who passed the hospital the day after the attack described the extensive 
destruction of the hospital building and its infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>10. The mobile Kafrnbel field hospital in Al-Bab has been shelled twice in different 
locations, most recently in early December. In order to remain hidden and decrease the 
likelihood of attack, the hospital was not identified by the distinctive emblems of the 
Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p>11. In collecting accounts from eyewitnesses and victims to attacks on hospitals and 
medical units, there has been consistent information indicating that no warnings were given 
prior to attacks. This is a violation of international humanitarian law and amounts to the 
war crime of attacking protected objects. 
</p><p>12. Dar Al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo was regularly targeted during the reporting period. 
These attacks caused death and injury to civilians present within the hospital, significantly 
damaging its infrastructure, and substantially reducing the hospital&#8217;s ability to treat patients. 
The commission considers that these direct attacks on Dar Al-Shifa and other field hospitals 
in Aleppo constitute examples of a campaign of attacks against civilians in anti-
Government armed group-controlled areas.  
</p>
<p>13. Medical personnel have come under attack in Aleppo. In early September, a medical 
emergency worker was shot by sniper fire in Al-Midan neighbourhood while in full medical 
uniform and holding a medical bag with a Red Crescent logo on it. Around the same time, 
an ambulance that was evacuating wounded, hors de combat FSA fighters in Salah Eden 
neighbourhood was hit five times by sniper fire. 
</p>
<p>14. Medical personnel and medical transports are afforded special protection under 
international humanitarian law, implicit in Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, 
which requires that the wounded and sick be collected and cared for. Attacks against 
persons hors de combat are prohibited. 
</p>
<p><i>  Dara&#8217;a governorate 
</i></p>
<p>15. As part of an attack against Tafas, a town in southern Dara&#8217;a on 25 and 27 
December, a hospital was bombarded. Government forces attacked the hospital because 
they believed wounded FSA members were receiving treatment there.  
</p>
<p>16. Accounts indicate that the parties to the conflict consider the control of hospitals and 
medical facilities in terms of strategic and military gain. On 1 January 2013, Government 
forces attacked a checkpoint outside Al-Ihraq hospital in Dara&#8217;a that had been taken over 
by defectors in an effort to regain control over the hospital.  
</p>
<p>17. In August, an ambulance driver delivering medical supplies was stopped at a 
Government checkpoint in Athman. He was arrested upon the discovery of medical 
supplies and taken to a Government security agency. The man was detained for two weeks, 
after which his body was brought to the National Hospital in Dara&#8217;a. An interviewee who 
saw and collected the man&#8217;s body described it as, &#8220;The ambulance driver&#8217;s body was 
skeletal. It looked like he hadn&#8217;t been fed for two weeks. His skin as red and blue all over 
and his legs were swollen to twice their size. He looked like he&#8217;d been beaten to death.&#8221; </p>


<p><b>112</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><i>  Damascus governorate 
</i></p>
<p>18. The commission recorded an account of a physician who was arrested and tortured 
due to his medical and humanitarian activities. The interviewee provided medical assistance 
and transported medical supplies and medicines to civilians and wounded in FSA-
administered hospitals in Homs, Aleppo, Hama and Dara&#8217;a. He was arrested in Damascus 
on 17 July. When security forces came to his house, an officer [name withheld] asked him, 
&#8220;Why are you assisting the opposition? Why do you provide them with medicine?&#8221; The 
interviewee replied that he was providing humanitarian assistance, to which the officer 
replied, &#8220;I will teach you what assistance is; you will see it with your own eyes.&#8221; After 
threatening to rape the interviewee&#8217;s wife he shot her, his two young daughters and the 
doctor himself. The interviewee was taken to a military hospital, where he recounted how 
he and other patients in the hospital who were affiliated with the opposition were tortured 
and ill-treated. Medical staff burned their bodies with cigarettes and urinated on them. After 
17 days in the hospital, the interviewee was transferred to a branch of Military Security in 
Damascus. After three months in prison, he was charged with providing medical support to 
anti-Government armed groups. In late October, a lawyer secured his release. 
</p>
<p>19. During the ten days of heavy shelling and aerial bombardment of Al-Tal in early 
August, Al-Hosna hospital, Al-Tal military hospital, and Al-Zahraa hospital were severely 
damaged. 
</p>
<p>20. In late August, Dumair was heavily shelled. One interviewee recounted how a 
fighter jet dropped three bombs on a residential area, which destroyed six houses, all of 
which were near a field hospital. 
</p>
<p>21. One interviewee described how he witnessed the shelling of Al-Huda hospital in 
Sbeneh in September. The interviewee had been at the hospital three to four days prior to its 
shelling. He described it as a four-storey building, with one ward dedicated to obstetrics, 
where pregnant women were being treated, one dedicated to children, one dedicated to 
emergencies and one dedicated to treating FSA fighters. All the wards were full, including 
the one with FSA fighters, who were around 20&#8211;25 in number. The interviewee believed 
that the hospital was deliberately targeted due to the presence of wounded FSA fighters. In 
support of this, he pointed out that other shells had landed in the vicinity of the hospital. 
</p>
<p><i>  Idlib governorate 
</i></p>
<p>22. Jabal Al-Zawiya was subjected to heavy bombardment in early August. During the 
bombardment, Adnan Kiwan Hospital was targeted, damaging the building and its 
infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><i>  Dayr az Zawr governorate 
</i></p>
<p>23. Al-Saeed hospital in the Al-Arfi neighbourhood of Dayr az Zawr, which provided 
medical care to opposition fighters, was bombarded multiple times, on 19 July, in 
September, and on 26 November. Due to the bombardment, the equipment and staff of the 
hospital have been transferred to two concealed field hospitals. Patients of the hospital were 
injured during the attacks. One of the rockets fired at the hospital landed inside the 
operating room. 
</p>
<p>24. During the heavy shelling of Al-Muhassan that began on 29 September, a field 
hospital set up in a school was shelled over 6 times. The repeated shelling of the field 
hospital demonstrates that it was deliberately targeted, providing reasonable grounds to 
believe that the war crime of attacking protected objects has been perpetrated. </p>

<p><i>  Hama governorate 
</i></p>
<p>25. The commission has received accounts of the Syrian Army occupying and using the 
National Hospital in Halfaya, Hama, as a military base and thus rendering it a military 
objective. 
</p>
<p><i>  Homs governorate 
</i></p>
<p>26. On 24 July, a field hospital in Talbiseh was shelled, injuring eight civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>27. Field hospitals, as medical units, are afforded special protection under international 
humanitarian law, be they military or civilian, fixed or mobile, permanent or temporary, as 
long as they are organised and utilised for medical purposes. According to applicable 
customary international humanitarian law, the protection from attack accorded to medical 
units and hospitals, shall not cease unless they are used to commit hostile acts, outside their 
humanitarian function, and only after a warning has been given and after the warning has 
remained unheeded for a reasonable time. The presence of soldiers or fighters solely for the 
protection of the hospital or for the maintenance of order does not alter the hospital or 
medical unit&#8217;s protected status. It remains a civilian object; not a military one. 
</p><p>28. The first-hand account of the physician tortured and charged with providing medical 
assistance denotes a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Punishing a person 
for performing medical duties is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>29. Hospitals and medical units have been deliberately targeted by Government forces to 
gain military advantage by depriving anti-Government armed groups and those perceived to 
support them of medical assistance for sustained injuries. There are also reasonable grounds 
to believe that Government forces have committed the war crime of attacking protected 
objectsb and the war crime of attacking objects or persons using the distinctive emblems of 
the Geneva Conventions.c Certain attacks, such as those on Dar Al-Shifa hospital in 
Aleppo, appear to have been intended to terrorise a local population by targeting a 
prominent protected facility. As military operations are increasingly carried out in densely 
populated, urban areas, hospitals and medical units may have been hit by missiles or 
mortars that may have been aimed at nearby military targets.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Damascus governorate 
</i></p>
<p>30. The commission recorded a car bomb explosion outside of a hospital in Al-Wahdeh 
neighbourhood in Jaramana, Damascus governorate on 28 August. While the perpetrator is 
unknown, vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices have characterised anti-Government 
armed group conduct. Investigation into the incident is on-going. 
</p>
<p><i>  Homs governorate 
</i></p>
<p>31. A young fighter relayed how an anti-Government armed group attacked a 
checkpoint outside the National Military Hospital in Jurat Al-Shayyah in western Homs in 
September. After gaining control of the checkpoint, the interviewee described how fighters

</p>
<p>took over the hospital building, looted the equipment and supplies to take to their own field 
hospital, and set the hospital on fire. The fighter explained that as the hospital was an army 
hospital, its destruction was considered a victory against Government forces. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>32. The use of car bombs in civilian areas, particularly near a hospital, is an act that 
spreads terror among the civilian population and is in violation of the laws of armed 
conflict. Accounts indicate that anti-Government armed groups have taken medical supplies 
and equipment from Government and military hospitals, possibly for use in field hospitals. 
The destruction of a hospital building is in violation of the law of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Deprivation of access to medicine and medical care 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Aleppo governorate 
</i></p>
<p>33. Following the shelling of Qadi Askr bakery in Aleppo on 16 August, an interviewee 
recalled how he rushed to the scene of the attack and attempted to rescue those injured by 
bringing them to Aleppo University Hospital. The administration of the University Hospital 
refused to treat the wounded as he was afraid of retaliation from Government security 
forces. Another hospital in Aleppo agreed to treat the wounded, on the stated condition that 
they would &#8220;do the medical care very quickly. You have to take the wounded before the 
Security knows about the incident.&#8221; In one recorded incident in early October, Al-Jamal 
Hospital in Aleppo refused to treat an FSA fighter wounded by shelling. 
</p>
<p><i>  Dara&#8217;a governorate 
</i></p>
<p>34. The commission recorded an account of snipers positioned at Government 
checkpoints in front of a hospital in Dara&#8217;a, which shot at and prevented civilian vehicles 
from approaching the hospital and accessing medical care. One interviewee described being 
forced to turn away from the hospital in Dara&#8217;a after coming under fire from a Government 
sniper while attempted to bring his brother, a government worker himself, for lifesaving 
treatment on 30 November.  
</p>
<p>35. An interviewee injured by shrapnel from indiscriminate shelling in Bosra on 23 
October, relayed how he was evacuated to a FSA-administered field hospital because he 
could not go to a government hospital in Dara&#8217;a where all those injured who are Sunni are 
considered to be insurgents or demonstrators and denied medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>36. An 11 year old girl, who was severely injured by shrapnel on 26 November while 
she was walking to school, was refused entry to Izra Hospital at a military checkpoint. The 
girl lost consciousness while the interviewee took a detour around the checkpoint to the 
hospital. At Izra Hospital, staff refused to accept the wounded girl, saying it was a military 
hospital. By the time they arrived at another hospital, in Sweida, she had died of her 
injuries. 
</p>
<p><i>  Damascus governorate 
</i></p>
<p>37. A 12 year old boy who was injured by shelling was told by doctors and nurses at a 
Government hospital to say he had been hit by &#8220;terrorists&#8221; explaining, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t say so, 
the security forces will come and imprison you.&#8221; A full account of this incident can be 
found in document A/HRC/22/59, annex X.  </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>115 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Hama governorate 
</i></p>
<p>38. On 21 December, Qalaat Al-Madiq was indiscriminately shelled. One victim of the 
shelling was evacuated to a field hospital, explaining that he could not go to a Government 
hospital in a nearby village fearing that he would be arrested or killed by <i>Shabbiha</i> or 
security forces. 
</p>
<p><i>  Homs governorate 
</i></p>
<p>39. Interviewees from Rastan describe how in October, snipers were placed on top of 
Al-Basel hospital. As a result of military presence within the hospital, the interviewee said 
none of the civilians in Rastan would dare approach the hospital for medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>40. There have been documented accounts of violence against the wounded and sick, 
such as the killing, injuring, harassing and intimidating of patients or those trying to access 
health care, blocking or interfering with timely access to medical treatment, the deliberate 
failure to provide or the denial of medical assistance, and discrimination in access to health 
care. There have also been documented instances of health-care facilities being misused or 
their neutrality compromised by the presence of snipers or military personnel. The 
documented instances of doctors, Government forces and snipers interfering with or 
blocking timely access to medical treatment, compounded by a general climate of fear that 
prevents civilians from accessing state hospitals, has meant that those wounded in 
hostilities have languished without assistance, prevented from accessing basic emergency 
medical care. Government forces have violated the Common Article 3 provision to the 
Geneva Conventions that &#8220;the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cultural property 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b></p>
<p>41. Syria&#8217;s six World Heritage sites have suffered damage in the fighting. Old Bosra 
Castle has been used for military and strategic purposes by Government forces. Interviewee 
accounts indicate that the castle, along with nearby Roman ruins, have been occupied by 
Government forces. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>42. There are reasonable grounds to believe that cultural property within Syria, namely 
the ancient city of Bosra, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been used for 
purposes that are likely to expose it to damage and destruction. Such conduct is prohibited 
under international humanitarian law, unless imperatively required by military necessity. 
All parties to the conflict have an obligation to respect cultural property and take special 
care to avoid any damage to cultural property in the context of military operations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>43. In Aleppo, the historic souk was burned in October. The Umayyad mosque was 
significantly damaged and the Saint Kevork Church was damaged by arsonists, also in 
October. Looters have broken into one of the world&#8217;s best-preserved Crusader castles, Krak </p>


<p><b>116</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p>des Chevaliers. Artefacts in museums in Palmyra, Bosra and Homs have also been looted 
while ruins in the ancient city of Palmyra have been damaged. 
</p>
<p>44. Old Bosra Castle which has been used for military and strategic purposes by 
Government forces was subsequently targeted by anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>45. All parties to the conflict have an obligation to respect cultural property and take 
special care to avoid any damage to cultural property in the context of military operations. 
A failure to do so is in violation of customary and treaty provisions of international 
humanitarian law, such as the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the 
Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague Convention). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Journalists 
</b>46. Incidents of domestic and international journalists being arbitrarily detained, held 
hostage, and killed in the context of the continuing hostilities, have been recorded. 
Investigations are on-going as to the deliberate targeting of journalists by Government 
forces and by anti-Government armed groups. 
</p>
<p>47. Japanese journalist Mika Yamamoto was killed in Aleppo in August, apparently in a 
gun battle. 
</p>
<p>48. Ali Abbas, a SANA reporter, was killed outside his home in Jedaydet Artouz, a 
Damascus suburb on 11 August. The Al-Nusra Front claimed responsibility for the killing 
of Abbas in a statement issued on 17 August.  
</p>
<p>49. Abdel Karim Al-Oqda was allegedly extra-judicially executed on 19 September at 
his home in Hama. Al-Oqda was a cameraman and reporter for the citizen news 
organization, Shaam News Network. On 16 September, Government forces bombarded the 
printing press of Liwaa Al-Fatih, a weekly affiliated with the FSA, in Aleppo. Yusuf 
Ahmed Deeb, an editor, was killed in the attack. 
</p>
<p>50. Haidar Smoudi, a cameraman of the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) was 
allegedly murdered outside his home in Damascus by anti-Government fighters on 22 
December. 
</p>
<p>51. On 18 January 2013, French reported Yves Debay was killed by sniper fire in 
Aleppo and Al-Jazeera reporter Mohamed Al-Massalma (Mohamed Al-Horani) was shot in 
Busra Al-Harir, Dara&#8217;a.  
</p>
<p>52. James Foley, a freelance US journalist, was abducted on 22 November in Idlib. 
Anhar Kochneva, an Ukranian journalist, is being held hostage since October by anti-
Government armed groups demanding a ransom for her release. Austin Tyce, an American 
journalist, was taken from a Damascus suburb in August and his whereabouts are unknown. 
</p><p>53. Many other journalists have been killed while performing their trade. The 
Committee to Protect Journalists lists more than 17 journalists killed in Syria during this 
reporting period. </p>


<p>GE.13-10627 <b>117 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>54. Under international humanitarian law, attacks against journalists are prohibited. 
Journalists exercising their professional activities in relation to an armed conflict must be 
protected. Both pro- and anti-Government forces have violated this provision. </p>


<p><b>118</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b>Annex XIII 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Pillaging and destruction of property</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. Deliberately destroying the property of an adversary in the absence of military 
necessity is illegal under international humanitarian law. For purposes of this analysis, 
property of suspected anti-Government members and supporters was considered as being 
that of the &#8220;adversary.&#8221; For anti-Government armed groups, the same was considered when 
the property belonged to Government personnel or was non-military Government property. 
Appropriating property for private or personal use (pillaging) in the context of an armed 
conflict is a war crime.b Twenty-eight interviews were conducted regarding property 
destruction and pillaging over the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Government forces and affiliated militia 
</b>2. Government forces and affiliated militia intentionally destroyed the homes and 
businesses of (suspected) anti-Government members and supporters during raids on 
villages and neighbourhoods. Instances of overt destruction included the burning down of 
property, blowing it up, and damaging it beyond repair. Credible accounts attributed these 
crimes to Government security forces. Looting was a frequent precursor to the destruction. 
</p>
<p>3. Multiple interviewees described an army-led attack on the town of Bosra, Dara&#8217;a 
governerate on 15 October. The neighbourhood where the attack took place is mixed, with 
some 5000 Shi&#8217;as living amongst the majority Sunni population. The army, allegedly 
supported by more than 300 members belonging to the local &#8216;Popular Committees,&#8217; 
(referred to by the interviewee as &#8220;<i>Shabbiha</i>&#8221;) swept through the neighbourhood. Together 
they emptied houses of their contents and then set them alight. According to one person 
interviewed, &#8220;[t]he army would break into the houses and then the <i>Shabbiha</i> would burn 
them down&#8230; they were careful not to damage the Shi&#8217;a houses on the edge of the street.&#8221; 
Reports put the total number of homes burned in the operation at 30. 
</p>
<p>4. On 14 October, a mixture of Air Force Intelligence, Military Security Intelligence 
and <i>Shabbiha</i> entered the town of Mhajjah, Dara&#8217;a. They went from house to house 
searching for names on a list. They burnt 100 houses, many of which belonged to men who 
had defected from the security forces. Another interviewee stated that &#8220;only 10 houses 
remain&#8221; in the village of Lihraq, Dara&#8217;a, all the others, including the interviewee&#8217;s house 
were burned down some time after August, by Government forces and affiliated militia. 
</p>
<p>5. In a village east of Homs, Deir Baalbeh, an army raid on 28&#8211;29 December ended 
with an interviewee stating, &#8220;There is not a single house in Deir Baalbeh that hasn&#8217;t been 
looted and burned.&#8221; Video footage confirmed the widespread destruction and homes 
emptied of their contents. 
</p>
<p>6. In Latakia, anti-Government forces attacked Government compounds in Qastal 
Ma&#8217;af village in August. Police stations and Interior Ministry offices were targeted, 
however, FSA forces were repelled and ultimately withdrew. &#8220;This triggered indiscriminate 
shelling by the Government against all Turkman villages in the district, and already at the 
same day, when the clashes erupted, they started with campaigns of looting homes of

<p>people&#8221;. He described the perpetrators as &#8220;Popular Committees&#8221; who are &#8220;the junior partner 
of the <i>Shabbiha</i>.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>7. In Damascus, throughout the reporting period, homes and shops belonging to 
suspected opposition supporters were systematically looted. Reports describing looting by 
Government forces and <i>Shabbiha</i> in August in Jedaydet Artouz. In October, a man who 
was shot in his home by Government forces, returned home from the hospital to find all his 
belongings had been looted. Also in Damascus a flammable powder was used to set homes 
alight. In Dahadeel, Damascus, in an operation on 19 October, an interviewee saw 
Government forces enter his neighbour&#8217;s house. He believes that his neighbour either did 
not have an ID or his name was on a list because &#8220;they took him away and broke up the 
furniture in the house, before setting it alight.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>8. In Kanshikam village, Idlib, in September, an interviewee&#8217;s village was shelled and 
raided shortly thereafter. His house was stormed by soldiers who &#8220;stole his valuables and 
destroyed everything else.&#8221; He was blindfolded and taken to the Political Security Branch 
in Kanshikan, accused of defecting. He had not defected and was later released. 
</p>
<p>9. In well-corroborated accounts, the army, Air Force Intelligence, Military 
Intelligence and <i>Shabbiha</i> entered Tafas in late November and burned multiple houses and 
shops.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>10. There were no first-hand accounts of anti-Government armed groups appropriating 
property for their own use. Second hand accounts, reports from Governments, video and 
other materials provided evidence of looting by armed groups, though it was unclear 
whether the goods taken were in fact used for personal gain, or instead to support the 
opposition&#8217;s war effort. There were also allegations of theft and looting by individuals and 
groups not participating in the conflict, but who took advantage of the security vacuum 
created by it. 
</p>
<p>11. Destruction of property was alleged by a limited number of interviewees, including 
one reliable account in Dayr az Zawr. The interviewee described oil production facilities 
being damaged via attacks by anti-Government armed groups. Another witness blamed 
anti-Government fighters for damaging cultural objects in Aleppo during the fighting. 
</p><p>12. On January 14, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic transmitted a 
Note Verbale briefly describing looting by &#8216;armed gangs&#8217; in Aleppo. However, the report 
provided no specific instances. The commission is aware of reports alleging such groups 
are responsible for plundering factories, schools, pharmacies and warehouses and selling 
them across borders. Attempts to reach sources inside Syria who could verify these acts 
were unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>13. Government forces and affiliated militia have perpetrated the war crime of pillaging. 
They have deliberately burned and destroyed property they believed belonged to opposition 
members or supporters thereby committing the crime of &#8216;destruction of property of an 
adversary&#8217; as well as the international human rights law violation of the right to privacy and 
home.  
</p>
<p>14. While noting allegations, it was not possible to reach a finding with respect to 
similar acts by the anti-Government armed groups due primarily to difficulties in 
determining whether the appropriations were for personal gain. </p>


<p><b>120</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b> III. Razing 
</b></p>
<p>15. Instances of razing in urban locations in Syria were documented. Typically, after 
shelling and bombarding an area, Government forces moved in with bulldozers and razed 
hundreds of civilian homes in residential areas. 
</p>
<p>16. One interviewee witnessed the destruction of what he estimates to be approximately 
300 residential homes by explosives and bulldozers in Al-Tadamon in Damascus in early 
August. A former resident of Al-Tadamon now internally displaced, described the events 
beginning on 10 July. The neighbourhood was shelled, which caused the majority of the 
population to flee. Around 24 July, Government forces entered Al-Tadamon and levelled 
approximately 200 homes with bulldozers, among them the interviewee&#8217;s home and store. 
Prior to leaving the Damascus area, the interviewee went back to Al-Tadamon to see the 
neighbourhood. He described how his home and store, as well as all the other buildings on 
his street, were &#8220;reduced to stones.&#8221; Satellite imagery shows the total or partial destruction 
of an estimated 1,000 structures in Al-Tadamon (see Figure 1). Another neighbourhood 
experiencing this phenomenon is Qaboon, north of Damascus. 
</p><p>17. One interviewee, who witnessed the razing of residential homes in Al-Tadamon, 
noted that the houses demolished were facing the Hajiz Nasreen checkpoint, which was on 
the line between the city of Damascus and its suburbs. According to the interviewee, houses 
were razed because anti-Government armed groups were using the residential homes to 
attack the checkpoint. According to the interviewee, most of the houses were empty as 
people had fled due to the prior shelling and bombardment of the neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>18. Analysed satellite imagery (see Figure 2) also shows the mass razing of residential 
homes in Hey el Arbeen neighbourhood of Hama. According to reports and ancillary 
imagery review, an 80-hectare area of Hama containing hundreds of residential structures 
was razed within the first week of October. Sources described the Hama site as a launching 
pad for anti-Government operations. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government justified these demolitions as part a pre-existing urban plan to 
remove illegal buildings. Media has reported that additional demolitions are planned. 
</p>
<p><b>  Findings 
</b></p>
<p>20. These events were analysed as attacks under the rubric of the law of armed conflict. 
No violation was found to arise from within the information collected.  
</p>
<p>21. With respect to the internally displaced persons who lived there, customary 
international humanitarian law, obliges the parties to a conflict to prevent displacement 
caused by their own acts. Further, under customary law, displaced persons have a right to 
voluntary return in safety to their homes or places of habitual residence as soon as the 
reasons for their displacement cease to exist.c In practical terms, this principle applies to all 
refugees and displaced persons forcibly removed from or otherwise forced to flee their 
&#8220;homes, lands, properties or places of habitual residence &#8230; regardless of the nature or 
circumstances by which displacement originally occurred.&#8221;d Guiding human rights 
principles on this issue take the position that war is not a justifiable ground upon which to

<p><b>Annex XIV 
</b></p>
<p>[English only] 
</p>
<p><b>  Accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Violations of international law and the obligation to 
investigate, prosecute and punish  
</b></p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry on Syria has already stated that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that Government and affiliated militia as well as anti-Government armed groups 
committed crimes pursuant to international law, violations of international human rights 
law and international humanitarian law.a The commission emphasises that under 
international law, i.e. treaties to which Syria is a Party and customary international law, 
<i>Syria is obliged to investigate, prosecute and punish the authors of such violations, 
irrespective of their allegiance</i>.b  
</p>
<p><b> II. Investigation and prosecution through the Syrian national 
justice system  
</b>Any national effort in Syria has to meet essential international standards, namely 
independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness of investigationsc 
and due process.d  
</p>
<p>However, the commission has stated that it has not yet identified any evidence that Syria is 
making a genuine and credible effort to punish severe crimes.e In fact, given the protracted 
and increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict, it seems highly improbable that effective 
and independent prosecutions that meet essential international standards could be carried 
out in Syria anytime in the near future. There is not only a lack of willingness to institute 
proceedings, a country torn by almost two years of bloody and destructive conflict is also 
unlikely to be capable of such an effort.  
</p>
<p>At the present stage, investigation and prosecution by the Syrian national justice system is 
thus not a viable option to ensure accountability of authors on all sides to the conflict in 
Syria. However, it is crucial to note that the potential approaches to accountability 
described below would have to be supplemented by national prosecutions in Syria at some 
point. Experience shows that only a very limited number of cases can be dealt with by other 
States or the international community and that a significant &#8220;impunity gap&#8221; remains if the 
concerned State does not initiate national investigations and prosecutions. Assistance to 
strengthen the capacity, independence, impartiality, and effectiveness of the Syrian national 
justice system with respect to prosecuting the crimes identified in this report should form 
part of transitional arrangements.

systems of third States  
</b>It is possible that crimes committed in Syria are investigated and prosecuted by third States 
according to applicable rules of international law. For those crimes, many States assert 
universal jurisdiction which means that they apply their national criminal law despite the 
absence of specific link to the offence such as territoriality or nationality of the author or 
the victim.  
</p>
<p>However, this approach can only ensure accountability in a very limited way. Authors of 
crimes could only be prosecuted if they leave Syria. The identification of perpetrators and 
the carrying out of the investigation have proven to be extremely challenging in these cases 
due to the fact that the evidence as well as witnesses and victims are not present in the State 
that asserts jurisdiction. Accordingly, national prosecutions in third states cannot guarantee 
comprehensive accountability for crimes in Syria but only supplement other efforts in a 
selective way. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Investigation and prosecution by an internationalized or 
international ad hoc tribunal  
</b></p>
<p>The international community has set up or helped to set up a number of ad hoc tribunals, 
including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the Special Court for Sierra Leone 
(SCSL), the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) and the Extraordinary Chambers in the 
Courts of Cambodia (ECCC, &#8220;Khmer Rouge Tribunal&#8221;). An important advantage of such 
tribunals is that they can be tailored to meet the specific challenges and needs of the 
situation. While the ICTY and the ICTR were essentially imposed, the other tribunals 
mentioned above were created with significant participation of the respective countries 
which increases ownership of victims. The geographical presence of a tribunal in the 
concerned State can also improve positive perception by affected societies. 
</p>
<p>A significant inconvenience of ad hoc tribunals is that a highly complex institution has to 
be created from scratch. Defining a sound legal framework, finding appropriate facilities, 
recruiting competent personnel or ensuring cooperation of States <i>represent considerable 
challenges, require time and are likely to be more costly</i> than if a permanent institution is 
tasked with investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, when financial contributions by 
States are not compulsory as in the case of the ICTY and the ICTR, <i>long-term funding is 
extremely difficult to secure</i>. The SCSL, the STL and the ECCC, for instance, are currently 
under great financial pressure. Financial constraints on ad hoc tribunals are of significant 
concern because they drastically undermine the ability to effectively and independently 
provide justice for victims. The example of the ECCC is also instructive because it shows 
that internationalized structures which are integrated in the national justice system are 
exposed to a <i>considerable risk of undue influencing</i> which impedes the impartial delivery of 
justice. Finally, security concerns have often led the creators of ad hoc tribunals to establish 
them (at least partially) abroad, which limits the positive &#8220;ownership-effect&#8221; of ad hoc 
tribunals described above. 
</p>
<p>What the situation in Syria at the present time is concerned, it is difficult to conceive an 
<i>internationalized ad hoc tribunal that is integrated in the national judicial system</i>. Given 
the apparent lack of willingness and capability to execute investigations and prosecution 
described in paragraph 2, it is unrealistic to assume that Syria would support the 
establishment of such a tribunal let alone fully respect its independence. The dire security 
situation rules out the presence of such a mechanism in Syria. An <i>international ad hoc </i></p>


<p><b>126</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><i>mechanism that is imposed on Syria</i> likewise fails to convince. The general inconveniences 
of ad hoc tribunals and the existence of the International Criminal Court as a permanent 
institution speak against this solution.  
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the creation of an international or internationalized ad hoc tribunal does not 
adequately ensure accountability for crimes committed in Syria.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Investigation and prosecution by the International Criminal 
Court  
</b>The biggest advantage of the ICC is that it is an <i>established structure that could 
immediately initiate investigations regarding serious crimes in Syria</i>. The ICC can rely on 
highly experienced and competent personnel, an established legal framework and long-term 
funding secured through mandatory contributions of States Parties. It is noteworthy that an 
important reason for the creation of the ICC was the wish to avoid some of the above-
mentioned difficulties associated with ad hoc tribunals by creating a permanent mechanism. 
The right to refer situations was included in the Rome Statute notably to give the UN 
Security Council the possibility to resort to the ICC as a permanent institution instead of 
establishing further ad hoc tribunals. 
</p>
<p>Syria is not a State Party to the Rome Statute. Accordingly, jurisdiction of the ICC can only 
be established if the competent Syrian authorities <i>accept the jurisdiction ad hoc</i>,f if <i>Syria 
adheres to the Rome Statute</i>g or if the <i>UN Security Council refers the situation </i>to the ICC.h 
In order to address violations that have been committed since the beginning of the conflict 
in Syria in 2011, it would be crucial <i>that the ICC can exercise its jurisdiction retroactively</i>. 
Jurisdiction since 2011 would only be possible if Syria or the Security Council specify it 
when referring the situation to the Court. Given the lack of willingness by the current 
Syrian authorities to initiate credible prosecutions, the <i>only</i> <i>conceivable</i> <i>option</i> for ICC 
jurisdiction at this point in time seems to be a <i>referral of the Security Council</i>. If the 
opposition should take over power at a later stage it could accept the jurisdiction the ICC ad 
hoc in the name of Syria.  
</p>
<p>It is important to highlight the possible <i>deterrent effect the establishment of ICC 
jurisdiction</i> could have on the commission of crimes in Syria. It would be a message to all 
parties involved in the conflict that crimes are not only monitored by the International 
Community but also sanctioned. As opposed to an ad hoc mechanism that has yet to be 
created, the ICC is a well-known, fully functioning institution that could immediately 
initiate investigations. ICC jurisdiction over Syria could especially have an effect on the 
opposition that seeks international legitimization. Finally, the existence of ICC jurisdiction 
contributes to political negotiations because it moves the fundamental issue of 
accountability to the fore.  
</p>
<p>The establishment of jurisdiction of the ICC <i>does in no way rule out parallel or subsequent 
national proceedings</i>. According to the <i>principle</i> <i>of</i> <i>complementarity</i> enshrined in the Rome 
Statute, a case is inadmissible if national authorities carry out genuine investigations and 
prosecutions.i In fact, it is clear that the ICC will never be in a position to prosecute all 
authors of serious crimes. The bulk of prosecutions will have to take place on a national 
level, whether the ICC is seized or not.

<p>Finally, the ICC can <i>rely on strong support from the international community</i>. There are 
121 States Parties to the Rome Statute that represent almost two thirds of all UN Member 
States. Almost 60 States from all regions of the world <i>have explicitly called on the UN 
Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC</i>.j The UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights,k Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Human Rights Councill and 
numerous NGOsm have also demanded a referral. Finally, the UN General Assembly,n the 
UN Human Rights Council,o Arab States,p the Group of Friends of the Syrian People,q the 
UN Secretary General,r and others have called for accountability in Syria and/or action by 
the UN Security Council. 
</p>
<p>In sum, the ICC <i>is the appropriate institution for the fight against impunity in Syria</i>. As an 
established, broadly supported structure, it could immediately initiate investigations against 
authors of serious crimes in Syria and due to the complementarity principle, the option of 
national prosecutions at a later stage, instead of or in parallel to the activities of the ICC, 
remains fully available.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Need for a holistic approach  
</b></p>

serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. According to the <i>Set

<p>guarantees of non-recurrence.s These rights of victims are mirrored by corresponding 
obligations of States. 
</p>
<p>The <i>right to justice</i> implies the right of a victim to assert his or her right in a judicial 
process as well as accountability of the authors of serious crimes. Possible measures are 
described in this non-paper. The <i>right to reparation</i> includes restitution, rehabilitation and 
measures of satisfaction, such as medical care, return of property, memorials or public 
apologies. The <i>right to truth demands a clarification of the facts and the corresponding 
responsibilities</i>. Measures include truth commissions, investigation panels, documentation 
of violations or the securing of archives. <i>Guarantees of non-recurrence</i>, finally, focuses on 
the need to protect victims and the society at large from further violations by adopting 
measures such as disarmament, demobilization, reintegration of former combatants, 
institutional reforms or lustration and vetting.  
</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is crucial that any initiative to fight impunity in Syria <i>is not limited to 
judicial measures but is carried out with a view to ensure all the basic rights of victims</i> 
described above. International measures must be tailored to the potentially changing 
situation with the view to contributing to a sustainable culture of accountability and rule of 
law. They should strengthen national initiatives, ownership and institutions in order to re-
establish civic trust and to create the basis for peace, justice, security and development at 
the national level.

</p>
<p><b>  Glossary of weapons used 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Glossary of weapons used in Syria 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Aerial projectiles  
</b>Syrian Air Forces (SAF) fighter jets and helicopters were used extensively in bombing the 
anti-Government armed groups and the areas under their influence. Different categories of 
aerial projectiles were fired or dropped including the RBK250-275 cluster bomb, OFAB 
250-270 fragmentation high explosive bomb, FAB-500 high explosive bombs, S5 explosive 
rockets and DIY &#8220;Barrel Bombs&#8221; which consist of storage tanks or sheet-metal cylinders 
packed with varied quantities of explosives and metal scrap. 
</p>
<p><b>  Anti-aircraft MANPADs 
</b></p>
<p>Man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADs) are shoulder-launched surface-to-air 
missiles. They are typically guided weapons mainly used against low-flying aircraft, 
especially helicopters. Reports indicated that certain armed groups used MANPADs 
including Strela-2 (SA-7) and Igla-1 (SA-16) in shooting down SAF aircrafts. 
</p>
<p><b>  Anti-tank weapons 
</b></p>
<p>Different categories of anti-tank weapons have been used in the Syrian conflict by both 
sides including man-portable weapons (RPG7), guns (B10), missiles (AT-3 Sagger), AT 
mines and IEDs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Artillery and mortars 
</b></p>
<p>The army has deployed its artillery and mortars across Syria and participated in the 
extensive and continuous shelling of cities, villages and rural areas. Statements indicated 
that the guns most often used by those units are the BM-21 Grad, 2S1 Gvozdika, Type 63 
multiple rocket launcher and mortars of different calibres (120mm and 240mm). Statements 
also indicated that some armed groups possess mortars. 
</p>
<p><b>  Assault rifles 
</b></p>
<p>The most common weapons used by Government forces and the armed opposition were 
assault rifles, including the AK-47, FN-FAL and the NORINCO. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cluster munition 
</b></p>
<p>A cluster munition is a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that 
releases or ejects smaller anti-tank and/or anti-personnel sub-munitions. Cluster munitions 
pose an immediate threat by randomly scattering thousands of sub-munitions or 
&#8220;bomblets&#8221;. The danger posed by these sub-munitions may extend well after the conflict, as 
hundreds may fail to explode upon impact. The commission documented the Government 
forces&#8217; increasing use of this type of ammunition by aerial bombs and more recently by 
artillery rockets.  </p>


<p><b>130</b> GE.13-10627 
</p>
<p><b>  Machine guns 
</b></p>
<p>Vehicle-mounted heavy machine guns have been omnipresent in the Syrian conflict. The 
most commonly documented are the DShK 12.7x108mm, the KPV 14.5mm, the ZU-23-2 
23mm and the ZU-23-4 Shilka 23mm Anti-aircraft gun mounted on APC.  </p>
