ITEM 8.01OTHER EVENTS
During the second quarter of 2016, Apache voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil
and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts
method. Accordingly, certain financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect
retrospective application of the successful efforts method. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016,
the Company retrospectively adopted a new accounting standard update which requires debt
issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated
debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2016, that was filed by the Company on August 4, 2016 reflects these
accounting changes and updates for the relevant periods therein.
We have recast certain information in our filing to reflect the retrospective application of these
changes in accounting principles for all periods presented in the following sections of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “Previously Filed Annual
Report”) as follows:
•
•Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data,
Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,
•Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,
Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (only sub-Item (a)(1), excluding
Report of Management on page F-1 and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm on page F-3), and
Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (only sub-Item (a)(3) Exhibit No.
12.1, Statement of Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Combined Fixed
Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends).

•
As this Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed only for the purpose described above, and only
affects the Items specified above, the other information in the Previously Filed Annual Report
filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2016 remains
unchanged. No attempt has been made in this Current Report on Form 8-K to modify or update
disclosures in the Previously Filed Annual Report, except for the revision of certain financial
information as described above. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not reflect events
occurring after the filing of the Previously Filed Annual Report. Accordingly, this Current Report
on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Previously Filed Annual Report and the
Company’s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Previously Filed Annual
Report, including any amendments to those filings.
