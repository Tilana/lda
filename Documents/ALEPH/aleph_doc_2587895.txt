PART III — NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail why Forms 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR, N-CSR, or the
transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
We determined that we were unable to file our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 by
the August 14, 2013 due date or by the August 19, 2013 extension date.
We are not able to file a timely Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, because we have
not completed required financial statements for previous reporting periods.  In November 2005,
we determined that our previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2004,  and  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2005,  should  no  longer  be  relied  upon.    More
information regarding the 2004 restatement and our initial efforts to file our comprehensive 2005
10-K including quarterly financial information can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on November 15, 2005 and our Form 12b-25’s filed with the SEC on April 3,
2006 and August 15, 2006.
As disclosed and discussed further in the current report on Form 8-K filed October 26, 2006, in an
effort  to  complete  the  2005  annual  financial  statements  on  a  timely  basis,  including  the
restatement  of  prior  years  financial  statements,  the  managing  general  partner  engaged  new
auditors for our partnership and for 14 of the 25 other partnerships then subject to SEC reporting
requirements.
The  managing  general  partner  continues  to  evaluate  alternative  courses  of  action  aimed  at
satisfying reporting requirements for all sponsored partnerships in the most expeditious manner
possible.    At  this  time  we  are  not  able  to  estimate  when  we  will  file  all  delinquent  reports
described in Part IV (2) below.
Because of the matters discussed above, management expects to have material weaknesses in
its internal controls over financial reporting.
