<p><b>  26/&#8230;  Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers 
</b> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council, as 
well as those of the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, on the 
independence of the judiciary and on the integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession, an objective and impartial prosecution able to perform its functions accordingly, 
and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms and the application of the rule of law, and for 
ensuring fair trials without any discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> the increasingly frequent attacks on the independence of judges, 
lawyers, prosecutors and court officials, in particular threats, intimidation and interference 
in the discharge of their professional functions, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on the institution building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Commends</i> the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers for the important work undertaken in the discharge of her mandate; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a period of three 
years, on the same terms as provided by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/2 of 
16 June 2011; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
the performance of his or her tasks, to provide all necessary information requested by him 
or her, to respond to communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur 
without undue delay, to consider responding favourably to his or her request for visits and 
to consider implementing his or her recommendations; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, as well as 
regional organizations, national human rights institutions, independent experts, bar 
associations, professional associations of judges and prosecutors, non-governmental 
organizations and other relevant stakeholders, to cooperate to the fullest extent possible 
with the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his or her mandate; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary human and 
financial resources for the effective fulfilment of his or her mandate; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this issue in accordance with its annual 
programme of work.
