<p><b>D.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Council accepted the recommendation of its officers that the speaking time limits

and three minutes for statements by observers for non-member States of the Council and other 
observers, including United Nations entities, specialized agencies and related organizations, 
intergovernmental organizations and other entities, national human rights institutions and 
non-governmental organizations.  The Council also accepted the recommendation of its officers 
that the list of speakers would be drawn up in chronological order of registration and that the 
order of speakers would be as follows:  States members of the Council and concerned countries, 
followed by observers for non-member States of the Council and other observers.

<p><b>&#8220;The human rights situation in Darfur&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of amendment to operative paragraph 3 of draft resolution 
A/HRC/S-4/L.1, the Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Decide to dispatch a mission to assess the human rights situation in Darfur, to be 
headed by the President of the Council and to include the members of the Bureau and the 
regional group coordinators members of the Council as well as the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Sudan and request the Mission to report to the Council at its fourth 
session. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that 
requirements would arise to implement the activities called for in amendment to operative 
paragraph 3 of A/HRC/S-4/L.1 to provide for travel, security and general temporary assistance 
for the biennium 2006-2007, in the amount of $364,550. 
</p>
<p>3. No provisions have been included under 2006- 2007 programme budget for these  </p>
<p>additional activities, therefore, additional resources will be required under:  Section 23, Human 
rights, $364,550. </p>
