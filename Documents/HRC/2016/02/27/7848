<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Contemporary international labour migration is propelled by globalization and neo-
liberal economic policies that promote deregulation of labour markets, including the flow of 
cheap, low-skilled labour.1 An estimated 105 million individuals currently work outside 
their country of birth.2 Remittances from migrant workers, which exceed Official 
Development Assistance to developing countries,3 contribute significantly to growth in 
household economies and improve the underlying determinants of health such as housing 
and education. The impact of the migration process on a migrant worker&#8223;s health can be 
</p>
<p>significant, and where poorly managed, may outweigh any economic and social benefits.  
</p>
<p>2. This report addresses the enjoyment of the right to health of individuals who migrate 
from one country (sending State) to another country (receiving State) for paid employment 
and who work in low-skilled or semi-skilled industries in receiving States. The scope of the 
report is restricted to migrant workers because certain issues, like those related to 
recruitment agencies, compulsory testing and occupational health, give rise to serious 
violations of the right to health and therefore warrant a separate inquiry. Nonetheless, 
concerns such as access to health care in receiving States are faced similarly by other 
migrants, such as refugees, and the analysis can indeed be extended to all groups of 
migrants. Some individuals migrate through official channels, others through informal ones, 
while others ebb in and out of both. The term &#8220;irregular&#8221; has been used to cover migrant 
workers who live or work in the receiving State without authorization, whereas &#8220;regular&#8221; 
refers to migrant workers with authorization to live and work in the receiving State. The 
report pays particular attention to work in construction, domestic work, sex work and 
agriculture, as examples of dirty, dangerous and degrading jobs (3D jobs) that these migrant 
workers frequently fill.  
</p>
<p>3. Migrant workers often commence the migration process as relatively healthy 
individuals.4 However, the complexity and diversity of circumstances throughout the 
various dimensions of the migration cycle may render them highly vulnerable to poor 
physical and mental health outcomes, compromising the enjoyment of other rights.5 For 
instance, irregular migrant workers may face extreme health risks during transit owing to 
hazardous conditions such as being cramped or hidden in boats or trucks.6 They may also 
face physical and sexual violence during transit.7 Limited or no health care during transit 
and in transit countries may further increase the burden of disease, including untreated non-

<p>communicable diseases.8  Camps in transit countries9 or assisted voluntary returns to the 
sending State10 may help in reducing health vulnerabilities of irregular migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>4. Economic necessity, lack of information and low educational and skill levels can 
drive migrant workers towards hazardous and poorly regulated 3D jobs. An the absence of 
effective safeguards to protect the rights of migrant workers in such industries &#8211; coupled 
with exploitative practices by unscrupulous recruitment agencies, intermediaries and 
employers &#8211; create living and working conditions that hinder the full realization of the right 
to health.  
</p>
<p>5. Cultural and linguistic differences may magnify the vulnerability of migrant workers 
in receiving States, especially in the absence of family or social support networks. Legal, 
information and employment-related barriers to accessing health facilities, goods, and 
services also heighten vulnerability. For irregular migrants, the challenges are even greater 
because they are likely to have lesser, if any, health care entitlements, protection under 
occupational health and safety laws or access to redress mechanisms, while constantly 
facing the threat of detention and deportation. Laws linking immigration control and health 
systems are particularly damaging as they are a direct barrier to accessing health care, and 
perpetuate discrimination and stigma rather than promote social inclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Conceptual framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. The right to health framework is primarily grounded in article 12 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health. General 
comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights elaborates 
upon, and interprets, the right to health. It mandates States to respect, protect and fulfil the 
right to health of everyone, including migrant workers. States are also required to improve 
the underlying determinants of health &#8211; prerequisites for the realization of the right to 
health &#8211; such as education, nutritious food, potable water, adequate sanitation, and safe and 
healthy work and living conditions. Migration should be seen as an underlying determinant, 
as the processes of pre-departure and reintegration in sending States, and arrival, stay and 
integration in receiving States determine health outcomes of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>7. Rights of migrant workers are explicitly recognized under a number of international 
law instruments. The 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families details the rights of migrant workers and 
their families throughout the entire migration process, tailoring the obligation of States 
according to the stage of migration, including departure from and return to sending States, 
and transit and employment in receiving States.  
</p>
<p>8. The International Labour Organization (ILO), through various conventions and 
recommendations places obligations on States11 and certain duties to recruitment agencies,

<p>requiring them to take steps to prevent abuse and exploitation of migrant workers.12 It 
focuses on occupational health and safety of migrant workers and recommends measures to 
promote reunification of families,13 which can have a positive effect on mental health as it 
provides social support to migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>9. The World Health Assembly resolution on the health of migrants recommends that 
States promote migrant-sensitive health policies, including information and service 
provision, and to promote equitable access of public health resources.14 </p>
<p>10. By mandating that non-discrimination inform all aspects of State policy, the right to 
health framework does not allow for any distinction between regular and irregular migrant 
workers on the one hand, and nationals of States, on the other. In this aspect it differs from 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families which allows irregular migrant workers access to health 
facilities, goods and services only when urgently needed.15 Non-discrimination requires that 
socio-economic rights, such as access to health facilities, goods and services, be equally 
available to nationals and non-nationals, including irregular migrant workers.16  
</p>
<p><b> A. State obligations  
</b></p>
<p>11. Fulfilling the right to health requires States to adopt and implement an evidence-
based national health policy which does not discriminate against non-nationals17 and 
addresses the needs of irregular and regular migrant workers, at all stages of the migration 
process, including pre-departure and return. As an aspect of their right to health obligation, 
States should ensure availability and accessibility of quality health facilities, goods and 
services, including existing health insurance schemes, to migrant workers, on the basis of 
equality with other nationals.  
</p>
<p>12. Each State involved in the migration process should comply with its obligation to 
respect, protect and fulfil the right to health of all persons within its jurisdiction, including 
migrant workers. Bilateral agreements and non-binding memoranda of understanding 
between States are commonly used to govern labour corridors and terms and conditions to 
be abided by them.18 The regulatory structure contained in such arrangements should be 
enforceable and reflect principles of the right to health, especially non-discrimination, 
empowerment, participation, transparency and accountability of State and non-State actors.

<p><b> B. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>13. Participation of affected communities in decision-making processes is critical to the 
right to health framework. States should not discriminate on the basis of nationality or legal 
status19 and should pay special attention to vulnerable groups, such as low-skilled and 
irregular migrant workers, to protect them from rights violations by third parties, such as 
private recruitment agencies, intermediaries and employers.  
</p>
<p>14.  Accordingly, States should ensure the participation of migrant workers, including 
irregular migrant workers, in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and enforcement 
of laws and policies, including in the negotiation of bilateral agreements. As trade unions 
are considered fundamental in promoting workers rights,20 including occupational health,21 
regular and irregular migrant workers, should be encouraged to participate in or form 
unions. Effective participation, especially of irregular workers requires positive measures 
by States to create an environment in which these groups can participate without fear of 
sanctions. Access to timely and accurate information is a prerequisite to meaningful 
participation in health-related decision-making. 
</p>
<p>15. States, including receiving States, should ensure involvement of migrant workers in 
decision-making processes and awareness-raising strategies, particularly in relation to 
accessing health services. Participation will also raise awareness among potential migrant 
workers about issues such as migration stress factors, illegal recruiting practices, their 
rights in sending and receiving States and obligations of foreign employers.22 Community 
participation will assist in making health services culturally and linguistically appropriate 
for migrant workers.23 In some States, civil society organizations have successfully 
involved migrant workers in outreach and referral programmes resulting in culturally and 
linguistically appropriate information for migrant workers,24 thus encouraging community-
led initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>16. The right to health mandates States to put in place effective and accessible 
mechanisms to hold all duty bearers to account. Non-citizens, such as migrant workers also 
have the right to access legal remedies to challenge violations against them.25 Although 
States are the primary duty bearers under the right to health, they have a concurrent 
obligation to ensure that non-State actors, such as recruitment agencies and employers, are 
held accountable for violations of the right to health of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>17. Accountability requires robust regulatory frameworks across all sectors of 
employment, with independent mechanisms, to enforce rights and monitor compliance.

<p>Strict monitoring will encourage transparency and deter exploitation, collusion and 
mistreatment by recruitment agencies, employers and government authorities.26 
</p>
<p>18. Sending and receiving States should also ensure legal redress through quasi-judicial 
or judicial mechanisms to enable migrant workers to enforce their rights against State and 
non-State actors. States should also provide for appropriate relief, by way of compensation, 
restitution or non-repetition, for violations of the right to health. Such relief should also 
include temporary measures such as shelters for abused domestic workers.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Specific issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Pre-departure obligations of States 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Access to information 
</b></p>
<p>19. The full realization of the right to health is closely dependent on the State&#8223;s 
obligation to ensure availability and accessibility of meaningful information to support 
decision-making in respect of migration. Providing information to potential migrant 
workers, particularly about their rights, is also necessary for empowering them against 
possible abuse and exploitation by actors involved in the migration process. 
</p>
<p>20. Information about costs assumed in the migration process, recruitment agencies, 
terms and conditions of work in and practical information about receiving States, potential 
dangers and benefits of migrating to a particular country, risks associated with migration 
and employment and ways to counter them should be provided before a commitment to 
migrate has been made.27 Potential migrant workers should also be made aware about 
policies of receiving States, such as compulsory health testing, entitlement to and accessing 
health-care services. Common methods to spread such information have included issuing 
warnings, publishing a list of licensed and blacklisted agencies on websites and in 
newspapers28 and mass media information campaigns.29  
</p>
<p>21. Closer to the time of departure, pre-departure orientation sessions are conducted in 
some countries to prepare migrant workers for their time in the receiving State30 and to train 
them for their jobs.31 During these sessions, migrant workers should be provided with 
understandable information regarding their rights, health information, such as preventing 
the transmission of communicable diseases like HIV, and health facilities available in 
receiving States. Pre-departure training sessions are critical for informing migrant workers 
about their rights vis-&#224;-vis the receiving State and the employer.32 Pre-departure sessions 
should also be used to provide information on recourse mechanisms, such as consular

<p>protection, available in the event of abuse, exploitation or other rights violations.33 States 
should ensure information is accurate and relevant during pre-departure sessions, including 
those conducted by private agencies. 
</p>
<p>22. Returnee migrant workers along with organizations working with migrant workers 
should be encouraged to hold training and informational sessions to make outgoing migrant 
workers aware of situations and experiences they are likely to face in receiving States and 
recourse available to them in times of abuse, exploitation and distress.34 However, as pre-
departure sessions frequently take place only a short time prior to departure,35 this does not 
give migrant workers enough time to process the information. Pre-departure sessions and 
trainings should, therefore, be designed and conducted in ways that ensure maximum 
understanding of the information by migrant workers. Post-arrival orientation sessions that 
reinforce and contextualize information received during pre-departure sessions should also 
take place to support migrant workers with integration in receiving States.36  
</p>
<p><b>  Regulation of recruitment agencies 
</b></p>
<p>23. States are obligated to protect the right to health of individuals from interference by 
third parties. Recruitment agencies, which are mostly private enterprises, are typically the 
first point of contact in the formal migration process for low-skilled migrant workers, many 
of whom are illiterate and poor. They provide information to migrant workers about job 
opportunities and living and work conditions in receiving States for a fee. They also arrange 
documentation necessary for migration, thus playing a crucial role in guiding migrant 
workers through important phases of migration.37 Dependence on recruitment agencies may 
render migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, necessitating regulation of 
recruitment agencies by sending States. 
</p>
<p>24. As an essential aspect of protecting the right to health of migrant workers, States 
should ensure monitoring and accountability of recruitment agencies. States may monitor 
recruitment agencies through legislation, providing for mandatory licensing requirements, 
regular reporting and independent monitoring and inspections.38 Monitoring is also 
necessary to prevent illegal recruitment agencies from entering the market and exploiting 
migrant workers.39 
</p>
<p>25. To prevent exploitation, States should ensure that written employment contracts 
address issues such as the underlying determinants of health, including occupational health, 
access to health facilities, goods and services, and compensation for employment-related 
injury and death, as well as mechanisms for settling disputes.40

<p>26. Some States prohibit agencies from recruiting workers or a class of workers, such as 
domestic workers, to countries or employers who habitually deprive migrants of adequate 
rest, nutritious food, medical care and sleep.41 However, as this may result in migrant 
workers seeking riskier routes to foreign employment, sending States should ensure that 
bilateral agreements with receiving States provide for strong protections and enforcement 
mechanisms against abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>27. States should ensure that migrant workers have access to legal remedies, including 
compensation, in cases where recruitment agencies have contributed to the violation of 
rights or have not complied with requirements under national law or policy.42  
</p>
<p><b> B. Immigration policies 
</b></p>
<p>28. Immigration policies, such as compulsory medical testing, detention and 
deportation, especially when contained in bilateral arrangements between States, require the 
involvement of sending and receiving States in enforcing them. Such immigration policies, 
including those contained in bilateral agreements, should be in conformity with States&#8223; 
(both sending and receiving) obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health of 
migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Compulsory medical testing 
</b></p>
<p>29. Many receiving States require migrant workers to undergo compulsory medical 
testing for certain conditions such as HIV,43 tuberculosis44 and pregnancy45 as part of their 
immigration policy. Though quite a few countries have eased HIV-related travel 
restrictions, compulsory testing for HIV for residence and work,46 especially for low-skilled 
migrant workers,47 continues in over 40 countries. This is despite commitment by States to 
enact legislation eliminating all forms of discrimination against persons living with HIV48 
and recommendations against compulsory tests for migrant workers.49

<p>30. Justifications for compulsory testing revolve around protection and preservation of 
public health and resources in the receiving State.50 However, compulsory testing, 
especially for HIV, is not only counterproductive to the public health approach but is in 
violation of the right to health. Compulsory medical testing does not consider the window 
period required for an accurate test.51 Further, in cases of false negative results, individuals 
may engage in unsafe sexual practices, exposing sexual partners to increased risk.52 False 
positive results may lead to mental trauma among migrant workers, considering the stigma 
that may be associated with particular health conditions. Additionally, as both their 
immigration from sending States and stay in receiving States is dependent on these tests, 
migrant workers may avoid getting tested, forge documents or even stop treatment,53 thus 
driving the disease underground. Compulsory testing is also no guarantee against 
transmission of communicable diseases once migrant workers are inside the receiving State.  
</p>
<p>31. Compulsory testing is also inconsistent with the right to health, as it is done without 
informed consent and fails to respect the rights to autonomy, privacy, dignity and 
confidentiality of health information.54 Limitations on the right to health and informed 
consent, including for public health reasons, should be based on scientific evidence, must 
be the least restrictive alternative available and respect human dignity, rights and 
freedoms.55  
</p>
<p>32. In some cases, even where prohibited under the laws of the sending States, outbound 
migrant workers may be subjected to compulsory testing because the receiving State may 
require it before granting work permits to migrant workers.56 Policies of receiving States 
that require compulsory tests for exclusively incoming migrant workers may be additionally 
discriminatory if similarly situated foreign nationals such as tourists or even diplomats57 
may not be required to undergo compulsory testing. 
</p>
<p>33. Furthermore, test results are passed on to employers or recruitment agencies without 
the migrant worker&#8223;s consent,58 breaching the requirement of confidentiality and contrary to 
international recommendations.59 Additionally, pre- and post-test counselling protocols may 
not be followed, even when required by law.60 A right to health approach, however, 
requires that counselling, voluntary testing and treatment be treated as a health-care 
continuum.61 Migrant workers who test positive for HIV may remain in an irregular 
situation, making them more vulnerable to abuse by employers and less likely to access

<p>medical treatment. In cases of pregnancy, women may resort to risky illegal abortion to 
avoid deportation.62 Further, compulsory testing stigmatizes those who are deported based 
on positive test results.  
</p>
<p><b>  Detention and deportation  
</b></p>
<p>34. Receiving States frequently use the public health rationale to detain and deport 
migrant workers with specific health statuses, such as HIV, Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B.63 In 
linking immigration policies with health status, the right to health requirements of 
confidentiality, counselling and referral are overlooked.  
</p>
<p>35. To qualify as a public health exception, restrictions must be: provided by law, 
strictly necessary, for the least possible duration, based on scientific evidence and the least 
restrictive alternative available. As there are less restrictive, non-custodial alternatives 
available to detention,64 isolation, rather than detention, must be supported by law and used 
only when necessary as a measure of last resort, especially in cases of communicable 
diseases.65   
</p>
<p>36. Detention centres are often overcrowded, lack basic standards of hygiene, nutritious 
food and water. They have been described as centres of abuse and violence against migrant 
workers.66 Long periods of detention and poor living conditions in detention centres 
facilitate the transmission of communicable diseases and can have a devastating effect on 
the mental health of migrant workers.67 Health-care services in some detention centres are 
reportedly unavailable, difficult to access and of poor quality, which is particularly 
concerning for migrant workers detained due to health status.68 Migrant workers living with 
HIV have faced stigmatization and harassment as a result of lack of confidentiality in 
detention.69 Where States persist with immigration detention, they should, at the minimum, 
provide detainees with adequate living conditions, consensual medical check-ups and make 
quality and confidential physical and mental health facilities available and accessible in a 
timely manner.70

<p>37. The fear of detention and deportation prevents migrant workers from accessing 
health care,71 which may endanger their health and that of the broader population, thereby 
undermining public health justifications for detention and deportation. Further, employers 
may misuse laws providing for detention and deportation to exploit migrant workers.72 Fear 
of detention and deportation renders migrant workers more vulnerable and unable to enjoy 
the right to health and its underlying determinants. To fulfil the right to health of migrant 
workers, States should try to develop alternative detention policies more in line with the 
right to health.73 Additionally, without referral for counselling and treatment, deported 
migrant workers may also face difficulties in accessing health facilities, goods and services 
upon return to the sending State.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to health facilities, goods and services  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>38. Ensuring the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health facilities, 
goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable populations like 
migrant workers, is a core obligation under the right to health. Non-discrimination requires 
that regular and irregular migrant workers be equally entitled to freedoms and entitlements 
available to nationals of States. Access to health care in many receiving States, however, is 
dictated by restrictive immigration policies and public perceptions of &#8222;non-deserving&#8223; 
migrant workers, particularly those in an irregular situation.74 In the wake of the global 
economic crisis and associated austerity measures, States have legislated limitations on 
previously available health-care benefits for migrant workers.75 Such limitations are 
contrary to States&#8223; obligation to desist from taking retrogressive measures that impact on 
</p>
<p>health.  
</p>
<p>39. Further, equitable distribution of health facilities, goods and services is required to 
ensure that the most vulnerable are not disproportionately burdened beyond their means. It 
is regrettable that in many States, discriminatory laws largely undermine health care for 
migrant workers, especially irregular migrant workers.76 Even where legally required of 
employers, health-care coverage may cover only basic services and may be inadequately 
enforced by authorities.77 Consequently, migrant workers are forced to pay for health-care 
expenses, including emergency care, at rates that are sometimes disproportionately high 
compared to their income.78  
</p>
<p>40. The principle of non-discriminatory access is eroded when irregular migrant workers 
are not allowed to access non-emergency health-care services. Notably, mental illness is

<p>rarely considered an urgent health issue.79 Such insufficiencies lead to unacceptable gaps in 
the implementation of minimum health guarantees for irregular migrant workers.80 Further, 
the denial of access to health care until an emergency situation arises is incongruent with 
the right to health and counter-intuitive,81 as it imposes longer-term health and financial 
costs for individual migrant workers and society.  
</p>
<p>41. Policies linking access to health systems with immigration control discriminate 
against irregular migrants. In some countries, health-care providers are required, under 
threat of criminal sanction, to report irregular migrants to immigration authorities,82 which 
may lead to detention and deportation. As a result, instead of seeking formal channels of 
care83, irregular migrant workers resort to unsafe and illegal options. This renders them 
vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and increased health risks.  
</p>
<p><b>  Administrative barriers  
</b></p>
<p>42. The right to health obligates States to protect migrant workers against non-State 
parties that restrict their access to health care. Migrant workers are often refused health 
services, particularly specialized referral services on the basis of income qualification, and 
sometimes even because of incomplete paperwork.84 For irregular migrant workers, 
administrative barriers associated with their uncertain legal status are often an impediment 
to health care.85 Additionally, issues such as limited office hours or caps on the number of 
applications processed,86 may also act as barriers to access. 
</p>
<p><b>  Language and cultural barriers 
</b></p>
<p>43. A right to health approach requires States to disseminate culturally appropriate 
health-related education and information to both regular and irregular migrant workers. 
Anti-immigrant austerity measures in some States, however, have reduced subsidies for 
interpretation and translation services in health-care settings.87 Lack of familiarity with the 
local language may put migrant workers at a disadvantage, as they may not be able to 
sufficiently describe symptoms to enable accurate diagnosis and quality treatment.88 
Furthermore, an inability to understand health-related information and education may result 
in migrant workers unwittingly engaging in risky health behaviours. States should therefore

information and education.  
</p>
<p>44. Health-seeking behaviour can be influenced by a migrant worker&#8223;s cultural 
background. Cultural misunderstandings and apprehension of procedures which they are 
not traditionally and culturally familiar with act as barriers to access.89 Migrant workers 
may therefore prefer doctors who practise their native traditional systems of medicines and 
who better understand their diseases, as opposed to the host State&#8223;s health-care providers, 
who are perceived to lack cultural sensitivity to their health problems and sometimes racist 
and therefore discriminatory.90 
</p>
<p><b>  Treatment interruption 
</b></p>
<p>45. Ensuring continuous access to treatment and medicines on a non-discriminatory 
basis is crucial to the right to health framework. Migratory processes and pressures can 
expose migrant workers to increased risk of contracting communicable diseases particularly 
HIV.91 There is therefore a need to ensure that continuous treatment is available to these 
populations throughout the entire process. Treatment interruptions, lack of follow-up and 
treatment failures are documented at higher rates among migrants than the stationary 
population.92 Some States have adopted regional frameworks, such as the Ibero-American 
Social Security Convention,93 and bilateral social security agreements94 to ensure 
&#8220;portability&#8221; of social security, including health-care benefits, from sending to receiving 
States, which allows migrant workers to enjoy such benefits, independent of their 
immigration status. States are encouraged to adopt such approaches with respect to access 
to treatment for chronic diseases, such as HIV, in order to maximize adherence rates in both 
sending and receiving States.  
</p>
<p><b> D. 3D jobs and occupational health 
</b></p>
<p>46. Occupational health is integral to the right to health. States should ensure that 
occupational health laws and policies address the unique vulnerabilities of migrant workers 
in dirty, dangerous and degrading (3D) industries and are implemented, monitored and 
enforced.95 The vulnerability of migrant workers in 3D jobs may be further intensified in 
cases of irregular migrant workers, who, due to their legal status are in a weaker position to 
negotiate their rights with employers.96 Furthermore, lax enforcement of laws and

<p>mechanisms like sponsorship systems in some countries, encourage exploitative practices.97 
Sponsorship ties a migrant&#8223;s authorization to work with one specific employer, and in some 
States, sponsorship gives an employer the power to refuse a migrant worker&#8223;s request to 
transfer to another employer &#8211; such transfer may be sought due to abusive or unsafe 
working conditions.98 
</p>
<p><b>  Construction work  
</b></p>
<p>47. Construction work is inherently hazardous because it involves working on 
scaffolding and unfinished structures and using powerful machinery. Falls have been found 
to be more common among migrant workers,99 while hand injuries from power tools and 
eye injuries from building materials lodging in unprotected eyes are also frequent 
occurrences.100 In hot climates, heat stroke, exhaustion, dehydration and heat-related 
cardiac conditions are of particular concern, especially for those compelled to work 
excessive hours.101 In addition, physical abuse by employers, overcrowded and unsanitary 
accommodation, non-payment of wages, confiscation of passports and contract substitution 
further increase health risks posed by construction work.102  
</p>
<p>48. The provision of on-site training and protective equipment is necessary for the 
enjoyment of the right to a healthy working environment. Migrant construction workers 
often enter construction sites without appropriate training or sufficient protective 
equipment, for example safety ropes when working from heights.103 Further, instruction or 
training may not be provided in a language understandable to migrant workers, which may 
lead to greater occupational injuries and death among migrant workers.104  
</p>
<p>49. States should ensure relief and remedies for migrant workers injured due to violation 
of their right to occupational health.105 However, a lack of coverage under workers&#8223; health 
insurance or compensation schemes has often afflicted migrant workers, particularly 
irregular migrant workers.106 Additionally, the preponderance of sub-contracting

<p>arrangements in the construction industry denies coverage, which is otherwise available.107 
For severely injured workers, compulsory or voluntary repatriation may mean access to a 
lower standard of health care and inability to hold duty bearers in receiving States 
accountable.  
</p>
<p><b>  Agricultural work 
</b></p>
<p>50. Agricultural work is associated with particular occupational health risks. For 
example, exposure to pesticides and other farm chemicals has been linked to elevated 
distress levels,108 depression, neurological problems and miscarriages.109 Heavy and 
repetitive manual work also places great strain on the body, with associated risks of 
musculoskeletal injuries. Such risks must be addressed legislatively through enforceable 
occupational health and safety regulation and mechanisms for remedial action. 
</p>
<p>51. As with other 3D jobs, informal arrangements and lack of coverage under labour and 
occupational health and safety laws are common, leaving little room for migrant farm 
workers to negotiate working and living conditions necessary to facilitate the realization of 
their right to health.110 Inadequate and unhygienic living conditions, food insecurity, 
underpayment of wages and excessive hours among migrant farm workers111 increase the 
risk of illness and work-related injuries, while decreasing their capacity to access health 
care. High vulnerability to HIV has been recorded among migrant farm workers in some 
regions, due to lack of access to information and knowledge about HIV, availability and use 
of condoms, voluntary testing and health care.112   
</p>
<p>52. Even when workers&#8223; compensation and health insurance are available, irregular 
migrant farm workers have been found to be less aware of their rights,113 and therefore less 
likely to make a claim and seek medical attention. This indicates the need for both sending 
and receiving States to provide accessible and comprehensible information about rights to 
health care, insurance and workers compensation for migrant farm workers. 
</p>
<p>53. Difficulties commonly experienced by migrant workers in accessing health care are 
exacerbated for farm workers because of high mobility driven by seasonal work and rural

providing physically and economically accessible health care for migrant farm workers.

</p>
<p><b>  Domestic work 
</b></p>
<p>54. Women make up a significant proportion of the estimated 52.6 million migrant 
domestic workers worldwide.115 Domestic work provides economic and social 
independence for migrant women, accounting for 7.5 per cent of women&#8223;s wage 
employment globally.116 It is, however, largely undervalued and confined to the hidden 
informal economy of the home, reinforcing gender disparities in accessing underlying 
determinants of health, including decent work conditions.117  
</p>
<p>55. Discrimination and prejudice based on gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status 
intersect, causing chronic stress and making migrant domestic workers a highly vulnerable 
and marginalized group.118 Owing to their vulnerability, isolation and dependence, migrant 
domestic workers experience a range of violations119 which negate their enjoyment of the 
right to health and its underlying determinants. Violations include food and sleep 
deprivation, denial of medical treatment, squalid living conditions, non-payment of wages, 
excessive work hours (increasing the risk of accidents) and psychological, physical and 
sexual abuse.120 Cardiovascular, endocrine, skin, musculoskeletal, and psychological 
conditions have also been documented among migrant domestic workers, with worst cases 
resulting in death, including suicide.121 
</p>
<p>56. Migrant domestic workers are frequently excluded or inadequately covered by the 
receiving State&#8223;s labour laws and social protections, including health insurance.122 
Sponsorship systems, debt, language barriers, fear of arrest, detention or deportation and a 
lack of effective recourse for violations interact to varying degrees in different receiving 
States to facilitate the systematic exploitation and abuse of domestic workers.123 The 
situation of some migrant domestic workers has even been described as &#8220;modern-day 
slavery&#8221;.124 In order to fulfil the right to health, States are obligated to address the particular

<p>&#8220;&#8220;Sweeping Changes?&#8221; A Review of Recent Reforms on Protections for Migrant Domestic Workers 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>vulnerability of migrant domestic workers under labour, occupational health and safety and 
social protection laws. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to observe the adoption by the International 
Labour Office (ILO) in 2011 of Domestic Workers Convention No. 189 and 
Recommendation No. 201, which details requirements for protection from harassment and 
violence, occupational health and safety, written contracts and protection under labour 
laws. This follows general comment No. 1 (2010) on migrant domestic workers of the 
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, which pays particular attention to the vulnerability of migrant domestic workers 
throughout the different stages of migration. Implementation of these instruments would 
provide greater protection to migrant domestic workers at all stages of the migration 
process, thereby creating an enabling environment consistent with the obligation to fulfil 
the right to health.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sex work 
</b></p>
<p>58. States have a responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil the enjoyment of the right to 
health of migrant sex workers, regardless of whether they have been trafficked or not. 
Migrant sex workers are a highly stigmatized population as sex or sex-related work may be 
criminalized in many countries. Occupational health hazards for sex workers include a 
disproportionate risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, violence and often 
rape.125 Criminalization perpetuates discrimination, stigma and violence towards sex 
workers126 and is a barrier to accessing health-care services, which leads to poorer health 
outcomes.127 When combined with xenophobia, criminalization may legitimize harassment, 
intimidation and violence against migrant sex workers, especially by law enforcement 
authorities, without mechanism for protection or redress.128 The nature of the occupation is 
also used to justify compulsory testing for HIV and other communicable diseases.129 
Additionally, human traffickers may take advantage of the illegality of sex work and 
migration and exert undue influence and control over sex workers.130 
</p>
<p>59. The possibility of arrest, detention and deportation due to immigration status further 
discourages access to health facilities, goods and services, particularly for transgender sex 
workers who may face severe discrimination and abuse in their home country.131 Health 
needs of migrant sex workers are poorly understood in many countries, resulting in policies 
that fail to address their needs and vitiate the right to health. For example, possession of a 
condom as evidence of sex work-related criminality actively deters migrant sex workers 
from carrying condoms, which results in risky sexual behaviour and exposure to HIV and 
other sexually transmitted infections.132

<p>60. Ensuring non-discriminatory access to health care both in law and practice requires 
States to decriminalize consensual adult sex work, enact and implement laws extending 
labour rights, occupational health and safety and access to affordable health care, with 
particular focus on irregular migrant sex workers.  
</p>
<p>61. Participation of migrant sex workers in the formulation and implementation of 
health laws, programmes and collection of disaggregated data is required to ensure that 
health concerns of sex workers are addressed.133 Measures that provide a confidential and 
supportive environment for voluntary testing, treatment, referral and counselling, that 
educate sex workers about sexual and reproductive health rights, including preventing the 
transmission of HIV, and that tackle the marginalization experienced by sex workers are 
consistent both with epidemiological evidence and the right to health framework.134  
</p>
<p><b> E. Mental health 
</b></p>
<p>62. The provision of timely, affordable and non-discriminatory access to preventative, 
curative and rehabilitative mental health services and information forms part of the 
normative content of the right to health. The general stigma and lack of awareness 
surrounding mental disability,135 together with restricted access to health facilities, goods 
and services by migrant workers, means that their mental health may often be neglected.  
</p>
<p>63. Migration is a stressful experience due to dramatic changes to an individual&#8223;s 
cultural, environmental and social landscape. Its impact on mental health will vary between 
individuals, due to differences in personal experiences and characteristics, such as age, 
gender, medical history, cultural background and agency in the migration process.136 
</p>
<p>64. Within receiving States, immigration status, social exclusion, living and working 
conditions, communication with family, integration and access to health services are factors 
relevant to the mental health of migrant workers.137 Migration may also induce depressive 
symptoms in families left behind in sending States.138 Stigma, marginalization and 
discrimination are socially embedded and experienced regularly by migrant workers, 
particularly those who are in an irregular situation.139 Both sending and receiving States

<p>should address the psychosocial costs of migration faced by migrant workers and their 
families at all stages of the migration process. States should also invest in social support 
programmes with the participation of migrant workers to counter negative consequences of 
social exclusion, homesickness and family pressures.140  
</p>
<p>65. Migrant workers in 3D jobs, face occupational risk as an additional stress factor, 
while exposure to pesticides has been linked to anxiety, depression, irritability and 
restlessness in agricultural workers.141 For domestic workers, isolation and psychological 
trauma caused by abuse are occupational risks,142 and suicide has been associated with 
harsh working conditions of migrant construction workers.143 Effective implementation and 
enforcement of labour and occupational health and safety laws can contribute to reducing 
the risk of mental illness as well as physical injury.  
</p>
<p>66. Due to poor public funding of mental health services,144 psychological symptoms 
may go untreated or be inappropriately treated. Medicines are prescribed when counselling 
or psychosocial support services would be more appropriate.145 Even when mental health 
services are available, under-utilization and premature dropout from services have been 
recorded among migrants, including migrant workers.146 Constant fear of deportation may 
also be a stress factor,147 and discourage workers from accessing mental health facilities, 
goods and services, where available.  
</p>
<p>67. To effectively prevent and respond to mental illness, the right to health requires 
receiving States to take steps to identify and monitor stress factors and provide non-
discriminatory access to affordable, acceptable and quality psychosocial and mental health 
services. Sending States should also ensure that support services within embassies and 
consulates are accessible and that outgoing migrant workers comprehend the potential 
impact of migration on mental health and ways to access mental health care in receiving 
States.  
</p>
<p>68. Immigrant-specific health policies focusing on linguistically and culturally sensitive 
services have increased access to mental health services by migrants.148 Culturally and 
linguistically proficient community health workers can also play an important role due to

<p>their understanding of the underlying determinants of mental health for migrant workers, in 
accordance with the right to health.149  
</p>
<p>69. For returnee migrant workers, the lack of psychosocial services may result in mental 
health issues being severely ignored. Where it is recognized that migrant workers in 
particular sectors or countries are exploited and abused, sending States should implement 
measures to effectively address their mental health concerns. Such policies should be 
developed, implemented and monitored in consultation with returned migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Women and sexual and reproductive health 
</b></p>
<p>70. States should undertake a gender analysis to identify and address health 
vulnerabilities of female migrant workers resulting from different biological and 
sociocultural factors that influence their health. Women comprise a significant percentage 
of migrant workers but often face greater health vulnerabilities due to gender inequalities.150 
Poverty, family responsibilities and barriers to education and information make women 
more vulnerable before departing; while violence against women is pervasive during transit 
in some regions.151 Systematic exploitation and abuse within informal industries dominated 
by migrant women, such as domestic work and sex work, stems from and reinforces 
women&#8223;s vulnerability during the migration process.  
</p>
<p>71. Domestic and sexual violence, lack of redress for rights violations and lower wages 
than male counterparts reflect gender-based discrimination and aggravate its negative 
effects in the health-care setting and access to health care faced by migrant workers 
generally.152 Furthermore, gendered power imbalances and lack of access to health services, 
information and redress affects the ability of women, especially sex workers, to negotiate 
safe sex, which increases their vulnerability to HIV.153 Sending and receiving States should 
therefore address the compounded vulnerability of female migrant workers, particularly 
those with irregular status, in the development and implementation of evidence-based and 
participatory health policies and strategies. 
</p>
<p>72. The right to health requires States to ensure access to health facilities, goods and 
services, especially for vulnerable groups, such as migrant women workers. Health 
services, information and education should be tailored to the specific needs of women &#8211; 
such as sexual and reproductive health needs, including access to contraception and safe 
legal abortion &#8211; and pay attention to the special vulnerability of low-skilled migrant 
workers, regardless of immigration status.

<p>73. Some States deport women migrant workers who are found to be pregnant during 
compulsory medical testing.154 The women concerned may also be exposed to greater 
vulnerability in both sending and receiving States because of the stigma attached to 
pregnancy outside of marriage in many societies.155 The practice of forced contraceptive 
injections have been reported during pre-departure in some sending States.156 Such practices 
encroach upon rights to privacy, informed consent, confidentiality, dignity and non-
discrimination and act as an impediment to seeking assistance from police or health 
systems.157  
</p>
<p>74. Higher abortion rates among migrant workers have been linked to low awareness 
about and socioeconomic barriers to accessing contraception and family planning 
services.158 In countries which permit abortion but which prohibit migrant workers from 
becoming pregnant, the result is unequal access to legal reproductive health services due to 
apprehension of job loss and deportation, leading to risky treatment delays and unsafe 
abortions.159 Where abortion is criminalized, resort to unsafe abortion is also driven by the 
threat of criminal prosecution.160  
</p>
<p>75. For women who carry a pregnancy to term in receiving States, difficulty accessing 
obstetric, pre- and post-natal and maternal health-care services and information161 may 
result in adverse health outcomes for both the woman and child, including premature birth, 
low birth weight, congenital malformation and perinatal, infant and maternal mortality.162 In 
contrast, it has been found that policies promoting social integration of the migrant 
community reduce unfavourable pregnancy-related outcomes for migrant women.163 
Extending the 14-weeks maternity leave required under the Maternity Protection 
Convention or the maternity leave granted to nationals to women migrant workers164 would 
assist in making pregnancy-related health care and services accessible and in accordance 
with the right to health.

<p><b>(b) Establish labour corridors through enforceable bilateral agreements, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the right to health framework, which clearly define the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant workers, obligations of recruitment agencies, employers and States, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies, including compensation for violations, in line with the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Encourage collection of disaggregated data by age and gender of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant workers, to assess their level of health-related knowledge, health needs and 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupational injuries and deaths, including suicide, and accordingly inform policies 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding migrant workers. Such information should be protected by adequate data 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection measures to ensure privacy and confidentiality of the data;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Provide potential migrant workers with information about their rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly the right to health, as well as about recruitment agencies, employers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>States, recourse for redress and protection from abuse; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Regulate recruitment agencies through laws which discourage illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>recruitment and provide for rigorous monitoring and accountability mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Protect migrant workers from abuse by recruitment agencies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>employers by ensuring employment contracts are in accordance with the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>health and are enforceable; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Abolish discriminatory immigration policies that require mandatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>testing for health conditions, such as HIV and pregnancy, which are not based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>clearly established scientific evidence and violate the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Delink access to health facilities, goods and services from the legal status 
</b></p>
<p><b>of migrant workers and ensure that preventative, curative and emergency health 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities, goods and services are available and accessible to all migrant workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including irregular migrant workers, in a non-discriminatory manner. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>endeavour to prevent treatment interruption for migrant workers and remove 
</b></p>
<p><b>barriers to accessing health care, such as those that are linguistic, cultural, 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative and employment-related; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensure access to mental-health facilities, goods and services, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>social support groups and family reunification programmes, for all migrant workers </b>&#8211;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>including irregular and returnee migrant workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Extend existing domestic labour laws, occupational health and safety 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws, social insurance schemes and other protections to all categories of migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers, including domestic workers, sex workers and irregular migrant workers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Ensure protection of migrant workers, especially those in dangerous 
</b></p>
<p><b>industries, from abuse and exploitation by employers by providing accessible redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and compensation in cases of violation; </b></p>


<p><b>(l) Prevent the detention and deportation of migrant workers based on their 
</b></p>
<p><b>health status and ensure the provision of care and treatment to such migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the first instance. At minimum, States should ensure that migrant workers are not 
</b></p>
<p><b>deported without referral for treatment or to States where the required treatment is 
</b></p>
<p><b>not available and accessible; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Prevent the detention and deportation of irregular migrant workers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>instead regularize their stay on objective criteria, in order to protect them from 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation and ensure their full enjoyment of the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Encourage the establishment of migrant workers associations and trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>unions to ensure effective representation and participation of migrant workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including irregular and returnee migrant workers, in the formulation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation, monitoring and enforcement of laws and policies, including outreach 
</b></p>
<p><b>and referral programmes, pre-departure sessions and social support groups.
