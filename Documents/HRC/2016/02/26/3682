The human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all 
the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status,  </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the relevance of these treaties in 
the protection of all migrants, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of 
migrants, and the work of various special mechanisms of the Council that have reported on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> the importance of the decent work agenda of the International 
Labour Organization, including for migrant workers, the eight fundamental Conventions of 
that Organization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its eighteenth session (A/HRC/18/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p>at its ninety-eighth session, as a general framework within which each country can formulate 
policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job-
intensive recovery and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/170 of 20 December 2010, in which the 
Assembly acknowledged the important nexus between international migration and 
development and the need to deal with the challenges and opportunities that migration 
presents to countries of origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the successful negotiation of International Labour Organization 
Convention No. 189 concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, adopted on 16 June 
2011, </p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the efforts made to ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>the resolve</i> to take further measures to ensure respect for and protection 
of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and members of their families, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, to 
exercise due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants, including those perpetrated with 
racist or xenophobic motivations, to investigate such crimes and to punish the perpetrators, 
and that not doing so violates &#8211; and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of &#8211; the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of victims, and urging States to reinforce measures in this regard, 
including international cooperation, </p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind also </i>that the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms may 
only be subject to limitations and restrictions as provided by international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that migrant workers are among the most vulnerable in the context of the 
financial and economic crisis and that remittances, which are significant private financial 
sources for households, have been negatively affected by rising unemployment and weak 
earnings growth among migrant workers in some countries of destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> that female migrant workers engaged in domestic services are 
among the most vulnerable groups of migrant workers, some of whom are subject to a 
widespread pattern of physical, sexual and psychological abuse and exposure to health and 
safety threats without adequate information about associated risks and precautions,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> <i>also </i>at the fact that the vulnerable situation of migrants may result 
in violations of their human rights in countries of origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Global Forum on Migration and Development process, including the 
debates on migratory mobility, which emphasize the importance of facilitating access to 
regular forms of migration and, where applicable, to social services, including health, that 
contribute to the strengthening of the personal development prospects and outcomes for 
migrants and their families, </p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that migrants who are non-documented or in an irregular situation are 
frequently employed under less favourable conditions of work than other workers, and that 
certain employers find this an inducement to seek such labour in order to reap the benefits of 
unfair competition,<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time when migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns,  
</p>
<p><i> Mindful of the fact</i> that, in the fulfilment of their obligations to protect human rights, 
States of origin, transit and destination can benefit from schemes of international cooperation, </p>


<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants;1 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families to consider doing so as a matter of priority, and requests the 
Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants, 
regardless of their legal status, and also to take into account the principles and standards set 
forth in relevant international instruments that protect labour-related<b> </b>human rights;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, 
when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security 
measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human rights 
of migrants;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>5. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to ensure that their immigration policies are consistent 
with their obligations under international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that all migrants are entitled to equal protection by the law, 
and that all persons, regardless of their migratory status, are equal before the courts and 
tribunals and, in the determination of his/her rights and obligations in a suit at law, are 
entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 
established by law;  </p>
<p> 7. <i>Also</i> <i>reaffirms</i> the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the obligations of States under the International Covenants on Human Rights and, 
in this regard, strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to 
them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges States to apply and, where 
needed, reinforce existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or 
expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
xenophobic and racist acts; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Requests</i> all States to firmly protect the human rights of migrants relating to 
their conditions of work, regardless of their migratory status, in particular the right to equal 
pay for equal work; 
</p>
<p> 9.  <i>Stresses</i> that migrants have the right, without any discrimination, to just and 
favourable conditions of work and should have the appropriate means to pursue that right, 
including through the protection of the rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of 
association; 
</p>
<p> 10.  <i>Reaffirms</i> that, once a migrant assumes an employment relationship, regardless 
of their immigration status, the State in which he or she is employed has the obligation to 
ensure the respect of their labour-related human rights, as contained in the international 
instruments to which the State is a party; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes </i>programmes and policies implemented by some States of destination 
that promote the full respect of the labour-related human rights of migrants, regardless of 
their immigration status, as well as initiatives of States of origin to promote labour markets; 
</p>

<p> 12. <i>Urges</i> all<b> </b>States to strengthen measures to protect the human rights of migrant 
workers in times of humanitarian crisis;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> countries of origin, transit and destination to seek technical 
assistance and/or to collaborate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to better promote and protect the human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants to continue 
his efforts to promote and support the building of greater synergies between States to 
strengthen cooperation for the protection of the human rights of all<b> </b>migrant workers and their 
families; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to report on best practices of 
States to protect the human rights of all migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><i>37th meeting

<p><i> 30 September 2011
