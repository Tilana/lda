Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. is unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended

Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12

If answer is no, identify report(s), [X] YES [ ] NO
(3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations from the corresponding
period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the
subject report or portion

If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively and quantitatively, and, if
appropriate, state the reasons why a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.
Net loss for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 is anticipated to increase as compared
with the same period in 2015. In the six month period ended June 30, 2015 we reported a net
loss of $108,000 or $0.02 per share; however we anticipate that for the period ended June 30,
2016, net loss will be in the range of approximately $200,000 - $500,000, or a loss of $0.03 -
$0.07 per share.
Reported total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016, are expected to decrease
approximately $900,000 over that reported for the same period of 2015. This decrease in revenue
is primarily due to a combination of decreases in oil and natural gas prices as well as decreases
in production.
Total expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, are expected to decrease by
approximately $1,100,000 over that reported for the same period in 2015.
