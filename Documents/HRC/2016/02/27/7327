<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Turkey was held at the 13th meeting on 27 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Turkey was headed by B&#252;lent Ar&#305;n&#231;, Deputy Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister. At its 17th meeting, held on 29 January 2015, the Working Group adopted the 
</p>
<p>report on Turkey. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Turkey: Cuba, Gabon and Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Turkey: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/TUR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/TUR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America were transmitted to 
</p>
<p>Turkey through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation thanked, in advance, all countries that would make 
</p>
<p>recommendations in a spirit of sincere cooperation. He expressed gratitude to all relevant 
</p>
<p>governmental institutions and different stakeholders for their contributions, as they were 
</p>
<p>consulted during the preparation process for the UPR. He emphasized that the protection 
</p>
<p>and promotion of human rights was one of the political objectives of Turkey. The first pillar 
</p>
<p>of measures had been directed towards eliminating the problems stemming from legislation. 
</p>
<p>The second priority had been the establishment of new national human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>6. The Constitutional amendments of 12 September 2010 had introduced positive 
</p>
<p>discrimination in respect of women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities, had 
</p>
<p>enhanced the protection of personal data and children&#8217;s rights and had expanded the scope 
</p>
<p>of the right to freedom of assembly and association. The judicial reform packages had 
</p>
<p>introduced substantial legislative amendments to the Turkish Penal Code, the Code of 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure, the Anti-Terror Law and the Press Law, with the aim of strengthening 
</p>
<p>the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, enhancing its efficacy, facilitating access 
</p>
<p>to justice, expanding the scope of freedoms and ensuring further improvements in freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression. </p>


<p>7. The head of delegation acknowledged the advance written questions of some 
</p>
<p>countries, and stated that the Democratization Package of September 2013 enabled political 
</p>
<p>campaigning and propaganda, as well as education in private schools, in languages and 
</p>
<p>dialects other than Turkish. The ban on women wearing headscarves in the public service 
</p>
<p>had been lifted. Hate crime was included in the Turkish Penal Code and the penalty for the 
</p>
<p>offence of discrimination and hatred had been increased. A comprehensive Anti-
</p>
<p>Discrimination and Equality Law had been drafted, the action plan on preventing violations 
</p>
<p>of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms had entered into force on 1 March 2014, and the number of pending applications 
</p>
<p>before the European Court of Human Rights against Turkey had been reduced considerably. 
</p>
<p>On 27 September 2011, Turkey became a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-
</p>
<p>CAT) and ratification was under way for the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), signed in 2009, and the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, signed on 
</p>
<p>24 September 2012. 
</p>
<p>8. Turkey&#8217;s priority was institutionalization in the field of human rights. In 2010, the 
</p>
<p>right of individual application to the Constitutional Court had been introduced, followed by 
</p>
<p>a noteworthy body of case law.  
</p>
<p>9. The office of the Ombudsman had become operational in December 2012. A draft 
</p>
<p>amendment its founding law had been prepared, with a view to ensuring the 
</p>
<p>implementation of more recommendations and the settlement of complaints in a more 
</p>
<p>effective way. In addition, the National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) of Turkey had 
</p>
<p>been established in 2012 in accordance with the criteria set out by the principles relating to 
</p>
<p>the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles). Efforts were under way to enable the Institution to apply for accreditation. The 
</p>
<p>NHRI was additionally designated as the national preventive mechanism to perform tasks 
</p>
<p>under OP-CAT.  
</p>
<p>10. Legislative work was in progress for the establishment of a law enforcement 
</p>
<p>oversight commission, which was to function independently from law enforcement bodies 
</p>
<p>to examine and investigate allegations of ill-treatment made in respect of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials. The Law on Ending Terrorism and Strengthening Social Integration had entered 
</p>
<p>into force on 16 July 2014.  
</p>

</p>
<p>48. Djibouti lauded the efforts to implement the six judicial reform packages since the 
</p>
<p>first UPR. 
</p>
<p>49. Ecuador recognized the efforts to implement UPR recommendations, particularly 
</p>
<p>those related to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>50. The head of the delegation of Turkey stated that consultations were being conducted 
</p>
<p>with representatives of the Alevi community to address their demands. Problems of Roma 
</p>
<p>citizens regarding education, employment, housing, social policy and health had been 
</p>
<p>discussed, and solution-oriented approaches had been adopted. The absence of specific 
</p>
<p>provisions in respect of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons 
</p>
<p>did not mean that their rights were not legally guaranteed. The necessary investigations 
</p>
<p>were conducted into cases of killings of and acts of violence against LGBTI persons and all 
</p>
<p>types of hate crimes, in order to identify perpetrators and bring them to justice. The legal 
</p>
<p>process was conducted with diligence by the judicial authorities.  
</p>
<p>51. Minority rights in Turkey were regulated in accordance with the Treaty of Lausanne 
</p>
<p>of 1923; only non-Muslim citizens were recognized as &#8220;minorities&#8221;. No other definition of 
</p>
<p>minority existed in Turkey. Turkish citizens belonging to non-Muslim minorities were 
</p>
<p>entitled to the same rights and freedoms as other nationals on an individual basis, including 
</p>
<p>having their own schools, places of worship, foundations, hospitals and media 
</p>
<p>organizations. Any isolated anti-Semitic statements were condemned at the highest level, 
</p>
<p>and the necessary judicial or administrative steps were taken. No restrictions whatsoever 
</p>
<p>existed on the enjoyment of religious rights by non-Muslim citizens. Positive steps had 
</p>
<p>been taken in the field of education and culture for non-Muslim citizens.  </p>


<p>52. The head of the delegation, responding to an issue raised by the delegation of 
</p>
<p>Armenia, said that claims and allegations of a blockade were unfounded and did not reflect 
</p>
<p>the reality on the ground and were not related to human rights. Transit transportation 
</p>
<p>between Armenia and third countries could be carried out through Georgia or the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran and through Turkey, and there were direct flights between Turkey and 
</p>
<p>Armenia. The previous week, upon the anniversary of the death of Hrant Dink, the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister had once again confirmed the importance that Turkey accorded that matter and the 
</p>
<p>humanitarian approach that it had in that respect.  
</p>
<p>53. Turkey was taking the measures necessary to prevent the movement of citizens of 
</p>
<p>third countries who attempted to use its territory to travel to third countries to join radical 
</p>
<p>groups; source countries were also expected to take similar steps and cooperate with Turkey 
</p>
<p>in that regard.  
</p>
<p>54. The delegation stated that there were 166 non-Muslim community foundations in 
</p>
<p>Turkey. Regulations had been enacted to address the property issues of foundations 
</p>
<p>belonging to different faith groups. Provisional article 11 had been introduced, on 27 
</p>
<p>August 2011, to the Law on Foundations No. 5737, whereupon the Foundations Council 
</p>
<p>had decided to register 333 immovable properties in the name of the relevant foundation, 
</p>
<p>and compensation for 21 immovable properties had been paid. 
</p>
<p>55. Egypt expressed concern about the deterioration in the human rights situation, 
</p>
<p>especially regarding freedom of expression and assembly.  
</p>
<p>56. Equatorial Guinea noted with satisfaction measures taken in favour of minorities and 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s participation in political life. 
</p>
<p>57. Estonia called upon Turkey to respect the right to peaceful assembly and association. 
</p>
<p>It expressed hope that human rights defenders and journalists could work properly and 
</p>
<p>without fearing prosecution. 
</p>
<p>58. Finland commended efforts to protect refugees, but noted that restrictions on media 
</p>
<p>and dissenting voices had continued to increase.  
</p>
<p>59. France welcomed the Deputy Minister and his delegation.  
</p>
<p>60. Gabon congratulated Turkey for the constitutional amendment recognizing the 
</p>
<p>principle of positive discrimination, the judicial reform, the mediator institution and the law 
</p>
<p>on terrorism and social integration. 
</p>

</p>
<p>concerned by restrictions on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.  
</p>

</p>
<p>safeguards.

</p>
<p>recognizing minorities. 
</p>
<p>66. Iceland recognized Constitutional amendments but was concerned about restrictions 
</p>
<p>on freedom of expression and about domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>67. India welcomed the judicial reform and democratization package, the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>and gender equality policies. It encouraged Turkey to enhance the equality of women, 
</p>
<p>address discrimination against minorities and implement CRPD. </p>


<p>68. Indonesia welcomed legal and institutional reforms, the protection of children in 
</p>
<p>conflict with the law and the fight against human trafficking, which could be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>69. Ireland expressed concern about restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly.

</p>
<p>to continue to fight against child labour.

</p>
<p>neighbouring countries, and encouraged further implementation of legislative reforms.

<p>mechanism to perform tasks within the context of OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>78. Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic expressed appreciation for efforts to protect and 
</p>
<p>safeguard the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>79. Latvia commended efforts in raising girls&#8217; schooling rates and the provision of 
</p>
<p>education services to refugees.

</p>

<p>efforts to enhance the independence of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>89. Montenegro requested that Turkey elaborate on the measures taken to prevent early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriages in an integrated manner. </p>


<p>90. Morocco welcomed the country&#8217;s adhesion to OP-CAT, progress made on gender 
</p>
<p>equality and the introduction in the Constitution of the concept of affirmative action. 
</p>
<p>91. Myanmar appreciated efforts in reviewing laws and regulations and bringing them 
</p>

<p>by the Government. 
</p>

<p>strengthening of the judicial and institutional frameworks. 
</p>
<p>96. Norway expressed concerns about reports of increased intervention in the media and 
</p>
<p>about journalists&#8217; self-censorship. 
</p>
<p>97. In response to the Egyptian delegate, the head of the delegation underlined that 
</p>
<p>Turkey was open to all constructive recommendations and criticism regarding the 
</p>
<p>implementation of democracy, fundamental freedoms and, especially, human rights, since 
</p>
<p>they are universal values. However the delegation wished to see such criticism and 
</p>
<p>recommendations coming from parties who adhered to the same common universal values 
</p>
<p>as Turkey did.  
</p>
<p>98. In Turkey, freedom of expression and the media were considered an indispensable 
</p>
<p>part of democratic order. The offence of creating propaganda for terrorist organizations had 
</p>
<p>been redefined and amended to reflect more concrete criteria for conviction. A working 
</p>
<p>group had been set up in the Ministry of Justice for the identification of legal provisions 
</p>
<p>that may impose restrictions on the freedom of expression. A complete pluralism existed in 
</p>
<p>Turkey in respect of media organizations.  
</p>
<p>99. The head of the delegation clarified that the reasons for the detention of persons who 
</p>
<p>were referred to as &#8220;detained journalists&#8221; were not related to their journalistic activities. As 
</p>
<p>at 23 January 2015, a total of 31 such persons were in custody&#8212;29 convicted, 2 held on 
</p>
<p>remand&#8212;on charges such as being a member of an armed terrorist organization, attempting 
</p>
<p>to overthrow the constitutional order, voluntary manslaughter and embezzlement.  
</p>
<p>100. The head of the delegation stressed that the judiciary was independent from the 
</p>
<p>legislative and executive powers. Detention on remand had ceased to be a widely used 
</p>
<p>protective measure; the length of detentions and the detention rates in prisons had been 
</p>
<p>dramatically reduced.  
</p>
<p>101. The delegation noted that the law on assemblies and demonstration marches had 
</p>
<p>been amended to ensure public participation in the determination of venues and routes for 
</p>

</p>
<p>issue was well known, and that Turkey did not need to repeat its position at that time, nor

</p>

<p>the law was one of the basic principles of the Turkish Constitution. A new definition had 
</p>
<p>been introduced in the Constitution through an amendment in 2010, which allowed for 
</p>
<p>positive discrimination for women. Turkey had been the first to sign and ratify the Council 
</p>
<p>of Europe Istanbul Convention; Law No. 6284 on the Protection of Family and Prevention

</p>
<p>April 2014, and the principle of non-refoulement had gained legal basis. The procedure 
</p>
<p>relating to humanitarian residence permit and subsidiary protection mechanisms had been 
</p>
<p>defined, and &#8220;temporary protection&#8221; to be provided in cases of massive influx had been 
</p>
<p>codified for the first time. Work on drafting the law on the prevention of human trafficking 
</p>
<p>and protection of victims was under way.  
</p>
<p>145. The delegation highlighted that the National Strategy Document and Action Plan on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child 2013&#8211;2017 was focused on keeping girls in the education system, 
</p>
<p>with an aim to prevent early marriages. The illiteracy rate of women and girls in Turkey 
</p>
<p>had been decreasing for the past decade. Turkey had ratified the ILO Worst Forms of Child 
</p>
<p>Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182). The National Strategy Document and Action Plan 
</p>
<p>included key measures on the prevention of child labour.  
</p>
<p>146. Turkey was a safe harbour for more than 1.6 million Syrians. With others, the figure 
</p>
<p>reached 2 million. In conformity with its international obligations, Turkey had pursued an 
</p>
<p>open-door policy for all Syrians and Iraqis who had to flee the conflicts in their countries 
</p>
<p>during the past four years. The amount disbursed for its humanitarian response had reached 
</p>
<p>US$ 5 billion, whereas total bilateral and multilateral support had remained at 
</p>
<p>US$ 300 million. In response to certain allegations, the delegation stated that accusing 
</p>
<p>Turkey of mistreating Syrians or not doing its share in addressing their needs was equal to 
</p>
<p>failing to acknowledge the huge burden on and the great sacrifices made by Turkey. 
</p>
<p>147. The head of delegation thanked everyone who attended the UPR review of Turkey; 
</p>
<p>the questions asked and recommendations made during the session had been noted and 
</p>
<p>would be considered with diligence. </p>
