<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group conducted an official visit to Chile from 1 to 9 September 2014 
</p>
<p>at the invitation of the Government. It met with stakeholders in Santiago de Chile, 
</p>
<p>Valpara&#237;so and Arica. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Chile for 
</p>
<p>helping to arrange meetings with the pertinent State agencies and for its excellent 
</p>
<p>cooperation throughout the process. 
</p>
<p>2. In Santiago, the Working Group met with the President of the Republic, the 
</p>
<p>President of the Senate, the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Minister 
</p>
<p>responsible for gender matters, the Minister of Justice, the Director of the National Service 
</p>
<p>for Women (SERNAM), the Undersecretary-General within the Office of the President, the 
</p>
<p>Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the Ministry of the Interior and 
</p>
<p>Public Security; the Ministry of Social Development; the Ministry of Education; the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health; the Ministry of the Economy, Development and Tourism; the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Labour and Social Security; the National Service for Persons with Disabilities; the 
</p>
<p>National Service for Older Persons; the National Indigenous Development Corporation 
</p>
<p>(CONADI); the National Council for Children; and the National Service for Minors. In 
</p>
<p>Valpara&#237;so, the Working Group met with the Committee on Human Rights and Aboriginal 
</p>
<p>Peoples and the Committee on Constitution, Law and Justice of the Chamber of Deputies, 
</p>
<p>as well as the Senate Health Committee and the Senate Labour and Social Security 
</p>
<p>Committee. In Arica, the Working Group met with the regional governor, the Director of 
</p>
<p>SERNAM and the Regional Ministerial Health Department.  
</p>
<p>3. During the visit, the Working Group met with the National Human Rights Institute 
</p>
<p>and with civil society representatives.1 It also met with the United Nations Country Team 
</p>
<p>and would like to express its particular gratitude for the support provided by the Regional 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has seen strong economic growth. The 
</p>
<p>poverty rate fell from 40 per cent in 1990 to 14 per cent in 2013. However, this significant 
</p>
<p>economic development, as a result of which the World Bank classifies Chile as a high-
</p>
<p>income country, was not inclusive: inequality in income and wealth distribution continues 
</p>
<p>to be one of the country&#8217;s main challenges, hindering true social integration. At the same 
</p>
<p>time, it has led to significant inequality in areas such as education and health, despite the 
</p>
<p>increase in public spending in those spheres. Although Chile has a very high level of human 
</p>
<p>development and is ranked 41 of 187 countries,2 it also has the highest level of income 
</p>
<p>inequality in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) area 
</p>
<p>and the fourth-highest level of poverty in the region. One in five persons in Chile is poor 
</p>
<p>and one in four reports not having enough money to buy sufficient food.3 There are also 
</p>
<p>territorial inequalities that create conflict between the central region and the other regions 
</p>

</p>
<p>of Chile, and there is evidence of discrimination and rights violations against certain groups, 
</p>
<p>particularly women,4 indigenous peoples and migrants.  
</p>
<p>5. The national fertility rate is 1.89 children per woman. Life expectancy is higher for 
</p>
<p>women (82.2 years) than for men (76.1 years). The maternal mortality rate is one of the 
</p>
<p>lowest in Latin America, with 22.1 deaths per 100,000 live births.5 Women are the heads of 
</p>
<p>39 per cent of Chilean households, of which 55 per cent live in extreme poverty.6  
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group visited the country at a time of change with regard to the rights 
</p>
<p>of women. The current President, Michelle Bachelet, who was re-elected after her first term 
</p>
<p>of office from 2006 to 2010, has publicly recognized that various forms of structural 
</p>
<p>discrimination affect Chilean women in the areas of family, politics and work. She has also 
</p>
<p>affirmed that if Chile is to achieve full economic, social and political development, all 
</p>
<p>barriers limiting women&#8217;s exercise and enjoyment of substantive equality must be removed.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal, institutional and political framework for women</b>&#8217;<b>s 
equality and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. At the international and regional levels 
</b></p>
<p>7. Chile has participated positively in international human rights mechanisms, such as 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies, the universal periodic review and the special procedures. It has ratified most 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights instruments, including the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, in 1989, and the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;), in 1998. It has committed to the Beijing 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995 and the Millennium Development Goals. Chile 
</p>
<p>voted against Human Rights Council resolution 26/11 on protection of the family,7 which 
</p>
<p>does not protect women&#8217;s right to equality within the family and does not recognize family 
</p>
<p>diversity. The Working Group welcomes the Government&#8217;s intention to ratify the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women.  
</p>
<p>8. Chile has also ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Equal 
</p>
<p>Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100); Maternity Protection Convention (Revised), 
</p>
<p>1952 (No. 103); Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111); 
</p>
<p>Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention, 1981 (No. 156); Indigenous and Tribal 
</p>
<p>Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) and, recently, the Domestic Workers Convention, 
</p>
<p>2011 (No. 189), a move welcomed by the Working Group. Chile has yet to ratify the ILO 
</p>
<p>Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183) or the Additional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights (Protocol of San Salvador).

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. At the national level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Over the last 20 years, Chile has launched several legislative initiatives in order to 
</p>
<p>further the realization of women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality. The Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Chile enshrines the principles of non-discrimination and equality between men and women.  
</p>
<p>10. Act No. 20609, adopted in 2012, established anti-discrimination measures, with a 
</p>
<p>judicial mechanism that makes it possible to effectively restore the rule of law whenever an 
</p>
<p>act of arbitrary discrimination is committed. It also contains a definition of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>discrimination that makes express reference to discrimination on grounds of sex and gender 
</p>
<p>identity. However, the Act does not contain a broad definition of direct and indirect 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women or affirmative action and reparation for victims in line with 
</p>
<p>articles 1 and 2 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women and with the principle of equality between women and men.  
</p>
<p><i>  Women in the family  
</i></p>
<p>11. Chile has made progress towards the elimination of archaic provisions in the area of 
</p>
<p>family law, such as differences between the rights of children born in and out of civil 
</p>
<p>wedlock and the classification of adultery as a crime, which has now been abolished.8  
</p>
<p>12. In 2004, the new Civil Marriage Act No. 19947 established divorce on grounds of 
</p>
<p>cessation of cohabitation (which requires a waiting period of one year when there is mutual 
</p>
<p>agreement and of three years when the divorce is instituted by only one spouse) and divorce 
</p>
<p>on grounds of fault (which does not require any waiting period). The Working Group notes 
</p>
<p>with satisfaction that the Act protects the right to financial compensation in a divorce for 
</p>
<p>the spouse who was responsible for childcare and domestic tasks rather than paid activity. 
</p>
<p>Also among the recent changes to family law is Act No. 20680 of 2013, which incorporated 
</p>
<p>the concept of shared parental responsibility into the Civil Code.9 
</p>
<p>13. Although the general legislative framework recognizes equal rights and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities for men and women within the family, legal provisions that discriminate 
</p>
<p>against women remain.  
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group noted with concern that the rules governing marital property 
</p>
<p>under one of the  joint property regimes discriminate against women. If spouses do not 
</p>
<p>agree to another property regime, the general and supplementary regime under the Civil 
</p>
<p>Code will apply to their property relations, and the husband will manage both joint property 
</p>
<p>and the property belonging to the wife. In order to manage or access their property, wives 
</p>
<p>must be represented or authorized by their husbands when participating in legal procedures, 
</p>
<p>such as selling or letting property, or commercial procedures, such as arranging a loan. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group welcomes the bill to reform the joint property regime, which makes women 
</p>
<p>fully able to administer their own property and the assets acquired during the marriage. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group notes that the Civil Union Act, adopted on 28 January 2015 by 
</p>
<p>Congress and currently under consideration by the Constitutional Court, recognizes the 
</p>
<p>property rights of heterosexual and homosexual couples, but lacks filiation rights for the 
</p>
<p>latter. As highlighted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women in its general recommendation No. 21, States must protect the equality of women

</p>
<p>in de facto unions, in the sharing of income and assets and in the care and raising of 
</p>
<p>children.10  
</p>
<p><i>  Women in the workforce 
</i></p>
<p>16. The Constitution and the Labour Code also recognize and guarantee the principle of 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination in the area of work. In 2009, Act No. 20348 introduced the concept of 
</p>
<p>equal pay for men and women into the Labour Code. However, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>informed that citizens are generally unaware of the existence of this Act, which reduces its 
</p>
<p>effectiveness. Workers&#8217; fear of losing their job if they mention the Act and their low levels 
</p>
<p>of unionization, particularly among women, are also obstacles to its implementation. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group also notes that the Equal Pay Act does not provide for equal pay for work 
</p>
<p>of equal value, despite the State&#8217;s obligation in that regard under the ILO Conventions and 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>17. In 1998, Act No. 19591 banned employers from imposing pregnancy-related 
</p>
<p>conditions in respect of female employees. In 2006, Act No. 20123 prohibited 
</p>
<p>discrimination between male and female workers, regardless of whether they are permanent 
</p>
<p>employees or subcontracted employees. This prohibition encompasses, inter alia, maternity 
</p>
<p>benefits. In 2011, Act No. 20545 extended paid maternity leave to 24 weeks, with the 
</p>
<p>option of transferring it to fathers, although women with salaries above the limit established 
</p>
<p>by the Act are at a disadvantage. Additionally, Act No. 20761 of 2014 extends to fathers the 
</p>
<p>option of exercising the right established in 2007 under Act No. 20166, which allows 
</p>
<p>women to leave their place of work for one hour per day in order to feed their children aged 
</p>
<p>under 2. The Working Group expresses its concern that many women are not part of the 
</p>
<p>formal workforce and are therefore unable to benefit from paid maternity leave. 
</p>
<p>18. In the area of shared responsibility for caring for dependent persons of other ages, 
</p>
<p>the process initiated in 1977 by Act No. 19505 is important. That Act established, for the 
</p>
<p>first time, leave for working parents to care for children with special needs. In 2011, that 
</p>
<p>leave was extended by Act No. 20535 to include care for persons over the age of 18 who 
</p>
<p>have mental disabilities or are highly dependent, which marked the first time that a labour 
</p>
<p>law had recognized care for dependent adults as a protected responsibility. Despite this 
</p>
<p>progress, Chile is far from having embraced an egalitarian concept of family 
</p>
<p>responsibilities, since the extensions of maternity and care leave apply to female workers as 
</p>
<p>the main beneficiaries and are available to male workers only at the option of the mother.11  
</p>
<p><i>  Women in political life 
</i></p>
<p>19. The Working Group welcomes the recent adoption by Congress of the reform 
</p>
<p>replacing the binominal electoral system with an inclusive proportional system, with 60/40 
</p>
<p>gender quotas for nominations on lists of candidates.12 The reform includes an affirmative 
</p>
<p>action mechanism that requires parties to present gender-balanced lists; neither men nor 
</p>
<p>women may represent less than 40 per cent or more than 60 per cent of any party&#8217;s lists. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, it includes economic incentives for the election of women, promoting their 
</p>
<p>nomination for competitive positions, and establishes penalties for non-compliance.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>  Sexual and reproductive rights and health 
</i></p>
<p>20. Act No. 20418, adopted in 2010, established regulations on information, guidance 
</p>
<p>and services in the area of fertility regulation, including the right to education, information, 
</p>
<p>guidance and choice in areas relating to contraception and sex education. However, it grants 
</p>
<p>schools and parents&#8217; associations the freedom to select and modify sex education 
</p>
<p>programmes according to their beliefs and values. The Act requires the public sector to 
</p>
<p>distribute contraceptives without discrimination, although the Working Group noted severe 
</p>
<p>difficulties in accessing them (see para. 64).  
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group notes with extreme concern that abortion is criminalized in all 
</p>
<p>circumstances under articles 342 and 345 of the Criminal Code. The right to therapeutic 
</p>
<p>abortion existed in the country between 1931 and 1989, when the Health Code was 
</p>
<p>amended by the military dictatorship. In January 2015, the Government submitted a bill to 
</p>
<p>Congress that amended the definition and punishment of abortion as an offence. 
</p>
<p>Consideration is being given to decriminalizing voluntary interruption of pregnancy in three 
</p>
<p>circumstances: following rape, when the mother&#8217;s life is in danger and when the foetus is 
</p>
<p>not viable.13 Chile is one of the few Latin American States that prohibits abortion for any 
</p>
<p>reason and that has a clause in its Constitution explicitly protecting unborn children. In July 
</p>
<p>2014, the Human Rights Committee reiterated the international community&#8217;s concern 
</p>
<p>regarding the abortion law in Chile and recommended that the country establish exceptions 
</p>
<p>to the general ban on abortion, including therapeutic abortion and cases where a pregnancy 
</p>
<p>is the result of rape or incest. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women made a similar recommendation.  
</p>
<p><i>  Violence against women 
</i></p>
<p>22. The first law in Chile against domestic violence, adopted in 1995, initially 
</p>
<p>emphasized the need to maintain the family unit through reconciliation therapy. This law 
</p>
<p>was amended in 2005 by Act No. 20066, which improved protection measures and 
</p>
<p>increased sentences. The Criminal Code was also amended in 2010, by Act No. 20480, to 
</p>
<p>criminalize femicide committed by spouses, ex-spouses, partners or ex-partners, but 
</p>
<p>femicide outside the family has not been addressed. Furthermore, there are gaps regarding 
</p>
<p>the criminalization of sexual harassment, which is deemed a crime only when it occurs in 
</p>
<p>the workplace (art. 2 of the Labour Code) or if it is committed against minors (Act No. 
</p>
<p>20526), but not in other settings or circumstances. The Working Group welcomes the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s announcement regarding an amendment to the law on domestic violence 
</p>
<p>aimed at making it more comprehensive, since the current legislation does not consider all 
</p>
<p>forms of violence in all spheres, both public and private. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group recognizes that these laws have provided a legal basis for the 
</p>
<p>protection of women&#8217;s rights, but it also notes that many of them are incomplete and have 
</p>
<p>not been implemented systematically or effectively. The Working Group furthermore notes 
</p>
<p>that the existing laws have not been sufficiently disseminated so that Chilean women and 
</p>
<p>men are fully aware of their existence and that there does not appear to be a significant 
</p>
<p>number of legal proceedings so as to ensure that legal changes are in fact applied, such as in 
</p>
<p>the case of the laws on equal pay, sexual harassment and violence against women.

</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>24. At the institutional level, since its creation in 1991, SERNAM has played a 
</p>
<p>significant role as the primary State institution responsible for promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and for achieving equality and has sought to ensure that a gender dimension 
</p>
<p>is incorporated into all State policies.  
</p>
<p>25. One of the objectives of National Indigenous Development Corporation is to 
</p>
<p>encourage the participation and comprehensive development of indigenous women, in 
</p>
<p>coordination with SERNAM. The Corporation&#8217;s Women and Gender Unit was created in 
</p>
<p>March 2008 to promote, among other things, equal opportunities for representation and 
</p>
<p>participation by indigenous women, with the aim of fostering their development, 
</p>
<p>representation and participation. 
</p>
<p>26. With a view to strengthening the institutional framework for gender equality, the 
</p>
<p>Government has recently created the Ministry for Women and Gender Equity, 14 which 
</p>
<p>replaced SERNAM. The new Ministry&#8217;s responsibilities will be to promote laws that ensure 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s full enjoyment of rights and equal opportunities; to develop policies and 
</p>
<p>programmes to prevent, eradicate and punish violence against women; to promote equality 
</p>
<p>between women and men in family relationships and with respect to responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>education, care and development of children and other family members requiring care; and 
</p>
<p>to promote changes to bring an end to stereotypes, prejudice and practices that discriminate 
</p>
<p>against women. However, the Working Group finds it regrettable that the term &#8220;<i>equidad</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(equity) was chosen rather than &#8220;<i>igualdad</i>&#8221; (equality) and that the law does not explicitly 
</p>
<p>mention vulnerable groups of women. Under the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Covenants on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the State is required to respect, protect and ensure women&#8217;s right to equality and to prohibit 
</p>
<p>gender-based discrimination against them. The promise of equity is insufficient to ensure 
</p>
<p>the right to equality and to a life free from all forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>27. Despite increasingly scarce resources, Chilean civil society also plays an important 
</p>
<p>role in the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights, in some cases taking the lead or 
</p>
<p>challenging the State when it does not fulfil its responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Policies 
</b></p>
<p>28. The current Government is committed to intensifying its efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic inequality in Chile. It has also recognized that gender inequality is the most 
</p>
<p>pronounced form of inequality. Its political will is reflected in several draft reforms, 
</p>
<p>including constitutional reform; reform of the binominal electoral system, with a gender 
</p>
<p>quota for candidates of political parties; tax reform; measures to implement equal pay; and 
</p>
<p>an end to for-profit education, thus providing access to quality education, strengthening 
</p>
<p>public education and moving towards free, quality higher education. The tax reform 
</p>
<p>adopted in September 2014 aims to bring about inclusive development, increasing public 
</p>
<p>spending by 3 per cent and ensuring fiscal sustainability with the aim of, among other 
</p>
<p>things, funding the increase in education spending. 
</p>
<p>29. The New Gender and Equity Agenda addresses women&#8217;s rights, equality and 
</p>
<p>autonomy, tackling issues such as:  
</p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p> (a) Violence against women, by increasing the number of women&#8217;s shelters and 
</p>
<p>centres, amending the Domestic Violence Act and drafting the National Action Plan on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women;  
</p>
<p> (b) The participation of women in politics, through electoral reform;  
</p>
<p> (c) Inequalities in women&#8217;s participation in the world of work, by increasing 
</p>
<p>their representation on the boards of public companies, establishing programmes to train 
</p>
<p>and assist them in finding employment, increasing the number of nurseries and 
</p>
<p>kindergartens and setting up a national care system for children, family members with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and older adults; 
</p>
<p> (d) Sexual and reproductive rights, through the bills on sex education and the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of abortion; 
</p>
<p> (e) Quality of life, through preventive health care and leisure, culture and sports 
</p>
<p>programmes;  
</p>
<p> (f) Cultural change, so as to put an end to practices and stereotypes based on 
</p>
<p>gender. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group recognizes the efforts made to improve the social security 
</p>
<p>system, for example through the creation of the non-contributory pension, which widened 
</p>
<p>the individual capitalization system and introduced a system of non-contributory pensions 
</p>
<p>for women and men over 65 who are unable to collect a pension on retirement. The 
</p>
<p>solidarity insurance contribution  supplements the social security funds of individuals who 
</p>
<p>have less money in their fund than the minimum required to receive a pension. This is very 
</p>
<p>important in the case of women who, because they have devoted themselves to their role as 
</p>
<p>mothers, have been unable to pay contributions during certain periods of their life. However, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group considers it regrettable that some of these non-contributory pensions 
</p>
<p>amount to less than the minimum wage.15 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group hopes that Chile will achieve the objective set under the 
</p>
<p>National Health Strategy of reducing the projected fertility rate among those under 19 by 10 
</p>
<p>per cent before 2020 through a range of strategies such as adolescent-friendly spaces. 
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group finds it regrettable that the terms &#8220;equity&#8221; and &#8220;equality&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>used interchangeably in government policies and programmes and urges the State to draw a 
</p>
<p>distinction between the terms and to use the term &#8220;gender equality&#8221;, as indicated above. It 
</p>
<p>notes that the executive has repeatedly encountered difficulties in implementing policies, 
</p>
<p>particularly with regard to bills aimed at promoting the equality of women in various 
</p>
<p>settings. Many of the people consulted by the Working Group agreed that patriarchal social 
</p>
<p>attitudes &#8212; reinforced through conservative religious values that are resistant to changes 
</p>
<p>aimed at promoting women&#8217;s rights &#8212; have had considerable impact on the formulation of 
</p>
<p>policies and laws. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>33. Despite efforts to modernize the administration of justice, including reforms to 
</p>
<p>criminal and civil procedure and family justice, 16  the Working Group noted failings 
</p>
<p>concerning women&#8217;s access to justice. It observed that courts do not offer realistic remedies 
</p>
<p>for women as regards equality. Obtaining effective reparation requires very costly legal 
</p>
<p>representation, notwithstanding the existence of the Legal Aid Corporation, a non-profit

</p>
<p>public service charged with providing legal guidance and advice, along with free legal 
</p>
<p>representation for those without the financial resources to pay for it. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>was also informed that legal aid is available only for persons with very low incomes and 
</p>
<p>that demand for services frequently exceeds response capacity. The civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations involved in legal aid lack the resources to litigate cases. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>finds it regrettable that the National Human Rights Institute may only launch legal 
</p>
<p>proceedings before the courts in cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, torture, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance and human trafficking and is not permitted to submit amicus curiae 
</p>
<p>briefs to the courts. Furthermore, the Working Group was informed that a large number of 
</p>
<p>women who were victims of torture and sexual violence during the dictatorship have lacked 
</p>
<p>the necessary resources to present evidence before the courts and have not obtained due 
</p>
<p>reparation. 
</p>
<p>34. According to the information received, factors such as socioeconomic status, 
</p>
<p>residence in rural areas, ethnicity, nationality and age strongly influence women&#8217;s real 
</p>
<p>possibilities of accessing effective legal remedies. The case of G.B.B., a female Aymaran 
</p>
<p>herder who was detained in 2007, accused of neglect leading to the death of her 3-year-old 
</p>
<p>son while she was working as a llama herder and sentenced to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment, was 
</p>
<p>highlighted by the National Human Rights Institute as an example of how the legal system 
</p>
<p>can exacerbate social exclusion and discrimination. The sentence, in addition to violating 
</p>
<p>the right to due process and international standards on the rights of indigenous peoples, did 
</p>
<p>not consider the cultural characteristics of female Aymaran herders and was based on a 
</p>
<p>western legal perspective. In mid-2012, the then President of the Republic reduced the 
</p>
<p>sentence from 12 to 6 years. The case 17  has been submitted to the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights on grounds of discriminatory treatment and a lack of due 
</p>
<p>process resulting in an excessive and unfair sentence. 
</p>
<p>35. During its visit, the Working Group was informed of the excessive caseload of the 
</p>
<p>courts, particularly the family courts, which delays the processing of cases and requests for 
</p>
<p>precautionary protection measures against imminent acts of violence. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>noted that in criminal law, only a small percentage of cases of violence against women go 
</p>
<p>to trial, and an even smaller percentage result in the conviction of the attacker. These 
</p>
<p>shortcomings create a climate of mistrust regarding the ability of the courts to provide 
</p>
<p>effective legal remedies.  
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group was also informed that courts are not generally sensitive to 
</p>
<p>gender. For that reason, as part of the Atala case,18 the Inter-American Court of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights called for training for judicial authorities on issues relating to gender-based 
</p>
<p>discrimination. The Working Group finds it regrettable that the Supreme Court does not 
</p>
<p>consider the decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights or international human 
</p>
<p>rights law to be legally binding. It also finds regrettable that the core curriculum of the 
</p>
<p>Academy of the Judiciary does not include courses on women&#8217;s rights or gender equality, 
</p>
<p>and that the Ministry of Justice offers only limited and sporadic training on these matters. 
</p>
<p>In order to ensure effective enjoyment of the right to access to justice, changes must be 
</p>
<p>made to all aspects of the legal system.

<p><b> III. Participation of women in the family and in cultural, 
economic, social, political and public life  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation of women in the family and in cultural life 
</b></p>
<p>37. Discrimination against women in the family and in cultural life persists in Chile 
</p>
<p>because of several factors, and in particular because of a national character that is 
</p>
<p>dominated by patriarchal social attitudes, inequalities in the formal rights of women and 
</p>
<p>men and a paucity of effective legal mechanisms to defend women&#8217;s rights. The Chilean 
</p>
<p>population&#8217;s cultural representations of men and women have evolved positively in many 
</p>
<p>regards; however, traditional concepts still carry significant weight among large segments 
</p>
<p>of the population. In Chilean society, the idea persists that men are primarily responsible 
</p>
<p>for providing economic resources through work and for exercising power, while women are 
</p>
<p>responsible for domestic tasks, raising children and caring for others. According to one 
</p>
<p>study, 62 per cent of Chileans would not agree with full equality between the sexes. 
</p>
<p>Conservatism and machismo remain prevalent in Chilean society.19 
</p>
<p>38. These patriarchal attitudes in Chile also contribute to the perpetuation of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, as well as other forms of violence committed outside the home. Efforts should be 
</p>
<p>made to dispel the myths surrounding the family, particularly the idea that it represents the 
</p>
<p>safest and most secure space for women. The statistics demonstrate that, on the contrary, 
</p>
<p>the family is a setting where they are continually exposed to the risk of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence (see para. 82 below). 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group was informed that, as highlighted in 2009 by the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), failure to make alimony payments is 
</p>
<p>common, despite the existence of a clear legal framework in that regard (Act No. 20152 of 
</p>
<p>2007), a situation that indirectly disadvantages women. Approximately 25,000 fathers are 
</p>
<p>sued each year for failing to pay alimony, and 98 per cent of separated Chilean mothers 
</p>
<p>must turn to the courts to receive alimony payments from their ex-partners, creating high 
</p>
<p>levels of social injustice for children, and also indirectly for mothers, who must provide for 
</p>
<p>their children alone.20 The Working Group urges the adoption of the bill establishing an 
</p>
<p>effective mechanism for the payment of alimony through court-ordered withholding of the 
</p>
<p>funds by employers. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group was informed that many communications media convey and 
</p>
<p>perpetuate gender stereotypes and often hinder genuine debate aiming to advance women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and gender equality. While some media are spearheading the creation of egalitarian 
</p>
<p>identities that are tolerant of differences, others are reinforcing and generalizing the 
</p>
<p>representation of women as erotic objects or as housewives and using them to promote 
</p>
<p>consumption, perpetuating the most patriarchal representations of gender. 
</p>
<p>41. Studies indicate that the presence of women in the news varies according to subject 
</p>
<p>matter, but, in general, women represent 29 per cent of the focus of news items, and men 71 
</p>
<p>per cent. However, it appears that the current President&#8217;s first term of office marked a 
</p>
<p>significant change in the media, making women more visible in the public sphere. Despite 
</p>
<p>this new link between women and public leadership, some studies have revealed that the 
</p>
<p>media sometimes trivialize the political activity of female ministers, accompanying

<p>information on their activities with comments on their private lives and on their physical 
</p>
<p>appearance.21 
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group notes with concern the link between the inequality of women in 
</p>
<p>the family and their limited participation in political and economic life, owing to 
</p>
<p>stereotypical perceptions of their social role as women and also presumably as wives, 
</p>
<p>mothers, daughters and carers, for example. Socially, women are expected to take primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility for bringing up their children, thus limiting their opportunities for 
</p>
<p>professional development. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation in economic and social life 
</b></p>
<p>43. There is a substantial level of inequality between men and women in the division of 
</p>
<p>labour. In 2014, 48.3 per cent of women were participating in the workforce, as compared 
</p>
<p>with 72 per cent for men. Despite the steady increase in recent years (from 31.7 per cent in 
</p>
<p>199022), the Working Group is concerned at the low percentage of women in the labour 
</p>
<p>market in comparison with the average for Latin America (52.8 per cent23) and in other 
</p>
<p>countries of the OECD (63.8 per cent).24 In addition, rates of unemployment for women 
</p>
<p>remain higher than for men (6.5 per cent as compared with 5.1 per cent).25 
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group welcomes the efforts of the Government to promote the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of women in the labour market by, among other measures, creating and 
</p>
<p>encouraging the use of free nurseries and preschool services for the most 
</p>
<p>socioeconomically vulnerable families. This important measure allows mothers, who 
</p>
<p>usually bear the main burden of care, to participate in the labour market and generate an 
</p>
<p>income. The Working Group encourages such initiatives and hopes that they will be 
</p>
<p>expanded to include middle-class women. 
</p>
<p>45. The Working Group was disappointed to note the significant wage gap that exists 
</p>
<p>between men and women who are carrying out the same work, which can be as much as 50 
</p>
<p>per cent in certain sectors26 and is more accentuated in positions of greater responsibility. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group also noted the high level of education attained by women, which is 
</p>
<p>sometimes greater than that of men but does not usually translate into positions of greater 
</p>
<p>responsibility and higher salary. In mid-2011, the Pensions Authority reported that the 
</p>
<p>wage gap had increased by 17 per cent. A study by the Labour Directorate undertaken a 
</p>
<p>year after the relevant legislation had been adopted revealed low levels of fulfilment of 
</p>
<p>employers&#8217; legal obligations and scant promotion and training on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>law. As a consequence, the law is little known and the trade unions consulted did not know 
</p>
<p>how to assert their rights. 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group notes that there seems to be no specific and systematic 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to equal opportunities in employment. The Anti-Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Act also regulates the prevention of discrimination at work. However, the equal pay 
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the law has not led to the elimination of the wage gap. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>application of the law would appear to be insufficient owing to limited numbers of labour

<p>inspectors and lack of effective remedies from the courts. According to one survey,27 74 per 
</p>
<p>cent of Chilean society feels that defending their labour rights could cost them their jobs. 
</p>
<p>47. The limited participation of women in the workforce and their lower salaries lead to 
</p>
<p>higher poverty rates among women in old age, despite the positive initiatives introduced by 
</p>
<p>the Government (non-contributory pensions which were brought in as part of social security 
</p>
<p>reforms in 2008).  
</p>
<p>48. Women hold only 5 per cent of high-level management positions in the principal 
</p>
<p>Chilean companies. 28  According to information provided by the Government, the 
</p>
<p>appointment of women to the boards of directors of public companies has increased by 24 
</p>
<p>per cent since 2014, and the goal is to reach 40 per cent by the end of the presidential 
</p>
<p>mandate in 2018. 
</p>
<p>49. Despite reforms aimed at encouraging shared responsibility, continued cultural 
</p>
<p>resistance in Chilean society in these areas means that the percentage of men willing to take 
</p>
<p>on care-giving functions as provided under the reforms is minimal. Moreover, the legal 
</p>
<p>provisions giving benefits to fathers who participate in the upbringing and care of their 
</p>
<p>children generally apply only if the mother is absent.29 
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group found that the country has made significant progress in access 
</p>
<p>to basic and secondary education, achieving similar coverage for both sexes. The enrolment 
</p>
<p>of women in higher education has increased, but choices of career or profession seem to 
</p>
<p>reflect assigned female gender roles. Greater efforts will have to be made in order to 
</p>
<p>increase the percentage of Chileans of both sexes in higher education and to revise the 
</p>
<p>educational curriculum in order to achieve gender equality. Seventy-two per cent of 
</p>
<p>Chileans believe that a quality education is available only to those able to pay.30 
</p>
<p>51. The Working Group was able to witness the phenomenon of social and economic 
</p>
<p>exclusion on its visits to Arica and the shanty towns of Vi&#241;a del Mar. Despite efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure social protection, including targeted social benefits and welfare mechanisms, the 
</p>
<p>system remains inadequate. This has a disproportionate impact on single mothers (who 
</p>
<p>represent around 40 per cent of households), women who work in the informal sector and 
</p>
<p>unemployed women. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group was deeply impressed by the resilience shown by women from 
</p>
<p>significantly disadvantaged groups, who have formed associations in order to undertake 
</p>
<p>activities in such areas as construction, recycling, handicrafts, marketing, education and 
</p>
<p>training on matters concerning the empowerment of women. It noted that certain women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>associations have been unable to obtain State financing or bank loans for their activities 
</p>
<p>owing to restrictions concerning individual annual income or starting capital requirements. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group was informed of innovative proposals to give women greater access to 
</p>
<p>financing, and it is hoped that appropriate frameworks will be developed to support 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s economic and social initiatives.

</p>
<p>More than half a century after women won the right to vote, Chile has made a leap forwards 
</p>
<p>in terms of the presence of women in the highest echelons of power.  
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group was pleased to note the Government&#8217;s efforts to increase the 
</p>
<p>number of women in the executive. The cabinet is made up of 9 female ministers, 14 male 
</p>
<p>ministers, 10 female undersecretaries and 22 male undersecretaries, meaning that 39 per 
</p>
<p>cent of ministers and 31 per cent of undersecretaries are women. Moreover, around 20 per 
</p>
<p>cent of intendants and 40 per cent of governors in Chile are women.31 Representation is 
</p>
<p>lower at the level of local government, where only 12.5 per cent of mayors are women. 
</p>
<p>Among the largest hindrances to the participation of women are the political parties, which 
</p>
<p>remain unwilling to embrace gender equality in political representation by introducing it 
</p>
<p>into their internal culture, working practices and system of incentives.32 
</p>
<p>55. Notwithstanding efforts to increase the representation of women in the executive, 
</p>
<p>they remain seriously underrepresented in other areas of power, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>legislature. Although for the first time in the history of Chile the President of the Senate is a 
</p>
<p>woman, the proportion of women in parliament stands at 15.8 per cent for the Chamber of 
</p>
<p>Deputies and 18.4 per cent for the Senate, which is far below the regional average (24.5 per 
</p>
<p>cent in 2014). According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Chile is number 94 on a list of 
</p>
<p>188 countries classified according to the proportion of women in parliament.33  
</p>
<p>56. The 60 per cent/40 per cent gender quota for candidates to parliament is a much-
</p>
<p>needed measure. Chile is one of two countries in Latin America not to have such a measure 
</p>
<p>in place for elections to the legislature. The binominal electoral system has hindered 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s chances of being chosen as candidates in such elections, as have the policies 
</p>
<p>followed by the traditional parties and the lack of affirmative action plans at the national 
</p>
<p>level to encourage the participation of women. 
</p>
<p>57. According to information obtained during the visit, the representation of women in 
</p>
<p>the judiciary is higher than in other areas of power. However, women are concentrated in 
</p>
<p>the lower courts. Fewer women are appointed to the courts of appeal. Of the 20 members of 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, only five are women34 (in 1995 there were no women on the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court, in 2005 there was one and in 2009 five). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Working Group was pleased to note the efforts made to ensure basic health 
</p>
<p>services, particularly preventive medical examinations. 35  In Chile, breast cancer and 
</p>
<p>cervical cancer are covered under the System of Explicit Health Guarantees. Nonetheless, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group was informed on a number of occasions that many women who lacked 
</p>
<p>the resources necessary to obtain paid medical attention were unable to access free 
</p>
<p>preventive examinations when they needed them. Various women in vulnerable 
</p>
<p>circumstances complained that they had to wait for months before seeing a doctor for 
</p>
<p>diagnosis or other health care and that sometimes they were unable to see a specialist for 
</p>
<p>health problems requiring specialized care. These shortcomings in the health-care system 
</p>
<p>were cited repeatedly as a major problem during the visit of the Working Group. Several of 
</p>
<p>the people with whom the Working Group spoke highlighted the lack of specialists in the

</b></p>
<p>public sector. According to one survey, 77 per cent of Chileans believe that obtaining 
</p>
<p>quality health care depends on how much they are able to pay.36 
</p>
<p><i>  Sexual and reproductive health rights 
</i></p>
<p>59. Although Act No. 20418 37  guarantees access to contraceptives of all kinds, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group was informed that, in practice, difficulties exist regarding unequal access to 
</p>
<p>contraceptives and non-availability of emergency contraception in many municipalities, 
</p>
<p>with the staff members concerned claiming a lack of stocks or moral reluctance. Many 
</p>
<p>women find themselves obliged to consult a doctor in order to obtain a prescription, and the 
</p>
<p>additional costs can represent a major obstacle. According to the information provided by 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Health, the emergency contraceptive pill should be available at all health-
</p>
<p>care centres throughout the country to whomever asks for it, and it should be dispensed by 
</p>
<p>midwives without consultation or prescription from a physician.38 When the request is made 
</p>
<p>by a girl under the age of 14, her parents or guardian should be informed subsequently. The 
</p>
<p>Act has no implementing regulations, however, and the various government agencies use a 
</p>
<p>considerable degree of discretion in applying its provisions as regards free distribution. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group was alarmed by the high rates of teenage pregnancies and by the fact that 
</p>
<p>the age of sexual consent is 14.39 According to information from the Ministry of Health for 
</p>
<p>2012, 14.42 per cent of children were born to adolescent mothers.40 During its interviews 
</p>
<p>with groups of mothers, the Working Group was able to note that teenage pregnancies 
</p>
<p>occur among girls belonging to the most socioeconomically vulnerable sectors of society, 
</p>
<p>for whom being a mother is the most important, and perhaps the only, aspiration for their 
</p>
<p>lives, identity and status, given the lack of opportunity to pursue their personal development 
</p>
<p>in other areas.41 
</p>
<p>60. Sex education and access to contraceptives are key to addressing this situation. 
</p>
<p>Under the law, everyone has the right to receive education, information and guidance on 
</p>
<p>fertility planning. Educational establishments must include a sex education programme as 
</p>
<p>part of the middle school curriculum, in a manner consistent with the beliefs of each 
</p>
<p>establishment and in collaboration with parents. The Working Group finds it regrettable 
</p>
<p>that sex education in schools is constrained by certain values and is not founded in the 
</p>
<p>universal values of human rights, which would contribute to the eradication of 
</p>
<p>discriminatory gender stereotypes and to the empowerment of women. As has already been 
</p>
<p>indicated by United Nations special rapporteurs 42  and the human rights treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>religious freedom cannot be used to justify discrimination against women and, therefore, 
</p>
<p>cannot be considered as a justifiable reason not to provide education on women&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p>equality. 
</p>
<p>61. As the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted, teenage pregnancy is 
</p>
<p>extremely dangerous for women. In Latin America, the danger of maternal death is four 
</p>
<p>times greater among adolescents under the age of 16. Sixty-five per cent of women with 
</p>
<p>obstetric fistula develop the condition during adolescence, with serious consequences for 
</p>
<p>their lives, both physically and socially. Teenage pregnancies are also dangerous for babies, 
</p>
<p>with mortality rates being 50 per cent higher among children born to adolescent mothers. 
</p>
<p>Such pregnancies also have a negative impact on the socioeconomic development of

</p>
<p>communities.43 In Chile, although the law44 prohibits the expulsion of pregnant schoolgirls, 
</p>
<p>pregnant teenagers drop out of secondary education, thereby seriously compromising their 
</p>
<p>future opportunities.  
</p>
<p>62. As stated earlier (para. 21 above), the Working Group finds it regrettable that 
</p>
<p>abortion is criminalized under all circumstances in Chile. According to the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Health, in 2011 there were 30,860 hospital discharges for abortion (spontaneous and/or 
</p>
<p>induced). Other sources estimate the annual number of induced abortions to be between 
</p>
<p>70,00045 and 109,200,46 with serious risks for the health and life of women. According to 
</p>
<p>one survey,47 87.4 per cent of Chileans would be in favour of amending the abortion law. 
</p>
<p>As has been highlighted in a study,48 the criminalization of abortion in all circumstances 
</p>
<p>represents a violation of the human rights of women because it violates the obligation to 
</p>
<p>guarantee and protect their autonomy, equality, personal security and integrity, life, their 
</p>
<p>right not to suffer cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and their privacy and health. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Women who face multiple forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous women 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group observed that Chile has few statistics that accurately reflect the 
</p>
<p>realities of indigenous women because most of the data disaggregated by sex are not also 
</p>
<p>disaggregated by ethnic origin and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to poverty, although indicators over the past two decades have shown a 
</p>
<p>general improvement of socioeconomic conditions among the indigenous population, major 
</p>
<p>gaps in levels of poverty and extreme poverty persist. Public policies have made it possible 
</p>
<p>to carry out sectoral actions that have proved beneficial to aboriginal peoples, but they have 
</p>
<p>not been sufficient to overcome the profound inequalities affecting the indigenous 
</p>
<p>population.49 
</p>
<p>65. With regard to Mapuche women, one parameter that illustrates their increased 
</p>
<p>vulnerability, resulting from the structural poverty in which they live, is the rise in the 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality ratio (18.3 per 100,000 live births versus 37.4 in 2010) in the Araucan&#237;a 
</p>
<p>region, which is home to half of the country&#8217;s Mapuche population. This is an indicator of 
</p>
<p>inequality in access to information and to timely, high-quality and culturally relevant health 
</p>
<p>services, an inequality which is rooted in gender, ethnicity, social class and residence in 
</p>
<p>rural areas.50 According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 
</p>
<p>mortality rates among Mapuche women are 30 per cent higher than the average.51 With 
</p>
<p>regard to gaps in education, although the State has no statistics on the subject, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concern 
</p>
<p>about higher rates of illiteracy among Mapuche women.

</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group expresses its particular concern about the high degree of social 
</p>
<p>exclusion among indigenous women, who report feeling a sense of invisibility and of a 
</p>
<p>complete inability to advance their human rights as individuals and members of their 
</p>
<p>community. Several of those interviewed confirmed that there are insufficient programmes 
</p>
<p>and policies geared towards the most vulnerable groups of women. For example, neither 
</p>
<p>SERNAM nor the law establishing the new Ministry for Women and Gender Equality, 
</p>
<p>make provision for a unit or programme focusing on and/or prioritizing the needs of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>67. In Chile it is estimated that there are about 326,000 domestic workers, of whom 96 
</p>
<p>per cent are women. Live-in female domestic workers account for around 16 per cent.52 The 
</p>
<p>Working Group was disappointed to find during its visit that the Labour Code establishes a 
</p>
<p>differentiated statutory regime, with fewer labour rights and less protection, thus facilitating 
</p>
<p>abuse and heightening the vulnerability of these female workers, who include a significant 
</p>
<p>number of immigrants. For example, non-live-in workers can have contracts requiring them 
</p>
<p>to work up to 72 hours a week (as opposed to 45 hours for other workers), and the law 
</p>
<p>makes no provision for overtime, while for other workers overtime is paid at a rate 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent higher than the regular rate of pay.53 A number of the persons consulted agreed that 
</p>
<p>current migration policies facilitate abuse. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group welcomes the recent adoption of Act No. 20786, which, among 
</p>
<p>other advances, establishes a 45-hour working week for domestic workers.54 Several other 
</p>
<p>reforms have also sought to improve conditions for this category of workers: since 2011 
</p>
<p>they have received the minimum wage (until then they only had the right to 75 per cent) 
</p>
<p>and are entitled to time off on holidays and to maternity leave. In practice, however, some 
</p>
<p>of these modifications are not effectively applied, chiefly because of a lack of oversight. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group also finds it regrettable that, under the new law, regulations governing 
</p>
<p>working hours for live-in domestic workers are more lax. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Lesbian women 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Working Group also expresses its concern regarding allegations of violations of 
</p>
<p>the rights of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women in Chile, who are victims of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence in public and private life and for whom the State has not 
</p>
<p>developed an appropriate response. Between 2002 and 2013, 1,128 cases or complaints of 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity were recorded. Around 
</p>
<p>12 per cent of those cases involved lesbians and transgender persons. Although the number 
</p>
<p>of cases has declined, the abuses have unfortunately become more violent than in the past 
</p>
<p>and have led to deaths.55  
</p>
<p>70. During its visit, the Working Group expressed its concern about the case of Karen 
</p>
<p>Atala, a lesbian judge who in 2002 lost custody of her daughters when the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>ruled that, because of her sexual orientation, she could not be a good mother and that 
</p>
<p>custody should therefore be awarded to the father. In 2012, the Inter-American Court of

<p><b>18</b> GE.15-07947 
</p>
<p>Human Rights issued a contrary ruling, which stated that sexual orientation was not an 
</p>
<p>impediment to being a mother or father and ordered the Chilean State to make economic 
</p>
<p>redress to the affected party. The Working Group encourages Chile to implement the ruling, 
</p>
<p>to accord recognition to families of all types and to support legal initiatives that would 
</p>
<p>allow civil unions to be recognized. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Women with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>71. Under legislation establishing norms on equality of opportunity and social inclusion 
</p>
<p>for persons with disabilities56 the State must adopt the measures necessary to ensure that 
</p>
<p>women with physical or mental disabilities are able fully to enjoy and exercise their rights 
</p>
<p>on an equal footing with others, especially as regards their dignity, right to form and be part 
</p>
<p>of a family, sexuality and reproductive health. 
</p>
<p>72. Nevertheless, several of the people consulted stressed that the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities are still not fully respected, especially with regard to access to health, education, 
</p>
<p>work and the full enjoyment of civil and political rights. The Working Group also expresses 
</p>
<p>its concern at the lack of official statistics enabling the specific needs of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities to be assessed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Incarcerated women 
</b></p>
<p>73. During its visit, the Working Group visited the Arica Women&#8217;s Penitentiary which 
</p>
<p>has separate spaces for pre- and post-natal care and treatment, as well as facilities for 
</p>
<p>breast-feeding infants. The Working Group found that a large proportion of the prisoners 
</p>
<p>were female migrants convicted for drug trafficking offences. According to information 
</p>
<p>received, a large proportion of these imprisoned women do not receive sufficient assistance 
</p>
<p>from the consular services of their own countries or from the Chilean State to enable them 
</p>
<p>to have adequate access to the Chilean justice system. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group, like the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 57 
</p>
<p>encourages avoidance of intensive recourse to imprisonment for women, particularly 
</p>
<p>pregnant women or women with young children, and suggests favouring the use of non-
</p>
<p>custodial methods and electronic monitoring. Since women are increasingly becoming the 
</p>
<p>breadwinners of their households, their separation from their families has even more serious 
</p>
<p>repercussions. The Working Group welcomes the bill aimed at commuting the sentences of 
</p>
<p>a number of incarcerated women.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Women victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p>75. During the last 20 years a number of programmes and measures, both legislative and 
</p>
<p>judicial, have been developed to address the problem of violence against women in the 
</p>
<p>home. Despite this, however, violence against women in Chile has remained prevalent in 
</p>
<p>recent years.58 One in three women reports having been a victim of some kind of violence at 
</p>
<p>the hands of a partner or ex-partner, although complaints are lodged in only about 30 per 
</p>
<p>cent of cases.59 Many of the persons interviewed also decried the leniency of the sentences 
</p>
<p>imposed for such offences. The low numbers of complaints and widespread impunity

</b></p>
<p>hinder an effective response to this issue on the part of the State (see paras. 36 and 38 
</p>
<p>above). 
</p>
<p>76. Female human rights defenders (including Mapuche women) have reportedly been 
</p>
<p>subjected to violence and sexual harassment by the Carabineros (police) during social 
</p>
<p>protests, which is an additional cause for concern. A culture of impunity surrounds these 
</p>
<p>offences owing to a failure to indict, transfer of jurisdiction to military tribunals and a lack 
</p>
<p>of transparency. The Working Group echoes the concerns expressed by various persons 
</p>
<p>consulted regarding the importance of keeping those cases in the civilian courts.  
</p>
<p>77. Violence against women is part of a cultural pattern with very deep roots in Chilean 
</p>
<p>society. Its eradication will require prevention and attention by public services as well as 
</p>
<p>the punishment of offenders. These elements, which should be part of a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>policy to address the problem, are currently separate. The official response has focused on 
</p>
<p>the judicial dimension, which has revealed itself to be insufficient to ensure the 
</p>
<p>comprehensive protection that the State is required to provide. There needs to be a 
</p>
<p>concerted and sustained response on the part of public institutions in developing prevention 
</p>
<p>measures, which must include ongoing campaigns and a rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Working Group was informed of the existence of the &#8220;Living Human 
</p>
<p>Treasures&#8221; heritage programme, which has contributed to the recognition and protection of 
</p>
<p>the role of women in aboriginal communities. Women are the repositories of memories of 
</p>
<p>knowledge and events connected with domestic life, a function which is accorded scant 
</p>
<p>recognition, value or prestige. The programme has helped to secure recognition for various 
</p>
<p>cultural manifestations, including a woman representing the Mapuche culture who has been 
</p>
<p>recognized for her work as an <i>epew</i> (storyteller) within the community and who speaks the 
</p>
<p>Mapuche language and has a great capacity for transmitting knowledge; ceramics and the 
</p>
<p>world view of the Aymara people; Aymara textiles; and a workshop on plant fibres of Rapa 
</p>
<p>Nui. Various initiatives have been launched in collaboration with other public institutions to 
</p>
<p>highlight the role of women in the country&#8217;s traditional and artistic culture. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Chile currently has a window of opportunity. It has the political will to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eliminate discrimination and the economic potential to make a transformative change 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the lives of women, moving from a patriarchal and conservative society to one in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which women have equal political, economic and social rights and opportunities. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of the programme of legislative reform proposed by the Government is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential precondition for achieving such a change. Moreover, this change should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoted not only through legislation, but also through the education system, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications media and social networks. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Chile has made significant progress towards gender equality. Despite this, 
</b></p>
<p><b>however, there is still a large gap between the principles of equality and the actual 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of women. There are hard cores of resistance to change in relations between the 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexes in the country. Schools have enormous potential as forums for change and for 
</b></p>
<p><b>fostering progress towards more equal gender relations. There does not seem to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>consensus among all State and political actors regarding the changes that need to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>made in gender relations. A cultural shift must take place through the adoption and </b></p>
