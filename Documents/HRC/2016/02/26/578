<p><b>  28/1. Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (<i>g</i>) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p>in which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the 
</p>
<p>staff of the Office of the High Commissioner,1  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>management review of the Office of the High Commissioner2 and on the funding and 
</p>
<p>staffing of the Office,3 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
</p>
<p>culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> <i>its concern</i> that, in spite of stated efforts by the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, the situation whereby one region accounts for 49<b> </b>per cent remains, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/27/18. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>

<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
</p>
<p>regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p>most notably in senior management positions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that the dependence of the Office of the High Commissioner on 
</p>
<p>extrabudgetary resources is at the heart of the imbalance in the composition of its staff,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
</p>
<p>the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
</p>
<p>account Article 101, paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
</p>
<p>conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution, 
</p>

</p>
<p>General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>serious concern</i> at the fact that, despite the measures reported by 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
</p>
<p>the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
</p>
<p>single region occupies almost half of the posts in the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes with concern </i>the fact that, in 2013, three regions decreased their 
</p>
<p>representation in the percentage of staff and that an increase was recorded in the 
</p>
<p>overrepresentation status of one region; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in his report1 that 
</p>
<p>enhancing the geographical diversity of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>remains one of his priorities, and requests him to redouble his efforts with a view to 
</p>
<p>redressing the current imbalance in the geographical composition of the staff of the Office, 
</p>
<p>despite the budgetary contingency; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner in this regard to establish specific and 
</p>
<p>public targets and deadlines to be achieved; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographical 
</p>
<p>diversity of his staff by strengthening the measures aimed at achieving a better 
</p>
<p>representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
</p>
<p>particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a cap on the 
</p>
<p>representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further</i> <i>requests</i> the High Commissioner to implement further measures to 
</p>
<p>eliminate the current imbalance in the geographical composition of the staff of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner, in particular in the number of posts not subject to geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution; 
</p>
<p>7.<i>  Takes note<b> </b>with appreciation<b> </b></i>of the commitment of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>to remain attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible 
</p>
<p>geographic diversity of the Office of the High Commissioner, as stated in the conclusion of 
</p>
<p>his report; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
</p>
<p>the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
</p>
<p>issue; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Recognizes </i>that, as at 31 December 2013, women accounted for 54.6 per cent 
</p>
<p>of all staff at the Professional and higher level at the Office of the High Commissioner; </p>


<p> 10. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
</p>
<p>recruitment and promotion at the Professional level and in particular in senior management 
</p>
<p>positions as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Reaffirms</i> the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
</p>
<p>national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds 
</p>
<p>and of different political, economic and legal systems to the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>the universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3 of General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution of staff in each and every department; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Underlines</i> the priority importance that the General Assembly continue to 
</p>
<p>provide support and guidance to the High Commissioner in the ongoing process of 
</p>
<p>improving the geographical balance in the composition of the staff of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to continue to improve his interaction with 
</p>
<p>Member States, including within the framework of President&#8217;s statements PRST/15/2 of 1 
</p>
<p>October 2010, PRST/18/2 of 30 September 2011 and PRST/19/1 of 22 March 2012, and 
</p>
<p>giving particular attention to the composition of the staff;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the 
</p>
