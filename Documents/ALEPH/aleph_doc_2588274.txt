<P align=center><B>____________________ Units consisting of<BR>One Common Share
and<BR>One warrant to purchase one Common Share </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are offering 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;common shares, no
par value, and warrants to purchase up to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;common shares issuable from time
to
time upon the exercise of the warrants. We are offering the common shares and
warrants in units, each unit consisting of one common share together with one
warrant, each warrant exercisable at a price of
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for one common
share. Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share,
subject to adjustment, at any time, prior to the earlier of (a) the close of
business on December 31, 2015 or (b) (i) with respect to half the common shares
exercisable pursuant to the warrants, if at any time on or before December 1,
2014, the volume weighted average trading price per Common Share during any five
consecutive trading day period on the NYSE MKT averages at least
US$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per Common Share
and we elect to accelerate half the warrant pursuant to the terms thereof (the
date of expiration pursuant to such terms, the &#147;Partial Termination 
Date&#148;) and
(ii) with respect to balance of the common shares exercisable pursuant to the
warrants, if at any time on or before December 1, 2014 and 10 days after the
Partial Termination Date, the volume weighted average trading price per Common
Share during any five consecutive trading day period on the NYSE MKT averages at
least US$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per Common
Share and we elect to accelerate half the warrant pursuant to the terms
thereof.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units will be sold at a
negotiated price of
$0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per unit. Units
will not be issued or certificated. The common shares and warrants are
immediately separable and will be issued separately. We do not expect that the
warrants will be listed for trading on any securities exchange. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our common shares are traded on
the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex), in both
cases under the symbol &#147;DEJ.&#148;
On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2014, the last
reported sale price of our common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange was
Cdn$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per common share
and on the NYSE MKT was
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per common share.
<B>There is no market through which the warrants may be sold and purchasers may
not be able to resell the warrants. This may affect the pricing of the warrants
in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices,
and the liquidity of the warrants. </B>The aggregate market value of our
outstanding voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates
on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2014, was
approximately
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million. We have
not issued any securities pursuant to Instruction I.B.5 of Form F-3 during the
12 calendar month period that ends on and includes the date of this prospectus
supplement. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Investing in our securities
involves a high degree of risk. See the sections entitled &#147;Risk 
Factors&#148;

&nbsp;On
January 1, 2011, we adopted International Financial Reporting Standards 
(&#147;IFRS&#148;)
for financial reporting purposes, using a transition date of January 1, 2010.
Our annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2013, including 2012 and 2011 required comparative information, have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee. Our financial statements prior to the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2010 were prepared in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles then in effect (&#147;Canadian GAAP&#148;). IFRS 
and
Canadian GAAP differ from United States generally accepted accounting principles
in certain respects, and therefore our financial statements may
not be comparable to the financial statements of United States companies. </P>

<P align=center><B>ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities
under U.S. federal securities laws may be affected adversely by the fact that we
are incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada,
that many of our officers and directors are residents of countries other than
the United States, that some of the experts named in this prospectus supplement
and the accompanying prospectus are residents of a countries other than the
United States, and some of our assets and the assets of said persons may be
located outside the United States. There is some doubt as to the enforceability
in Canada in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of
United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated upon the United States
federal securities laws. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions
brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Canada. See
&#147;Risk Factors &#150; <I>It may be difficult to enforce judgments or bring 
actions
outside the United States against us and certain of our directors and
officers.</I>&#148; </P>

&nbsp;Dejour
Energy Inc. was incorporated as &#147;Dejour Mines Limited&#148; on March 29, 
1968, under
the laws of the Province of Ontario. By articles of amendment dated October 30,
2001, our issued shares were consolidated on the basis of one new share for
every 15 old shares, and the name of the company was changed to Dejour
Enterprises Ltd. On June 6, 2003, our shareholders approved a resolution to
complete a one-for-three-share consolidation, which became effective on October
1, 2003. Dejour was continued in British Columbia under the <I>Business
Corporations Act (British Columbia) </I>in 2005. On March 9, 2011, Dejour
changed its name to Dejour Energy Inc. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Our
authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, preferred
shares and series 1 preferred shares. There are no indentures or agreements
limiting the payment of dividends and there are no conversion rights, special
liquidation rights, pre-emptive rights or subscription rights attaching to our
common shares. </P>

align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;We
are in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing energy projects with
a focus on oil and gas exploration in Canada and the United States. We hold
approximately 62,400 net acres of oil and gas leases in the following regions:
</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>the Peace River Arch of northwestern British Columbia and northeastern
  Alberta, Canada; and </P>
  <LI>
  <P>the Piceance, Paradox and Uinta Basins in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
  </P></LI></UL>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Over
the past three years, we have evolved our forward focus from acquiring resource
potential toward conversion of resources into reserves. This process involved
several distinct steps on the same continuum including: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>classification and prioritization of acreage based on economic promise,
  technical robustness, infrastructural and logistic advantage and commercial
  maturity; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>evaluation and development planning for top tier acreage positions; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>developing partnerships within financial and industry circles to speed the
  exploitation process; and </P>
  <LI>
  <P>aggressively bringing production on line where feasible. </P></LI></UL>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;As
a result of these moves, our asset characterization has moved toward more
tangible low-risk near-term development projects, moderate risk appraisal
opportunities and moderate- to high-risk exploration potential. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Our
business objective is to grow our oil and gas production and generate sufficient
cash flow to continue to expand our operations and enhance shareholder value.

&nbsp;In
March 2014, we completed the purchase of certain natural gas producing assets
and related processing facilities adjacent to our existing oilfield in Woodrush
Field, Northern British Columbia (the &#147;Drake/Woodrush Oilfield&#148;). This
acquisition of assets at Ft. St. John, British Columbia, resulting in the
acquisition of an additional 9,600 net acres (44% developed). The assets
acquired included a 54% working interest in a Halfway formation well, a 74%
working interest in 2 shut-in natural gas wells, and a 96.8% working interest in
a sour processing facility. Funding for the purchase was provided by cash on
hand and available credit from the current credit facility of Dejour Energy
(Alberta) Ltd. (&#147;DEAL&#148;) with its Canadian bank. The properties so 
acquired have
a fair value of Cdn$2,146,000, applying a 10% discount factor to expected
future net cash flows. We also assumed related decommissioning liabilities of
$1,520,000, applying a weighted average discount rate of 2.04% and an inflation
rate of 2%. The total cash consideration paid is $626,000. </P>

&nbsp;On
June 30, 2014, we closed the sale of 65% of our working interest in the initial
four wells drilled in 2013 at our Kokopelli project in Colorado, together with
certain related production facilities, for Cdn$4,136,000 (US$3,876,000) cash and
a 25% carried working interest in a US$16.0 million drilling and completion
program planned for 2014 to be funded 100% by the purchaser of the assets. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;On
July 3, 2014, we closed the acquisition of an additional 24% working interest in
the Drake/Woodrush Oilfield to increase our working interest to 99%. As
consideration for the purchase, we issued 9,600,000 common shares at a price of
Cdn$0.202 per share for a deemed value of Cdn$1,939,000. A company controlled by
our CEO has a 5% working interest in the Drake/Woodrush Oilfield and the CEO
abstained from voting when our board of directors approved the acquisition. On
July 14, 2014, we obtained the regulatory approval for the acquisition and the
issuance of the shares from the TSX. </P>

&nbsp;An
investment in a company engaged in oil and gas exploration involves an unusually
high amount of risk, both unknown and known, present and potential, including,
but not limited to the risks enumerated below. An investment in our units,
common shares and warrants is highly speculative and subject to a number of
known and unknown risks. Only those persons who can bear the risk of the entire
loss of their investment should purchase our securities. An investor should
carefully consider the risks described below, together with the risks described
in the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into
this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before investing in
our units, common shares or warrants. The risks described below are not the only
ones we face. Additional risks that we are not currently aware of or that we
currently believe are immaterial may become important factors that affect our
business. The risk factors set forth below, in the accompanying prospectus and
the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus, may have a significant impact on our business,
financial condition and/or results of operations and could cause actual results
to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. See

&nbsp;Prices
for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor
changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty
and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Our
ability to market our oil and natural gas depends upon our ability to acquire
space on pipelines that deliver such commodities to commercial markets. We are
also affected by deliverability uncertainties related to the proximity of our
reserves to pipelines and processing and storage facilities and operational
problems affecting such pipelines and facilities, as well as extensive
governmental regulation relating to price, taxes, royalties, land tenure,
allowable production, the export of oil and natural gas and many other aspects
of the oil and natural gas business.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Both
oil and natural gas prices are unstable and are subject to fluctuation. Any
material decline in prices could result in a reduction of our net production
revenue. The economics of producing from some wells may change as a result of
lower prices, which could result in reduced production of oil or natural gas and
a reduction in the volumes and net present value of our reserves. We might also
elect not to produce from certain wells at lower prices. All of these factors
could result in a material decrease in our net production revenue and a
reduction in our oil and natural gas acquisition, development and exploration
activities.</P>

&nbsp;World
oil and natural gas prices are quoted in U.S. dollars, and the price received by
Canadian producers, including us, is therefore affected by the Canadian/U.S.
dollar exchange rate, which will fluctuate over time. In recent years, the
Canadian dollar has increased materially in value against the U.S. dollar, which
may negatively affect our production revenues. Further material increases in the
value of the Canadian dollar would exacerbate this potential negative effect and
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of

Canadian/U.S. exchange rates could also negatively affect the future value of
our reserves as determined by independent petroleum reserve engineers.</P>

&nbsp;Our
involvement in the oil and natural gas exploration, development and production
business subjects us to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with
those types of operations, including hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, 
sour gas releases and spills, each of
which could result in substantial damage to oil and natural gas wells,
production facilities, other property and the environment or personal injury. In
particular, we may explore for and produce sour natural gas in certain areas. An
unintentional leak of sour natural gas could result in personal injury, loss of
life or damage to property, and may necessitate an evacuation of populated
areas, all of which could result in liability to us. In accordance with industry
practice, we are not fully insured against all of these risks. Although we
maintain liability insurance in an amount that we consider consistent with
industry practice, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could
exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could
have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects. In addition, the risks we face are not, in all
circumstances, insurable and, in certain circumstances, we may elect not to
obtain insurance to deal with specific risks due to the high premiums associated
with such insurance or other reasons. For instance, we do not have insurance to
protect against the risk from terrorism. Oil and natural gas production
operations are also subject to all of the risks typically associated with those
operations, including encountering unexpected geologic formations or pressures,
premature decline of reservoirs and the invasion of water into producing
formations. Losses resulting from the occurrence of any of these risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.</P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
level of activity in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry is influenced by
seasonal weather patterns. Oil and natural gas development activities, including
seismic and drilling programs in northern Alberta and British Columbia, are
restricted to those months of the year when the ground is frozen. Wet weather
and spring thaw may make the ground unstable. Consequently, municipalities and
provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the
movement of rigs and other heavy equipment, thereby reducing activity levels. In
addition, certain oil and natural gas producing areas are located in areas that
are inaccessible other than during the winter months because the ground
surrounding the sites in these areas consists of swampy terrain, and additional
seasonal weather variations will also affect access to these areas. Seasonal
factors and unexpected weather patterns may lead to declines in exploration and
production activity during certain parts of the year.</P>

&nbsp;The
petroleum industry is competitive in all of its phases. We compete with numerous
other organizations in the search for, and the acquisition of, oil and natural
gas properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas. Our competitors
include oil and natural gas companies that have substantially greater financial
resources, staff and facilities than us. Our ability to increase our reserves in
the future will depend not only upon our ability to explore and develop our
present properties, but also upon our ability to select and acquire other
suitable producing properties or prospects for exploratory drilling. Competitive
factors in the distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas include price
and methods and reliability of delivery and storage.</P>

&nbsp;Other

we have a limited ability to exercise influence over the operation of those

<P

&nbsp;There
are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas
reserves and the future cash flows attributed to the reserves. Our reserve and
associated cash flow estimates are estimates only. In general, estimates of
economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and the associated future
net cash flows are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such
as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve
recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and
gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies
and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially from actual
results. All estimates are to some degree speculative, and classifications of
reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved. For
those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and natural gas
reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of
such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues
associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same
engineers at different times, may vary. Our actual production, revenues, taxes
and development and operating expenditures with respect to our reserves will
vary from our estimates of them, and those variations could be material.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Estimates
of proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often
based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves
rather than actual production history. Recovery factors and drainage areas are
estimated by experience and analogy to similar producing pools. Estimates based
on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual
production history. Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon
production history and production practices will result in variations in the
estimated reserves, and those variations could be material.</P>

<P

&nbsp;Future
oil and natural gas exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from
dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient
petroleum substances to return a profit after drilling, operating and other
costs. Completion of a well does not assure a profit on the investment or
recovery of drilling, completion and operating costs. In addition, drilling
hazards or environmental damage could greatly increase the cost of operations,
and various field operating conditions may adversely affect the production from
successful wells. These conditions include delays in obtaining governmental
approvals or consents, shut-ins of connected wells resulting from extreme
weather conditions, insufficient storage or transportation capacity or other
geological and mechanical conditions. While diligent well supervision and
effective maintenance operations can contribute to maximizing production rates
over time, production delays and declines from normal field operating conditions
cannot be eliminated and can be expected to adversely affect revenue and cash
flow levels to varying degrees.</P>

&nbsp;Our

with industry participants and government officials and on our ability to select
and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly

intervene with respect to price, taxes, royalties and the exportation of oil and
natural gas. Regulations may be changed from time to time in response to
economic or political conditions. The implementation of new regulations or the
modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry
could reduce demand for crude oil and natural gas and increase our costs, any of
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. In addition, in order to conduct oil and

&nbsp;All
phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and
hazards and are subject to environmental regulation under a variety of federal,
provincial, state and local laws and regulations. Environmental legislation
provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills,
releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and
natural gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility
sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of
applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with legislation can require
significant expenditures, and a breach of applicable environmental legislation
may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which may be
material. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result
in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and
potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The
discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water
may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require us
to incur costs to remedy any discharge. Environmental laws may result in a
curtailment of production or a material increase in the costs of production,
development or exploration activities, or otherwise adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Legal,
accounting and other expenses associated with public company reporting
requirements have increased significantly in the past few years. We anticipate
that general and administrative costs associated with regulatory compliance will
continue to increase with on-going compliance requirements under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as any new rules implemented by the SEC,
Canadian Securities Administrators, the NYSE MKT and the Toronto Stock Exchange
in the future. These rules and regulations have significantly increased our
legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more
time-consuming and costly. We cannot assure you that we will continue to
effectively meet all of the requirements of these regulations, including Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and National Instrument 52-109 of the Canadian
Securities Administrators. Any failure to effectively implement internal
controls, or to resolve difficulties encountered in their implementation, could
harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, or
result in our principal executive officer and principal financial officer being
required to give a qualified assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting. Any such result could cause investors to lose confidence in our
reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on
the trading price of our common shares and our ability to raise capital. These
rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to
obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to
accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to
obtain the same or similar coverage in the future. As a result, it may be more
difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our

from Sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(c), 14(f) and 16 of the Exchange Act, pursuant to
Rule 3a12-3 of the Exchange Act. Therefore, we are not required to file a
Schedule 14A proxy statement in relation to our annual meetings of shareholders.
The submission of proxy and annual meeting of shareholder information on Form
6-K may result in shareholders having less complete and timely information in
connection with shareholder actions. The exemption from Section 16 rules
regarding reports of beneficial ownership and purchases and sales of common

enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. based on the civil liability provisions
of the U.S. federal securities laws against us or our officers and directors. In
addition, a shareholder should not assume that the courts of Canada (i) would
enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our officers
or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws or other laws of the United States, or (ii) would enforce, in

calculation, we will allocate $ of the purchase price for the unit to the common
share and $ of the purchase price for each unit to each of one warrant and
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants have not been included. See

<P align=center><B>DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Each
warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share, subject to
adjustment, at any time, prior to the earlier of (a) the close of business on
December 31, 2015 or (b) (i) with respect to half the common shares exercisable
pursuant to the warrants, if at any time on or before December 1, 2014, the
volume weighted average trading price per Common Share during any five
consecutive trading day period on the NYSE MKT averages at least 
US$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per Common
Share and we elect to accelerate half the warrant pursuant to the terms thereof
(the date of expiration pursuant to such terms, the &#147;Partial Termination
Date&#148;) and (ii) with respect to balance of the common shares exercisable
pursuant to the warrants, if at any time on or before December 1, 2014 and 10
days after the Partial Termination Date, the volume weighted average trading
price per Common Share during any five consecutive trading day period on the
NYSE MKT averages at least US$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per Common Share 
and we elect to accelerate half
the warrant pursuant to the terms thereof. The warrants will be freely
transferable, subject to Canadian securities laws and the terms and conditions
contained in the warrant certificate. </P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Holders
of the warrants may exercise their warrants to purchase common shares on or
before the expiration date by delivering a notice of exercise form,
appropriately completed and duly signed and payment in cash of the exercise
price for the number of common shares with respect to which the warrant is being
exercised. Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part, but only for full
common shares. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
common shares issuable on exercise of the warrants will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms of the warrants, duly and validly authorized, issued
and fully paid and non-assessable. We will authorize and reserve at least the
number of common shares issuable upon exercise of all outstanding warrants. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;If
we effect certain stock-based distributions or changes in our capital structure,
such as a stock split or consolidation or stock dividend to all shareholders,
then we will adjust the exercise price and/or number of shares purchasable under
the warrants, as required by the terms of the warrants, to preserve the rights
of the warrant holders. If we effect a merger or consolidation or other
reorganization in which our common shares are reclassified or in which we are
not the surviving corporation, the warrants will become exercisable for the
securities that the holders of warrants would have received if the holders had
exercised the warrants in full immediately prior to the reorganization event.
</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
number of common shares that may be acquired by a holder upon any exercise of a
warrant will be limited to the extent necessary to ensure that, following such
exercise (or other issuance), the total number of common shares then
beneficially owned by that holder and its affiliates and any other persons whose
beneficial ownership of common shares would be aggregated with the holder&#146;s
for
purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not exceed 4.99% of the
total number of our issued and outstanding common shares (including for such
purpose the shares of common shares issuable upon such exercise). A holder may
increase or decrease this limitation by written notice to us, but any such
increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after notice is
delivered to us and will not be permitted to increase the limitation to greater
than 9.99% . </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;No
fractional common shares will be issued in connection with the exercise of a
warrant. In lieu of fractional shares, we will pay the holder an amount in cash
equal to the applicable fractional amount multiplied by the exercise price of
the warrant. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Subject
to compliance with Canadian securities laws, a warrant may be transferred by a
holder in whole or in part without our consent by the holder executing an
assignment in the form attached to the certificate representing the warrant and
upon payment of any necessary tax or other governmental charge imposed upon such
transfer. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;If
there is not an effective registration statement filed with the SEC registering
the common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time a warrant
are exercised, the warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis, pursuant to the
terms of the warrants The warrants will not be listed on any securities exchange
or automated quotation system, and we do not intend to arrange for any exchange
or quotation system to list or quote the warrants. </P>

&nbsp;The
following is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations
relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) arising from and relating to the
acquisition of units acquired pursuant to this prospectus supplement, the
acquisition, ownership, and disposition of common shares acquired as part of the
units, the exercise, disposition, and lapse of warrants acquired as part of the
units, and the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of common shares received

consequences that may apply to a U.S. Holder arising from and relating to the
acquisition of units pursuant to this prospectus supplement, or the acquisition,
ownership, and disposition of units, common shares, warrants and warrant shares.
In addition, this summary does not take into account the individual facts and
circumstances of any particular U.S. Holder that may affect the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to such U.S. Holder. Accordingly, this summary is not
intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or U.S. federal income tax
advice with respect to any particular U.S. Holder. Except as expressly discussed
below, this summary does not address tax filing or reporting requirements. This
summary does not address the U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal
estate and gift, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax consequences to U.S.
Holders relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of units, common
shares, warrants and warrant shares. In addition, except as specifically set
forth below, this summary does not discuss applicable income tax reporting
requirements. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the
U.S. federal, U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal estate and gift,
U.S. state and local, and non-U.S. tax consequences relating to the acquisition,
ownership, and disposition of units, common shares, warrants and warrant shares.

U.S. federal income tax purposes, the acquisition by a U.S. Holder of a unit
will be treated as the acquisition of two components: a component consisting of
one common share and a component consisting of one warrant. The purchase price
for each unit will be allocated between these two components in proportion to
their relative fair market values at the time the unit is purchased by the U.S.
Holder. This allocation of the purchase price for each unit will establish a
U.S. Holder&#146;s initial tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the
one
common share and one warrant that comprise each unit. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;For
purposes of determining tax basis, we will allocate
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&
nbsp;
of the purchase price for each unit to the one common share and
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&
nbsp;
of the purchase price for each unit to the one warrant. However, the IRS will
not be bound by our allocation of the purchase price for the units, and
therefore, the IRS or a U.S. court may not respect the allocation set forth
above. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the
allocation of the purchase price for the units. </P>

The following discussion is subject to the rules described below under the
heading &#147;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.&#148; <U>Exercise of 
Warrants</U>
A U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exercise of a
warrant and related receipt of a warrant share (unless cash is received in lieu
of the issuance of a fractional warrant share). A U.S. Holder&#146;s initial tax
basis in the warrant share received on the exercise of a
warrant should be equal to the sum of (a) such U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in 
such
warrant plus (b) the exercise price paid by such U.S. Holder on the exercise of
such warrant. A U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for the warrant share received
on
the exercise of a warrant should begin on the date that such warrant is
exercised by such U.S. Holder. </P>

<P align=justify><U>Disposition of Warrants</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A
U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition
of a warrant in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the U.S.
dollar value of cash plus the fair market value of any property received and (b)
such U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the warrant sold or otherwise disposed of.
Any
such gain or loss generally will be a capital gain or loss (provided that the
warrant share to be issued on the exercise of such warrant would have been a
capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code if acquired by the
U.S. Holder), which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the warrant is
held for more than one year. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Expiration of Warrants Without Exercise</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Upon
the lapse or expiration of a warrant, a U.S. Holder will recognize a loss in an
amount equal to such U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the warrant. Any such loss
generally will be a capital loss and will be long-term capital loss if the
warrants are held for more than one year. Deductions for capital losses are
subject to complex limitations under the Code. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Certain Adjustments to the Warrants</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Under
Section 305 of the Code, an adjustment to the number of warrant shares that will
be issued on the exercise of the warrants, or an adjustment to the exercise
price of the warrants, may be treated as a constructive distribution to a U.S.
Holder of the warrants if, and to the extent that, such adjustment has the
effect of increasing such U.S. Holder&#146;s proportionate interest in the our
&#147;earnings and profits&#148; or assets, depending on the circumstances of 
such
adjustment (for example, if such adjustment is to compensate for a distribution
of cash or other property to shareholders by us). Any such constructive
distribution would be taxable whether or not there is an actual distribution of
cash or other property. See more detailed discussion of the rules applicable to
distributions made by us at &#147;Ownership and Disposition of Common Shares and
Warrant Shares &#150; Taxation of Distributions&#148; below.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
rules with respect to adjustments are complex and each U.S. Holder of warrants
should consult its own tax advisor in the event of an adjustment. </P>

<P align=justify><U>Taxation of Distributions</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A
U.S. Holder that receives a distribution, including a constructive distribution,
with respect to a common share or warrant share (as well as any constructive
distribution on a warrant as described above) will be required to include the
amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend (without reduction for
any Canadian income tax withheld from such distribution) to the extent of our
current or accumulated &#147;earnings and profits,&#148; as computed for U.S. 
federal
income tax purposes. To the extent that a distribution exceeds our current and
accumulated &#147;earnings and profits,&#148; such distribution will be treated 
first as a
tax-free return of capital to the extent of a U.S. Holder's tax basis in the
common shares or warrant shares and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange
of such common shares or warrant shares (see &#147;Sale or Other Taxable 
Disposition
of Common Shares and Warrant Shares&#148; below). However, we may not maintain 
the
calculations of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax
principles, and each U.S. Holder should therefore assume that any distribution
by us with respect to the common shares (or warrants) or warrant shares (as well
as any constructive distribution on a warrant) will constitute ordinary dividend
income. Dividends received on common shares or warrant shares generally will not
be eligible for the &#147;dividends received deduction.&#148; Subject to 
applicable
limitations and provided we are is eligible for the benefits of the Canada-U.S.
Tax Convention, dividends paid by us to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including
individuals, generally will be eligible for the preferential tax rates
applicable to long-term capital gains for dividends, provided certain holding
period and other conditions are satisfied, including that we are not classified
as a PFIC (as defined below) in the tax year of distribution or in the preceding
tax year. The dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult
its own tax advisor regarding the application of such rules. </P>

&nbsp;A
U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition
of common shares or warrant shares in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property
received and (b) such U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in such common shares or 
warrant
shares sold or otherwise disposed of. Any such gain or loss generally will be
capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the
time of the sale or other disposition, such common shares or warrant shares are
held for more than one year. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Preferential
tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is an
individual, estate, or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for
long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for
capital losses are subject to significant limitations under the Code. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;If
we were to constitute a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; 
(&#147;PFIC&#148;) for any
year during a U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period, then certain potentially 
adverse
rules could affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder
from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of units, common shares,
warrants and warrant shares. We believe that we were not a PFIC for our tax year
ending on December 31, 2013, and based on our current and anticipated business
activities and financial expectations, we expect that we will not be a PFIC for
our current tax year and for the foreseeable future.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
determination as to whether any corporation was, or will be, a PFIC for a
particular tax year depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal
income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition,
whether any corporation will be a PFIC for any tax year depends on its assets
and income over the course of such tax year, and, as a result, our PFIC status
for our current tax year and any future tax year cannot be predicted with
certainty. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge our views (or a Subsidiary PFIC, as defined below) concerning our PFIC
status. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding our PFIC
status and any of our subsidiaries. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;In
addition, in any year in which we are classified as a PFIC, such holder may be
required to file an annual report with the IRS containing such information as
Treasury Regulations and/or other IRS guidance may require. Each U.S. Holder
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the requirements of filing such
information returns under these rules, including the requirement to file a IRS
Form 8621. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;We
will be a PFIC under Section 1297 of the Code if, for a tax year, (a) 75% or
more of our gross income for such tax year is passive income (the &#147;income 
test&#148;)
or (b) 50% or more of the value of our assets either produce passive income or
are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;), 
based on the
quarterly average of the fair market value of such assets. &#147;Gross 
income&#148;
generally includes all sales revenues less the cost of goods sold, plus income
from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources, and
&#147;passive income&#148; generally includes, for example, dividends, interest,
certain
rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of stock and securities, and
certain gains from commodities transactions.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;In
addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above,
if we own, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the total value of the
outstanding shares of another corporation, we will be treated as if we (a) held
a proportionate share of the assets of such other corporation and (b) received
directly a proportionate share of the income of such other corporation. In
addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above
and assuming certain other requirements are met, &#147;passive income&#148; does
not
include certain interest, dividends, rents, or royalties that are received or
accrued by us from a &#147;related person&#148; (as defined in Section 954(d)(3)
of the
Code), to the extent such items are properly allocable to the income of such
related person that is not passive income and certain other requirements are
satisfied. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under certain attribution rules, if we are a PFIC, U.S. Holders will be deemed
to own their proportionate share of any subsidiary which is also a PFIC (a
&#145;&#145;Subsidiary PFIC&#146;&#146;), and will be subject to U.S. federal 
income tax on (i) a
distribution on the shares of a Subsidiary PFIC or (ii) a disposition of shares
of a Subsidiary PFIC, both as if the holder directly held the shares of such
Subsidiary PFIC. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;If
we were a PFIC in any tax year and a U.S. Holder held units, common shares,
warrants or warrant shares, such holder generally would be subject to special
rules under Section 1291 of the Code with respect to &#147;excess 
distributions&#148; made
by us on the common shares, warrants or warrant shares and with respect to gain
from the disposition of units, common shares, warrants or warrant shares. An
&#147;excess distribution&#148; generally is defined as the excess of 
distributions with
respect to the common shares, warrants or warrant shares received by a U.S.
Holder in any tax year over 125% of the average annual distributions such
U.S. Holder has received from us during the shorter of the three preceding tax
years, or such U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for the common shares, warrants
or
warrant shares, as applicable. Generally, a U.S. Holder would be required to
allocate any excess distribution or gain from the disposition of the units,
common shares, warrants or warrant shares ratably over its holding period for
the units, common shares, warrants or warrant shares. Such amounts allocated to
the year of the disposition or excess distribution would be taxed as ordinary
income, and amounts allocated to prior tax years would be taxed as ordinary
income at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year and an interest
charge at a rate applicable to underpayments of tax would apply. </P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;While
there are U.S. federal income tax elections that sometimes can be made to
mitigate these adverse tax consequences (including, without limitation, the 
&#147;QEF
Election&#148; under Section 1295 of the Code and the &#147;Mark-to-Market 
Election&#148; under
Section 1296 of the Code), such elections are available in limited circumstances
and must be made in a timely manner. Under proposed Treasury Regulations, if a
U.S. Holder has an option, warrant, or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC
(such as the warrants), such option, warrant or right is considered to be PFIC
stock subject to the default rules of Section 1291 of the Code that apply to
&#147;excess distributions&#148; and dispositions described above. However, for 
the
purposes of the PFIC rules, the holding period for any warrant shares acquired
upon the exercise of a warrant will begin on the date a U.S. Holder acquires the
units (and not the date the warrants are exercised). This will impact the
availability, and consequences, of the QEF Election and Mark-to-Market Election
with respect to the warrant shares. Thus, a U.S. Holder will have to account for
warrant shares and common shares under the PFIC rules and the applicable
elections differently. In addition, a QEF Election may not be made with respect
to the warrants and it is unclear whether the Mark-to-Market Election may be
made with respect to the warrants. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax
advisor regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to the ownership
and disposition of units, common shares, warrants, and warrant shares, and the
availability of certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;U.S.
Holders should be aware that, for each tax year, if any, that we are a PFIC, we
can provide no assurances that we will satisfy the record keeping requirements
of a PFIC, or that we will make available to U.S. Holders the information such
U.S. Holders require to make a QEF Election with respect to us or any Subsidiary
PFIC. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the
potential application of the PFIC rules to the ownership and disposition of
units, common shares, warrants and warrant shares, and the availability of
certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules. </P>

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;U.S.
Holders that are individuals, estates and certain trusts whose income exceeds
certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare surtax on &#147;net
investment income&#148; including, among other things, dividends and net gain 
from
disposition of property (other than property held in a trade or business). Each
U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the effect, if any, of
this tax on its ownership and disposition of units, common shares, warrants and
warrant shares. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Receipt of Foreign Currency</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The
amount of any distribution paid to a U.S. Holder in foreign currency, or on the
sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of units, common shares, warrants
and warrant shares, generally will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency based on the exchange rate applicable on the date of receipt
(regardless of whether such foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars at
that time). If the foreign currency received is not converted into U.S. dollars
on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in the foreign currency
equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any U.S. Holder who
receives payment in foreign currency and engages in a subsequent conversion or
other disposition of the foreign currency may have a foreign currency exchange
gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally
will be U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. Each U.S.
Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of receiving, owning, and disposing of foreign currency. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Foreign Tax Credit</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Subject
to the PFIC rules discussed above, a U.S. Holder that pays (whether directly or
through withholding) Canadian income tax with respect to dividends paid on the
common shares or warrant shares (or with respect to any deemed dividend on the
warrants) generally will be entitled, at the election of such U.S. Holder, to
receive either a deduction or a credit for such Canadian income tax paid.
Generally, a credit will reduce a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax 
liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas a
deduction will reduce a U.S. Holder&#146;s income subject to U.S. federal income
tax.
This election is made on a year-by-year basis and applies to all foreign taxes
paid (whether directly or through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a year.

<P

&nbsp;Complex
limitations apply to the foreign tax credit, including the general limitation
that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. Holder&#146;s 
U.S.
federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holder&#146;s &#147;foreign 
source&#148; taxable
income bears to such U.S. Holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying 
this
limitation, a U.S. Holder&#146;s various items of income and deduction must be
classified, under complex rules, as either &#147;foreign source&#148; or 
&#147;U.S. source.&#148;
Generally, dividends paid by a foreign corporation should be treated as foreign
source for this purpose, and gains recognized on the sale of stock of a foreign
corporation by a U.S. Holder should be treated as U.S. source for this purpose,
except as otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and if an
election is properly made under the Code. However, the amount of a distribution
with respect to the common shares, warrant shares or warrants that is treated as
a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it
is for
Canadian federal income tax purposes, resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit
allowance to a U.S. Holder. In addition, this limitation is calculated
separately with respect to specific categories of income. The foreign tax credit
rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor
regarding the foreign tax credit rules. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Backup Withholding and Information Reporting</U> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Under
U.S. federal income tax law and Treasury Regulations, certain categories of U.S.
Holders must file information returns with respect to their investment in, or
involvement in, a foreign corporation. For example, recently enacted legislation
generally imposes new U.S. return disclosure obligations (and related penalties)
on U.S. Holders that hold certain specified foreign financial assets in excess
of certain threshold amounts. The definition of specified foreign financial
assets includes not only financial accounts maintained in foreign financial
institutions, but also, unless held in accounts maintained by a financial
institution, any stock or security issued by a non-U.S. person, any financial
instrument or contract held for investment that has an issuer or counterparty
other than a U.S. person and any interest in a foreign entity. U.S. Holders may
be subject to these reporting requirements unless their units, common shares,
warrants or warrant shares are held in an account at certain financial
institutions. Penalties for failure to file certain of these information returns
are substantial. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors
regarding the requirements of filing information returns under these rules,
including the requirement to file an IRS Form 8938. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Payments
made within the U.S. or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, of dividends on, and
proceeds arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of, units, common
shares, warrants and warrant shares will generally be subject to information
reporting and backup withholding tax (currently at a rate of 28%), if a U.S.
Holder (a) fails to furnish such U.S. Holder&#146;s correct U.S. taxpayer
identification number (generally on Form W-9), (b) furnishes an incorrect U.S.
taxpayer identification number, (c) is notified by the IRS that such U.S. Holder
has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding
tax, or (d) fails to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such U.S. Holder
has furnished its correct U.S. taxpayer identification number and that the IRS
has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding tax.
However, certain exempt persons generally are excluded from these information
reporting and backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the U.S.
backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. 
Holder&#146;s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or will be refunded, if such U.S.
Holder furnishes required information to the IRS in a timely manner.</P>

&nbsp;The
discussion of reporting requirements set forth above is not intended to
constitute an exhaustive description of all reporting requirements that may
apply to a U.S. Holder. A failure to satisfy certain reporting requirements may
result in an extension of the time period during which the IRS can assess a tax,
and under certain circumstances, such an extension may apply to assessments of
amounts unrelated to any unsatisfied reporting requirement. Each U.S. Holder
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the information reporting and
backup withholding rules. </P>

holder are made. This summary is not exhaustive of all Canadian federal income
tax considerations. Accordingly, prospective investors in common shares or
warrants should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their own
particular circumstances. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Currency Conversion </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;For
purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition,
holding or disposition of the common shares and warrants, including dividends,
adjusted cost base and proceeds of disposition must be converted into Canadian
dollars using the rate of exchange quoted by the Bank of Canada at noon on the
date on which the amount first arose or such other rate of exchange as is
acceptable to the CRA. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Exercise of Warrants </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Upon
the exercise of a warrant, there will be no income tax consequences for a
Non-Resident Holder. When a warrant is exercised, the Non-Resident Holder&#146;s
cost
of the common share acquired thereby will be the aggregate of the Non-Resident
Holder&#146;s adjusted cost base of such warrant and the exercise price paid for
the
common share. The Non-Resident Holder&#146;s adjusted cost base of the common 
share
so acquired will be determined by averaging such cost with the adjusted cost
base to the Non-Resident Holder of all common shares held by the Non-Resident
Holder as capital property immediately prior to such acquisition. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Disposition of Common Shares and Warrants </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A
Non-Resident Holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian Tax Act in
respect of any capital gain realized by such Non-Resident Holder on a
disposition of the common shares or warrants, nor will capital losses arising
from the disposition be recognized under the Canadian Tax Act, unless the common
shares or warrants constitute &#147;taxable Canadian property&#148; (within the 
meaning of
the Canadian Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of disposition and
the Non-Resident Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax
treaty or convention. As long as the common shares are then listed on a
designated stock exchange (which currently includes the TSX and the NYSE MKT) at
the time of disposition, the common shares and the warrants generally will not
constitute taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder, unless at any
time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition: (i) the
Non-Resident Holder, persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at
arm&#146;s length, or the Non-Resident Holder together with all such persons, 
owned
or was considered to own 25% or more of our issued shares of any class or series
of shares of our capital stock; and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value
of the common shares was determined directly or indirectly from one or any
combination of real or immovable property situated in Canada, &#147;Canadian 
resource
properties&#148; (within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act), &#147;timber 
resource
properties&#148; (within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act) or a options in
respect
of, or interests in, or civil law rights in, such properties, whether or not it
exists. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;If
the common shares or warrants are taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident
Holder, any capital gain realized on the disposition or deemed disposition of
such shares, may not be subject to Canadian federal income tax pursuant to the
terms of an applicable income tax treaty or convention between Canada and the
country of residence of a Non-Resident Holder. </P>
<P align=justify><B>A Non-Resident Holder whose shares are taxable Canadian
property should consult their own advisors. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Dividends on Common Shares </B></P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Under
the Canadian Tax Act, dividends on shares paid or credited, or deemed to be paid
or credited, to a Non-Resident Holder will be subject to Canadian withholding
tax at the rate of 25% of the gross amount of the dividends. This withholding
tax may be reduced pursuant to the terms of an applicable income tax treaty or
convention between Canada and the country of residence of a Non-Resident Holder.
Under the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, a US Holder will generally be subject to
Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 15% of the amount of such dividends. In
the case of a US Holder that is a U.S. corporation that beneficially owns at
least 10% of our voting stock, such US Holder will generally be subject to
Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 5% of the amount of such dividends.
Pursuant to the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, certain tax-exempt entities that are
US Holders may be exempt from Canadian withholding taxes, including any taxes
levied in respect of dividends received on the shares. </P>
