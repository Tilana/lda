Nature of operations and principal activities
3. 
Due to  difficult market conditions in the mining and exploration sector, the Company has been evaluating high  quality and 
value adding investment opportunities outside the mineral exploration industry to take advantage of global market trends and 
maximise the value of its Shares. On 10 February 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding agreement to acquire Helio 
Energia Holdings S.A. (refer to section 5.1.a for further details). 
The  Company  will  also  seek  either  a  strategic  partner  or  commercial  opportunities  to  divest  its  existing  Canegrass  Project 
mineral exploration assets and projects. At the current nickel price Nickelore's interest in the remains a valuable asset.
Dividends paid or recommended
4. 
There were no dividends paid or recommended during the financial year ended 30 June 2016.
Review of operations
5. 
5.1.  Operations review
Helio Energia Holdings S.A.
a. 
On  10  February  2016,  Nickelore  entered  into  a  non-binding  agreement  to  acquire  Helio  Energia  Holdings  S.A.  (Helio). 
Helio is a leading-edge, full-service, end-to-end provider of distributed generation solar energy systems for commercial 
and industrial energy customers in Brazil (the Acquisition). Nickelore believes the Acquisition will provide shareholders 
with an opportunity to enter an exciting new market with strong prospects for growth. 
Helio  continues  to  grow  its  operations  since  the  acquisition  was  announced,  with  six  projects  totalling  2.9MW  now 
operating, including a 1MW system that is currently the largest private industrial solar system in Brazil. In addition, Helio 
has 6 projects under construction or contract, which will deliver a further 10.0MW of installed capacity, bringing Helio's 
total installed capacity to 12.9MW upon completion. The pipeline for additional solar rental agreements is robust, with 
more than 12.3MW in signed proposals or short listings on requests for proposals, and over 120MW of identified pipeline 
under development. 
On 29 July 2016, Nickelore executed a binding Share Sale Agreement to acquire 100% of the issued capital of Helio and is 
progressing the Acquisition for Nickelore shareholder approval in the current quarter.  
Nickelore proposes to acquire Helio in exchange for equity in the Company for a fixed quantum of consideration. Included 
in the consideration will be performance shares in Nickelore, subject to the achievement of key business milestones. The 
terms  provide  incentives  to  realise  significant  business  outcomes,  provides  a  clear  structure  to  deliver  an  increased 
investment  return  for  both  Nickelore  and  Helio  shareholders,  as  well  as  a  capital  structure  that  ensures  Helio  is  well 
positioned to capture its growth pipeline opportunities. 
As  part  of  the  transaction,  Nickelore  will  undertake  a  Principal  Raising  for  a  minimum  of  A$5  million,  with 
oversubscriptions for up to an additional A$20 million. Patersons Securities Limited has been appointed as lead manager 
to  conduct  the  Principal  Raising.  Funds  from  the  Principal  Raising  will  provide  additional  capital  for  Helio  to  capture 
pipeline  opportunities  as  it  targets  38MW  of  cumulative  installed  capacity  within  18  months  of  conclusion  of  the 
fundraising. As Helio grows its installed capacity, it is expected that debt and alternate forms of infrastructure funding, 
such as asset portfolio level equity structures, will be utilised to expand Helio's installed capacity.

Directors' report
NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
Completion  of  Nickelore's  acquisition  of  Helio  remains  conditional  upon  a  number  of  conditions  precedent,  such  as 
undertaking the Principal Raising, and regulatory and shareholder approvals for both Nickelore and Helio, including ASX 
requirements for re-admission being met by the combined entity.
Existing Business Activities
b. 
The Acquisition of Helio will result in a significant change to the nature and scale of the Company's main business, which 
the Nickelore Board considers to be positive and in the best interests of Nickelore shareholders.  
While Nickelore intends to continue to fund its obligations in respect to the Canegrass Project, if Nickelore shareholders 
approve the Acquisition, post-completion the new board of Nickelore will undertake a review of the Canegrass assets to 
investigate opportunities to divest its existing assets and projects by way of a sale, joint venture, or farm-out agreement.
5.2.  Operating results
The  loss  of  the  Company  for  the  year  amounted  to  $271,880  (2015:  $162,142),  which  is  consistent  with  2015  and 
expected at the Company's current operating levels. This has been minimised through Directors' election to accrue fees. 
No Directors' fees have been settled in cash since November 2011; refer to note 12b of the financial statements. 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  the  continuity  of  normal 
business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Details of 
the  Company's  assessment  in  this  regard  can  be  found  in  Note  1  Statement  of  significant  accounting  policies:  Going 
Concern on page 14. The auditor's report on page 38 contains an emphasis on matter in this regard.
5.3.  Financial position
The net assets of the Company have increased by $262,444 from 30 June 2015 to $460,535 at 30 June 2016. 
As at 30 June 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased from 30 June 2015 by $253,938 to $508,675 and 
had working capital of $460,535 (2015: $198,091 working capital).
Significant changes in state of affairs
6. 
Other than referred to in 5 Review of operations, no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Company occurred during 
the financial year.
Events subsequent to reporting date
7. 
There are no other significant events subsequent to reporting date that are not covered in this Directors' Report or within the 
financial statements at Note 14 Events subsequent to reporting date on page 30.
Likely developments
8. 
Other than matters referred to in sections 3 and 5.1 of this Directors' Report, no other likely developments, future prospects 
and business strategies of the operations of the Company and the expected results of those operations have not been included 
in this report as the Directors believe that the inclusion of such information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice 
to the Company.

At the date of this report, the Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee and 
Nomination  Committee  comprise  the  full  Board  of  Directors.  The  Directors 
believe  the  Company  is  not  currently  of  a  size  nor  are  its  affairs  of  such 
complexity  as  to  warrant  the  establishment  of  these  separate  committees. 
Accordingly, all matters capable of delegation to such committees are considered 
by the full Board of Directors.
Indemnifying officers or auditor
11. 
11.1.  Indemnification
The  Company  entered  into  an  Agreement  with  each  Director  of  the  Company  indemnifying  them  against  liabilities  to 
another person (other than the Company or a related body corporate) that may arise from their position as Directors of 
the Company and its controlled entities, with the exception of conduct involving a wilful breach of duty or improper use 
of information to gain a personal advantage. This agreement stipulates that the Company will meet the full amount of 
any such liabilities, including costs and expenses. 
The Company has not entered into any agreement with its current auditors indemnifying them against any claims by third 
parties arising from their report on the financial report.

NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
Since the end of the previous financial year the Company paid insurance premiums of $9,935 in respect of Directors and 
Officers liability insurance contracts for current and former Directors and Officers of the Company.
12.  Options 
12.1.  Unissued shares under option
At the date of this report, there were no un-issued ordinary shares of Nickelore Limited under option (listed or unlisted) 
(2015: nil). 
No person entitled to exercise the option has or has any right by virtue of the option to participate in any share issue of 
any other body corporate.
12.2.  Shares issued on exercise of options
No ordinary shares were issued  by the Company as a result of the exercise of options  during or since the end of the 
financial year.
13.  Environmental regulations 
The Company's operations are subject to environmental regulations in relation to its exploration activities. The Directors are 
not aware of any outstanding breaches.  
The  Directors  have  considered  the  enacted  National  Greenhouse  and  Energy  Reporting  Act  2007  (the  NGER  Act)  which 
introduced a single national reporting framework for the reporting and dissemination of information about the greenhouse gas 
emissions, greenhouse gas projects, and energy use and production of corporations. At the current stage of development, the 
Directors have determined that the NGER Act has no effect on the Company for the current, nor subsequent, financial year. 
The Directors will reassess this position as and when the need arises.
14.  Non-audit services 
During the year, independent expert report services were provided to the Company by a party related to the auditors, Stantons 
International,  in  respect  to  the  proposed  acquisition  of  Helio.  These  services  amounted  to  $12,500  (2015:  $-).  Details  of 
remuneration paid to the auditor can be found within the financial statements at Note 16 Auditor's Remuneration on page 31. 
The Board has established certain procedures to ensure that the provision of non-audit services are compatible with, and do 
not compromise, the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). These procedures include:
non-audit services will be subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the Company and will be reviewed
by the Board to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
ensuring  non-audit  services  do  not  involve  reviewing  or  auditing  the  auditor's  own  work,  acting  in  a  management  or
decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.
The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by Stantons International (or by another 
person  or  firm  on  Stantons  International's  behalf)  is  compatible  with  the  general  standard  of  independence  for  auditors 
imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
15.  Proceedings on behalf of company 
No person has applied for leave of Court to bring proceedings on behalf of the Company or intervene in any proceedings to 
which the Company is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Company for all or any part of those 
proceedings. 
The Company was not a party to any such proceedings during the year.
16.  Auditor's independence declaration 
The  lead  auditor's  independence  declaration  under  section  307C  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  (Cth)  for  the  year  ended  
30 June 2016 has been received and can be found on page 9 of the annual report.

ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Directors' report
17.  Remuneration report (Audited) 
17.1.   Principles of compensation
Remuneration is referred to as compensation throughout this report. 
Key Management Personnel (KMP) have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities 
of the Company. KMP comprise the directors of the Company. 
Compensation  levels  for  KMP  are  competitively  set  to  attract  and  retain  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced 
directors and executives. 
To this end, the Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
Provide competitive rewards to attract qualified and experienced executives; 
  Link executive rewards to length of service, experience and overall performance of the Company; and 
  Equity participation is a cost effective and efficient incentive given the Company's pre-production status.
The Board of Nickelore Limited believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate and effective in its ability to attract 
and retain the best executives and Directors to run and manage the Company, as well as create goal congruence between 
directors, executives and shareholders. 
Shares and options may only be issued to directors subject to approval by shareholders in a general meeting. 
The Board has no established retirement or redundancy schemes. 
The remuneration structure for KMP is based on a number of factors, including length of service, particular experience of 
the individual concerned, and overall performance of the Company. The contracts for service between the Company and 
KMP are on a continuing basis, the terms of which are not expected to change in the immediate future. 
The Board determines the proportion of fixed and variable compensation for each KMP. 
Director's fees are reviewed annually by the Board. No termination payments are payable to Non-Executive Directors.  
In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of Non-Executive Director and senior management 
remuneration is separate and distinct.
Fixed Remuneration
a. 
Generally, compensation is provided by the Company to its executive officers by way of salary and share option grants. 
The objective is to ensure that executive compensation is fair and reasonable in order to attract and retain qualified and 
experienced executives. 
Fixed  remuneration  consists  of  base  cash  remuneration  and  statutory  superannuation  entitlements.  Longer  term 
discretionary remuneration consists of share option grants. Remuneration levels are based on an overall assessment of 
both individual and Company performance. 
The Company believes that encouraging its executives and employees to become shareholders is the best way of aligning 
their interest to those of its shareholders. In addition, equity participation is a cost effective and efficient incentive as 
compared  to  cash  bonuses  or  increased  remuneration,  particularly  given  the  Company's  pre-production  status. 
Accordingly,  all  executives  and  employees  are  entitled  to  participate  in  the  Company's  equity  incentive  scheme. 
Generally,  the  ability  to  exercise  an  option  is  conditional  upon  the  holder  remaining  in  the  Company's  employment. 
There are presently no other non-cash benefits available to Directors or employees. There is no separate profit-sharing 
or bonus plan. 
The contracts for service between the Company and Directors  and executives are on a continuing basis, the terms of 
which  are  not  expected  to  change  in  the  immediate  future.  Upon  retirement,  Directors  and  executives  are  paid 
employee benefit entitlements accrued to date of retirement. The Company may terminate the contracts without cause 
by providing one month's written notice. Termination payments (if applicable) are generally not payable on resignation 
or dismissal for serious misconduct. In the instance of serious misconduct the Company can terminate employment at 
any time.
Performance Based Remuneration – Short-term and long-term incentive structure
b. 
The  Board  will  review  executive  packages  annually  by  reference  to  the  Company's  performance  and  executive 
performance and comparable information from industry sectors using independent external advice where appropriate.

Short-term incentives
NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
No short-term incentives in the form of cash bonuses were granted during the year.
Long-term incentives
No long-term incentives in the form of cash bonuses were granted during the year.
Service Contracts
c. 
The employment conditions of the executive director, Mr Robert Gardner and other KMP are formalised in contracts of 
employment.  Terms  of  employment  contracts  are  structured  to  industry  standards  including  normal  provisions  for 
termination and notice periods.
Non-executive Directors
d. 
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level which provides the Company with the ability to attract and 
retain Directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to shareholders. 
The Constitution and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of Non-Executive Directors shall be 
determined from time to time by a general meeting. An amount not exceeding the amount determined is then divided 
between the Directors as agreed. 
The  amount  of  aggregate  remuneration  sought  to  be  approved  by  shareholders  and  the  manner  in  which  it  is 
apportioned amongst Directors is reviewed annually. The Board considers advice from external consultants as well as the 
fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies when undertaking the annual review process. 
Each  Non-Executive  Director  receives  a  fee  for  being  a  Director  of  the  Company.  No  additional  fees  are  paid  for 
participation on subcommittees, such as the Audit Committee. Non-Executive Directors are encouraged by the Board to 
hold shares in the Company. 
Accordingly, they are entitled to participate in equity incentive schemes offered by the Company.  
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors for the financial year were $30,000 of which $13,375 remains accrued and unpaid at 
30 June 2016 (2015: $30,000 of which $22,500 was accrued and unpaid).
Engagement of Remuneration Consultants
e. 
During the financial year, the Company did not engage any remuneration consultants.
Relationship between Remuneration of Key Management Personnel and Shareholder Wealth
f. 
During the Company's exploration and development phases of its business, the Board anticipates that the Company will 
retain  earnings  (if  any)  and  other  cash  resources  for  the  exploration  and  development  of  its  resource  projects. 
Accordingly,  the  Company  does  not  currently  have  a  policy  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  dividends  and  returns  of 
capital. Therefore, there was no relationship between the Board's policy for determining, or in relation to, the nature 
during the current and previous financial years.  
The Board did not determine the nature and amount of remuneration of the KMP by reference to changes in the price at 
which  shares  in  the  Company  traded  between  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  current  and  previous  financial  years. 
However, as noted above, the Directors of the Company received incentive options in which generally would only be of 
value if the Company's share price increased sufficiently to warrant exercising the incentive options.
Relationship between Remuneration of Key Management Personnel and Earnings
g. 
The Company is currently undertaking the proposed acquisition of Helio, as referred to in 5 Review of operations, and 
does  not expect to be undertaking  profitable operations (other  than  by way of material asset sales, none of which is 
currently planned) until sometime after the successful completion of the Helio transaction. Accordingly, the Board does 
not  consider  earnings  during  the  current  and  previous  financial  years  when  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of 
remuneration of KMP.
17.2.  Remuneration Details for the Year Ended 30 June 2016
There were no cash bonuses paid during the year and there are no set performance criteria for achieving cash bonuses. 
The following table of benefits and payment details, in respect to the financial year, the components of remuneration for 
each member of the KMP of the Company:

NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note   1 
These are the financial statements and notes of Nickelore Limited (the Company). Nickelore Limited is a company limited by 
shares, domiciled and incorporated in Australia, whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.
Statement of significant accounting policies
a.  Basis of preparation
i.  Statement of compliance 
The financial statements are general purpose financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with Australian 
Accounting  Standards,  including  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result in a financial report 
containing relevant and reliable  information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply. Compliance 
with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  ensures  that  the  financial  statements  and  notes  also  comply  with  International 
Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  IASB.  Material  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  these 
financial statements are presented below. They have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.  
The financial statements were authorised for issue on 16 August 2016 by the directors of the Company.
ii.  Financial position 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  are  based  on  historical  costs  modified,  where 
applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.
iii.  Going Concern 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  the  continuity  of  normal 
business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 
Nickelore's net assets have increased by $262,444 from $198,091 at 30 June 2015 to $460,535 at 30 June 2016. 
As at 30 June 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $253,938 from $254,737 at 30 June 2015 to 
$508,675 and had working capital of $460,535 (June 2015: $198,091 working capital). 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is principally dependent upon the ability of the Company to 
secure funds by raising capital from equity markets or by other means, and by managing cash flows in line with available 
funds, and/or the successful  development of the Company's exploration assets, including the suspension of payment of 
Directors' fees. Should the above matters not be achieved, there is a material uncertainty about the ability of the Company 
to continue as a going concern. 
Based upon cash flow forecasts and other factors referred to above, the directors are satisfied that the going concern basis 
of  preparation  is  appropriate,  including  the  meeting  of  exploration  commitments.  Should  the  Company  be  unable  to 
continue as a going concern it may be required to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the normal 
course of business and at amounts different to those stated in the condensed financial statements.  
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying 
amounts or to the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a 
going concern and meet its debts as and when they fall due.
iv.  Use of estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the  application  of  policies  and  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.  These  estimates  and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
Judgements made by management in the application of Australian Accounting Standards that have significant effect on the 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 1q 
on page 21.
v.  Comparative figures 
Where required by Accounting Standards comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation 
for the current financial year.

Note   1 
b.  Accounting Policies 
The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in the financial statements. The 
Group  has  considered  the  implications  of  new  and  amended  Accounting  Standards  applicable  for  annual  reporting  periods 
beginning after 1 January 2015 but determined that their application to the financial statements is either not relevant or not 
material.
Statement of significant accounting policies
c.  Exploration and development expenditure
i.  Recognition and measurement 
Exploration and evaluation costs, including the costs of acquiring licenses, are written off in the year they are incurred.
ii.  Site restoration and rehabilitation 
Provision  is  made  for  anticipated  costs  of  rehabilitation  necessitated  by  disturbance  arising  from  production  activity  in 
respect of certain tenements in the period in which the disturbance occurred. The provision for tenement rehabilitation is 
provided  in  respect  of  a  performance  guarantee  under  Department  of  Mines  and  Petroleum  obligations  over  site 
restoration requirements over certain tenements. 
Rehabilitation  costs  are  accumulated  in  the  provision  on  a  production  output  basis  commencing  in  the  period  that 
disturbance occurs. In determining the rehabilitation obligations, the entity has assumed no significant changes will occur 
in the relevant Federal and State legislation in relation to rehabilitation of the disturbances arising from production activity 
in respect of those tenements.
Income tax
d. 
Current  income  tax  expense  charged  to  the  profit  or  loss  is  the  tax  payable  on  taxable  income  calculated  using  applicable 
income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, as at reporting date. Current tax liabilities (assets) are therefore measured 
at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority. 
Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as 
well unused tax losses. 
Current and deferred income tax expense (income) is charged or credited outside profit or loss when the tax relates to items 
recognised outside profit or loss. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where amounts have been fully 
expensed but future tax deductions are available. No deferred income tax will be recognised:
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities (other than as a result of a business 
combination) which affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
  When the taxable temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill; or 
  When  the  taxable  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or  interests  in  joint 
ventures,  and  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  difference  can  be  controlled  and  it  is  probable  that  the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date. Their measurement 
also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. 
Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised, except:
When the deductible temporary difference giving rise to the asset arises from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities 
(other than as a result of a business combination) which affects neither accounting profit nor taxable income; or 
  When the deductible temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests in joint 
ventures,  in  which  case  a  deferred  tax  asset  is  only  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary 
difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
The  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  and  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note   1 
Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  where  a  legally  enforceable  right  of  set-off  exists  and  it  is  intended  that  net 
settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended 
that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods 
in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.
Statement of significant accounting policies
e.  Plant and Equipment
i.  Recognition and measurement 
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy 1m Impairment of non-financial assets). 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset  to a working 
condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are 
located, and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.  
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "other income" in profit 
or loss. 
The  carrying  amount  of  plant  and  equipment  is  reviewed  annually  by  Directors  to  ensure  it  is  not  in  excess  of  the 
recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows 
that will be received from the assets employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows have not been 
discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts.
ii.  Subsequent costs 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it 
is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits  embodied  within  the  part  will  flow  to  the  Company  and  its  cost  can  be 
measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred.
iii.  Depreciation 
With the exception of exploration and evaluation assets, depreciation is charged to the income statement on a diminishing 
value basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment, except to the extent 
that they are included in the carrying amount of another asset as an allocation of production overheads.  
Depreciation  rates  and  methods  are  reviewed  annually  for  appropriateness.  The  Company  currently  has  no  depreciable 
assets. Accordingly, the depreciation rates used will be set in future periods as required. 
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.
f.  Employee Benefits
i.  Defined contribution superannuation funds 
A  defined  contribution  plan  is  a  post-employment  benefit  plan  under  which  an  entity  pays  fixed  contributions  onto  a 
separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to 
defined  contribution  superannuation  funds  are  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the  income  statement  as  incurred.  Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
ii.  Short-term benefits 
Liabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries and annual leave that are expected to be settled within 12 months of 
the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees' services provided to the reporting date and are 
calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates that the Company expects to pay at the 
reporting date including related on-costs, such as workers compensation insurance and payroll tax.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note   1
Statement of significant accounting policies
Non-accumulating non-monetary benefits, such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods and services, 
are expensed based on the net marginal cost to the Company as the benefits are taken by the employees.
iii.  Other long-term benefits 
For the year ending 30 June 2016, no amount for long term benefits has been recognised in the financial statements as the 
Company has no employees.
g.  Equity-settled compensation 
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified.  In  addition,  an  expense  is  recognised  for  any  modification  that  increases  the  total  fair  value  of  the  share  based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of modification. 
The Company operates an employee share option plan. Share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of 
the instruments issued and amortised over the vesting periods. Share-based payments to non-employees are measured at the 
fair value of goods or services received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, if it is determined the fair value of the 
goods  or  services  cannot  be  reliably  measured,  and  are  recorded  at  the  date  the  goods  or  services  are  received.  The 
corresponding amount is recorded to the option reserve. 
The fair value of options is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The number of shares and options expected to 
vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that the amount recognised for services received as 
consideration  for  the  equity  instruments  granted  is  based  on  the  number  of  equity  instruments  that  eventually  vest.  No 
expense  is  recognised  for  awards  that  do  not  ultimately  vest,  except  for  awards  where  vesting  is  only  conditional  upon  a 
market condition. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of Nickelore (market conditions) if applicable. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the  performance  and/or  service  conditions  are  fulfilled,  ending  on  the  date  on  which  the  relevant  employees  become  fully 
entitled to the award (the vesting period). 
The  cumulative  expense  recognised  for  equity-settled  transactions  at  each  reporting  date  until  vesting  date  reflects  (i)  the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the Company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest.  No adjustment is made for the  likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the  effect of 
these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The income statement charge or credit for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. 
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised  for  the  award  is  recognised  immediately.  However,  if  a  new  award  is  substituted  for  the  cancelled  award  and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
No options in respect to the plan were issued or on issue for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.
h.  Revenue and other income 
Interest revenue is recognised in accordance with note 1k.ix Financial income and expenses. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and 
allowances. Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration 
due or there is a risk of return of goods or there is continuing management involvement with the goods. 
All revenue is stated net of any GST (note 1h).
i.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
GST is a broad-based consumption tax that the Company is exposed in Australia. 
Revenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not 
recoverable from the relevant country's taxation authority. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are 
shown inclusive of GST. 
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Office is included as a current asset or liability 
in the balance sheet.

Statement of significant accounting policies
j.  Leases 
Leases of fixed assets where substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to the ownership of the asset, but not the legal 
ownership, are transferred to entities in the Company are classified as finance leases. Finance lease payments are allocated 
between the reduction of the lease liability and the lease interest expense for the period. 
Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to that asset. 
Leased assets are depreciated on a diminishing value basis over their estimated useful lives where it is likely that the Company 
will obtain ownership of the asset or over the term of the lease. 
Lease payments for operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are recognised in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives under operating leases are recognised as a liability and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
lease term.
k.  Financial instruments
Initial recognition and measurement
i. 
A  financial  instrument  is  recognised  if  the  Company  becomes  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument. 
Financial assets are derecognised if the Company's contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if 
the Company transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of 
the  asset.  Financial  liabilities  are  derecognised  if  the  Company's  obligations  specified  on  the  contract  expire  or  are 
discharged or cancelled.
ii.  Non-derivative financial instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other payables. 
Non-derivative  financial  instruments  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  plus,  for  instruments  not  at  fair  value  through 
profit  or  loss,  any  directly  attributable  transactions  costs.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition  non-derivative  financial 
instruments are measured as described below.
iii.  Classification and subsequent measurement
Loans
(1)  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  includes  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  at  call  with  banks,  other  short-term  highly  liquid 
investments with original maturities of six (6) months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
short-borrowings in current liabilities on the Statement of financial position. 
(2) 
Loans are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
and  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost.  Gains  or  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  through  the 
amortisation process and when the financial asset is derecognised. 
Loans are included in current assets, except for those which are not expected to mature within 12 months after the end 
of the reporting period. 
(3)  Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost. Receivables are usually settled within 30 to 90 days. 
Collectability of trade and other debtors is reviewed on an ongoing basis. An impairment loss is recognised for debts 
which are known to be uncollectible. An impairment provision is raised for any doubtful amounts.

Investments
NICKELORE LIMITED

ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note   1 
(4) 
All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition 
charges associated with the investment. After initial recognition, investments, which are classified as held for trading 
and available-for-sale, are measured at fair value. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in the 
profit or loss. 
Gains or losses on available-for-sale investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a 
separate component of equity until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the 
profit or loss. 
For  investments  that  are  actively  traded  in  organised  financial  markets,  fair  value  is  determined  by  reference  to 
securities  exchange  quoted  market  bid  prices  at  the  close  of  business  on  the  Statement  of  Financial  Position  date. 
Where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another 
instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset 
base of the investment. 
(5)  Held-to-maturity investments 
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or determinable 
payments, and it is the Company's intention to hold these investments to maturity. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the financial 
asset is derecognised. Investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification. 
(6)  Trade and other payables 
Trade  payables  and  other  payable  are  recognised  when  the  Company  becomes  obligated  to  make  future  payments 
resulting from the purchase of goods and services which are unpaid and stated at their amortised cost. The amounts 
are unsecured and are generally settled on 30 day terms. 
(7)  Share capital 
Ordinary issued capital is recorded at the consideration received. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit. 
Ordinary  issued  capital  bears  no  special  terms  or  conditions  affecting  income  or  capital  entitlements  of  the 
shareholders.
iv.  Amortised cost 
Amortised cost is calculated as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition 
less  principal  repayments  and  any  reduction  for  impairment,  and  adjusted  for  any  cumulative  amortisation  of  the 
difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the effective interest method.
v.  Fair value 
Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  current  bid  prices  for  all  quoted  investments.  Valuation  techniques  are  applied  to 
determine  the  fair  value  for  all  unlisted  securities,  including  recent  arm's  length  transactions,  reference  to  similar 
instruments and option pricing models.
vi.  Effective interest method 
The  effective  interest  method  is  used  to  allocate  interest  income  or  interest  expense  over  the  relevant  period  and  is 
equivalent  to  the  rate  that  discounts  estimated  future  cash  payments  or  receipts  (including  fees,  transaction  costs  and 
other premiums or discounts) over the expected life (or when this cannot be reliably predicted, the contractual term) of the 
financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. Revisions to expected future net 
cash flows will necessitate an adjustment to the carrying amount with a consequential recognition of an income or expense 
item in profit or loss.
vii.  Impairment 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. 
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative 
effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are 
assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.

Note   1
Statement of significant accounting policies
NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
All impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss statement.  
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
viii. Derecognition 
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to cash flow expires or the asset is transferred to another 
party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks and benefits associated with the 
asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised where the related obligations are either discharged, cancelled or expired. The 
difference  between the carrying value of the financial  liability  extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair 
value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
ix.  Financial income and expenses 
Finance  income  comprises  interest  income  on  funds  invested  (including  available-for-sale  financial  assets),  gains  on  the 
disposal of available-for-sale financial assets and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.  
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method, unwinding of 
discounts on provisions, changes in  the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit  or loss and impairment 
losses  recognised  on  financial  assets.  All  borrowing  costs  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  using  the  effective  interest 
method.
Borrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  construction  or  production  of  assets  that  necessarily  take  a 
substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as 
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in income in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
l.  Earnings per share
i.  Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings (or loss) per share is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the parent 
company, excluding any costs of service equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.
ii.  Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings (or loss) per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares which 
comprise share options granted as Share-based payments.  
The  Company  does  not  report  diluted  earnings  per  share,  as  dilution  is  not  applied  to  annual  losses  generated  by  the 
Company.
m.  Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets (1d Income tax) are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset's 
recoverable amount is estimated. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
A  cash-generating  unit  is  the  smallest  identifiable  asset  group  that  generates  cash  flows  that  largely  are  independent  from 
other  assets  and  groups.  Impairment  losses  are  recognised  in  the  income  statement,  unless  the  asset  has  previously  been 
revalued, in which case the  impairment  loss is recognised as a reversal to the extent of that previous revaluation with any 
excess  recognised  through  the  income  statement.  Impairment  losses  recognised  in  respect  of  cash-generating  units  are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not 
generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
 
Note   1 
Impairment  losses  recognised  in  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indications  that  the  loss  has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
recognised.
Statement of significant accounting policies
n.  Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will results and that outflow can be reliably measured. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using 
the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying value is the present value of those cash flows. When some 
or all of the economic benefits  required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, for example 
under an insurance contract, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received 
and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
o.  Segment reporting 
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and 
incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Company's other components. All 
operating segments' results are regularly reviewed by the Company's Managing Director to make decisions about resources to 
be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
p.  Fair value estimation 
A number of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and 
non-financial assets and liabilities. Information about the assumptions made in determining fair values of assets and liabilities is 
disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
q.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements 
Management discusses with the Board the development, selection and disclosure of the Company's critical accounting policies 
and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of 
causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are  discussed 
below.
i.  Key Judgements – Environmental Issues 
Balances  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  are  not  adjusted  for  any  pending  or  enacted 
environmental legislation, and the directors understanding thereof. At the current stage of the  company's development 
and its current environmental impact, the directors believe such treatment is reasonable and appropriate.
ii.  Key Estimate – Taxation 
Balances disclosed in the financial statements and the notes thereto, related to taxation, are based on the best estimates of 
directors. These estimates take into account both the financial performance and position of the company as they pertain to 
current income taxation legislation, and the directors understanding thereof. No adjustment has been made for pending or 
future taxation legislation. The current income tax position represents that directors' best estimate, pending an assessment 
by tax authorities in relevant jurisdictions. Refer Note 6 Income tax on page 25.
r.  New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued by the AASB which are not yet mandatorily 
applicable to the Company have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Those which may be relevant to the 
Company are set out below. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early.
i.  AASB 9 Financial Instruments and associated Amending Standards (applicable for annual reporting period commencing 1 January
2018)
The Standard will be applicable retrospectively (subject to the comment on hedge accounting below) and includes revised 
requirements  for  the  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  instruments,  revised  recognition  and  derecognition 
requirements for financial instruments and simplified requirements for hedge accounting.

Note   1
Statement of significant accounting policies
NICKELORE LIMITED 
ABN 13 086 972 429 
ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
Key changes made to this standard that may affect the Group on initial application include certain simplifications to the 
classification of financial assets, simplifications to the accounting of embedded derivatives, and the irrevocable election to 
recognise  gains  and  losses  on  investments  in  equity  instruments  that  are  not  held  for  trading  in  other  comprehensive 
income. 
The  Directors  anticipate  that  the  adoption  of  AASB  9  will  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial 
instruments.
ii.  AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018). 
When  effective,  this  Standard  will  replace  the  current  accounting  requirements  applicable  to  revenue  with  a  single, 
principles-based model. Except for a limited number of exceptions, including leases, the new revenue model in AASB 15 will 
apply to all contracts with customers as well as non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to 
facilitate sales to customers and potential customers. 
The  core  principle  of  the  Standard  is  that  an  entity  will  recognise  revenue  to  depict  the  transfer  of  promised  goods  or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange 
for the goods or services. To achieve this objective, AASB 15 provides the following five-step process:
Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 
Identify the performance obligations in the contract(s);
(1) 
(2) 
(3)  Determine the transaction price; 
(4)  Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and 
(5)  Recognise revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. 
This Standard will require retrospective restatement, as well as enhanced disclosures regarding revenue. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will not have a material impact on the Group’s revenue recognition 
and disclosures.
iii.  AASB 16: Leases (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019). 
AASB 16 removes the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for the lessee effectively treating 
all leases as finance leases. Short term leases (less than 12 months) and leases of a low value are exempt from the lease 
accounting requirements. Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will not have a material impact on the Group’s recognition of leases 
and disclosures).
iv.  AASB 2014-3: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations [AASB 1
& AASB 11]
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of interests in 
joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business. The amendments require:
(1)
(2)
the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in AASB 3 
Business Combinations, to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in AASB 3 and other 
Australian Accounting Standards except for those principles that conflict with the guidance in AASB 11; 
the acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards for business 
combinations
This Standard also makes an editorial correction to AASB 11. 
The  Directors  anticipate  that  the  adoption  of  these  amendments  will  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  financial 
statements.
v.  AASB 2014-9: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (AASB 2014-9
applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Early adoption permitted).
AASB 2014-9 amends AASB 127 Separate Financial Statements, and consequentially amends AASB 1 First-time Adoption of 
Australian Accounting Standards and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, to allow entities to use the 
equity  method  of  accounting  for  investments  in  subsidiaries,  joint  ventures  and  associates  in  their  separate  financial 
statements.  AASB 2014-9 also makes editorial corrections to AASB 127.

Potential deferred tax assets attributable to tax losses and exploration expenditure carried forward have not been brought 
to account at 30 June 2016 because the directors do not believe it is appropriate to regard realisation of the deferred tax 
assets as probable at this point in time. These benefits will only be obtained if: 
i.
the Company derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the 
deductions for the loss and exploration expenditure to be realised; 
the company continues to comply with conditions for deductibility imposed by law; and
ii. 
iii.  no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Company in realising the benefit from the deductions for the loss and
exploration expenditure.
Should the Company successfully complete the acquisition of Helio, it is likely the tax losses attributed to the Company 
noted above will be lost as a result of the proposed significant changes in ownership and in the operations of the Company.

i.  The Company is in a loss making position and it is unlikely that the conversion to, calling of, or subscription for, ordinary 
share capital in respect of potential ordinary shares would lead to diluted earnings per share that shows an inferior view 
of the earnings per share. Therefore in the event the Company has dilutionary equity instruments on issue, the diluted 
loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2016 is the same as basic loss per share, whilst the  Company remains loss 
making.

b.  Capital Management

Capital management policy

they  can  provide  returns  for  shareholders  and  benefits  for  other  stakeholders  and  to  maintain  an  optimal  capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital.
As the Company incurs net cash outflows from operations and has large accumulated losses, the primary method used 
to adjust its capital structure is the issue of new shares. The Company has determined that where possible it will issue 
ordinary  shares  to  avoid  any  restrictions  on  its  use  of  capital  or  commit  to  interest  payments.  There  have  been  no 
changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital of the Company since the prior year.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements.

a.  Specific Financial Risk Exposures and Management
The  main  risk  the  Company  is  exposed  to  through  its  financial  instruments  are  credit  risk,  liquidity  risk  and  market  risk 
consisting of interest rate, foreign currency risk and equity price risk.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. 
The Board adopts practices designed to identify significant areas of business risk and to effectively manage those risks in 
accordance with the Company's risk profile. This includes assessing, monitoring and managing risks for the Company and 
setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The Company is not of a size nor is its affairs of such complexity to justify the 
establishment  of  a  formal  system  for  risk  management  and  associated  controls.  Instead,  the  Board  approves  all 
expenditure,  is  intimately  acquainted  with  all  operations  and  discuss  all  relevant  issues  at  the  Board  meetings.  The 
operational  and  other  compliance  risk  management  have  also  been  assessed  and  found  to  be  operating  efficiently  and 
effectively.
i.  Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract 
obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Company. 
The Company does not have any material credit risk exposure to any single receivable or group of receivables under 
financial instruments entered into by the Company.
Credit risk exposures 
The  credit  risk  on  financial  assets,  excluding  investments,  of  the  Company  which  have  been  recognised  in  the 
Statement of Financial Position, is the carrying amount, net of any provision for doubtful debts.
Credit risk related to balances with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Company in accordance 
with  approved  Board  policy.  Such  policy  requires  that  surplus  funds  are  only  invested  with  financial  institutions 
residing in Australia, where ever possible.

ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2016
Impairment losses 
None of the Company's financial assets are past due (2015: $nil). There has been no allowance for impairment in 
respect of the financial assets of the Company during this year.
ii.  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise 
meeting its obligations related to financial liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring sufficient 
cash and marketable securities are available to meet the current and future commitments of the Company. Due to the 
nature  of  the  Company's  activities,  being  mineral  exploration,  the  Company  does  not  have  ready  access  to  credit 
facilities, with the primary source of funding being equity raisings. The Board of Directors constantly monitor the state 
of equity markets in conjunction with the Company's current and future funding requirements, with a view to initiating 
appropriate capital raisings as required. Any surplus funds are invested with major financial institutions.
The  financial  liabilities  of  the  Company  are  confined  to  trade  and  other  payables  as  disclosed  in  the  statement  of 
financial position. All trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and due within 30 days of the reporting date.
iii.  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will 
affect  the  Company's  income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of  financial  instruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk 
management  is  to  manage  and  control  market  risk  exposures  within  acceptable  parameters,  while  optimising  the 
return.
(1)  Interest rate risk
Exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  arises  on  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  recognised  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting period whereby a future change in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed 
rate financial instruments. The Company is also exposed to earnings volatility on floating rate instruments.
Interest rate risk is not material to the Company as no debt arrangements have been entered into, and movement 
in interest rates on the Company's financial assets is not material.
(2)  Foreign exchange risk
Exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  may  result  in  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument 
fluctuating  due  to  movement  in  foreign  exchange  rates  of  currencies  in  which  the  Company  holds  financial 
instruments which are other than the AUD functional currency of the Company. The Board current assesses the 
Company's exposure to foreign exchange risk as immaterial.
(3)  Price risk
Price risk relates to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in market prices. The Company is exposed to securities price risk on investments held for trading or for 
medium to longer terms.
The investment in listed equities has been valued at the market price prevailing at balance date. Management of 
this investment's price risk is by ongoing monitoring of the value with respect to any impairment.
iv.  Sensitivity Analysis
(1)  Interest rates
The  following  table  illustrates  sensitivities  to  the  Company's  exposures  to  changes  in  interest  rates.  The  table 
indicates the impact on how profit and equity values reported at balance sheet date would have been affected by 
changes  in  the  relevant  risk  variable  that  management  considers  to  be  reasonably  possible.  These  sensitivities 
assume that the movement in a particular variable is independent of other variables.
A change of 50 basis points in the interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and 
profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

The Board is responsible for evaluating the performance of the 
Board and individual directors on an annual basis. It may do so 
with the aid of an independent advisor. The process for this can 
be  found 
in  Schedule  6  of  the  Company's  Corporate 
Governance Plan. .
(b)  The Company's Corporate Governance Plan requires the Board 
to  disclosure  whether  or  not  performance  evaluations  were 
conducted during the relevant reporting period.  
Due to the size of the Board and the nature of the business, it 
has  not  been  deemed  necessary  to 
institute  a  formal 
documented  performance  review  program  of  individuals. 
However,  the  Chairman  intends  to  conduct  formal  reviews 
each financial year whereby the performance of the Board as a 
whole  and  the  individual  contributions  of  each  director  are 
disclosed.  The  Board  considers  that  at  this  stage  of  the 
Company's development an informal process is appropriate. 
The review will assist to indicate if the Board's performance is 
appropriate and efficient with respect to the Board Charter. 
The  Board  regularly  reviews  its  skill  base  and  whether  it 
remains appropriate for the Company's operational, legal and 
financial  requirements.  New  Directors  are  obliged  to 
participate in the Company's induction process, which provides 
a comprehensive understanding of the Company, its objectives 
and the market in which the Company operates. 
Directors  are  encourages  to  avail  themselves  of  resources 
required to fulfil the performance of their duties. 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  performance  of 
senior  executives.  The  Board 
is  to  arrange  an  annual 
performance evaluation of the senior executives.
(a)
(b)  The Company's Corporate Governance Plan requires the Board 
to  conduct  annual  performance  of  the  senior  executives. 
Schedule  6  'Performance  Evaluation'  requires  the  Board  to 
disclose  whether  or  not  performance  evaluations  were 
conducted during the relevant reporting period.  
During the financial year an evaluation of performance of the 
individuals  was  not  formally  carried  out.  However,  a general 
review of the individuals occurs on an on-going basis to ensure 
that  structures  suitable  to  the  Company's  status  as  a  listed 
entity are in place.
(a)  Due  to  the  size  and  nature  of  the  existing  Board  and  the 
magnitude  of  the  Company's  operations  the  Company 
currently  has  no  Nomination  Committee.  Pursuant  to  clause 
4(h) of the Company's Board Charter, the full Board carries out 
the duties that would ordinarily be assigned to the Nomination 
Committee  under  the  written  terms  of  reference  for  that 
committee. 
The  duties  of  the  Nomination  Committee  are  outlined  in 
Schedule  5  of  the  Company's  Corporate  Governance  Plan 
available online on the Company's website.  
The  Board  devotes  time  at  board  meetings  to  discuss  board 
succession issues. All members of the Board are involved in the 
Company's  nomination  process,  to  the  maximum  extent 
permitted under the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules.  
The Board regularly updates the Company's board skills matrix 
(in  accordance  with  recommendation  2.2)  to  assess  the 
appropriate  balance  of  skills,  experience,  independence  and 
knowledge of the entity.

looking to achieve in its membership.
Recommendation 2.3 
A listed entity should disclose: 
(a)
the names of the directors considered by the board to be 
independent directors; 
if  a  director  has  an  interest,  position,  association  or 
relationship  of  the  type  described  in  Box  2.3  of  the  ASX 
Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendation (3rd 
Edition),  but  the  board  is  of  the  opinion  that  it  does  not 
compromise the independence of the director, the nature of 
the interest, position, association or relationship in question 
and an explanation of why the board is of that opinion; and 
the length of service of each director
(b)
(c)
Recommendation 2.4 
A majority of the board of a listed entity should be independent 
directors.
