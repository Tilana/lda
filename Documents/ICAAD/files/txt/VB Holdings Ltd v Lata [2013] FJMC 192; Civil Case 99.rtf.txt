2.      
Triable Issues

2.1     
Who caused the accident? 

2.2

What was the quantum of damage caused to the 1st Defendant's vehicle? 

2.5

2.6

5] On 28th May 2012, the plaintiff's case was led. Thereafter the defendant moved adjournment and defendant's case was fixed on 13th June 2012. It was fixed for continuation of hearing on 20th February 2013. On that date nor defendants or his counsel were present. Matter was fixed for judgment today. 

6] On behalf of the Plaintiff, Mr. Esala Drova Ravonokula gave evidence. On 14th May 2009, he drove FM 944, a prison vehicle. It was leased from V.B. Holdings Ltd by prison department. It met with an accident at Makoi. When he was driving towards Suva from Makoi, a truck came from left side and truck collided his vehicle. The accident happened middle of the road. Though he applied brakes it happened. He then reported the matter to the police. He was never charged for this incident. 

7] in cross examination he said he was driving a Hino truck and he was coming down on a slope, speed was 50kmph. There were two lanes he was inside lane close to the middle. He said the truck came suddenly at Munikoso Junction. The point of impact was the back part of the carrier. The witness said there was a bus travelling at the outer lane at that time. The defendants suggested that he was speeding but witness denied it. 

8] The next witness was Jainendra Govind.He said he is working for QBE. There was a claim for $26,761.49. Access charges were $750. He said they paid that claim. The witness tendered following documents in his evidence. 

PEX-1A is Visitation and assessment fess that was paid by the Plaintiff $146.25
PEX 1B is the service quotation from Niranjans for $27761.49. 
PEX 2 is Memorandum of Agreement and the agreed amount to pay was $27761.49, including access fee. 
PEX3 is the police report. 
PEX-4 is to prove the ownership of the 1st Defendant. 
PEX-5A and 5B are Demand notices to the defendants from the plaintiff. Which the defendants failed to honor the demand. 
PEX-6 is Bailiff Charges of $200, issued by Shamedra Kumar.

9] In cross examination the witness said Mr Esala was driving the prison department vehicle at the time of incident and they paid bill to Niranjans. 

10] The Plaintiff closed their case. The defendant failed to call any evidence.

11] The defendants denial is based on negligence of the driver of FM 944. The driver of FM 944, Esala gave evidence. He said while he was driving the 2nd defendant suddenly came to the main road without due diligence and care. There was a bus proceeding to the same side and FM 944 hit the carrier of the 2nd Defendant's. PEX-4 shows the first Defendant is the owner of CU270. The second defendant was driving and acting as master and servant basis and therefore first defendant is liable to pay said sum under vicarious liability. The defendant tried to prove negligence of the Plaintiff's driver, Mr Esala. But PEX-3 Traffic Officer says;

"On the above date, time and place PW1 was coming back from Nakasi to go back to Naboro Prison. Upon reaching Muanikoso Junction accused was about to come out from Muanikoso Junction to the main Kings Road, Pw1 then put the horn for accused to stop as it was too late for him to apply the brake. Accused did not stop and just suddenly came out from the junction. As the result Pw1 bumped accused and accused bumped another vehicle. Three vehicles received damages. The vehicle registration number CU 270 was at fault.

On the same day the driver of vehicle registration number CU270 was brought in to the station, interviewed and charged for Careless Driving" 

12] This report confirms the evidence of Mr. Esala. The 2nd defendant, without caring other road users, suddenly entered the main road and it caused the damages to the plaintiff's vehicle. PEX-2B quotation gives the quantum of damage and it proves excessive damage has been done to the Plaintiff's vehicle. PEX-2A proves that they agreed to pay the amount which arose by negligent act of the second defendant. 

13] The defendant did not call any evidence. In the light of the evidence it is proved that damages have been done and quantum of damages has also been proved. I hold the Plaintiff proved their case balance of probabilities. 

14] I answer triable issues as follows; 

"        
Who caused the accident? The second defendant

"        
Was there negligence on the part of the 2nd Defendant or on the part of the Plaintiff's authorized driver as set out in the respective pleadings? Negligence was on the second defendant

"        
What was the quantum of damaged caused to the Plaintiff's vehicle? $27,664.74

"        
What was the quantum of damage caused to the 1st Defendant's vehicle? Yes

"        
Is the Plaintiff entitled to recover for damage sustained? Yes

"
