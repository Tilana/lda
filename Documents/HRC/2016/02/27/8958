</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Afghanistan is engulfed in an armed conflict in which unacceptably high numbers of 
civilians are killed every day. An estimated 2,118 civilians were killed as a result of armed 
conflict in 2008, nearly 40 per cent more than were recorded in 2007. Not all of these deaths are 
unavoidable. Civilians face daily insecurity, and their most everyday tasks bring the risk of 
death. They are assassinated by the Taliban, or shot near checkpoints and convoys by Afghan or 
international soldiers. They are blown up in reckless Taliban suicide attacks carried out in public 
places, or killed in poorly planned or disproportionate airstrikes by international forces. Or they 
are the victims of false tips and killed in house raids by international intelligence services for 
which no Government or military command takes responsibility. 
</p>
<p> The concern of the Special Rapporteur during his fact-finding mission to Afghanistan in 
May 2008 was to understand how and why these killings are happening, and to formulate 
recommendations directed at reducing civilian casualties, however or by whomever they are 
caused. To achieve that, the Special Rapporteur adopted a civilian-centric view of the conflict 
and sought to understand how the tactics of each side lead to civilian deaths, how conduct by one 
side increases the likelihood of killings of civilians by the other, and how civilians are trapped in 
a struggle to avoid military confrontations. Each of the military actors in the conflict shifts blame 
to the other for civilian deaths. The truth, however, is that the Taliban, Afghan forces and 
international military forces all bear responsibility for unlawful killings, and each bears 
responsibility for reducing the numbers of civilians killed in the conflict. 
</p>
<p> In relation to the many killings perpetrated by the Taliban, its leadership should issue clear 
orders calling upon its fighters to respect human rights and humanitarian law, particularly with a 
view to ending the use of human shields, the assassination of civilians and the use of suicide 
attacks, which result in a disproportionate number of civilian casualties. Human rights 
proponents should engage in dialogue with the leadership in an effort to promote these 
objectives. This is common in internal conflicts and armed insurgencies throughout the world, 
and Afghanistan should be no exception. 
</p>
<p> With respect to killings by Afghan and international forces, it is necessary that the forces 
review procedures for conducting air strikes and raids. More effective procedures for reliably 
vetting targets should be developed, and the forces should ensure that their methods of attack do 
not result in civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the military advantage. In 
addition, significantly more attention needs to be paid by the international forces to promoting 
transparency and accountability in their operations and investigations. Estimates of civilian 
casualties in the conflict should be made publicly available. Furthermore, the international forces 
should ensure that Afghans can readily obtain information on the progress of investigations and 
prosecutions of killings. Military operations should not be permitted by unaccountable foreign 
intelligence personnel. 
</p>
<p> The compensation programmes of Government and international forces have resulted in 
many Afghans receiving compensation for their losses. These programmes can be improved, 
however, particularly through better coordination and more routine application. Furthermore, 
commanders should proactively seek out victims and families, and the design of programmes 
should take into account the particular obstacles women face in having access to them. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> In addition to conflict-related killings, the Special Rapporteur also addresses unlawful 
killings that occur in a law enforcement or private context, or that are due to deficiencies in the 
criminal justice system. First, Afghans are unlawfully killed by police and other armed personnel 
acting under the authority of Government officials. Rarely are these incidents seriously 
investigated by the Government. As police reform efforts go forward, it is crucial that the focus 
be on creating a truly national police force, and that the links between police, militias and 
particular tribes and politicians be broken. Second, a significant number of Afghans, especially 
women, are the victims of so-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221;. The State largely fails to investigate and 
prosecute these murders. Third, generally, the criminal justice system is deeply flawed, and 
corruption and incompetence are widespread. Powerful or wealthy perpetrators are set free. 
There is a pressing need for action to be taken against serious cases of corruption by Government 
officials, as a first step in reducing the corruption that plagues the system. Fourth, the flaws in 
the criminal justice system mean that the likelihood that innocent people are sentenced to death 
is high. For reasons of justice and international law, a moratorium should be imposed on the 
carrying out of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p> Far too many civilians in Afghanistan have experienced conflict and brutality for much of 
their lives. Many have lost multiple family members in successive conflicts. Afghans deserve far 
better. The message of the present report is that a great many of the killings that are now 
occurring in Afghanistan can be prevented. The Government of Afghanistan, the international 
forces and the Taliban should take urgent action to reduce the staggering rates at which civilians 
are unnecessarily and unlawfully killed in Afghanistan. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>1. Afghanistan is experiencing armed conflict across a broad swath of its territory. In legal 
terms, this is a non-international armed conflict between the Government, supported by 
international military forces (IMF), and various armed groups.<b>1</b> The Government&#8217;s forces include 
the Afghan National Army (ANA), which works closely with the international forces, the 
Afghan National Police (ANP), a fragmented organization that bears the brunt of the 
insurgency&#8217;s anti-government violence, and the National Directorate of Security (NDS), an 
Afghan intelligence service which conducts its own operations in addition to passing information 
to other national and international actors. The international military forces are divided into the 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which plays a counterinsurgency role and itself 
consists of a number of national contingents commanded by NATO (since August 2003), and 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which plays a counterterrorism role and is led by the 
United States. The armed groups against which these national and international forces are 
arrayed exhibit varying degrees of coordination and integration and are widely referred to as &#8220;the 
Taliban&#8221;, although they are sometimes referred to as &#8220;anti-government elements&#8221; (AGEs).<b>2</b> 
While extrajudicial executions committed in the context of the armed conflict are the primary 
focus of this report, independent causes of unlawful killings rooted in the systems of policing 
and criminal justice are also addressed. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The &#8220;international&#8221; armed conflict in Afghanistan began on 7 October 2001 (the date of the 
</p>
<p>US led invasion of the country), and is usually considered to have ended with the establishment 
of the transitional Afghan Government in June 2002. From that date, the armed conflict became 
of a &#8220;non-international&#8221; character inasmuch as the international forces are fighting on behalf of 
the Government. 
<b>2
</b>  It may also be noted that there are a range of armed opposition groups that tend to be referred 
</p>
<p>to collectively as &#8220;Taliban&#8221; by locals and foreigners alike. (Although, this recognition is part of 
why the term &#8220;anti-government elements&#8221; (AGEs) is increasingly used.). The relationships 
between these groups are not always clear. Some groups may work in alliances, but the extent of 
cooperation implied may remain unclear. Similarly, the leaders of some originally independent 
groups may have been incorporated into the Taliban&#8217;s leadership <i>shura</i>, but the extent to which 
this implies actual coordination or obedience to the dictates of Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, 
may nevertheless be difficult to discern. The views of informed interlocutors on the extent of this 
diversity and its implications for civilian protection varied. Some contended that speaking of 
&#8220;the Taliban&#8221; was a solecism and that there were too many distinct chains-of-command for 
efforts to influence &#8220;the Taliban&#8221; to be sensible or meaningful. Other interlocutors suggested that 
Taliban are well-known for obeying orders from the top and that the <i>Layeha</i> and the rule against 
beheading civilians, including those working for the government, had been followed across large 
parts of Afghanistan, meaning that pressure on the leadership of the core Taliban could be 
productive and that focusing on subtle variation between groups and factions obscures more than 
it reveals. This report is agnostic as to the relative merits of these perspectives. I will refer 
throughout to &#8220;the Taliban&#8221; for the simple reasons that this is the general usage and that few of 
those victims and witnesses with whom I spoke were capable of pin-pointing the affiliations of 
the perpetrators of any particular incident. </p>

</p>
<p><b>II.  CONFLICT-RELATED KILLINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Adopting a civilian-centric perspective 
</b></p>
<p>2. Afghanistan is not an easy country in which to be a civilian. Everyday activities are life 
threatening, and civilians are killed by all sides to the conflict. My concern is to reduce all 
unlawful killings, however or by whomever they are committed. This requires an assessment of 
how all parties to the conflict can modify their conduct so as to reduce the insecurity the war 
poses to the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>3. The violence experienced by Afghan civilians is quite different from that experienced by 
others in Afghanistan. Although the Taliban may draw some distinctions, expatriates are targeted 
by insurgents largely regardless of their individual conduct, and they are generally protected or at 
least left alone by the Government and international forces. Thus, expatriates experience 
violence as unilateral and indiscriminate and look upon security largely as a matter of physical 
protection (e.g., walled compounds) and physical avoidance (e.g., not driving into an area known 
for roadside bombs). In contrast, the typical Afghan civilian in a conflict-affected area 
experiences violence and pressure from all sides.<b>3</b> The most visible aspects of the conflict are the 
military engagements between the parties: raids on compounds suspected of housing insurgents, 
air strikes on suspected Taliban encampments, suicide attacks on military convoys, ambushes 
and armed confrontations, and so on. In this aspect of the conflict, civilians are seldom 
deliberately targeted but they may be killed as &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; or targeted based on false 
information that they are combatants. 
</p>
<p>4. In the following analysis, consideration is given to: (i) military tactics employed by each 
side which may lead directly to civilian deaths; (ii) the behaviours or methods of warfare adopted 
by one side which can affect the behaviour of the other side, and exacerbate civilian killings; and 
(iii) the competition for civilian support. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Military operations 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Air strikes and human shielding 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 2008, 64% of civilian casualties (552 people) caused by pro-Government forces were 
due to air strikes and close air support for troops in contact with Taliban fighters. These deaths 
have galvanized widespread outrage against international military action. Civilian casualties may 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  One example of conflating the security situations of Afghans with that of internationals is the 
</p>
<p>frequent references to the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) access map as 
providing meaningful insights into the general level of violence in a given region. But UNDSS 
personnel stressed to me the limited purpose of that map and its inadequacy as a recorder or 
predictor on other issues. Thus, threats to the civilian population should be assessed 
independently from threats to expatriates. Civilian protection efforts must be guided by analytic 
tools specific to that purpose. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>result from attacks on those mistakenly believed to be combatants, or because of collateral 
damage. IHL provides that attacks on legitimate military objectives may be lawful even when 
they result in civilian deaths, as long as they are proportional.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. These rules also apply in situations such as that in Kunar province, where the Taliban fires 
rockets from residential areas directed at international forces bases and the latter then respond by 
firing back at the source. I heard no claim that the international forces deliberately held the 
civilian population accountable for these attacks, but the perception was that their responses 
displayed insufficient concern for civilian casualties. One official opined that while the local 
people did not &#8220;support&#8221; the AGEs they were in no position to interfere when armed men 
decided to fire from the area. He stated that for the international forces to return fire served no 
useful military purpose inasmuch as the AGEs would slip away immediately after firing and 
return across the border to Pakistan. The international forces have procedures for vetting targets 
and selecting an appropriate method of attack. I was not provided specifics on procedures, and 
am in no position to assess their formal compliance with international law. But regardless of the 
written procedures, it is not clear that sufficient caution is shown <i>in practice</i> to ensure that 
attacks are not indiscriminate and that civilian casualties will not be excessive in relation to the 
military advantage anticipated. 
</p>
<p>7. IHL also requires each party to the conflict to take certain steps to limit the risk to civilians 
of attacks by the opposing party.<b>5</b> These requirements are routinely disregarded by the Taliban. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  With respect to the proportionality requirement, the &#8220;expected&#8221; resulting &#8220;incidental loss of 
</p>
<p>civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof&#8221; must not be 
&#8220;excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated&#8221; (Jean-Marie 
Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i> (2005) 
(hereinafter, ICRC Study), Rule 14). With respect to the required precautions in carrying out an 
attack, the general rule is that &#8220;constant care&#8221; and &#8220;[a]ll feasible precautions&#8221; must be taken &#8220;to 
avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and 
damage to civilian objects&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 15). This general rule is supplemented by a 
number of more specific rules. These include rules requiring that a party to the conflict make the 
&#8220;choice of means and methods of warfare&#8221; such as to minimize such harm to civilians (ICRC 
Study, Rule 17), do &#8220;everything feasible to assess&#8221; whether the proportionality requirement will 
be satisfied (ICRC Study, Rule 18), and &#8220;give effective advance warning of attacks which may 
affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 20). 
Furthermore, even as an operation is underway, there is an obligation to do &#8220;everything feasible 
to cancel or suspend an attack if it becomes apparent&#8221; that the target is not a military objective or 
that the proportionality requirement would not be satisfied (ICRC Study, Rule 19). On the issue 
of verifying that the target is a legitimate military objective, the rule is that each &#8220;party to the 
conflict must do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives&#8221; (ICRC study, 
Rule 16). 
<b>5
</b>  Customary international humanitarian law prohibits &#8220;the use of human shields&#8221; (ICRC Study, 
</p>
<p>Rule 97) meaning the &#8220;intentional collocation of military objectives and civilians or persons <i>hors 
de combat</i> with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives&#8221; 
(ICRC Study, Rule 97, discussion p. 340). In addition to this prohibition, each party also has 
various affirmative obligations. There is a general obligation to &#8220;take all feasible precautions to 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>While there are cases in which Taliban fighters have warned civilians to leave an area prior to an 
attack, I received multiple witness accounts of the Taliban intentionally using civilians as 
&#8220;human shields&#8221; to deter attacks on their forces. In some instances, the Taliban have launched 
rocket-propelled attacks at IMF bases, convoys or other military targets from civilian compounds 
and villages, thereby making it difficult for international forces to respond militarily - via return 
fire or air strike - without causing civilian casualties or damaging civilian objects. Human 
shielding is also employed when the Taliban are in direct military engagement with international 
ground forces, and fire upon soldiers from homes or compounds. In this situation, the presence 
of civilians within the compound - generally a family or group of families - has been used by the 
insurgents to deter return fire from international or ANA ground forces located nearby.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The Taliban also sometimes hide from the IMF in civilian homes. Witnesses in Kandahar, 
for example, told me that it was common in certain areas for the Taliban to ask families to hide 
them within their homes and compounds. One woman recounted how her relatives refused to do 
so, and asked the Taliban not to enter, saying that they feared being killed in potential cross-fire. 
But the Taliban entered the home by force. In the absence of direct military engagement such 
actions are less likely to lead to civilian casualties, but in other circumstances endangerment will 
occur and various binding IHL obligations will be violated. 
</p>
<p>9. The Taliban should end the use of human shields and avoid locating its forces in areas 
populated by civilians. Nonetheless, Taliban usage of human shields does not affect the 
international forces&#8217; obligation to ensure that air strikes do not cause a loss of civilian life 
excessive in relation to the military advantage of killing the targeted fighters. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Raids 
</b></p>
<p>10. Night-time raids on housing compounds are routinely used by the international forces to 
capture individuals suspected of links to the Taliban. The international forces generally conduct 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control against the effects of 
attacks&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 22). The specific implications of this rule in the context of 
non-international armed conflicts are open to some interpretation; however, the rules required in 
international armed conflicts provide guidance. These rules include that each party must &#8220;to the 
extent feasible, avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas&#8221; (ICRC 
Study, Rule 23) and &#8220;to the extent feasible, remove civilian persons and objects under its control 
from the vicinity of military objectives&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 24). 
<b>6
</b>  For instance, one witness with whom I spoke in Kandahar lost 17 family members in an 
</p>
<p>airstrike when the Taliban used his home to launch attacks on the international forces. During the 
evening, 15-20 Taliban insurgents came to the witness&#8217;s home, armed with AK-47s and rockets. 
The witness noticed airplanes flying overhead. Some of the Taliban told the family members to 
hide them, and others fired at the planes. They would not let the family leave the house. The 
witness told me that his sister-in-law begged the Taliban to stop firing at the planes from the 
home, fearing the planes would drop bombs on the family while attempting to strike the 
insurgents. Shortly after, she took her children out into the courtyard believing it would be safer, 
but they were all killed in the ensuing air strike. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>a raid in one of two ways.<b>7</b> The most common method, employed without any prior warning or 
request to enter, is to blow off a housing compound&#8217;s door with explosives. The other method is 
to land on a roof in a helicopter and then climb down into the house on ladders. Night raids are 
always dangerous for civilians. Many Afghans keep guns for personal protection from criminals, 
and to assure their self-protection within their own homes and compounds. Given that it is 
common for people to sleep with guns due to fear of intruders and local attackers, there is a high 
likelihood that they will fire on anyone, including troops, breaking down the compound&#8217;s door at 
night. The results can be devastating.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Raids must be conducted in accordance with the stringent safeguards required by 
international human rights and humanitarian law.<b>9</b> A commander in the international forces with 
whom I spoke defended surprise night raids as the safest available method, because sleeping men 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  During raids, the international forces are often accompanied by ANA units, and, in many 
</p>
<p>cases, ANP forces will secure the perimeter. In some areas, the NDS will perform prior 
surveillance. There are also raids conducted directly by the Afghan security forces, including the 
NDS. While the NDS collects and analyses intelligence, it also has as operational dimension. 
NDS officials informed me that they are authorized to conduct arrest operations and do so, 
especially in the areas of counterterrorism, organized crime, and counter-espionage. I did not 
gather information on the conduct of these raids. 
<b>8
</b>  The most common complaints that I heard regarding night raids fall outside my mandate - that 
</p>
<p>they are an invasion of privacy and the sanctity of a family&#8217;s home, and result in women being 
treated inappropriately by foreigners. Many Afghans with whom I spoke indicated that these 
were some of their greatest concerns with respect to the conduct of the IMF, and expressed a 
strong desire for more cross-cultural training for the IMF, and for raids to be led by Afghan 
forces. 
<b>9
</b>  The applicable body of law will depend on a raid&#8217;s objective. If the raid is targeting a 
</p>
<p>legitimate military objective, such as a combatant, then the raid is primarily governed by the 
same IHL governing other attacks, including rules and principles pertaining to verification of the 
target, proportionality, precautions in attack, and military necessity (<i>see</i> note 4). Thus, for 
example, when the IMF plans a raid, &#8220;everything feasible&#8221; must be done &#8220;to verify&#8221; that the 
target is a military objective (ICRC Study, Rule 16). And, in choosing the means and methods of 
conducting a military raid or detaining a combatant, the IMF must &#8220;take all feasible precautions&#8221; 
with a &#8220;view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life&#8221; (ICRC 
Study, Rule 17), and must &#8220;do everything feasible to assess whether the attack may be expected 
to cause incidental loss of civilian life &#8230; which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 18). If the raid&#8217;s target is not a 
legitimate military objective - e.g., if the target is a civilian who is not directly participating in 
hostilities - the operation is governed by international human rights law. In a law enforcement 
context, lethal force may be used only when it is clear that an individual is about to kill someone 
(making lethal force proportionate) and there is no other available means of detaining him or her 
(making lethal force necessary). (<i>See </i>A/61/311, paras. 33-45; Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, Principle 9; Code of Conduct for Law 
Enforcement Officials, art. 3.) </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4

</p>
<p>could be apprehended before they had a chance to respond with violence. But Afghans with 
whom I spoke maintained that such raids unnecessarily endangered the targeted individual&#8217;s 
relatives and gave examples in which they believed that the target could readily have been 
captured in a less dangerous manner.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Raids for which no Government or military command appears ready to acknowledge 
responsibility are especially problematic. In January 2008, two brothers were killed in a raid in 
Kandahar City led by international personnel. Well-informed Government officials confirmed 
that the victims had no connection to the Taliban. Despite clear indications of international 
involvement no international military commander would admit that his soldiers were involved. 
</p>
<p>13. I also examined raids in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces involving international and 
Afghan forces. The identity of the international forces has yet to be confirmed. In Nangarhar the 
Afghan forces were probably the Shaheen Unit working with armed international personnel and 
in Kandahar the Afghans were working with international forces out of the Ghecko military base. 
The Minister of Defense, the head of NDS and ANA commanders confirmed that these force did 
not fall under their command. It is virtually certain that some or all of these units are led by 
personnel belonging to international intelligence services. The result is that, in the name of 
restoring the rule of law, heavily-armed internationals and their Afghan counterparts are 
wandering around conducting raids that too often result in killings and being held accountable by

<p><b>3.  Intelligence gathering and false tips 
</b></p>
<p>14. While air strikes and raids on legitimate military objectives cause many civilian casualties, 
too many attacks also target civilians who are mistakenly believed to be combatants.<b>11</b> This seem 
to happen because the IMF were too hasty in concluding that suspicious activity was connected 
to the Taliban and too credulous in interpreting information provided by civilians. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  For example, witnesses to raids and family members of suspects suggested that suspects could 
</p>
<p>have been picked up from their place of work or while walking to work, where women and 
children would be at significantly less risk of being exposed to the threat or use of force. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  Pursuant to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed 
conflicts, attacks may only be directed at legitimate military objectives (ICRC Study, Rule 7). In 
addition to certain objects (<i>see </i>ICRC Study, Rule 8), legitimate military objectives may include 
combatants and civilians taking a direct part in hostilities (ICRC Study, Rules 1, 6). Combatants 
are &#8220;members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict&#8221; (excluding those forces&#8217; &#8220;medical 
and religious personnel&#8221;) (ICRC Study, Rule 3). Many of those who belong to or are aligned 
with a party to the conflict - whether the Government or an armed opposition group - are neither 
combatants nor would be considered to be directly participating in hostilities while carrying out 
their roles. (When an individual is a civilian immune from attack, this does not mean that they 
may not be detained for violations of national law; however, the rules governing such law 
enforcement operations are principally provided by international human rights law rather than by 
international humanitarian law.)<b> </b></p>

<p>15. A number of civilians from conflict-affected areas with whom I spoke - including elders, 
witnesses to specific incidents, and the family members of victims - alleged that the international 
forces&#8217; ignorance of local practices sometimes resulted in civilians being targeted based on only 
superficially suspicious conduct.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Residents of communities struck by the IMF often complained that attacks had been 
undertaken on the basis of fabricated information provided by individuals pursuing personal 
grudges.<b>13</b> Numerous Government officials also claimed that civilian casualties had often been 
caused by international forces acting on false tips. One governor stated that there were people in 
his province who make a business of acting as intermediaries who would give false tips to the 
international forces in return for payment from individuals holding grudges. A number of 
security officials raised the issue in more general terms.<b>14</b> Civilians from conflict-affected areas

</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  I heard multiple accounts of individuals who were irrigating fields at night - a common 
</p>
<p>practice to prevent the evaporation of scarce water - being targeted by ground forces and in air 
strikes. The witnesses believed that these killings took place because international forces had 
jumped to the conclusion that a man moving about at night must be an insurgent. I received 
similar allegations about persons targeted while traveling at night (in one case, the individual 
was going to a hospital to obtain medication for a woman who had gone into labor) and others 
who were camping in remote areas because they were engaged in herding or road construction. 
Elders and other witnesses also claimed that international forces would misinterpret guns carried 
for self-defense as demonstrating that an individual was an insurgent and explosives possessed 
for road construction or gemstone mining - a significant industry in Nuristan - as evidence that 
an individual was involved in producing roadside bombs. One witness pleaded that the 
international forces should look at the ground reality in the area: &#8220;We are poor, we graze sheep, 
we have emergencies and need to walk at night - but we cannot.&#8221; 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  An elder from Nuristan accused a district governor of feeding false information to 
international forces leading them to raid his local opponents. An elder from the Korengal Valley 
in Kunar asserted that &#8220;resistance&#8221; to the Government was stimulated by an IMF attack on the 
home of a prominent local leader. No compensation was provided and the leader responded by 
aligning himself with AGEs and facilitating attacks on the international forces. A witness from 
the Ghani Khel district of Nangarhar described a similar incident based on false information. An 
individual from the Maywand district of Kandahar claimed that Afghan interpreters for the 
international forces would extort money by threatening to label as Taliban those who would not 
pay. Air strikes and raids would follow. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  One senior official who claimed that reports of civilian casualties were frequently exaggerated 
stated that sometimes local residents genuinely perceived the victims as civilians involved in 
family feuds even when, in his view, those &#8220;feuds&#8221; were part and parcel of the conflict between 
the Taliban and the Government. </p>

</p>
<p>confirmed that there is a tendency for attacks on persons wrongly believed to belong to the 
Taliban to work as self-fulfilling prophecies when those targeted decide to cultivate some 
countervailing source of military support.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Understandably, the international forces do not detail why particular targets were selected. 
Publicly releasing the source of intelligence information would often be tantamount to imposing 
a death sentence on the source. But this also makes it extremely difficult to confirm the 
authenticity or otherwise of intelligence relied upon. This does not mean that the problem should 
be ignored.<b>16</b> Government officials at all levels repeatedly argued that tighter cooperation 
between the international forces and the NDS in vetting targets and planning operations was the 
surest path toward reducing civilian casualties caused by false tips.<b>17</b> The merits of corroborating 
intelligence with as many sources as possible were not disputed by international military 
commanders, although one characterized the NDS&#8217;s information as being more copious than 
reliable. 
</p>
<p>18. Existing procedures for ensuring that strikes targeting Taliban fighters are based on reliable 
information are insufficient to ensure respect for IHL requirements.<b>18</b> The current approach 
renders civilians vulnerable to attack and pushes personal and tribal rivals into opportunistic 
participation in the armed conflict.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  Similarly, several elders from Nuristan province stated that communities closely observe who 
</p>
<p>receives development assistance from the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and that 
those who do not receive assistance may come to fear that they are thought to be AGEs and thus 
flee the area rather than wait to be attacked. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  One witness whom I interviewed stated that, in his area, people trying to get their personal 
enemies attacked would sometimes go to the District Governor, but that he knew too much to 
believe their stories, would sometimes go to the Provincial Governor, but that he too was hard to 
persuade, and would then go to the international forces, who would conduct raids without 
adequately verifying the information received. 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  I discussed the existing coordination mechanisms with a number of Governors and security 
officials. While arrangements vary, typically there is a weekly meeting bringing together the 
Governor and senior representatives of the international forces, ANA, ANP, and NDS, among 
others. This weekly meeting is sometimes supported by a standing body of lower-level 
representatives. Called a Provincial Coordination Committee (PCC), similar mechanisms also 
exist at the regional level and, less often, at the district level. All concerned stated that whether 
these mechanisms work well depends largely on the personal relationships and trust among the 
participants, and many of the Government officials with whom I spoke stressed with concern that 
the international forces continued to conduct some operations without prior consultation.

<p><b>4.  Suicide attacks 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the four months prior to my visit, 214 of the estimated 381 civilians killed by the 
Taliban were killed in suicide attacks.<b>19</b> Both the number of suicide attacks and the number of 
civilians killed during such attacks have increased as the conflict has progressed: 2006 
(123 attacks; 237 killed), 2007 (160 attacks; 321 killed), first four months of 2008 
(34 attacks 214 killed).<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Taliban suicide attacks are often employed in a disproportionate or indiscriminate manner, 
and large numbers of civilians are injured or killed as a result. Because they are carried out 
through a suicide body-borne or vehicle-borne IED (&#8220;incendiary explosive device&#8221;) by 
insurgents who feign civilian status, Afghan and international forces are hard pressed to 
distinguish potential suicide bombers from civilians, leading to the accidental killing of civilians. 
</p>
<p>21. Suicide bombing, as a method of attack during an armed conflict, is not prohibited <i>per se</i>.<b>21</b> 
But a suicide attack violates IHL when it targets civilians, may be expected to result in 
disproportionate civilian casualties, or is carried out in a perfidious manner. 
</p>
<p>22. Data on suicide attacks from January 2007 to March 2008 indicates that 15% of attacks 
targeted civilians, including government officials, and thus violated IHL. In addition, many of 
the attacks on legitimate military objectives disregarded the principle of proportionality by 
taking place in public areas where there are large numbers of civilians. Thus, although the 
suicide attack may target an IMF convoy or a member of the ANA, large numbers of civilian 
bystanders are often wounded and killed in a manner wholly excessive to any possible 
anticipated military advantage. The organizers of such attacks simply fail to take all feasible 
precautions to minimize incidental loss of civilian life. The manner in which suicide attacks have 
been employed also appear to have become more reckless in recent years. 
</p>
<p>23. Many Taliban attacks also involve perfidy, a prohibited method of warfare.<b>22</b> The Taliban 
regularly violate the prohibition against perfidy by feigning a civilian or other protected status 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  UNDSS recorded 381 civilian casualties during the first four months of 2008 (214 of these 
</p>
<p>were a result of suicide attacks).<b>

<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  Just as it does not violate humanitarian law for a Taliban fighter to drive up to a checkpoint 
and shoot at a soldier, it does not violate humanitarian law for a Taliban fighter to drive up to a 
checkpoint and blow up both the soldier and himself. 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Perfidy is a deception that is designed to lead one party to the conflict to believe that they 
must accord protected status to an enemy. AP 1; ICC. And see J Ashley Roach, &#8220;Ruses and 
Perfidy Deception During Armed Conflict&#8221;, 23 U. Tol. L. Rev. 395 (1991-1992). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4

</p>
<p>for the purpose of carrying out suicide attacks. The Taliban&#8217;s perfidious acts render everyday 
activities for Afghan civilians highly dangerous. In addition to the deaths caused directly, perfidy 
affects the behaviour of international and Afghan troops vis-&#224;-vis Afghan civilians. In this way, 
violations by one side make it more difficult for the other side to comply with its legal 
obligations. Thus, in many situations the IMF will have no reliable way of assessing whether an 
unknown person approaching is a civilian, or a Taliban member intending to attack. This 
heightens the caution with which IMF soldiers approach ordinary Afghans, and necessitates the 
IMF taking precautions to protect themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Force protection  
</b></p>
<p>24. The risk posed to the lives of IMF/Afghan soldiers by perfidious attacks has led the 
international forces to instruct civilians to keep at a distance from convoys and patrols. 
Defensive measures by soldiers will generally not be taken against vehicles and civilians who 
maintain the required distance and who do not otherwise pose a threat. Self-defensive 
measures may be taken against those who get too close. However, even when force is used in 
self-defense, it must comply with IHL norms, and, although perfidious attacks may increase the 
likelihood of mistakes, they do not justify any lowering of these standards for resorting to lethal 
force. 
</p>
<p>25. Often the IMF or Afghan forces engaging in force protection act lawfully in self-defense. 
Sometimes, however, the evidence strongly suggests that IHL is violated. For example, on 
4 March 2007, a convoy of US soldiers was ambushed. One soldier was wounded when a 
vehicle-borne IED hit the convoy. The soldiers responded by killing 19 Afghans and wounding 
50 others in the space of a twenty kilometre retreat from the site of the suicide attack. A witness 
with whom I spoke saw the convoy approaching and pulled over to let it pass. But the convoy 
opened fire. He was shot and injured, and relatives in his vehicle were killed. A US military 
investigation concluded, without publicly providing any reasoned analysis, that the soldiers had 
acted appropriately.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Struggling for the loyalty of the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Neutrality 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Government and its international supporters need civilian support to build a strong 
state.<b>24</b> The Taliban similarly need civilian support. As the parties to the conflict compete for the

</p>
<p><b>23
</b>  See Part II.D. 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  Civilians can provide information on the identities and locations of Taliban fighters, tip off 
</p>
<p>international forces to the locations of IEDs, provide information on the identities of other 
civilian collaborators and informants, block or facilitate the recruitment of fighters, and so on. </p>

</p>
<p>cooperation of local civilians, individuals are subjected to conflicting demands, often including 
threats of violence, regardless of what choices they make.<b>25</b> The kinds of killings that are 
happening in this war also wound the living and trap them in a struggle to retain their civilian 
neutrality.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Taliban assassinations and &#8220;night letters&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Taliban routinely resorts to assassinations to coerce and punish civilians. 
In 2008, 271 such executions were committed. These killings are the tip of an iceberg of 
intimidation, epitomized by the &#8220;night letters&#8221; distributed to civilians. Some letters are displayed 
in public places - nailed to a mosque door, a school, or in a public market - and contain general 
directives or threats to the local population.<b>27</b> One Kunar witness told of a letter justifying attacks 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  International humanitarian law governing non-international armed conflicts, including 
</p>
<p>article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, prohibits the killing of anyone &#8220;taking no 
active part in the hostilities&#8221; including not only civilians but also combatants &#8220;who have laid 
down their arms&#8221; or who have been placed <i>hors de combat </i>by injury or &#8220;any other cause&#8221;. 
Common Article 3 also prohibits &#8220;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions 
without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial 
guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples&#8221;. The content of these 
guarantees may be found, at least in part, by reference to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Furthermore, humanitarian law 
always prohibits &#8220;[a]cts of threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror 
among the civilian population&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 2). 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  I was told of one man who was beheaded by the Taliban after having been warned in a &#8220;night 
letter&#8221; posted in the community&#8217;s mosque to stop supplying information to the international 
forces. Although he appears to have fallen under suspicion due to his own conduct, the 
community&#8217;s elders had previously decided to keep the Taliban fighters out after having received 
a warning from the international forces. The latter had told them that if the Taliban continued to 
launch attacks from their area, they would retaliate, and civilians might well die. But, while the 
elders succeeded in angering the Taliban, they were unable to convince the international forces 
of their intentions. Indeed, I was told that the international forces mistook for Taliban the 
community search party looking for the missing man and fired on them. 
</p>
<p> Another incident also illustrates the difficulty for civilians to navigate the conflicting 
demands of the parties to the conflict. Witnesses informed me that the presence of Taliban 
fighters in their village had resulted in attacks by the international forces, targeting both actual 
fighters and others who had been wrongly accused. They stated that, for this reason, a <i>jirga</i> of 
local elders decided that the community would hinder and deter Taliban infiltration. They 
decided that the house of anyone found supporting AGEs would be burned down and he would 
be handed over to the government. It was unclear, however, whether the international forces 
believed that the <i>jirga</i>&#8217;s decision was <i>bona fide</i> and the community was subsequently raided by 
international forces, resulting in two civilian deaths. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  In addition to the accounts that I received from witnesses, I reviewed a large number of night 
letters and other information gathered in Afghanistan. Threats made by the Taliban in person, by 
 </p>

</p>
<p>on local school students and on all non-Muslims. Others are sent to specific addressees. A 
Kandahar woman told of letters instructing her son to stop working for the ANP. He was later 
killed by suspected Taliban. In Kunar, a night letter was been posted in the village&#8217;s mosque 
threatening three people. Subsequently, two were assassinated and the third fled the country.<b>28</b> 
     
</p>
<p>telephone, and through night letters and other publications have attempted to induce compliance 
with social norms favored by the Taliban and to deter various forms of collaboration with the 
Government, the international forces, and other actors. Persons threatened and targeted have 
included mullahs in Ulema Councils that advise the Government, members of Provincial 
Councils (especially female members), teachers, students attending school (especially female 
students), elders perceived to be collaborating with the Government, drivers supplying food to 
the international forces, persons employed by the Government, and persons working for 
non-governmental organizations. A night letter in Kandahar referred to earlier general 
pronouncements that people should not work for the Government or NGOs and went on to warn 
that a specific individual&#8217;s family members must cease to work for NGOs or be killed. Persons 
belonging to the ANA and persons suspected of passing information to Government or 
international forces have been routinely targeted. A night letter in a mosque in Khost read, 
&#8220;Anyone who reports any pending suicide bomber attacks will face death. Do not maintain links 
with the government as well as with the international forces.&#8221; A night letter in Kunar read, 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t cooperate with the government, don&#8217;t spy, don&#8217;t be recruited to the military or police.&#8221; 
Current and former members of the ANA have been abducted and killed. (While ANA 
combatants are legitimate military objectives, a party to a conflict is prohibited from killing 
someone that they have detained. In some instances, the Taliban has prohibited movement 
between areas that they control and areas controlled by the Government. Thus, in parts of 
Kandahar province, the Taliban has instructed people to travel to Pakistan rather than to 
Kandahar City to purchase goods or to obtain medical care. Some night letters have also 
attempted to impose social norms. (For instance, one in Kunar instructed locals not to shave.) 
<b>28
</b></p>
<p>  The East and the South see different patterns of abuse by the Taliban. In the East, night letters 
tend to be fairly general admonitions not to cooperate with foreigners; whereas, in the South, 
night letters tend to be more specific warnings that particular individuals must desist from 
particular activities. And, in the East, individuals labeled as collaborators are more likely to 
receive multiple warnings and even to be released after being detained by the Taliban, while, in 
the South, such individuals are more likely to be beheaded. Statistical evidence on assassinations 
show that they are far more common in the South and Southeast than in the East. The Taliban 
administers some kind of &#8220;judiciary&#8221; in a few areas, but most &#8220;punishments&#8221; are decided upon 
directly by Taliban fighters. These are only generalizations - individualized warnings, harsh 
intimidation, and beheadings take place in both regions with alarming frequency - but, 
nevertheless, these differences suggests that the proper approaches to reducing the risks war 
poses to the civilian population might also differ in some respects between the two regions. 
</p>
<p> Informed interlocutors provided a number of explanations for these differences: 
</p>
<p>1. In the South, the Taliban is more hard-line ideologically. (Insofar as this is true, it 
may be, in part, because the South is dominated by the same Taliban leadership that 
exercised authority over much of the country in the late 1990s, while the East sees a  
 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4

</p>
<p>Directives issued by the Taliban leadership to its fighters expressly authorize the execution  
of civilians.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>greater diversity of armed actors - including Hezb-i Islami and groups directly linked to 
Al-Qaeda. In both regions, however, locals generally refer to all of these simply as 
&#8220;Taliban&#8221;.) 
</p>
<p>2. In the East, tribal structures are stronger, making it easier for communities to resist 
Taliban coercion and infiltration. 
</p>
<p>3. The Taliban&#8217;s more ruthless repression in the South reflects the fact that it is more 
dependent on the local population&#8217;s cooperation there than in the East due to differences in 
geography and terrain. In the South, Taliban fighters must live amongst the local 
population and rely on them not to tip off the government or international forces as to their 
locations or identities; whereas, in the East, they can reside in Pakistan, only periodically 
crossing the border to make attacks. (The Southern provinces, including Helmand and 
Kandahar, also border Pakistan but, in contrast to the East, populated areas are separated 
from the border by large expanses of inhospitable and sparsely-populated desert.) The 
East&#8217;s terrain is also extremely rugged in contrast to the relatively flat South. 
</p>
<p> In the South, interlocutors also identified a difference in the kind of Taliban abuse between 
areas newly seized by the Taliban and areas under the sustained control of the Taliban. In the 
former, the Taliban is apt to kill elders who had previously collaborated with the Government 
and the international forces. In the latter, victims have more often been suspected spies. These 
are identified largely through circumstantial evidence, such as possession of US dollars. A 
number of those with whom I spoke were deeply fearful that speaking with a foreigner might 
lead others to label them as spies. 
<b>29
</b></p>
<p>  A copy of the Taliban&#8217;s <i>Layeha</i>, or Book of Rules, signed by the &#8220;highest leader of the 
Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan&#8221;, was obtained by two journalists who met with a Taliban 
commander in late 2006. For example, with respect to teachers and NGO workers, the manual 
provides the following rules: 
</p>
<p> (24) It is forbidden to work as a teacher under the current puppet regime, because this 
strengthens the system of the infidels. True Muslims should apply to study with a religiously 
trained teacher and study in a Mosque or similar institution. Textbooks must come from the 
period of the Jihad or from the Taliban regime. 
</p>
<p> (25) Anyone who works as a teacher for the current puppet regime must receive a 
warning. If he nevertheless refuses to give up his job, he must be beaten. If the teacher still 
continues to instruct contrary to the principles of Islam, the district commander or a group leader 
must kill him. 
</p>
<p> (26) Those NGOs that come to the country under the rule of the infidels must be treated 
as the government is treated. They have come under the guise of helping people but in fact are 
part of the regime. Thus we tolerate none of their activities, whether it be building of streets,

</p>
<p><b>3.  Intimidation by international forces 
</b></p>
<p>28. Civilians experience far more pervasive and violent intimidation by the Taliban, elders and 
others, especially in Kunar province, claimed international forces had threatened collective 
consequences for failures to cooperate.<b>30</b> In one instance, international forces were cited as 
saying that unless various weapons were brought to them within 24 hours, they would demolish 
several villages. The villagers refused, and a funeral ceremony was then attacked by a helicopter, 
killing six people. International forces in Kunar province would not meet with me, so it was not 
possible to obtain their response. Arguably, if villagers have Taliban in their midst they will 
inevitably be endangered by military operations no matter what safeguards are adopted. 
Nonetheless there is reason for serious concern that international forces take a cavalier attitude 
toward such safeguards precisely because they view the civilian population as complicit with the 
Taliban. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Transparency and accountability in international force operations 
</b></p>
<p>29. The international forces in Afghanistan should take seriously the principles of 
accountability and transparency, the importance of which they so frequently proclaim in other 
contexts.<b>31</b> I saw no evidence that the IMF commit widespread intentional killings in violation of 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>bridges, clinics, schools, madrases (schools for Koran study) or other works. If a school fails to 
heed a warning to close, it must be burned. But all religious books must be secured beforehand. 
</p>
<p> The Book of Rules clarifies that these &#8220;rules are obligatory&#8221; and that &#8220;[a]nyone who 
offends this code must be judged according to the laws of the Islamic Emirates&#8221;. (&#8220;A new layeha 
for the Mujahideen&#8221; (29 November 2006)<i> at </i>&lt; http://www.signandsight.com/features/ 
1071.html&gt; (translated from version in <i>Die Weltwoche</i> (16 November 2006)).) One informed 
interlocutor stated that at least in the South, where the control of Mullah Mohammad Omar is 
most direct, these rules do appear to influence the conduct of fighters on the ground. 
<b>30
</b></p>
<p>  There is no exception to the rule prohibiting attacks directed at civilians who are not directly 
participating in hostilities. Indeed, the international humanitarian law applicable to 
non-international armed conflicts expressly prohibits any &#8220;resort to belligerent reprisals&#8221; as well 
as any other &#8220;countermeasures against persons who do not or who have ceased to take a direct 
part in hostilities&#8221; (ICRC Study, Rule 148). 
<b>31
</b></p>
<p>  Human rights law imposes a duty on States to investigate alleged violations of the right to life 
&#8220;promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies&#8221; (Human Rights 
Committee, general comment No. 31, &#8220;Nature of the legal obligation on States Parties to the 
Covenant&#8221; (2004), (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13), para. 15.) This duty is entailed by the general 
obligation to ensure the right to life of each individual. The right to life is non-derogable 
regardless of circumstance (ICCPR, art. 4 (2)); thus, armed conflict and occupation do not 
discharge the State&#8217;s duty to investigate and prosecute human rights abuses. It is undeniable that 
during armed conflicts circumstances will sometimes impede investigation. Such circumstances 
will never discharge the obligation to investigate - this would eviscerate the non-derogable 
character of the right to life - but they may affect the modalities or particulars of the 
investigation. On a case-by-case basis a State might utilize less effective measures of

<p>human rights or IHL. But their response to alleged civilian casualties combines great seriousness 
of intent and adherence to the applicable law with surprisingly opaque and unsatisfactory 
outcomes. 
</p>
<p>30. First, when I asked relatives or witnesses which particular international force had carried 
out the killing, even those who had tried to follow up their cases at PRTs and other military bases 
were often unable to answer. Seeking clarification from the international forces is like entering a 
maze, one that I also experienced myself.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Second, the situation is even worse when it comes to the accountability of individual 
soldiers. There is a dual system, involving both the ISAF and national commands, for incidents 
in which there are grounds to believe that unlawful force may have been used. An ISAF 
commander will convene a Mission Review Board in response to formal allegations, internal 
information that raises concerns, or even a newspaper report on an incident. The perspective of 
this inquiry is not legal, but addresses incidents that may undermine the mission. The board 
evaluates whether the force used was appropriate. Findings go to the ISAF commander and the 
command of the relevant national contingent. The responsibility for prosecuting any crime 
committed then belongs to the sending country. There is, however, no requirement that the 
outcomes of these national processes of investigation, discipline, and prosecution be reported 
back to ISAF. The result is that <i>no one </i>in Afghanistan systematically tracks the outcome of 
investigations and prosecutions.<b>33</b> This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>investigation in response to concrete constraints. For example, when hostile forces control the 
scene of a shooting, conducting full forensic examinations may prove impossible. Regardless of 
the circumstances, however, investigations must always be conducted as effectively as possible 
and never be reduced to mere formality. (E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 33-43.) 
<b>32
</b></p>
<p>  One ISAF commander explained that while he could confirm whether a particular operation 
was conducted by conventional ISAF troops and then clarify which national contingent they 
belonged to, he would have to pass the case up the chain of command to clarify whether it had 
been conducted by ISAF special forces, and that I would have to ask the commander in charge of 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) to determine whether and which coalition forces were 
responsible. 
<b>33
</b></p>
<p>  I met a witness in Jalalabad who lost family members in the 4 March 2007 incident in which 
soldiers responded to a suicide attack on their convoy by shooting at a number of people over the 
next 20 kilometers of road (see above Part II.B.5). He was surprisingly open-minded about the 
responsible soldiers being tried by their sending country, but he was angry that he had not been 
provided with any information as to whether the soldiers involved had come before a court 
martial, whether they had been convicted or acquitted, and whether there were ongoing 
proceedings. Then I visited the regional commander, and he didn&#8217;t know either. He explained 
that it was the previous unit that was responsible for that incident and they had taken all the 
relevant files with them when they rotated back to the United States. To his credit, he recognized 
that this was a problem. Another regional commander with whom I spoke suggested that it was 
not such a problem whether the status of investigations and prosecutions could be tracked  
 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>32. The international forces operating in Afghanistan have a responsibility to make sure that 
there is a coherent, unified system of accountability which Afghans and others can follow. 
However messy this system may be on the inside, composed as it is of multiple mandates and of 
disparate national military justice systems, it is essential that those pieces add up to a coherent 
whole. 
</p>
<p>33. Third, the international forces do not publicly provide information on civilian casualties. 
Clearly, it is often difficult to reliably ascertain a precise figure because it is not always possible 
to determine whether particular individuals were civilians or Taliban fighters. But instead of a 
wall of silence, statistics should be provided accompanied by appropriate caveats and 
explanations of any uncertainty. The absurdity of the current situation is captured in the response 
by NATO to the preliminary findings I issued at the conclusion of my mission to Afghanistan. 
NATO&#8217;s spokesman stated that &#8220;the suggestion that international military forces have killed 
200 civilians uses a figure that we reject and is far too high&#8221; but he then refused to provide any 
alternative estimate.<b>34</b> This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation. 
</p>
<p>34. Fourth, the international forces should also cooperate more fully with outside efforts to 
investigate alleged abuses. There is some cooperation in the investigations of incidents between 
the Government and the international forces. As one senior Government official explained to me, 
the Government will verify the facts on the grounds, and these findings will then be correlated 
with ISAF&#8217;s information on how the operation was planned and conducted. These two sources of 
information result in a more complete understanding of whether and why civilians were killed. It 
     
</p>
<p>because compensation was the main concern. As he acknowledged, the bottom line is that those 
wishing to know the final outcomes of any prosecutions must read the local newspapers in all of 
the troop-sending countries. 
</p>
<p> In fact, at the time of my visit, a Court of Inquiry into the 4 March incident was proceeding 
in the United States. Shortly after I returned from Afghanistan, the US military released a short 
statement on this incident, indicating that a US military commander had conducted a &#8220;thorough 
review of the report of a Court of Inquiry&#8221; and had determined that the soldiers had &#8220;acted 
appropriately and in accordance with the rules of engagement and tactics, techniques and 
procedures in place at the time in response to a complex attack&#8221;. Unsurprisingly, this conclusory 
and unsubstantiated response to such a serious incident was met with dismay in Afghanistan. 
Afghans have a right to ask on what basis this conclusion was reached. But all of the documents 
produced by the Court of Inquiry have remained classified. The record of proceedings has not 
been released. The 12,000 page report of the Court of Inquiry including recommendations and 
factual findings has not been released. The US Government has even disregarded the existing 
regulation stating that the convening authority should ensure that an executive summary of the 
report be made public in order to provide information on the investigation&#8217;s findings and 
recommendations. Aside from the question of whether the decision not to initiate courts-martial 
was justified, the manner in which the US military justice system operated in this case was 
entirely inconsistent with principles of public accountability and transparency. Regrettably, this 
is no aberration; it is the norm. 
<b>34
</b></p>
<p>  NATO Statement, 15 May 2008. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>is regrettable that the findings of these investigations are not made public. Moreover, while the 
international forces do respond to particular allegations of abuse provided to them by other 
actors (such as UNAMA and the AIHRC), they have the capacity to do so in a much more 
substantive manner. This should include the expedited declassification and more comprehensive 
sharing of relevant information, including video footage (such as gun tapes) and mission 
story-boards (step-by-step descriptions of how an operation progressed). 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Compensation for victims 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Government provides some payments (approximately US$1,900) to civilians killed by 
AGEs, but this program is uneven, and operates in a highly unsatisfactory manner. The various 
international forces have implemented diverse programs for compensating civilian victims of 
military operations. Such payments are consistent with international law requirement for 
reparations for human rights or IHL violations.<b>35</b> Governments have generally cited the rationale 
of &#8220;winning hearts and minds&#8221; and eschewed any notion of obligation. But the fact remains that 
reparations are increasingly often paid to the families of those killed, even in lawful attacks, and 
this goes well beyond the practice in previous conflicts. Publicly-available records are 
insufficient for estimating the proportion of victims who receive payments. However, informed 
interlocutors suggested that victims do routinely obtain payments, although doing so is not 
always easy, and the payments are not always fair or timely.

</p>
<p>General Legal Obligation on States Parties to the Covenant&#8221; (2004), para. 16; Henckaerts 
&amp; Doswald-Beck, <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i> (ICRC 2005), Rule 150. As a 
matter of customary international humanitarian law, &#8220;A State responsible for violations of 
international humanitarian law is required to make full reparation for the loss or injury caused.&#8221; 
(ICRC Study, Rule 150.) While the modalities of this obligation under IHL continue to be 
clarified, &#8220;There is an increasing trend in favour of enabling individual victims of violations of 
international humanitarian law to seek reparation directly from the responsible State.&#8221; (ICRC 
Study, volume 1, page 541.) This interpretation is, moreover, obligatory pursuant to the 
international human rights law requirement to &#8220;ensure that any person whose rights ... are 
violated shall have an effective remedy&#8221; (ICCPR, art. 2(3)(a); Human Rights Committee, 
general comment No. 31, &#8220;Nature of the legal obligation on States Parties to the Covenant&#8221; 
(2004), (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13), para. 16.)  The injury for which reparation is due includes 
both material and moral damage, and the reparation therefore &#8220;shall take the form of restitution, 
compensation and satisfaction&#8221; (Draft Articles on State Responsibility, arts. 31, 34). Because 
restitution - &#8220;re-establish[ing] the situation which existed before the wrongful act was 
committed&#8221; would be &#8220;materially impossible&#8221; in the case of an individual&#8217;s death, the requisite 
reparation will comprise compensation and satisfaction (Draft Articles, art. 35). The 
compensation &#8220;shall cover any financially assessable damage&#8221; (Draft Articles, art. 36), and the 
satisfaction &#8220;may consist in an acknowledgment of the breach, an expression of regret, a formal 
apology or another appropriate modality&#8221; (Draft Articles, art. 37). In practice, the monies and 
goods provided for deaths in Afghanistan typically carry elements of both compensation and 
satisfaction, helping to compensate for the loss of a productive member of the family and serving 
as an expression of regret. </p>

</p>
<p>36. Women, in particular, face obstacles, as illustrated by interviews with many women in 
Kandahar who lost male relatives in air strikes, Taliban attacks, or IMF convoy shootings. Their 
incomes had been eliminated or drastically reduced. Some had received monetary assistance 
from the Afghan government or ISAF, but many did not know how to even begin to seek such 
aid. If they are lucky, their families support them. Some enter the workforce, and receive 
second-class wages. Others will have no way to access education or employment and will be 
forced to beg to feed their children. Compensation can be especially important for women, and 
payment programs should be designed with their unique circumstances and needs in mind. 
</p>
<p>37. Among the international forces, the US is the most systematic in providing compensation. 
Commanders are authorized to make &#8220;condolence&#8221; or &#8220;solatia&#8221; payments and frequently do so. 
The maximum payment amount provided for a death on either basis is roughly $2,500. A British 
commander informed me that they make <i>ex gratia</i> payments, with the amount determined by 
general guidelines and negotiation with the <i>shura</i> of the victim&#8217;s village. Some of the other 
national contingents within ISAF run similar programs. But some governments have held back. 
One concern has been that offering payments would inherently constitute an admission of legal 
liability. This concern is baseless, as demonstrated by the experiences of governments who do 
make such payments. Another concern expressed has been that for their military contingents to 
offer payments would encroach on &#8220;humanitarian space&#8221; by involving soldiers in the provision 
of &#8220;aid&#8221;. This is unpersuasive: such payments are an integral part of responsible military action 
rather than an ancillary humanitarian activity. The existing payment programs are extremely 
promising and, in many respects, unprecedented. The flaws lie in the overall system&#8217;s 
excessively discretionary and fragmentary character, which mean that whether payment is 
provided for a particular civilian&#8217;s death depends on the national contingent involved, the 
attitudes of local commanders and Government officials, and the ability of the surviving family 
to navigate the process for obtaining a payment. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Influencing the Taliban 
</b></p>
<p>38. There have been limited efforts to respond to the Taliban&#8217;s perpetration of extrajudicial 
executions and other human rights abuses. Tribal elders, in particular, emphasized the 
importance of finding ways to influence the Taliban&#8217;s conduct. While there was a general 
consensus that doing so would be difficult, a number of possible approaches were proposed. 
</p>
<p>39. Some suggested that Islamic scholars could take actions that would constrain the Taliban&#8217;s 
freedom to resort to tactics violative of Islamic and international law. While the Taliban&#8217;s own 
clerical network is unlikely to be influenced, my interlocutors felt that scholars could exercise a 
more indirect influence. One measure suggested was for especially respected clerics to release 
<i>fatwas</i> condemning the Taliban&#8217;s resort to abusive tactics.<b>36</b> Another was for Islamic scholars to 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  Some interlocutors expressed frustration that clerics from Al-Azhar University (in Egypt) in 
</p>
<p>particular had not more forcibly called attention to the incompatibility of some Taliban tactics 
with Islamic law. They opined that, even if the Taliban&#8217;s leadership might disregard Al-Azhar&#8217;s 
authority, the respect accorded the views of the Grand Imam and other clerics there by the wider 
society in which the Taliban operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan would nevertheless constrain 
the Taliban&#8217;s freedom of action. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>familiarize tribal elders with the precepts of Islamic law governing the conduct of hostilities. 
This would better equip them to persuade local commanders to desist from abusive tactics, to 
reduce broader support for such tactics, and to discourage young men from engaging in these 
methods of warfare. 
</p>
<p>40. Views varied on the relevance of a strategy &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; in relation to the 
Taliban. One interlocutor suggested that since the Taliban has denied responsibility for particular 
suicide attacks causing heavy civilian casualties, there might be a reputational concern with the 
public. It would follow that credibly documenting and publicizing violations could affect 
conduct. Another interlocutor argued that this analysis disregarded the structure of Taliban 
decision-making on military action and public relations. Although some senior Taliban might 
disavow particular attacks to minimize political fallout, commanders on the ground lacked 
external or internal incentives to modify their behavior to avoid adverse media reports. This 
reasoning would suggest that incentives for compliance are strong enough to induce <i>post hoc</i> 
damage control but too weak to encourage actual reforms. There is evidence, however, that 
reputational concerns have led to some efforts to ensure actual compliance rather than merely 
feign it after the fact. The Taliban&#8217;s leadership has promulgated directives prohibiting particular 
abusive tactics - such as beheadings<b>37</b> - and these have been at least partially respected by 
fighters on the ground. In my view, more extensive credible naming and shaming efforts are 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>41. Many interlocutors, especially elders, were frustrated by what they perceived as inadequate 
efforts by governments and inter-governmental organizations to respond to Taliban abuses. 
Many argued that Pakistan should do more to rein in those Taliban residing in its territory. It was 
also repeatedly suggested that the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference (OIC) should do more to condemn Taliban abuses and put pressure on states in a 
position to affect the Taliban&#8217;s conduct. While some expectations seemed unrealistic, the 
palpable disillusionment with efforts to date should provide a wake-up call. 
</p>
<p>42. Others argued that there was a need for international actors to engage directly with the 
Taliban to understand the rationales for its abusive tactics and to apply targeted pressure for 
change. Prominent elders in the South told me directly that the problem with visits by 
international envoys was that they only spoke to one side. An international military commander 
expressed surprise that I was not speaking with Taliban representatives. In general, when I 
conduct country visits and fact-finding missions, I speak with armed opposition groups, but I did 
not speak with any formal representatives of the Taliban or other armed groups during my visit.<b>38</b> 
In retrospect, this was a mistake. Taking account of information provided by such sources would 
permit a more nuanced understanding of Taliban and other AGE strategies. While some of the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>37
</b>  In February 2008, Mullah Mohammad Omar issued a directive ordering the Taliban not to 
</p>
<p>behead people, and this was seen to have some impact on conduct on the ground. 
<b>38
</b></p>
<p>  Initially, I assumed that security concerns, largely of the armed groups&#8217; own making, would 
make doing so impossible. I was also aware that various actors had reservations about the 
political implications of doing so. Ultimately, I felt I had no option but to abide by these 
reservations despite the fact that realistic opportunities were presented to me. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>explanations and justifications provided for engaging in abusive tactics would be self-serving 
and deceitful, there is no reason to assume that the Taliban could never be persuaded to modify 
its conduct in ways that would improve its respect for human rights. And purely humanitarian 
contacts have had a positive impact in the past.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>43. One senior official succinctly summarized Government concerns. While the Government 
itself can engage with any and all domestic groups, he felt that international engagement with the 
Taliban would reduce the Government from being a sovereign to being a mere faction in a civil 
war. It is true that this concern might apply to political negotiations to resolve the conflict. Does 
human rights engagement to ameliorate the conflict&#8217;s effects on civilians warrant the same 
concern? First, while such contacts could indeed be pursued in ways that might somehow 
&#8220;legitimize&#8221; these groups, contact in order to request its views on particular incidents, criticize 
its conduct, and urge better human rights and IHL compliance does not &#8220;legitimize&#8221; that group. 
Second, in many other countries Governments have permitted human rights actors to engage 
with armed opposition groups. The bottom line is that the international community does have 
human rights expectations to which it holds the Taliban and other armed groups. It criticizes 
them for conducting suicide attacks, assassinating teachers, and other acts incompatible with 
those fundamental human rights expectations. These expectations operate to protect people, 
rather than going to issues of legitimacy. The international community must do all it can to 
promote human rights compliance by all actors. I thus recommend that, in the future, human 
rights proponents should develop contacts with the Taliban and other armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  POLICE REFORM AND MILITIAS 
</b></p>
<p>44. In most parts of the country, the police are the face of the Government. In many districts 
where they are the <i>only </i>government officials seen by the people, the perceived legitimacy of 
Government depends almost entirely on them. Legitimacy will follow if they maintain law and 
order for all, but not if they extort, intimidate, and kill. All too often, the police do not truly 
represent the interests or diversity of the community. They are drawn dominantly from the 
members of one tribe or the followers of one commander.<b>40</b> For ordinary Afghans, this means 
that police function not as enforcers of law and order, but as promoters of the interests of a 
specific tribe or commander. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>39
</b>  In 2003 and 2004, Afghanistan was close to eliminating polio when Taliban fighters and 
</p>
<p>others concluded that the polio vaccine was actually designed to cause infertility and limit the 
growth of the Muslim population worldwide. For this reason, they began executing nurses and 
doctors and forcing those transporting vaccines to drink them. In 2007, persons close to the 
Taliban leadership in Quetta were contacted to explain the vaccination program&#8217;s purpose. In 
September 2007, a letter was produced by a Taliban leader in Quetta which permitted the WHO, 
UNICEF, and the Ministry of Health to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children. 
<b>40
</b></p>
<p>  As one senior foreign military official responsible for ANP training candidly stated, &#8220;police 
are often nothing but militias&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>45. These problems were especially visible in the South, where elders from conflict-affected 
areas stated that police abuses were tempting people to support the Taliban. A senior 
Government official listed the security threats in his province as coming both from the Taliban 
and from criminal elements among the Government security forces. An international military 
commander stated bluntly that the police in his area of operations are corrupt and predatory and 
that the people have no experience of the police delivering services, but only of confiscating 
their goods and money. Indeed, persons in and out of Government stated that to obtain ANP 
posts, individuals routinely pay amounts exceeding the salary, expecting to use their posts for 
personal benefit. 
</p>
<p>46. These realities have not, however, been adequately recognized by the Government or the 
international community.<b>41</b> Opportunities to remove corrupt and abusive individuals from the 
state&#8217;s security forces and power structures have consistently been missed. The pay-and-rank 
reform program designed to transform the ANP from a force thick with militias and local thugs 
into a professional, national police force had some undeniable successes, but its implementation 
grew half-hearted over time. Similarly, candidates linked to illegal armed groups were not 
disqualified in the 2005 elections despite an elections law requiring precisely that. 
</p>
<p>47. A key reason for these failures to act is acceptance of a false dichotomy between &#8220;stability 
and security&#8221; and &#8220;human rights&#8221;, and a tendency to prioritize the former. In fact, this 
understanding is deeply flawed. As one senior official told me, many AGEs in his area had 
joined the Taliban precisely because of the torture, abuses, and misguided strategies of his 
predecessor. It must be recognized that human rights respect by Government security forces is 
<i>necessary </i>in order to ensure security and stability. 
</p>
<p>48. What does this mean for policy? There are, of course, myriad development plans, sectoral 
strategies, training programs, and so on, covering every component of the Government&#8217;s security 
forces. But several considerations are crucial. 
</p>
<p>49. First, Afghanistan needs a police force that can play both a law enforcement and 
para-military role. There is a well-known debate between those who favor two different models 
of policing. Some focus on one designed to prevent and respond effectively to burglaries, thefts, 
domestic disputes, and murders. Others favor constructing a police force that can hold territory 
by fighting &#8220;anti-government elements&#8221;. But this way of framing the issues is not helpful. Any 
police force that does not deal effectively with the crimes that plague people in their everyday 
lives will be discredited. And any police force that works in conflict-affected areas must be 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  One illustration will suffice. I examined a recent incident in which police are alleged to have 
</p>
<p>massacred a group of men from a rival tribe. Those killed may or may not also have been 
sympathetic to the Taliban. Following extensive discussions with all parties it seems unlikely 
that we will ever know precisely what actually happened. But the point is that no-one in the 
Government has any interest in investigating, much less prosecuting, those responsible. And the 
international community seems unprepared to change that situation. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>prepared to engage with insurgents.<b>42</b> The ANP must have the ability to survive if they are to be 
able to carry out any of the ordinary policing activities. Training must thus encompass both 
aspects. 
</p>
<p>50. Second, training alone will not fix Afghanistan&#8217;s police force. Training is important but 
people who have an interest in summarily executing their enemies don&#8217;t stop doing so simply 
because they&#8217;ve read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or received instruction in an 
escalation of force protocol. 
</p>
<p>51. However, the Focused District Development (FDD) program has, in an unexpected 
manner, pointed the way toward genuine reform. The program takes an entire district&#8217;s police 
force to another location to receive intensive training. While they are being trained, the 
Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) moves in to police the district. They have 
generally been well-received. Why? The answer may lie partly in their training, but the dominant 
factor seems to be that the ANCOP police do not have any connection to local tribes, 
commanders, or warlords. There are a number of plausible approaches, ranging from a more 
comprehensive pay-and-rank reform effort to the construction of a national gendarmerie. But any 
serious effort to reform the ANP must focus on establishing a police force that represents the 
interests of communities rather than the narrow interests of particular tribes, warlords, and 
politicians. 
</p>
<p>52. Third, the Government must stop establishing and legitimizing more militias. It seems that 
the now abandoned &#8220;auxiliary police&#8221; program amounted to little beyond legitimizing existing 
militias by giving them Government uniforms. It is not clear, however, that the lessons of that 
experience have truly been learned and an ongoing &#8220;social outreach program&#8221; is quite 
worrying.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>53. Fourth, the police must be better trained and equipped with a view to reducing the 
unacceptable rate at which police officers die, which is almost five times that of the military. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>42
</b>  According to officials from the Ministry of Interior, in 131 of Afghanistan&#8217;s 365 districts, the 
</p>
<p>ANP is the only security force present. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  A senior Government official explained to me that the &#8220;social outreach program&#8221; of the 
Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG) is intended to mobilize the local 
population for its own protection. He explained that there will never be enough ANP or ANA to 
perform tasks such as protecting schools in conflict-affected areas and that the &#8220;social outreach 
program&#8221; involves asking a local tribal leader to do so. As a side benefit, he noted, building such 
bridges between the Government and local militias would generate intelligence on the infiltration 
of anti-government elements, the location of IEDs, and so on. But this approach seems likely 
only to increase the risk to the local population and to lead to the empowerment of favored 
groups within a community to extort, intimidate, and kill their opponents. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>54. Finally, the problem of killings by the police and other armed personnel acting under the 
authority of Government officials has been largely overlooked. This should end. While there are 
no reliable figures on the number of such unlawful killings, known cases clearly indicate that the 
overall number is high. There is a crying need for a system which ensures that when the police 
and/or their political masters are accused of multiple killings an independent investigation is 
launched. The killing of nine and the wounding of 42 unarmed protesters in Sheberghan 
(Jawzjan province) on 28 May 2007 by either the ANP or the Governor&#8217;s private bodyguards 
provides a classic example.<b>44</b> Local and national political interests have conspired to ensure that 
no effective investigation was undertaken. The technique is to let time pass until the evidence 
has faded and other political concerns have claimed the limelight. The matter can then be quietly 
filed away. The victims and their families are simply ignored. 
</p>
<p>55. Local police are, not unusually, incapable of meaningfully investigating themselves.<b>45</b> A 
national police investigative task force should be established for this purpose. The investigative 
powers of the AIHRC should also be strengthened and the local and national government should

<p><b>IV.  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Overview 
</b></p>
<p>56. In addition to the many killings of Afghan civilians which occur in the context of the 
armed conflict, Afghans also face insecurity from a general lack of law and order. Very few 
criminal murder cases are properly investigated or prosecuted and few perpetrators are 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  I spoke with members of civil society who investigated the incident, a number of witnesses to 
</p>
<p>the demonstration, and to those wounded in the shooting. I received credible accounts from some 
of those who were shot whilst running away from the protest area. When the AIHRC prepared a 
detailed but damning report on the incident, the response of the Government was to ignore it and 
set up separate inquiries. These inquiries appear to be going the way of most such efforts. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Interior (MoI), in year 1386 of the Afghan 
calendar (21 March 2007 - 21 March 2008), the General MoI&#8217;s Directorate of Internal Affairs 
addressed 436 cases, referring 351 officers and 12 generals being reported to the Prosecution 
Office. According to the Attorney General, during the year prior to my visit, prosecutions had 
resulted in the jailing of 17 police officers, all of whom were involved in one case. After serving 
20 months, they were released pursuant to a judgment by the Court of Appeals. These cases 
would not, however, appear to concern issues arising under the mandate. While the MoI was able 
to provide statistics on civilian casualties due to Taliban and IMF attacks, with respect to those 
caused by ANP, it reported only that &#8220;There are no statistics of arbitrary executions by the 
National Police reported by any sources.&#8221; The NDS also monitors the ANP for abuses. However, 
according to an NDS official, however, no action is taken on abuses reported, whether they are 
reported to the MoI or to more senior Government officials. </p>

</p>
<p>convicted.<b>46</b> This impunity is due to failings in the functioning of the criminal justice system. 
Although practice varies considerably, the criminal justice system&#8217;s formal structure is similar to 
that of many civil law countries.<b>47</b> Generally, police report crimes to the prosecutor, who 
investigates on his own or in collaboration with the police.<b>48</b> If the prosecutor finds sufficient 
evidence against the suspected perpetrator, he submits an indictment to the District Court.<b>49</b> The 
decision of the District Court may be appealed to the Provincial Court.<b>50</b> Recourse to the 
Supreme Court may be had if the lower court&#8217;s decision involved legal error or was based on 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  The Ministry of Interior provided statistics on the number of crimes that were detected by the 
</p>
<p>ANP, that were delivered to a prosecutor, and that resulted in a judicial verdict. For all offences, 
the MoI reported that 100% of cases detected were referred to a prosecutor.

</p>
<p> The figures given for judicial verdicts obtained were provided by the MoI rather than by 
the judiciary, and the true figures are likely higher. According to the MoI, &#8220;It&#8217;s worth mentioning 
that the continuous efforts of this organ to obtain the exact number of all three courts&#8217; decisions 
about criminal cases have not ended with an acceptable result, due to a lack of coordination and 
interest of the judicial organs with police in most of the provinces. ... There are usually tangible 
mistakes in this regard.&#8221; 
<b>47
</b></p>
<p>  The system&#8217;s formal structure is laid out in the <i>Interim Criminal Procedure Code of 2004</i> 
(ICPC) together with other statutes and the Constitution. However, it is generally acknowledged 
that there is weak compliance with some of this code&#8217;s detailed provisions. Moreover, many 
cases are dealt with in customary legal systems.

</p>
<p>unlawfully collected evidence.<b>51</b> The Supreme Court may also appoint a committee to revise a 
decision based on newly discovered evidence.<b>52</b> Despite these formally appropriate procedures, I 
received many complaints that killings are not investigated, that prosecutions are not pursued, 
and that the judiciary corruptly exonerates many individuals. 
57. Part of the problem at the early stages of crime detection and investigation is that there is a 
lack of cooperation between the police and the prosecutors. Constitutionally the police engage in 
&#8220;detection&#8221; and the prosecutors in &#8220;investigation&#8221;. This appears not to work well in practice. In 
the past, it has been suggested that the Minister of Interior (who can issue orders binding on the 
police) and the Attorney General (who can issue binding orders on the prosecutors) meet as part 
of a committee, agree on how to cooperate on the combined process of detection and 
investigation, and simultaneously issue the appropriate orders. This has not come to pass. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Corruption and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>58. While specific reforms to the justice system are essential, corruption is the common thread 
running through many of the problems. It is routine among police, prosecutors, and judges. To 
their credit, this was candidly acknowledged by Government officials. Senior Government 
officials described corruption as being so &#8220;widespread&#8221; as to be &#8220;unbelievable&#8221;, and admitted 
that they had corruption within their offices. According to many Afghans with whom I spoke, the 
problem is as blatant as it is rampant. One interlocutor told me that, as you approach a 
courthouse, you will be approached by persons with some link to the judge who will inquire as to 
your problem and solicit bribes. It was widely affirmed that when wealthy or powerful people do 
get convicted, they will not spend long in prison. With respect to the police, one senior foreign 
police trainer noted that, while individual police could be properly trained, the entire policing 
system was so corrupt that putting a new officer into the system was like &#8220;throwing people into a 
cesspool and expecting them to stay clean&#8221;. The result is a system which provides a thoroughly 
unacceptable degree of impunity to those accused of killings. 
</p>
<p>59. On a day-to-day basis, it is the Attorney General who has the authority to proactively 
monitor corruption, and to monitor the operations of other government agencies. This can 
involve both periodic visits to investigate offices and the long-term presence of a representative 
of the Attorney General&#8217;s office in the offices of another government agency. These may provide 
corrective guidance when officials are ignorant of their legal obligations and, when necessary, 
commence prosecutions. In 2007, this had led to the prosecution of 300 officials, 95% of whom 
were prosecuted for corruption. There have not, however, been any prosecutions of senior 
officials. The Government&#8217;s anti-corruption efforts have also included a number of specialized 
commissions, including, most recently, the High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption. Thus 
far, however, all governmental anti-corruption initiatives have been routinely undermined by 
political considerations when powerful figures have been implicated. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  ICPC, arts. 81, 83. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>60. Pervasive corruption cannot be eliminated overnight, but there is a pressing need to 
establish a visible and credible mechanism with the power to subpoena witnesses and evidence, 
and to launch prosecutions. Above all, it must be designed to withstand the inevitable pressures 
of both corrupt politicians and those in government who feel obliged to turn a blind eye to 
corruption so as not to jeopardize their ability to govern. Independent corruption agencies have 
been successfully established in many states including Nigeria, Hong Kong and Australia. A 
series of carefully targeted prosecutions of egregious cases would be beneficial in terms of 
sending the necessary message. While this will require international funding, national ownership 
is indispensable. There is also a need for the international community to recognize that, insofar 
as international aid money provides the resources on which much of this corruption thrives, it 
has a responsibility to use mechanisms, such as high-level appointment review boards, to support 
Government anti-corruption efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Women and the criminal justice system 
</b>61. Problems in the criminal justice system are multiplied exponentially for women. In 
Kandahar, a female member of my team asked a roomful of women where, or to whom, they 
could lodge a complaint if they faced abuse within the home, or feared for their lives. The room 
erupted with ironic laughter. For many of them, abuse or social stigmatization would result from 
simply going outside the home. Even if they could leave, they would be too ashamed to make 
their concerns public. And if they did complain to the police, they did not believe any action 
would follow. They felt they would only be punished further, or be imprisoned for &#8220;running 
away&#8221;. In short, far too many women at risk of being abused or killed simply have nowhere to 
turn. 
</p>
<p>62. Women&#8217;s referral centres, recently set up in Jalalabad and Parwan, appear to be making a 
real difference. Such initiatives warrant strong support from the government and the international 
community. Prosecutions of crimes against women would also be assisted by setting up in the 
Attorney-Generals office a strong special office for female victims. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Honour killings 
</b></p>
<p>63. &#8220;Honor killings&#8221;<b>53</b> occur with impunity in parts of Afghanistan. In the eastern region, for 
example, one source had documented 40 honor killings between January 2007 and 
December 2008. The actual number is certainly far higher due to fear of reporting such cases. 
The victims are predominantly women, although men are also killed. Rarely are perpetrators 
investigated and prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>64. In Jalalabad, Nangarhar province, I spoke with a family member of a boy and girl (cousins) 
who allegedly had sexual relations outside of marriage. They were invited to a &#8220;dinner&#8221; by their 
uncles and, when sleeping, were shot and killed. The boy&#8217;s body was sent to his father. The girl&#8217;s 
was buried without any funeral prayers. No family members complained to the police. The 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  The killing of a family member on suspicion of engagement in any actions deemed 
</p>
<p>dishonorable, ranging from mere association with the opposite sex to sexual relations or running 
away from home. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>police knew about the deaths, but did not investigate, claiming that they could not do so without 
a complaint from the family.<b>54</b> In Kandahar, a female colleague spoke with many women who 
told her that honor killings occur in their neighborhoods, but are rarely reported or investigated. 
One young woman, found to be pregnant, was strangled by her father and brother. No 
investigation or prosecution ensued. Other women were killed for attempting to flee their homes, 
often because of domestic violence. Women in the family of the deceased victim of an &#8220;honor 
killing&#8221; are typically too afraid of their own families to make a complaint to police. And they 
know that the police are unlikely to carry out an investigation, or that if they do, bribery will 
ensure impunity for the perpetrators. I received reports of a number of cases in which police did 
attempt to carry out investigations, but senior Government officials interfered with or prevented 
the investigations. Like any other murders, international law requires that these killings be 
investigated, prosecuted, and punished.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>65. Shortly before my visit, the Supreme Court submitted some 100 existing death sentences 
covering the preceding six years to President Karzai, whose approval is required for the carrying 
out of the sentences. There are strong reasons for the imposition of a moratorium on executions, 
quite apart from the larger debate over whether Afghanistan should abolish the death penalty. 
Even the police, prosecutors, and judges acknowledge that corruption and incompetence are 
widespread and that the criminal justice system is incapable of ensuring respect for due process 
rights. Thus, convictions often follow trials that are inherently unfair and unreliable. Those 
sentenced to death often had no access to lawyers, and were convicted following trials in which 
no evidence was produced or no defence witnesses called. And, while some well-informed 
interlocutors did not think that any genuinely innocent person has yet been sentenced to death, 
others felt certain that there are innocents on death row. Proceeding with executions in these 
circumstances would clearly be unjust and violate international legal standards. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>54
</b>  Article 476(1) of the <i>Penal Code of 1976</i> provides that in certain crimes against the person 
</p>
<p>committed by a family member, an action may only be brought based on a complaint by the 
victim. Following a highly questionable interpretation of this provision, there have been cases in 
which the fact that the (dead) victim has not &#8220;chosen&#8221; to bring a complaint against the 
perpetrator has served as a basis for refusing to prosecute. 
<b>55
</b></p>
<p>  In most situations, the isolated killing of individuals will constitute a simple crime and not 
give rise to any governmental responsibility. But once a pattern becomes clear in which the 
response of the Government is clearly inadequate, its responsibility under international human 
rights law becomes applicable. (<i>See</i> E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 71-75.) This is because human rights 
law obligates governments to investigate, prosecute, and punish crimes that impinge upon the 
rights of its people. (ICCPR, art. 2(1).) When doing so is obstructed by existing laws or 
practices, governments are obligated to change these. (ICCPR, art. 2(2).) As the Special 
Rapporteur has repeatedly observed, governments that fail to punish murders because they are 
&#8220;honor killings&#8221; are violating international human rights law. (<i>See</i> E/CN.4/2000/3, paras. 78-84; 
<i>see also</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences on her visit to Afghanistan in 2005, E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.5.) </p>

</p>
<p><b>V. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND PRESERVING EVIDENCE 
FROM PAST CRIMES 
</b></p>
<p>66. I visited the site of the Dasht-e-Leili mass graves in northern Afghanistan. I witnessed 
what informed interlocutors believe to be the remnants of the mass graves of an estimated 
2,000 Taliban fighters who had surrendered to the Afghan Northern Alliance and US Special 
Forces in 2001. The site appeared to have been disturbed, and it seemed likely that bodies had 
been removed. This was confirmed by reports issued subsequent to my visit.<b>56</b> There is an urgent 
need to preserve and document evidence of what took place there, both in terms of understanding 
how those 2,000 surrendered men died, and in determining who is responsible for recent 
attempts to remove evidence from the site. It is necessary that this site, and other mass graves 
throughout Afghanistan, be secured and investigated to address impunity for past crimes, and to 
facilitate reconciliation grounded in a shared understanding of the abuses that have been 
perpetrated and suffered by all sides. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Government of Afghanistan, the international military forces and the 
Governments who send them, and the Taliban and other anti-government elements all have 
a responsibility to take urgent action to reduce civilian casualties and to end unlawful 
killings in Afghanistan. My recommendations follow. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Killings by the international and afghan military forces 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The international forces should review procedures to ensure that air strikes and close 
air support are delivered only when sufficient measures have been taken to verify the 
identity of the target and that the incidental loss of civilian life would not be excessive in 
relation to the anticipated concrete and direct military advantage.</b> 
</p>
<p>69. <b>The international and Afghan forces should review the circumstances in which they 
conduct unannounced night-time raids, to identify situations in which alternative measures 
less dangerous to other residents might be employed.</b> 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Air strikes, raids and other attacks should never be based solely on conduct 
considered &#8220;suspicious&#8221; or on unverified &#8220;tips&#8221;. Rather, the Government and IMF should 
review intelligence sharing arrangements, develop procedures for more reliably vetting 
targets, and ensure that attacks are only conducted based on adequately verified 
information.</b> 
</p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p><b>Killings by the Taliban 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Taliban should cease employing means and methods of warfare that violate 
international humanitarian law, and result in the unlawful killing of civilians. The Taliban 
leadership should issue clear orders to those carrying out attacks to abide by international 
law. This particularly includes the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To stop threatening and assassinating civilians in all circumstances, including 
for their alleged failure to cooperate with the Taliban or for their decision to cooperate 
with the Government; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To cease using civilians as &#8220;human shields&#8221; to deter attacks by international 
and Afghan military forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To stop targeting civilians in suicide attacks, and cease engaging in perfidy 
(unlawful deception) during such attacks, including by disguising themselves as civilians, 
soldiers or police. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>A serious effort should be made - including by human rights groups and 
inter-governmental institutions - to pressure and persuade the Taliban and other armed 
groups to respect human rights and humanitarian law. This effort should include 
developing contacts with them for the sole, dedicated purpose of promoting respect for 
human rights. Such efforts should be undertaken subject to security feasibility and in 
conformity with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1267.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IMF responses to civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The international forces should ensure that allegations that soldiers have committed 
unlawful killings are fully investigated, and ensure that soldiers who have committed 
unlawful killings are prosecuted.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>The international military forces should cooperate more fully with outside 
efforts - especially those of UNAMA and of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights 
Commission - to investigate killings. This should include the expedited declassification and 
more comprehensive sharing of relevant information, including video footage and mission 
story-boards.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>At the conclusion of military investigations into killings of civilians, information on 
the findings and reasoning should be made public. Such information should be provided to 
the families of the victims. In particular, the reasoning of the US Court of Inquiry decision 
on the 4 March 2007 Nangarhar incident should be made public. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The international forces should ensure that, despite the complexity of multiple 
mandates and disparate national criminal justice systems, any directly affected person </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p><b>can go to a military base and promptly receive information on who was responsible for a 
particular operation, or what the status is of any investigation or prosecution. To this end: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Where the actions of soldiers are investigated or prosecuted within the 
troop-sending country, the progress of national processes of investigation, discipline and 
prosecution should be reported back to ISAF headquarters in Afghanistan; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The progress and outcomes of national processes of investigation or prosecution 
should be centrally tracked by ISAF; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) This information should be made available to the various regional commands, 
to the Provincial Reconstruction Teams under their command, and provided to directly 
affected persons when requested. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>When a raid is conducted by foreign intelligence personnel and Afghan forces outside 
the ANA&#8217;s chain-of-command, the responsible Government should publicly clarify its 
involvement when allegations of abuse are made. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The international military forces should provide public information on the estimated 
numbers of civilians killed and wounded in air strikes, raids, and other military operations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Compensation for victims 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The various domestic and international compensation programs should be better 
coordinated. This might usefully involve a high-level policy body that would help the 
various programs to operate in a complementary fashion and an operational, 
information-sharing body that would allow for greater consistency and that would help 
prevent individual cases from falling through the cracks. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Even where compensation programs involve <i>ex gratia</i> payments that carry no 
admission of legal liability, the discretion of commanders in deciding whether to grant 
compensation should be more limited, and general guidelines for making payments should 
be clearly set out.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Commanders should seek out victims and their families rather than waiting to receive 
a complaint or request. In particular, the obstacles women face in accessing compensation 
and other payments should be taken into account in implementing such programs.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Afghan National Police 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Ending unlawful killings by the police should be a priority. To that end, there should 
be a concerted effort to reform the police: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Human rights training, while important, will not be sufficient to prevent abuses 
that are driven by the links between police officers and particular tribes, commanders, and 
politicians. These links must be broken in order to establish a national police force that 
serves and protects the entire community; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Continued efforts to reconstruct the police force as a truly national and 
professional force are vital. The &#8220;focused district development&#8221; training should be strongly 
supported; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) All efforts to supplement the police by establishing or legitimizing local militias 
should be abandoned. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Impunity for killings by police must be urgently addressed: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The interminable dragging out of government investigations and inquiries into 
alleged police killings until such episodes are effectively forgotten reinforces impunity. 
Instead of setting up <i>ad hoc </i>inquiries that go nowhere, a national police investigative task 
force is needed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) In addition, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission&#8217;s 
investigative powers should be strengthened and the Government should have a time limit 
within which to respond to its findings. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The debate over whether the police force should play a primarily &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; 
or &#8220;paramilitary&#8221; role is unhelpful. At this stage the police are clearly obliged to play both 
roles and should be structured and trained accordingly so that they can provide security to 
the populations they serve. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Criminal justice system 
</b>85. <b>The proper investigation of crimes is hampered by poor coordination between police 
and prosecutors. The relationship between police and prosecutors needs to be improved: 
The Minister of Interior and the Attorney General should agree on how to cooperate on the 
combined process of detection and investigation of crimes, and simultaneously issue the 
appropriate orders to police and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The situation of half of the population - women - in relation to killings is largely 
ignored. The criminal justice system must be made accessible to them: 
 (a) Initiatives such as women&#8217;s referral centres should be supported and 
encouraged; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) A special office for female victims should be created by the Attorney-General. 
</b>87. <b>So-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221;, which occur in very large numbers, must be treated as 
the murders that they so clearly are. Police should investigate such cases whether or not the 
family has made a specific complaint to the police. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Measures should be taken to address the corruption that obstructs justice at all levels 
of the criminal justice system: 
 (a) An independent anti-corruption agency should be established by the 
Government, with international support, and endowed with the necessary powers and 
resources to prosecute important cases at all levels of government and the judiciary; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.4 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Insofar as international aid money provides the resources on which much 
corruption thrives, the international community has a responsibility to assist the 
Government with anti-corruption efforts through a range of mechanisms, including the use 
of high-level appointment review boards. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>It is widely agreed that the criminal justice system is not currently capable of reliably 
respecting fair trial standards. To avoid the execution of innocent persons, the Government 
should impose a moratorium on the application of the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transitional justice and preservation of evidence of past crimes 
</b>90. <b>Mass grave sites, including the site at Dasht-e-Laili, must be secured and preserved 
by the Government of Afghanistan with international assistance. Investigations into the 
cause of death of persons whose bodies are buried there, as well as investigations into any 
allegations of attempts to remove such evidence, are necessary. Failures to do so will result 
in continued impunity for those responsible for past abuses, and will undermine the ability 
of Afghans to obtain an accurate historical record of past crimes that is so necessary to
