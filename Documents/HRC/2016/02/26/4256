</p>

<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>that international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
are complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>

inviolability of religious sites in the occupied Palestinian territories, in particular in and 
around the holy city of Jerusalem, 
</p>

Strip against civilians constitutes a severe violation of international humanitarian and 
human rights law and undermines international efforts to achieve a peace settlement,

including the closure of border crossings, constitutes collective punishment and leads to 
disastrous humanitarian, economic, social and environmental consequences,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, end its occupation of the

the Government of Israel to immediately desist from such illegal activities therein;

ensure the respect of internationally recognized sports principles as enshrined in the Charter 
of the International Olympic Committee, particularly the free movement and circulation of 
Palestinian sports teams and athletes within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
administrative staff, and in relation with the external world, and facilitate the access of

international teams and sports figures unhindered access to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory and desist from imposing illegal measures on the construction of sports facilities

decisions to demolish a large number of Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem, including in
