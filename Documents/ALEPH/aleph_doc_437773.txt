REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 
 
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Progress  Energy  Trust  and  all  the  information  in  this  annual 
report are the responsibility of Management and have been approved by the Trust’s Board of Directors. 
 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  by  Management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted 
accounting  principles.    When  alternative  accounting  methods  exist,  Management  has  chosen  those  it  deems  most 
appropriate  in  the  circumstances.    Financial  statements  are  not  precise  since  they  include  certain  amounts  based  on 
estimates and judgments.  Management has determined  such amounts on a  reasonable basis in order to ensure  that the 
financial statements are  presented fairly,  in all  material respects.   Management has prepared  the financial information 
presented elsewhere in the annual report and has ensured that it is consistent with that in the financial statements. 
 
Progress Energy Trust maintains appropriate systems of internal accounting and administrative controls of high quality.  
These  systems  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  financial  information  is  relevant,  reliable  and 
accurate and that the Trust’s assets are properly accounted for and adequately safeguarded. 
 
The  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  Management  fulfills  its  responsibilities  for  financial  reporting 
and  is  ultimately  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving  the  financial  statements.    The  Board  carries  out  this 
responsibility principally through its Audit Committee. 
 
The  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  composed  entirely  of  independent  directors,  meets  regularly  with 
Management,  as  well  as  the  external  auditors,  to  discuss  auditing  (external,  internal  and  joint  venture),  internal 
controls,  accounting  policy  and  financial  reporting  matters.    The  Committee  reviews  the  financial  statements  and 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and recommends their approval to the Board of Directors.  The Committee also 
considers, for review by  the Board and approval by  the unitholders,  the engagement or re-appointment of the external 
auditors. 
 
The  financial  statements  have  been  audited  by  KPMG  LLP,  the  external  auditors,  in  accordance  with  Canadian 
generally  accepted  auditing  standards  on  behalf  of  the  unitholders.    KPMG  LLP  has  full  and  free  access  to  the  Audit 
Committee.

AUDITORS’ REPORT 
 
To the Unitholders of Progress Energy Trust 
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets  of Progress Energy Trust  as at December 31, 2006 and  2005 and  the 
consolidated statements of earnings and deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.  These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require 
that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatements.    An  audit  includes  examining  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the 
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
 
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the  Trust  as  at  December  31,  2006  and  2005  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2006 and 2005 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

PROGRESS ENERGY TRUST 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (tabular amounts are in $ thousands except for trust units and per trust unit amounts)
Progress Energy Trust (“Progress” or the “Trust”) is an open-ended, unincorporated investment trust governed by 
the  laws  of  the  province  of  Alberta.    The  principal  undertaking  of  the  Trust  is  to  indirectly  explore  for,  develop 
and  hold  interests  in  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  through  investments  in  securities  of  subsidiaries  and 
royalty interests in petroleum and natural gas properties.  Progress Energy Ltd. carries on the business of the Trust 
and directly owns the petroleum and natural gas properties and assets related thereto.  The Trust owns, directly and 
indirectly, 100 percent of the common shares (excluding the exchangeable shares – see note 6) of Progress Energy 
Ltd.    The  activities  of  Progress  Energy  Ltd.  are  financed  through  interest  bearing  notes  from  the  Trust  and  third 
party  debt.    The  convertible  debentures  are  direct  obligations  of  the  Trust.    Under  the  Trust  Indenture,  the  Trust 
may  declare  payable  to  unitholders  all  or  any  part  of  the  income  of  the  Trust,  which  is  primarily  comprised  of 
interest earned on debt notes issued to Progress Energy Ltd., as well as, amounts attributed to a net profits interest 
(“NPI”)  agreement  entered  into  with  Progress  Energy  Ltd.    The  aggregate  amounts  received  by  the  Trust  each 
period  are  based  on  the  consolidated  cash  flow  from  operations  before  changes  in  non-cash  working  capital  each 
period, as adjusted on a discretionary basis, for cash withheld to fund capital expenditures.   
 
Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  NPI  agreement,  the  Trust  is  entitled  to  a  payment  from  Progress  Energy  Ltd.  each 
month equal to the amount by which 99% of the gross proceeds from the sale of production exceed 99% of certain 
deductible expenditures (as defined).  Under the terms of the NPI agreement, deductible expenditures may include 
amounts, determined on a discretionary basis, to fund capital expenditures, to repay third party debt and to provide 
for working capital required to carry out the operations of Progress Energy Ltd.
Relationship with ProEx
A  technical  services  agreement  (“Technical  Services  Agreement”)  is  currently  in  place  between  the  Trust  and 
ProEx  Energy  Ltd.  (“ProEx”)  whereby  the  Trust  provides  personnel  and  certain  administrative  and  technical 
services  in  connection  with  the  management,  development,  exploitation  and  operation  of  the  assets  of  ProEx  and 
the marketing of its production.  The Technical Services Agreement has no set termination date and will continue 
until terminated by either party with one year prior written notice to the other party or some other date as mutually 
agreed.    ProEx  has  granted  performance  shares  to  the  employees  of  Progress  as  service  providers.    The  Trust 
provides  these  services  to  ProEx  on  an  expense  reimbursement  basis,  based  on  ProEx’s  monthly  capital  activity 
and production levels relative to the combined capital activity and production levels of both the Trust and ProEx.  
Total expense reimbursed by ProEx for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4.5 million (2005 - $2.8 million).
The Trust and ProEx have joint interest in certain properties and undeveloped land.  These joint interest properties 
are governed by standard industry agreements and  in addition, the Trust has entered into a Protocol Arrangement 
with ProEx that specifies how each company will manage the joint lands in specifically identified areas of interest.  
The  Protocol  Arrangement  identifies  methods  and  processes  to  be  followed  on  both  existing  and  new  lands,  joint 
facilities, marketing, seismic  and surface  rights.  To  ensure good governance practices, both  the Trust and ProEx 
have  each  created  independent  committees  of  their  Board  of  Directors  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  Technical 
Services Agreement and the Protocol Arrangement.
As  at  December  31,  2006,  accounts  payable  included  $4.6  million  (2005  -  $1.8  million)  payable  to  ProEx  which 
includes standard joint venture amounts including revenue.  These amounts were paid subsequent to year end.

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation 
The  Trust  is  involved  in  the  exploration,  development  and  production  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  in  British 
Columbia,  Alberta  and  Saskatchewan.    The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  stated  in  Canadian  dollars  and 
have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and 
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the 
period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its wholly owned subsidiary.
Joint Operations 
Substantially  all  of  the  exploration,  development  and  production  activities  are  conducted  jointly  with  others  and 
accordingly, the Trust only reflects its proportionate interest in such activities.
Measurement Uncertainty 
The  amounts  recorded  for  depletion  and  depreciation  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  property,  plant  and  equipment 
and the asset retirement obligations and related accretion are based on estimates.  The cost recovery ceiling test is 
based  on  estimates  of  proved  reserves,  production  rates,  petroleum  and  natural  gas  prices,  future  costs  and  other 
relevant assumptions.  By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the 
financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be material.
Cash and Short-Term Investments 
Cash and short-term investments consist of cash in the bank, less outstanding cheques and short-term deposits with 
a maturity of less than three months.
Petroleum and Natural Gas Properties 
The  Trust  uses  the  full  cost  method  of  accounting  for  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  under  which  all  costs 
related  to  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves  are  capitalized.  
Such  costs  include  lease  acquisition  costs,  geological  and  geophysical  costs,  carrying  charges  of  non-producing 
properties,  costs  of  drilling  both  productive  and  non-productive  wells,  the  cost  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
production equipment and overhead charges related to exploration and development activities.
In  accordance  with  the  full  cost  accounting  guideline,  the  Trust  evaluates  its  oil  and  gas  assets  to  determine  that 
the  costs  are  recoverable  and  do  not  exceed  the  fair  value  of  the  properties.    The  costs  are  assessed  to  be 
recoverable  if  the  sum  of  the  undiscounted  cash  flows  expected  from  the  production  of  proved  reserves  and  the 
lower  of  cost  and  market  of  unproved  properties  exceed  the  carrying  value  of  the  oil  and  gas  assets.    If  the 
carrying value of the oil and gas assets is not assessed to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to the 
extent  that  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  sum  of  the  discounted  cash  flows  expected  from  the  production  of 
proved  plus  probable  reserves  and  the  lower  of  cost  and  market  of  unproved  properties.    The  cash  flows  are 
estimated using the future product prices and costs and are discounted using the risk-free rate.
Proceeds from the disposition of petroleum and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs except 
for  dispositions  that  would  change  the  rate  of  depletion  and  depreciation  by  20  percent  or  more,  in  which  case  a 
gain or loss would be recorded.
Depletion and Depreciation 
Capitalized  costs,  together  with  estimated  future  capital  costs  associated  with  proved  reserves,  are  depleted  and 
depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proven reserves of petroleum and natural gas 
on a Trust interest basis (working interest plus royalty interest) before the deduction of crown and other royalties 
as  determined  by  independent  engineers.    For  purposes  of  this  calculation,  reserves  and  production  are  converted 
to  equivalent  units  of  oil  based  on  relative  energy  content  of  six  thousand  cubic  feet  of  gas  to  one  barrel  of  oil.  
7
Progress Energy Trust
Costs  of  significant  unproved  properties,  net  of  impairments,  are  excluded  from  the  depletion  and  depreciation 
calculation.
Other  assets,  which  is  comprised  of  office  equipment  and  furniture  and  fixtures,  is  recorded  at  cost  and  are 
depreciated over their useful life on a declining balance basis at 20 percent.
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The Trust records a liability for the fair value of future asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are 
incurred,  normally  when  the  asset  is  purchased  or  developed.    On  recognition  of  the  liability  there  is  a 
corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset within property, plant and equipment, which is 
depleted  on  a  unit-of-production  basis  over  the  life  of  the  reserves.    Estimates  used  are  evaluated  on  a  periodic 
basis and any adjustments are applied prospectively.  The liability is adjusted each reporting period to reflect the 
passage of time, with the accretion charged to earnings.  Actual costs incurred upon settlement of the obligations 
are  charged  against  the  liability.    No  gains  or  losses  on  retirement  activities  were  realized  due  to  settlements 
approximating the estimates.
Goodwill 
Goodwill  is  recognized  on  corporate  acquisitions  when  the  total  purchase  price  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  the  net 
identifiable  assets  of  the  acquired  company.    Goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis  in  the  fourth 
quarter.    If  indications  of  impairment  are  present,  a  loss  would  be  charged  to  earnings  for  the  amount  that  the 
carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
Financial Instruments 
The  Trust  uses  derivative  financial  instruments  from  time  to  time  to  hedge  its  exposure  to  commodity  price  and 
foreign  exchange  fluctuations.    The  Trust  may  enter  into  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  swap  contracts,  options  or 
collars to hedge its exposure to petroleum and natural gas commodity prices and may enter into foreign exchange 
forward  contracts  to  hedge  anticipated  U.S.  dollar  denominated  petroleum  and  natural  gas  sales.    The  derivative 
financial instruments are initiated within the guidelines of the Trust’s risk management policy and the Trust does 
not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The  Trust  designates  its  derivative  financial  instruments  as  hedges  and  performs  the  necessary  procedures  to 
enable the use of hedge accounting.  This includes the formal documentation of the hedge, linking all derivatives 
to specific assets and  liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions and 
performing assessments of hedge effectiveness.   Derivative contracts, accounted for as hedges, are not recognized 
on  the  balance  sheet.    Realized  gains  and  losses  on  these  contracts  are  recognized  in  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
revenue  and  cash  flows  in  the  same  period  in  which  the  revenues  associated  with  the  hedged  transaction  are 
recognized.  Premiums paid or received are deferred and amortized to earnings over the term of the contract.
Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges are recorded at their 
fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from the sale of petroleum and natural gas are recorded when title passes to an external party.
Income Taxes 
The  Trust  follows  the  liability  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes.    Temporary  differences  arising  from  the 
differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to 
calculate  future  income  tax  assets  or  liabilities.    Future  income  tax  assets  or  liabilities  are  calculated  using  tax 
rates anticipated to apply in the periods that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The  Trust  is  a  taxable  entity  under  the  Income  Tax  Act  (Canada)  and  is  taxable  only  on  income  that  is  not 
distributed or distributable to the unitholders.  As the Trust distributes all of its taxable income to the unitholders 
and meets the requirements of the Income Tax Act (Canada) applicable to the Trust, no provision for income taxes 
has  been  made  for  the  Trust.    The  future  income  tax  liability  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  represents  the 
future income tax liability of the Trust’s subsidiary.
Progress Energy Trust

On  October  31,  2006  the  federal  government  announced  its  intention  to  begin  taxing  distributions  from  trusts 
beginning  January  1,  2011.    The  government  has  also  proposed  to  limit  the  growth  of  existing  trusts  by  limiting 
new  equity  issues  to  40  percent  of  that  trust’s  October  31,  2006  market  capitalization    (“benchmark”)  for  2007, 
and an additional 20 percent of the benchmark for each of 2008, 2009 and 2010.  For Progress, the limits would be 
$476.8  million  for  2007  and  $238.4  million  for  each  of  2008,  2009  and  2010  with  any  unused  balance  rolling 
forward  to  the  following  year.    The  government  also  announced  its  intention  to  allow  trust  to  corporation 
conversions  to  occur  on  a  tax-deferred  basis  (no  immediate  tax  impact)  for  unitholders.    Given  these  proposed 
rules have not been substantially enacted into law, there has been no adjustment to future income taxes in regards 
to this announcement.
Unit Based Compensation 
The Trust has established a Performance Unit Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for employees and directors of the Trust 
or its subsidiary.  The Trust uses the fair value method for valuing unit based compensation and unit option grants.  
Under this method, compensation cost attributed to performance units granted is measured at the fair value at the 
grant  date  and  expensed  over  the  vesting  period  with  a  corresponding  increase  to  contributed  surplus.    Upon  the 
settlement  of  the  Plan,  the  previously  recognized  value  in  contributed  surplus  will  be  recorded  as  an  increase  to 
unitholders’ capital.
The  Trust  has  not  incorporated  an  estimated  forfeiture  rate  for  performance  units  that  will  not  vest,  rather,  the 
Trust accounts for actual forfeitures as they occur.
Per Unit Information 
Per unit information is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of trust units outstanding during the 
fiscal year.  Diluted per unit information includes  the  impact of  the  issuable exchangeable shares, as well as, the 
potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or  other  contracts  to  issue  units  were  exercised  or  converted  to 
units.    Diluted  per  unit  information  is  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method  that  assumes  any  proceeds 
received by the Trust upon the exercise of in-the-money unit options plus the unamortized unit compensation cost 
would be used to buy back trust units at the average market price for the period.
Exchangeable Securities – Non-Controlling Interest 
interest  given  exchangeable 
The  Trust  accounts  for  outstanding  exchangeable  shares  as  non-controlling 
shareholders can dispose of their shares without having to exchange them for trust units.   The exchangeable shares 
of  the  Trust’s  subsidiary  trade  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange.    As  a  result,  the  exchangeable  shares  have  been 
classified  as  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  outside  of  unitholders’  equity.    Net 
earnings  attributable  to  the  exchangeable  shares  is  charged  to  the  consolidated  statement  of  earnings  as  non-
controlling  interest expense with a corresponding  increase to non-controlling interest on  the consolidated  balance 
sheet.
Each redemption of exchangeable shares held by previous Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders is accounted for as a 
step-purchase resulting in an increase to property, plant and equipment, an increase to unitholders’ capital and an 
increase  in  the  Trust’s  future  income  tax  liability.    The  non-controlling  interest  activity  for  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2006 and 2005 is disclosed in note 6.

As described in note 1, the redemption of exchangeable shares held by previous Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders 
are  accounted  for  as  a  step-purchase.    Consequently,  a  charge  of  $13.5  million  was  made  to  property,  plant  and 
equipment for the year ended December 31, 2006 (2005 - $22.2 million). 
 
In June 2006, the Trust disposed of its assets in the Unity, Saskatchewan area to a private company for 2,860,000 
common shares valued at $1.20 per share for a total consideration of $3.4 million. 
 
The calculation of 2006 depletion and depreciation included an estimated $34.5 million (2005 - $26.9 million) for 
future  development  costs  associated  with  proved  undeveloped  reserves  and  excluded  $24.0  million  (2005  -  $24.0 
million)  for  the  estimated  future  net  realizable  value  of  production  equipment  and  facilities  and  $58.2  million 
(2005 - $65.7 million) for the estimated value of unproven properties.  Depletion and depreciation expense for the 
year ended December 31, 2006 was $93.0 million (2005 - $90.6 million). 
 
Included  in  the  Trust’s  property,  plant  and  equipment  balance  is  $14.8  million  (2005  -  $12.5  million),  net  of 
accumulated depletion, related to asset retirement obligations ($22.9 million before accumulated depletion (2005 - 
$18.7 million)) (Refer to note 5).   
 
The  Trust  capitalized  approximately  $1.2  million  of  geological  and  geophysical  expenses  associated  with  the 
exploration and development of capital assets during the year ended December 31, 2006 (2005 - $1.4 million). 
 
The Trust performed a ceiling test calculation at December 31, 2006 resulting in the undiscounted cash flows from 
proved  reserves  and  the  lower  of  cost  and  market  of  unproved  properties  exceeding  the  carrying  value  of  oil  and 
gas assets.  The following table summarizes the future benchmark prices the Trust used in the ceiling test:

The  Trust’s  credit  facilities  totaling  $215  million  are  with  a  syndicate  of  banks  consisting  of  a  $200  million 
extendible  revolving  term  credit  facility  and  a  $15  million  working  capital  credit  facility.    The  facilities  are 
available on a revolving basis for a period of at least 364 days until May 29, 2007, and such initial term out date 
may  be  extended  for  further  364  day  periods  at  the  request  of  the  Trust,  subject  to  approval  by  the  banks.  
Following the term out date, the facilities will be available on a non-revolving basis for a one year term, at which 
time  the  facilities  would  be  due  and  payable.    Various  borrowing  options  are  available  under  the  facilities 
Progress Energy Trust
10
including  prime  rate  based  advances  and  banker’s  acceptance  loans.    Average  cost  of  borrowing  under  these 
facilities  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006  was  5.1  percent  (2005  –  4.2  percent).    The  credit  facilities  are 
secured  by  a  $500  million  fixed  and  floating  charge  debenture  on  the  assets  of  the  Trust  and  by  a  guarantee  and 
subordination  provided  by  Progress  in  respect  of  the  Trust’s  obligations.    The  $215  million  borrowing  base  is 
subject to semi-annual review by the banks. 
 
4.  CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
On  August  22,  2006  the  Trust  issued  $75  million  principal  amount  of  6.25  percent  convertible  unsecured 
subordinated  debentures  (the  “6.25  percent  debentures”)  for  net  proceeds  of  $71.7  million.    The  6.25  percent 
debentures  pay  interest  semi-annually  and  are  convertible  at  the  option  of  the  holder  at  any  time  into  fully  paid 
trust  units  at  a  conversion  price  of  $19.50  per  trust  unit.    The  6.25  percent  debentures  mature  on  September  30, 
2011, at which time they are due and payable.  The Trust may elect to satisfy the interest and principal obligations 
by the issuance of trust units.  The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding bank indebtedness. 
 
On  February  2,  2005  the  Trust  issued  $100  million  principal  amount  of  6.75  percent  convertible  unsecured 
subordinated  debentures  (the  “6.75  percent  debentures”)  for  net  proceeds  of  $95.5  million.    The  6.75  percent 
debentures  pay  interest  semi-annually  and  are  convertible  at  the  option  of  the  holder  at  any  time  into  fully  paid 
trust units at a conversion price of $15.00 per trust unit.  The 6.75 percent debentures mature on June 30, 2010 at 
which time they are due and payable.  The Trust may elect to satisfy the interest and principal obligations by the 
issuance of trust units.  The net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding bank indebtedness. 
 
The 6.25 percent debentures and the 6.75 percent debentures (the “Debentures”) have been classified as debt, net 
of issue costs and net of the fair value of the conversion feature at the date of issue which has been classified as 
part of unitholders’ equity.  The issue costs will be amortized over the term of the Debentures and the debt portion 
will accrete up to the principal balance at maturity.  The accretion, amortization of issue costs and the interest paid 
are expensed within interest and financing expense on the consolidated statements of earnings.  If the Debentures 
are  converted  to  units,  a  portion  of  the  value  of  the  conversion  feature  under  unitholders’  equity  will  be 
reclassified  to  unitholders’  capital  along  with  the  conversion  price  paid.    The  following  table  sets  forth  a 
reconciliation of the Debenture activity:

5.  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
 
Asset retirement obligations were estimated based on the Trust’s net ownership interest in all wells and facilities, 
the  estimated  costs  to  abandon  and  reclaim  the  wells  and  facilities  and  the  estimated  timing  of  the  costs  to  be 
incurred in future periods.  The total undiscounted amount of the estimated cash flows required to settle the asset 
retirement  obligations  is  approximately  $56.7  million  which  will  be  incurred  over  the  next  41  years  with  the 
majority  of  costs  incurred  between  2009  and  2020.    A  credit  adjusted  risk-free  rate  of  eight  percent  was  used  to 
calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations.  In 2005, the Trust increased the inflation rate used to 
calculate the obligations from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent and revised its estimate for abandonment and reclamation 
costs in certain areas.  The impact of these revised estimates was an increase to the liability of $1.7 million.

6.  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST – EXCHANGEABLE SHARES
The  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  consists  of  the  book  value  of  exchangeable  shares 
issued to Progress Energy Ltd. shareholders and the fair value of exchangeable shares issued to Cequel Energy Inc. 
shareholders as part of a Plan of Arrangement that became effective on July 2, 2004, plus net earnings attributable 
to  the  exchangeable  shares,  less  exchangeable  shares  (and  related  cumulative  earnings)  redeemed.    The  non-
controlling  interest  charge  on  the  consolidated  statement  of  earnings  represents  the  share  of  net  earnings 
attributable  to  the  exchangeable  shares  based  on  the  trust  units  issuable  for  exchangeable  shares  in  proportion  to 
total  trust  units  issued  and  issuable  each  period  end.    The  activity  for  non-controlling  interest  for  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows:

The exchangeable shares can be converted, at the option of the holder, into trust units at any time and are listed on 
the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol PGE.  If the number of exchangeable shares outstanding is less than 
1,600,000, the Trust can elect to redeem the exchangeable shares for trust units or an amount in cash equal to the 
amount determined by multiplying the exchange ratio on the last business day prior to the redemption date by the 
current  market  price  of  a  trust  unit  on  the  last  business  day  prior  to  such  redemption  date.    The  number  of  trust 
units  issued  upon  conversion  is  based  on  the  exchange  ratio  in  effect  on  the  date  of  conversion.    The  exchange 
ratio is calculated monthly based on the five day weighted average trust unit trading price preceding the monthly 
effective date.  The exchangeable shares are not eligible for cash distributions.

Retraction of Exchangeable Shares 
Exchangeable  shareholders  may  redeem  their  shares  at  any  time  by  delivering  their  share  certificates  to  the 
Trustee,  together  with  a  properly  completed  retraction  request.    The  retraction  price  will  be  satisfied  with  trust 
units  equal  to  the  amount  determined  by  multiplying  the  exchange  ratio  on  the  last  business  day  prior  to  the 
retraction date by the number of exchangeable shares redeemed. 
 
Redemption of Exchangeable Shares 
On July 2, 2009 the exchangeable shares will be redeemed by the Trust unless the Board of Directors of Progress 
Energy  Ltd.  elect  to  extend  the  redemption  period.    The  exchangeable  shares  will  be  redeemed  by  either  issuing 
units or payment in cash for an amount equivalent to the value of the exchangeable shares at the current exchange 
ratio.  
 
7.  UNITHOLDERS’ CAPITAL
The Trust Indenture provides that an unlimited number of trust units may be authorized and issued.  Each trust unit 
is transferable, carries the right to one vote and represents an equal undivided beneficial interest in any 
distributions from the Trust and in the assets of the Trust in the event of termination or winding-up of the Trust.  
All trust units are of the same class with equal rights and privileges.

Redemption Right 
Unitholders  may  redeem  their  trust  units  for  cash  at  any  time,  up  to  a  maximum  of  $250,000  in  any  calendar 
month,  by  delivering  their  unit  certificates  to  the  Trustee,  together  with  a  properly  completed  notice  requesting 
redemption.    The  redemption  amount  per  trust  unit  will  be  the  lesser  of  90  percent  of  the  simple  average  closing 
price of the trust units on the principal market on which they are traded for the 10 day trading period after the trust 
units have been validly tendered for the redemption and the closing market price of the trust units on the principal 
market on which they are traded on the date on which they were validly tendered for redemption, or if there was no 
trade of the trust units on that date, the average of the last bid and ask prices of the trust units on that date.
Net Earnings Per Unit 
 
The following table summarizes the weighted average trust units used in calculating net earnings per unit: 
 
 
Weighted average trust units - basic 
Trust units issuable on conversion of exchangeable 
shares(1) 
Performance units 
Weighted average trust units - diluted 
(1) Calculated based on the weighted average exchangeable shares outstanding during the year at the year end exchange ratio. 
 
An adjustment  to  the numerator of $15.5 million for  the year ended December  31, 2006  (2005  - $18.0  million)  is 
required in the diluted earnings per unit calculation to provide for earnings attributable to non-controlling interest.

Units  potentially  issuable  on  the  conversion  of  the  Debentures  are  anti-dilutive  and  are  not  included  in  the 
calculation of diluted weighted average units for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Performance Unit Incentive Plan 
 
The Trust has established a Performance Unit Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for employees and directors of the Trust 
or  its  subsidiary.    The  number  of  units  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  Plan  shall  not  exceed  5  percent  of  the 
aggregate  number  of  issued  and  outstanding  units  of  the  Trust  and  including  the  number  of  units  which  may  be 
issued  on  the  exchange  of  the  outstanding  exchangeable  shares,  which  may  be  converted  into  trust  units.    Under 
the Plan, performance units shall be granted by the Board of Directors of Progress Energy Ltd. from time to time 
at  its  sole  discretion.    The  performance  units  will  vest  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  date  of  grant  and  actual 
payment will be determined based on the performance of the Trust relative to its peers.  Performance factors range 
from  0.5  to  1.5  times  the  initial  performance  units  granted.    Over  the  three  year  term  the  performance  units  will 
attract  distributions.    The  Trust  expects  to  pay  out  the  distribution  portion  in  cash  while  the  units  earned  will  be 
issued from treasury.   
 
As at December 31, 2006 there are 380,567 performance units outstanding that were granted effective July 2, 2004.  
As  a  result,  the  fair  value  of  the  performance  units  granted,  calculated  using  a  performance  factor  of  1.0,  is 
approximately $5.1 million of which $4.5 million will be amortized through unit based compensation expense and 
$0.6 million will be capitalized over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.  
 
As at December 31, 2006 there are 512,300 performance units outstanding that were granted effective July 2, 2005.  
The fair value of the performance units using a performance factor of 1.0 is approximately $8.1 million of which 
$7.0 million will be amortized through unit based compensation expense and $1.1 million will be capitalized over 
the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.   
 
As at December 31, 2006 there are 407,850 performance units outstanding that were granted effective July 2, 2006.  
The fair value of the performance units using a performance factor of 1.0 is approximately $6.5 million of which 
$5.6 million will be amortized through unit based compensation expense and $0.9 million will be capitalized over 
the vesting period with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2006 $4.9 million (2005 – $3.0 million) was charged to unit based compensation 
expense and $0.8 million (2005 – $0.3 million) was capitalized relating to the total performance units outstanding.

FUTURE INCOME TAXES
8. 
 
The  Trust  is  a  taxable  entity  under  the  Income  Tax  Act  (Canada)  and  is  taxable  only  on  income  that  is  not 
distributed or distributable to unitholders.  Cash distributions for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $125.6 
million (2005 - $116.5 million), reducing the Trust’s expected future income tax expense for the year.   
 
Included in the 2006 provision is a recovery of $9.2 million relating to a reduction in future federal and provincial 
tax rates enacted during the year and the impact of certain tax balance adjustments. 
 
During 2005, income tax audits were performed on the 2002 and 2003 tax returns of Cequel and Progress Energy 
Ltd.    As  a  result  of  these  audits,  the  provision  for  future  income  tax  expense  for  2005  includes  a  charge  of  $3.5 
million due to tax pool adjustments. 
 
The combined provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings and deficit reflect an effective tax rate 
which differs from the expected statutory tax rate.  Differences were accounted for as follows:
Earnings before taxes 
Statutory income tax rate 
Expected income taxes 
Add (deduct) 
    Net income of the Trust 
  Non-deductible crown charges  
  Resource allowance 
  Reduction  in  income  tax  rates  and  certain  tax  balance
adjustments 
Income tax audit adjustments

As  at  December  31,  2006,  the  Trust’s  corporate  subsidiary,  Progress  Energy  Ltd.,  has  federal  tax  pools  of 
approximately $268.0 million (2005 - $225.0 million) available for deduction against future taxable income.  The 
Trust currently has tax pools available of $85.0 million compared to their related carrying amounts on the balance 
sheet  of  $67.4  million,  resulting  in  temporary  differences  in  a  net  asset  position  of  $17.6  million  (2005  -  $8.8 
million) for which no future tax has been recorded.
The following are the combined tax pools available for the Trust and its corporate subsidiary:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
The Trust’s financial instruments recognized on the balance sheet consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable 
and  accrued  liabilities,  bank  debt  and  convertible  debentures.    The  fair  value  of  these  financial  instruments, 
excluding  the  convertible  debentures,  approximate  their  carrying  amounts  due  to  their  short  terms  to  maturity  or 
the  indexed  rate  of  interest  on  the  bank  debt.    The  fair  value  of  the  Debentures  outstanding  as  at  December  31, 
2006 was approximately $130.2 million.
Credit Risk 
 
The  Trust’s  accounts  receivable  are  with  customers  and  joint  venture  partners  in  the  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
business and are subject to normal credit risks.  Concentration of credit risk is mitigated by marketing production 
to numerous purchasers under normal industry sale and payment terms.  The Trust routinely assesses the financial 
strength of its customers.
The Trust may be exposed to certain losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to commodity price 
contracts.  The Trust mitigates this risk by entering into transactions with highly rated major financial institutions.
Commodity Price Contracts 
 
The Trust has entered into several derivative financial instruments for the purpose of protecting its cash flow from 
operations before changes in non-cash working capital from the volatility of natural gas prices.  For the year ended 
December 31, 2006, the Trust’s natural gas price risk management program had a net gain of $29.9 million (2005 - 
$5.7 million net loss) which is included in petroleum and natural gas revenue on the statements of earnings. 
 
Contracts outstanding in respect to financial instruments are as follows:
Swap - call spread 
(1) Costless collar and call spread strike prices indicate minimum floor and maximum ceiling
$7.43 –$8.43
10,000 gj/d
The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  natural  gas  financial  instruments  that  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  was  a  gain  of 
$14.0  million  as  at  December  31,  2006  and  represents  the  amount  the  Trust  would  receive  to  terminate  the 
contracts at December 31, 2006.  These instruments have no carrying value recorded in the financial statements.
