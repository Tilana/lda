</b></p>
<p><i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>20/16, in which the Council requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to 
</p>
<p>present to the Council before the end of 2015 draft basic principles and guidelines on 
</p>
<p>remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or 
</p>
<p>detention to bring proceedings before a court in order that the court may decide without 
</p>
<p>delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the 
</p>
<p>detention is not lawful. The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on 
</p>
<p>Remedies and Procedures on the Right of Anyone Deprived of Their Liberty to Bring 
</p>
<p>Proceedings Before a Court annexed to the present report are based on international law, 
</p>
<p>standards and recognized good practice, and are intended to provide States with guidance 
</p>
<p>on fulfilling, in compliance with international law, their obligation to avoid the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>1. The right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before a 
</p>
<p>court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her 
</p>
<p>detention and obtain appropriate remedies upon a successful challenge, is widely 
</p>
<p>recognized in international and regional human rights instruments, the jurisprudence of the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice and of international human rights mechanisms, including in 
</p>
<p>the reports and country visits of treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders, 
</p>
<p>regional human rights mechanisms, in the domestic law of States and the jurisprudence of 
</p>
<p>national courts. 
</p>
<p>2. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court is a self-standing 
</p>
<p>human right, the absence of which constitutes a human rights violation. It is a judicial 
</p>
<p>remedy designed to protect personal freedom and physical integrity against arbitrary arrest, 
</p>
<p>detention, including secret detention, exile, forced disappearance or risk of torture and other 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is also a means of determining the 
</p>
<p>whereabouts and state of health of detainees and of identifying the authority ordering or 
</p>
<p>carrying out the deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>3. This judicial remedy is essential to preserve legality in a democratic society. The 
</p>
<p>effective exercise of this fundamental safeguard of personal liberty in all situations of 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty, without delay and without exception, resulting in appropriate 
</p>
<p>remedies and reparations, including an entitlement to release upon a successful challenge, 
</p>
<p>must be guaranteed by the State. Numerous international and regional human rights bodies 
</p>
<p>and instruments have articulated a strong position on the non-derogability in any 
</p>
<p>circumstance of the right to bring such proceedings before a court. The Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Arbitrary Detention urges all States to incorporate this position into their national laws. In 
</p>
<p>practice, the absence of inclusive and robust national legal frameworks to ensure the 
</p>
<p>effective exercise of the right to bring proceedings before a court has resulted in a 
</p>
<p>protection gap for persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>4. In this light, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 20/16, requested the 
</p>
<p>Working Group to present to the Council draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies 
</p>
<p>and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to 
</p>
<p>bring proceedings before a court in order that the court may decide without delay on the 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group has complied closely with the request of the Council, that it seek the 
</p>
<p>views of States, relevant United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies and, in particular, the Human Rights Committee, other special procedures, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders. In 2013, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group distributed a questionnaire to stakeholders in which it requested details 
</p>
<p>on the right to bring such proceedings in their respective legal framework.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group submitted to the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-seventh 
</p>
<p>session, a thematic report on the international, regional and national legal frameworks on 
</p>
<p>the right to challenge the lawfulness and arbitrariness of detention before court 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/47). In the report, the Working Group documented general practice accepted as 
</p>
<p>law, and further best practices in applying the requirements of international law. States and 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders continued to make submissions up until the final session, when the 
</p>
<p>document was adopted, adding to the materials available to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>6. On 1 and 2 September 2014, the Working Group convened a global consultation in 
</p>
<p>Geneva to bring together experts to elaborate on the scope and content of the right to bring 
</p>
<p>proceedings before a court and to receive without delay appropriate remedies, and to allow 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to contribute to the development of the Basic Principles and Guidelines (see 
</p>
<p>annex). The background paper drew on the thematic report submitted to the Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/47) to set out the substantive and procedural obligations of States to ensure the 
</p>
<p>meaningful exercise of the right to bring proceedings before a court and current State </p>


<p><b> 3</b> 
</p>
<p>practice in implementing each of the obligations, highlighting several examples of good 
</p>
<p>practice.  
</p>
<p>7. The Basic Principles and Guidelines, drawn from international standards and 
</p>
<p>recognized good practice, are aimed at providing States with guidance on the fundamental 
</p>
<p>principles on which the laws and procedures regulating the right to bring proceedings 
</p>
<p>before a court should be based, and on the elements required for its effective exercise. 
</p>
<p>8. In the present Basic Principles and Guidelines, the terms &#8220;everyone&#8221;, &#8220;anyone&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;any person&#8221; denote every human being without discrimination based on race, colour, sex, 
</p>
<p>property, birth, age, national, ethnic or social origin, language, religion, economic 
</p>
<p>condition, political or other opinion, sexual orientation or gender identity, disability or other 
</p>
<p>status, and any ground that aims at or may result in undermining the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights on a basis of equality. It includes, but is not limited to, girls and boys, soldiers, 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, including psychosocial and intellectual disabilities, lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, non-nationals, including migrants regardless of 
</p>
<p>their migration status, refugees and asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, stateless 
</p>
<p>persons and trafficked persons and persons at risk of being trafficked, persons accused or 
</p>
<p>convicted of a crime, persons who have or are suspected to have engaged in the preparation, 
</p>
<p>commission or instigation of acts of terrorism, drug users, persons with dementia, human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders and activists, older persons, persons living with HIV/AIDS and other 
</p>
<p>serious communicable or chronic diseases, indigenous peoples, sex workers and minorities 
</p>
<p>based on national or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity. 
</p>
<p>9. Deprivation of personal liberty is without free consent. For the purposes of the 
</p>
<p>present Basic Principles and Guidelines, the term &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; covers the period 
</p>
<p>from the initial moment of apprehension until arrest, pretrial and post-trial detention 
</p>
<p>periods. This includes placing individuals in temporary custody in protective detention or in 
</p>
<p>international or transit zones in stations, ports and airports, house arrest, rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>through labour, retention in recognized and non-recognized centres for non-nationals, 
</p>
<p>including migrants regardless of their migration status, refugees and asylum seekers, and 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, gathering centres, hospitals, psychiatric or other medical 
</p>
<p>facilities or any other facilities where they remain under constant surveillance, given that 
</p>
<p>may not only amount to restrictions to personal freedom of movement but also constitute 
</p>
<p>the de facto deprivation of liberty. It also includes detention during armed conflicts and 
</p>
<p>emergency situations, administrative detention for security reasons, and the detention of 
</p>
<p>individuals considered civilian internees under international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>10. In the present Basic Principles and Guidelines, deprivation of liberty is regarded as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;arbitrary&#8221; in the following cases:  
</p>
<p>(a) When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis to justify the deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty (such as when a person is kept in detention after the completion of his or her 
</p>
<p>sentence, or despite an amnesty law applicable to the detainee, or when a person detained as 
</p>
<p>a prisoner of war, is kept in detention after the cessation of effective hostilities);  
</p>
<p>(b) When the deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of the rights or 
</p>
<p>freedoms guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 
</p>
<p>25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;  
</p>
<p>(c)  When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating 
</p>
<p>to the right to a fair trial, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 
</p>
<p>the relevant international instruments accepted by the State concerned, is of such gravity as 
</p>
<p>to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character;  </p>


<p>(d) When asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees are subjected to prolonged 
</p>
<p>administrative custody without the possibility of administrative or judicial review or 
</p>
<p>remedy;  
</p>
<p>(e)  When the deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of international law for 
</p>
<p>reasons of discrimination based on birth, national, ethnic or social origin, language, 
</p>
<p>religion, economic condition, political or other opinion, gender, sexual orientation, 
</p>
<p>disability or other status, and which is aimed at or may result in ignoring the equality of 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. In deliberation No. 9 concerning the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty under customary international law (see A/HRC/22/44, paras. 37-75), the Working 
</p>
<p>Group restated its constant jurisprudence on the prohibition of all forms of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty, and demonstrated that it is general practice accepted as law, 
</p>
<p>constituting customary international law and a peremptory norm (<i>jus cogens</i>). In its annual 
</p>
<p>report for 2013 (A/HRC/27/48), the Working Group restated that the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness in the deprivation of liberty requires a strict review of the lawfulness, necessity 
</p>
<p>and proportionality of any measure depriving anyone of their liberty; this standard of 
</p>
<p>review is applicable at all stages of legal proceedings. In the interactive dialogue held at the 
</p>
<p>twenty-second session of the Council, States gave general support for the conclusions of the 
</p>
<p>deliberation. The present Basic Principles and Guidelines adopt the criteria laid out by the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice in its judgement of 20 July 2012 concerning Questions 
</p>
<p>relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (<i>Belgium v. Senegal</i>) when confirming 
</p>
<p>the status of the prohibition of torture as a peremptory norm (<i>jus cogens</i>). The prohibition 
</p>
<p>of arbitrary detention is supported by the widespread international practice and on the 
</p>
<p><i>opinio juris</i> of States. It appears in numerous international instruments of universal 
</p>
<p>application and has been introduced into the domestic law of almost all States. Lastly, 
</p>
<p>arbitrary detention is regularly denounced within national and international forums. 
</p>
<p>12. For the purposes of the present Basic Principles and Guidelines, deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty is regarded as &#8220;unlawful&#8221; when it is not on such grounds and in accordance with 
</p>
<p>procedures established by law. It refers to both detention that violates domestic law and 
</p>
<p>detention that is incompatible with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, general 
</p>
<p>principles of international law, customary international law, international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>as well as with the relevant international human rights instruments accepted by the States 
</p>
<p>concerned. It also includes detention that may have been lawful at its inception but has 
</p>
<p>become unlawful because the individual has served the entire sentence of imprisonment, 
</p>
<p>following the expiry of the period for which the person was remanded into custody or 
</p>
<p>because the circumstances that initially justified the detention have changed. 
</p>
<p>13. States employ different models to regulate the exercise of the right to bring 
</p>
<p>proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention and to 
</p>
<p>obtain appropriate remedies without delay. Although no specific model is endorsed in the 
</p>
<p>principles and guidelines, States are encouraged to guarantee this right in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice.  
</p>
<p>14. The Basic Principles and Guidelines are based on the recognition that States should 
</p>
<p>take a series of measures to establish and/or to reinforce the procedural safeguards provided 
</p>
<p>to persons deprived of their liberty.  
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group recalls the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>which refers to the determination of the peoples of the United Nations &#8220;to establish 
</p>
<p>conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and 
</p>
<p>other sources of international law can be maintained&#8221;. One of the purposes of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations is &#8220;to maintain international peace and security&#8221; and, to that end, &#8220;to take effective 
</p>
<p>collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the </p>


<p><b> 5</b> 
</p>
<p>suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by 
</p>
<p>peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, 
</p>
<p>adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach 
</p>
<p>of the peace&#8221;. Furthermore, according to Article 2 of the Charter, &#8220;all Members shall give 
</p>
<p>the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present 
</p>
<p>Charter&#8221;. The Working Group recalls the reaffirmation in numerous Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions, including in resolution 2170 (2014), of the duty of Member States to comply 
</p>
<p>with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, 
</p>
<p>refugee and international humanitarian law, underscoring also that effective counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism measures and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law 
</p>
<p>are complementary and mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>16. Recognizing that certain groups are more vulnerable when deprived of their liberty, 
</p>
<p>the Basic Principles and Guidelines provide specific provisions for women and girls, 
</p>
<p>children, persons with disabilities and non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their 
</p>
<p>migration status, refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons.  
</p>
<p>17. The scope of the Basic Principles and Guidelines is distinct from the right of anyone 
</p>
<p>arrested or detained on a criminal charge to be brought promptly before a judge or other 
</p>
<p>judicial authority and tried within a reasonable time or be released.  
</p>
<p>18. Nothing in the present Basic Principles and Guidelines should be interpreted as 
</p>
<p>providing a lesser degree of protection than that provided under existing national laws and 
</p>
<p>regulations and international and regional human rights conventions or covenants 
</p>
<p>applicable to the liberty and security of person.  </p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the Right of Persons Deprived of Their Liberty to Bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>Proceedings Before a Court</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Principle 1  
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to be free from arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>1. Recognizing that everyone has the right to be free from arbitrary or unlawful 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty, everyone is guaranteed the right to take proceedings before a court in 
</p>
<p>order that that court may decide on the arbitrariness or lawfulness of the detention, and to 
</p>
<p>obtain without delay appropriate and accessible remedies.  
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 2  
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibilities of the State and others 
</b></p>
<p>2. National legal systems at the highest possible level, including, where applicable, in 
</p>
<p>the Constitution, must guarantee the right to take proceedings before a court to challenge 
</p>
<p>the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and 
</p>
<p>accessible remedies. A comprehensive set of applicable procedures shall be enacted to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the right is accessible and effective, including the provision of procedural and 
</p>
<p>reasonable accommodation, for all persons in all situations of deprivation of liberty. The 
</p>
<p>human and financial resources necessary shall be allocated to the administration of the 
</p>
<p>justice system. The right to bring such proceedings before a court must also be protected in 
</p>
<p>private relationships such that the duties apply to international organizations and, under 
</p>
<p>certain circumstances, to non-State actors. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 3  
</b></p>
<p><b>Scope of application 
</b></p>
<p>3. Any individual who is deprived of liberty in any situation by or on behalf of a 
</p>
<p>governmental authority at any level, including detention by non-State actors that is 
</p>
<p>authorized by domestic law, has the right to take proceedings before a court in the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of his or her deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies. Exerting authority over 
</p>
<p>any form of detention will constitute the effective control over the detention and make the 
</p>
<p>detainee subject to the State&#8217;s jurisdiction. Involvement in detention will give the State the 
</p>
<p>duty to ensure the detainee&#8217;s right to bring proceedings before a court. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 4  
</b></p>
<p><b>Non-derogability 
</b></p>
<p>4. The right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention and to obtain without delay appropriate and accessible remedies is 
</p>
<p>not derogable under international law.  
</p>
<p>5. The right is not to be suspended, rendered impracticable, restricted or abolished 
</p>
<p>under any circumstances, even in times of war, armed conflict or public emergency that 
</p>
<p>threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed. </p>


<p><b> 7</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The international law review of measures to accommodate practical constraints in 
</p>
<p>the application of some procedural elements of the right to bring proceedings will depend 
</p>
<p>upon the character, intensity, pervasiveness and particular context of the emergency and 
</p>
<p>upon the corresponding proportionality and reasonableness of the derogation. Such 
</p>
<p>measures must not, in their adoption, represent any abuse of power nor have the effect of 
</p>
<p>negating the existence of the right to bring such proceedings before a court. 
</p>
<p>7. Any such practical measures in the application of the right to bring proceedings 
</p>
<p>before a court to challenge the detention are permitted only to the extent and for the period 
</p>
<p>of time strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are 
</p>
<p>consistent with the State&#8217;s other obligations under international law, including provisions of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law relating to the deprivation of liberty, and are non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 5  
</b></p>
<p><b>Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies 
</p>
<p>may be exercised by anyone regardless of race, colour, sex, property, birth, age, national, 
</p>
<p>ethnic or social origin, language, religion, economic condition, political or other opinion, 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation or gender identity, asylum seekingor migration status, or disability or any 
</p>
<p>other status. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>The court as reviewing body  
</b></p>
<p>9. A court shall review the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty. It 
</p>
<p>shall be established by law and bear the full characteristics of a competent, independent and 
</p>
<p>impartial judicial authority capable of exercising recognizable judicial powers, including 
</p>
<p>the power to order immediate release if the detention is found to be arbitrary or unlawful.  
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to be informed  
</b></p>
<p>10. Persons deprived of their liberty shall be informed about their rights and obligations 
</p>
<p>under law through appropriate and accessible means. Among other procedural safeguards, 
</p>
<p>this includes the right to be informed, in a language and a means, mode or format that the 
</p>
<p>detainee understands, of the reasons justifying the deprivation of liberty, the possible 
</p>
<p>judicial avenue to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>and the right to bring proceedings before the court and to obtain without delay appropriate 
</p>
<p>and accessible remedies. 
</p>
<p><b>   Principle 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Time frame for bringing proceedings before a court  
</b></p>
<p>11. The right to bring proceedings before a court without delay to challenge the 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to obtain without delay 
</p>
<p>appropriate and accessible remedies applies from the moment of apprehension and ends 
</p>
<p>with the release of the detainee or the final judgement, depending on the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>The right to claim remedies after release may not be rendered ineffective by any statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations. </p>


<p><b>  Principle 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assistance by legal counsel and access to legal aid  
</b></p>
<p>12. Persons deprived of their liberty shall have the right to legal assistance by counsel of 
</p>
<p>their choice, at any time during their detention, including immediately after the moment of 
</p>
<p>apprehension. Upon apprehension, all persons shall be promptly informed of this right.  
</p>
<p>13. Assistance by legal counsel in the proceedings shall be at no cost for a detained 
</p>
<p>person without adequate means or for the individual bringing proceedings before a court on 
</p>
<p>the detainee&#8217;s behalf. In such cases, effective legal aid shall be provided promptly at all 
</p>
<p>stages of the deprivation of liberty; this includes, but is not limited to, the detainee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>unhindered access to legal counsel provided by the legal aid regime. 
</p>
<p>14. Persons deprived of their liberty shall be accorded adequate time and facilities to 
</p>
<p>prepare their case, including through disclosure of information in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>present Basic Principles and Guidelines, and to freely communicate with legal counsel of 
</p>
<p>their choice. 
</p>
<p>15. Legal counsel shall be able to carry out their functions effectively and 
</p>
<p>independently, free from fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation, hindrance or 
</p>
<p>harassment. Authorities shall respect the privacy and confidentiality of legal counsel-
</p>
<p>detainee communications. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons able to bring proceedings before a court 
</b></p>
<p>16. Procedures shall allow anyone to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to obtain without delay 
</p>
<p>appropriate and accessible remedies, including the detainee, his or her legal representative, 
</p>
<p>family members or other interested parties, whether or not they have proof of the consent of 
</p>
<p>the detainee.  
</p>
<p>17. No restrictions may be imposed on the detainee&#8217;s ability to contact his or her legal 
</p>
<p>representative, family members or other interested parties. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 11 
</b></p>
<p><b>Appearance of the detainee before the court  
</b></p>
<p>18. The court should guarantee the physical presence of the detainee before it, especially 
</p>
<p>for the first hearing of the challenge to the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty and every time that the person deprived of liberty requests to appear physically 
</p>
<p>before the court. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equality before the courts 
</b></p>
<p>19. The proceedings shall be fair and effective in practice, and the parties to the 
</p>
<p>proceedings in question shall be ensured the right to equal access to present their full case, 
</p>
<p>and equality of arms, and be treated without any discrimination before the courts.  
</p>
<p>20. Every individual deprived of liberty shall be guaranteed the right to have access to 
</p>
<p>all material related to the detention or presented to the court by State authorities to preserve 
</p>
<p>the equality of arms. The requirement that the same procedural rights be provided to all 
</p>
<p>parties is subject only to distinctions that are based on the law and can be justified on 
</p>
<p>objective, reasonable grounds not entailing actual disadvantage or other unfairness to the 
</p>
<p>detained person.  </p>


<p><b> 9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 13 
</b></p>
<p><b>Burden of proof  
</b></p>
<p>21. In every instance of detention, the burden of establishing the legal basis and the 
</p>
<p>reasonableness, necessity and proportionality of the detention lies with the authorities 
</p>
<p>responsible for the detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 14 
</b></p>
<p><b>Standard of review  
</b></p>
<p>22. No restriction may be imposed on the court&#8217;s authority to review the factual and 
</p>
<p>legal basis of the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>23. The court shall consider all available evidence that has a bearing on the arbitrariness 
</p>
<p>and lawfulness of detention, namely, the grounds justifying the detention, and its necessity 
</p>
<p>and proportionality to the aim sought in view of the individual circumstances of the 
</p>
<p>detainee, and not merely its reasonableness or other lower standards of review. 
</p>
<p>24. In order to determine that a case of deprivation of liberty is non-arbitrary and lawful, 
</p>
<p>the court shall be satisfied that the detention was carried out on grounds and according to 
</p>
<p>procedures prescribed by national law and that are in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>standards, and that, in particular, it was and remains non-arbitrary and lawful under both 
</p>
<p>national and international law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 15 
</b></p>
<p><b>Remedies and reparations  
</b></p>
<p>25. Any person arbitrarily or unlawfully detained is guaranteed access to effective 
</p>
<p>remedies and reparations capable of providing restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, 
</p>
<p>satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. Reparations should be adequate, effective and 
</p>
<p>prompt. States shall undertake prompt, effective and impartial investigations wherever there 
</p>
<p>is reasonable ground to believe that detention has been arbitrary. The duty applies in any 
</p>
<p>territory under a State&#8217;s jurisdiction or wherever the State exercises effective control, or 
</p>
<p>otherwise as the result of its actions or omissions of its servants. The right to reparation 
</p>
<p>cannot be rendered ineffective by amnesties, immunities, statutes of limitations or other 
</p>
<p>defence of the State. 
</p>
<p>26. Where a court determines that the deprivation of liberty is arbitrary or unlawful, it 
</p>
<p>shall order a conditional or unconditional release from detention. Relevant authorities shall 
</p>
<p>give immediate effect to any order for release. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 16 
</b></p>
<p><b>Exercise of the right to bring proceedings before a court in situations of armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict, public danger or other emergency threatening the independence or security 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a State 
</b></p>
<p>27. All detained persons in a situation of armed conflict as properly characterized under 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, or in other circumstances of public danger or other 
</p>
<p>emergency that threatens the independence or security of a State, are guaranteed the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to receive without delay appropriate and 
</p>
<p>accessible remedies. This right and corresponding procedural guarantees complement and 
</p>
<p>mutually strengthen the rules of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>28. Domestic legislative frameworks should not allow for any restriction on the 
</p>
<p>safeguards of persons deprived of their liberty concerning the right to bring proceedings </p>


<p>before a court under counter-terrorism measures, emergency legislation or drug-related 
</p>
<p>policies. 
</p>
<p>29. A State that detains a person in a situation of armed conflict as properly 
</p>
<p>characterized under international humanitarian law, or in other circumstances of public 
</p>
<p>danger or other emergency that threatens the independence or security of a State, has by 
</p>
<p>definition that person within its effective control, and thus within its jurisdiction, and shall 
</p>
<p>therefore guarantee the exercise of the right of the detainee to bring proceedings before a 
</p>
<p>court to challenge the arbitrariness or lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to receive 
</p>
<p>without delay appropriate and accessible remedies. Reconsideration, appeal or periodic 
</p>
<p>review of decisions to intern or place in assigned residence alien civilians in the territory of 
</p>
<p>a party to an international armed conflict, or civilians in an occupied territory, shall comply 
</p>
<p>with the present Basic Principles and Guidelines, including Basic Principle 6 on the court as 
</p>
<p>reviewing body. 
</p>
<p>30. Prisoners of war should be entitled to bring proceedings before a court to challenge 
</p>
<p>the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to receive without delay 
</p>
<p>appropriate and accessible remedies, where the detainee (a) challenges his or her status as a 
</p>
<p>prisoner of war; (b) claims to be entitled to repatriation or transfer to a neutral State if 
</p>
<p>seriously injured or ill; or (c) claims not to have been released or repatriated without delay 
</p>
<p>following the cessation of active hostilities. 
</p>
<p>31. Administrative detention or internment in the context of a non-international armed 
</p>
<p>conflict may only be permitted in times of public emergency threatening the life of the 
</p>
<p>nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed. Any consequent deviation from 
</p>
<p>procedural elements of the right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and to receive without delay 
</p>
<p>appropriate and accessible remedies must be in conformity with the present Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles and Guidelines, including on the principles of non-derogability, the right to be 
</p>
<p>informed and the court as reviewing body, and the guidelines on equality of arms and 
</p>
<p>burden of proof. 
</p>
<p>32. During armed conflict, the deprivation of the liberty of children must only be a 
</p>
<p>measure of last resort and for the shortest period of time. Basic legal safeguards must be 
</p>
<p>provided in all circumstances, including for children deprived of liberty for their protection 
</p>
<p>or rehabilitation, particularly if detained by military or security services. Safeguards include 
</p>
<p>the right to legal assistance and a periodic review of the legality of the deprivation of their 
</p>
<p>liberty by a court. The child has the right to have the deprivation of liberty acknowledged 
</p>
<p>by the authorities and to communicate with relatives and friends. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 17 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific obligations to guarantee access to the right to bring proceedings before a 
</b></p>
<p><b>court  
</b></p>
<p>33. The adoption of specific measures are required under international law to ensure 
</p>
<p>meaningful access to the right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and 
</p>
<p>accessible remedies by certain groups of detainees. This includes &#8211; but is not limited to 
</p>
<p>children &#8211; women (in particular pregnant and breastfeeding women), older persons, persons 
</p>
<p>detained in solitary confinement or other forms of incommunicado detention of restricted 
</p>
<p>regimes of confinement, persons with disabilities, including psychosocial and intellectual 
</p>
<p>disabilities, persons living with HIV/AIDS and other serious communicable or contagious 
</p>
<p>diseases, persons with dementia, drug users, indigenous persons, sex workers, lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, minorities as based on national or ethnic, 
</p>
<p>cultural, religious or linguistic identity, non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their </p>


<p><b> 11</b> 
</p>
<p>migration status, asylum seekers and refugees, internally displaced persons, stateless 
</p>
<p>persons and trafficked persons or persons at risk of being trafficked.  
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 18 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for children  
</b></p>
<p>34. Children may only be deprived of their liberty as a measure of last resort and for the 
</p>
<p>shortest possible period of time. The right of the child to have his or her best interests taken 
</p>
<p>as a primary consideration shall be paramount in any decision-making and action taken in 
</p>
<p>relation to children deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>35. The exercise of the right to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the 
</p>
<p>detention of children shall be prioritized and accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, 
</p>
<p>effective and responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children. 
</p>
<p>36. The authorities overseeing the detention of children shall <i>ex officio</i> request courts to 
</p>
<p>review the arbitrariness and lawfulness of their detention. This does not exclude the right of 
</p>
<p>any child deprived of his or her liberty to bring such proceedings before a court in his or her 
</p>
<p>own name or, if it is in his or her best interests, through a representative or an appropriate 
</p>
<p>body. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 19 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>37. Appropriate and tailored measures shall be taken into account in the provision of 
</p>
<p>accessibility and reasonable accommodation to ensure the ability of women and girls to 
</p>
<p>exercise their right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies. 
</p>
<p>This includes introducing an active policy of incorporating a gender equality perspective 
</p>
<p>into all policies, laws, procedures, programmes and practices relating to the deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty to ensure equal and fair access to justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  Principle 20 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>38. Courts, while reviewing the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities, shall comply with the State&#8217;s obligation to prohibit involuntary 
</p>
<p>committal or internment on the grounds of the existence of an impairment or perceived 
</p>
<p>impairment, particularly on the basis of psychosocial or intellectual disability or perceived 
</p>
<p>psychosocial or intellectual disability, as well as with their obligation to design and 
</p>
<p>implement de-institutionalization strategies based on the human rights model of disability. 
</p>
<p>The review must include the possibility of appeal. 
</p>
<p>39. The deprivation of liberty of a person with a disability, including physical, mental, 
</p>
<p>intellectual or sensory impairments, is required to be in conformity with the law, including 
</p>
<p>international law, offering the same substantive and procedural guarantees available to 
</p>
<p>others and consistent with the right to humane treatment and the inherent dignity of the 
</p>
<p>person.  
</p>
<p>40. Persons with disabilities are entitled to be treated on an equal basis with others, and 
</p>
<p>not to be discriminated against on the basis of disability. Protection from violence, abuse 
</p>
<p>and ill-treatment of any kind must be ensured. 
</p>
<p>41. Persons with disabilities are entitled to request individualized and appropriate 
</p>
<p>accommodations and support, if needed, to exercise the right to challenge the arbitrariness 
</p>
<p>and lawfulness of their detention in accessible ways. </p>


<p><b>  Principle 21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their migration 
</b></p>
<p><b>status, asylum seekers, refugees and stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>42. Non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their status, asylum seekers, 
</p>
<p>refugees and stateless persons, in any situation of deprivation of liberty shall be informed of 
</p>
<p>the reasons for their detention and their rights in connection with the detention order. This 
</p>
<p>includes the right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness and the necessity and proportionality of their detention, and to receive without 
</p>
<p>delay appropriate and accessible remedies. It also includes the right of the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>persons to legal assistance in accordance with the basic requirement of prompt and effective 
</p>
<p>provision of legal assistance, in a language that they use and in a means, mode or format 
</p>
<p>they understand, and the right to the free assistance of an interpreter if they cannot 
</p>
<p>understand or speak the language used in court. 
</p>
<p>43. Irrespective of the body responsible for their detention order, administrative or other, 
</p>
<p>such non-nationals shall be guaranteed access to a court of law empowered to order 
</p>
<p>immediate release or able to vary the conditions of release. They shall promptly be brought 
</p>
<p>before a judicial authority before which they should have access to automatic, regular 
</p>
<p>periodic reviews of their detention to ensure that it remains necessary, proportional, lawful 
</p>
<p>and non-arbitrary. This does not exclude their right to bring proceedings before a court to 
</p>
<p>challenge the lawfulness or arbitrariness of their detention. 
</p>
<p>44. Proceedings of challenges to decisions regarding immigration detention must be 
</p>
<p>suspensive to avoid expulsion prior to the case-by-case examination of migrants in 
</p>
<p>administrative detention, regardless of their status. 
</p>
<p>45. The deprivation of liberty as a penalty or punitive sanction in the area of 
</p>
<p>immigration control is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>46. The deprivation of liberty of an unaccompanied or separated migrant or of an 
</p>
<p>asylum-seeking, refugee or stateless child is prohibited. Detaining children because of their 
</p>
<p>parents&#8217; migration status will always violate the principle of the best interests of the child 
</p>
<p>and constitutes a violation of the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Guidelines  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Guideline 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Scope of application  
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies is 
</p>
<p>applicable: 
</p>
<p>(a) To all situations of deprivation of liberty, including not only to 
</p>
<p>detention for purposes of criminal proceedings but also to situations of detention 
</p>
<p>under administrative and other fields of law, including military detention, security 
</p>
<p>detention, detention under counter-terrorism measures, involuntary confinement in 
</p>
<p>medical or psychiatric facilities, migration detention, detention for extradition, 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrests, house arrest, solitary confinement, detention for vagrancy or drug 
</p>
<p>addiction, and detention of children for educational purposes; 
</p>
<p>(b) Irrespective of the place of detention or the legal terminology used in 
</p>
<p>the legislation. Any form of deprivation of liberty on any ground must be subject to 
</p>
<p>effective oversight and control by the judiciary.  </p>


<p><b> 13</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prescription in national law 
</b></p>
<p>48. A strict legality requirement is applicable to both the form of the legal basis and the 
</p>
<p>procedure for its adoption. The legal framework that establishes the process to challenge 
</p>
<p>the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention shall have a sufficient degree of precision, be 
</p>
<p>drafted in clear and unambiguous language, be realistically accessible and ensure that the 
</p>
<p>exact meaning of the relevant provisions and the consequences of its application are 
</p>
<p>foreseeable to a degree reasonable for the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>49. Any restriction on liberty must be authorized in national legislation. Depending on 
</p>
<p>the national legal system, restrictions may be based on the Constitution or in the common 
</p>
<p>law. Legislative acts are to be drafted in accordance with the procedural provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>Non-derogability 
</b></p>
<p>50. In times of public emergency threatening the life of the nation and the existence of 
</p>
<p>which is officially proclaimed, States may take measures to accommodate practical 
</p>
<p>constraints in the application of some procedural elements of the right to bring proceedings 
</p>
<p>before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention and to obtain 
</p>
<p>without delay appropriate and accessible remedies only to the extent strictly required by the 
</p>
<p>exigencies of the situation, provided that: 
</p>
<p>(a) The court&#8217;s authority to decide without delay on the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention, and to order immediate release if the detention is not lawful, 
</p>
<p>is not itself diminished;  
</p>
<p>(b) The duty of relevant authorities to give immediate effect to an order for 
</p>
<p>release is not diminished; 
</p>
<p>(c) Such measures are prescribed by law, necessary in the exigencies of the 
</p>
<p>situation (including by virtue of the fact that less restrictive measures would be 
</p>
<p>insufficient to achieve the same purpose), proportionate and non-discriminatory;  
</p>
<p>(d) Such measures apply temporarily, only for as long as the exigencies of 
</p>
<p>the situation require, and are accompanied by mechanisms to review periodically 
</p>
<p>their continued necessity and proportionality;  
</p>
<p>(e) Such measures are consistent with ensuring fair, effective and 
</p>
<p>adversarial proceedings;  
</p>
<p>(f) Such measures are not otherwise inconsistent with international law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>Characteristics of the court and procedural guidelines for review of the detention  
</b></p>
<p>51. The court reviewing the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the detention must be a 
</p>
<p>different body from the one that ordered the detention.  
</p>
<p>52. The competence, independence and impartiality of such a court should not be 
</p>
<p>undermined by procedures or rules pertaining to the selection and appointment of judges. 
</p>
<p>53. In undertaking the review of the detention, the court has the authority: 
</p>
<p>(a) To consider the application as a matter of urgency. Adjudication of the 
</p>
<p>case, including time for preparation of the hearing, should take place as 
</p>
<p>expeditiously as possible, and should not be delayed because of insufficiency of </p>


<p>evidence. Delays attributable to the detainee or his or her legal representative do not 
</p>
<p>count as judicial delay; 
</p>
<p>(b) To ensure the presence of the detainee regardless of whether  he or she 
</p>
<p>has asked to appear; 
</p>
<p>(c) To order immediate release if the detention is found to be arbitrary or 
</p>
<p>unlawful. Any court order of release shall be respected and immediately 
</p>
<p>implemented by the State authorities;  
</p>
<p>(d) To render and publicize its decision on the arbitrariness and lawfulness 
</p>
<p>of the detention without delay and within established deadlines. In addition to being 
</p>
<p>reasoned and particularized, the court&#8217;s decision should be clear, precise, complete 
</p>
<p>and sufficient, the contents of which should be made understood in a language and a 
</p>
<p>means, mode or format that the detainee understands. In the event of an unsuccessful 
</p>
<p>challenge, the court, in its decision, must provide reasons for why the individual 
</p>
<p>should remain in detention in the light of the principle that liberty should be the rule 
</p>
<p>and detention the exception. If further restrictions on the liberty of the individual are 
</p>
<p>under consideration, such consideration shall be dealt with in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>principles of international law;  
</p>
<p>(e) To take measures against the State authorities in control of the detention 
</p>
<p>where the deprivation of liberty is determined to be arbitrary or unlawful and/or the 
</p>
<p>treatment during the deprivation of liberty was found to be abusive. 
</p>
<p>54. For certain forms of detention, States may, exceptionally, enact legislation 
</p>
<p>regulating proceedings before a specialized tribunal. Such a tribunal: 
</p>
<p>(a) Must be established by law affording all guarantees of competence, 
</p>
<p>impartiality and the enjoyment of judicial independence in deciding legal matters in 
</p>
<p>proceedings that are judicial in nature;  
</p>
<p>(b) May only be considered legitimate and legally valid if reasonable and 
</p>
<p>objective criteria justify its existence, that is, there exists a special legal condition 
</p>
<p>and/or vulnerability of the person that requires specific protection by a specialized 
</p>
<p>tribunal. The right to equality before the law<b> </b>and to equal protection of the law 
</p>
<p>without any discrimination does not make all differences of treatment <b> </b>discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>Differentiation based on reasonable and objective criteria does not amount to 
</p>
<p>prohibited discrimination. 
</p>
<p>55. Military tribunals are not competent to review the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the 
</p>
<p>detention of civilians. Military judges and military prosecutors do not meet the fundamental 
</p>
<p>requirements of independence and impartiality. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to be informed  
</b></p>
<p>56. The factual and legal basis for the detention shall be disclosed to the detainee and/or 
</p>
<p>his or her representative without delay so as to provide adequate time to prepare the 
</p>
<p>challenge. Disclosure includes a copy of the detention order, access to and a copy of the 
</p>
<p>case file, in addition to the disclosure of any material in the possession of the authorities or 
</p>
<p>to which they may gain access relating to the reasons for the deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>57. In any facility where persons are deprived of their liberty, the detaining authorities 
</p>
<p>must inform detainees of their entitlement to bring proceedings and to receive a reasoned 
</p>
<p>and individualized decision without delay, including on how to commence the procedure 
</p>
<p>and potential consequences of voluntarily waiving those rights.Such information should be 
</p>
<p>provided in a manner that is gender- and culture-sensitive and corresponds to the needs of </p>


<p><b> 15</b> 
</p>
<p>specific groups, including illiterate persons, minorities, persons with disabilities, older 
</p>
<p>persons, indigenous peoples, non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their migration 
</p>
<p>status, refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons and children. The information shall be 
</p>
<p>provided in a language and a means, mode or format that is accessible and that the said 
</p>
<p>persons understand, taking into account augmentative and alternative means of 
</p>
<p>communications for persons with a mental or physical impairment. In the case of children, 
</p>
<p>information must be provided in a manner appropriate to their age and maturity. 
</p>
<p>58. Means of verification that a person has actually been informed shall be established. 
</p>
<p>These means may include documentation of the person having been informed by way of 
</p>
<p>printed record, audiotape, videotape or witnesses. 
</p>
<p>59. The above-mentioned information should also be widely published and made 
</p>
<p>accessible to the general public and to geographically isolated groups and groups 
</p>
<p>marginalized as a result of discriminatory practices. Use should be made of radio and 
</p>
<p>television programmes, regional and local newspapers, the Internet and other means, in 
</p>
<p>particular following any changes to the law or specific issues affecting a community. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>Registers and record-keeping 
</b></p>
<p>60. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of registers and adequate case 
</p>
<p>management, and to ensure that State authorities know at all times who is held in their 
</p>
<p>custody or detention facilities, including prisons and any other place of deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty: 
</p>
<p>(a) All records must contain the following minimum information, 
</p>
<p>disaggregated by sex and age of the detainee:   
</p>
<p>(i) The identity of the person; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The date, time and place where the person was deprived of liberty, and 
</p>
<p>the identity of the authority that deprived the person of liberty;  
</p>
<p>(iii) The authority that ordered the deprivation of liberty and the grounds for 
</p>
<p>it; 
</p>
<p>(iv) The authority responsible for supervising the deprivation of  liberty; 
</p>
<p>(v) The place of deprivation of liberty, the date and time of admission to 
</p>
<p>the place of deprivation of liberty, and the authority responsible for the place

<p>(vi) Relevant information on the detainee&#8217;s state of health; 
</p>
<p>(vii) In the event of death of the detainee during the deprivation of liberty, 
</p>
<p>the circumstances and cause of death and the destination of the remains;  
</p>
<p>(viii) The date and time of release or transfer to another place of detention, 
</p>
<p>the destination and the authority responsible for the transfer;  
</p>
<p>(b) Known procedures must be in place to safeguard against unauthorized 
</p>
<p>access or modification of any information contained in the register and/or records of

<p>persons deprived of liberty; 
</p>
<p>(c) The registers and/or records of persons deprived of liberty shall be 
</p>
<p>made promptly available, upon request, to any judicial or other competent authority 
</p>
<p>or institution authorized for that purpose by the law;  </p>


<p>(d) Known procedures must be in place to release immediately a detainee 
</p>
<p>upon discovery that he or she is continuing to be detained despite having completed

<p>serving a sentence or detention order;  
</p>
<p>(e) In the event of non-compliance with such requirements, sanctions 
</p>
<p>against the State authorities responsible are necessary.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Time frame for bringing proceedings before a court 
</b></p>
<p>61. To ensure that an individual is not be deprived of his or her liberty without being 
</p>
<p>given an effective opportunity to be heard without delay by a court of law, no substantial 
</p>
<p>waiting period shall exist before a detainee can bring a first challenge to the arbitrariness 
</p>
<p>and lawfulness of detention. Authorities shall facilitate the detainee&#8217;s right to bring 
</p>
<p>proceedings before a court and immediate access to legal counsel to prepare the detainee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>case. 
</p>
<p>62. Given that circumstances can change and lead to the possibility that a previous legal 
</p>
<p>justification for a detention is no longer applicable, detainees should have the right to 
</p>
<p>challenge their detention periodically. 
</p>
<p>63. After a court has held that the circumstances justify the detention, the individual is 
</p>
<p>entitled to take proceedings again on similar grounds after an appropriate period of time has 
</p>
<p>passed, depending on the nature of the relevant circumstances. 
</p>
<p>64. There shall be no substantial waiting period between each application and no 
</p>
<p>waiting period in cases of alleged torture or other ill-treatment, or risk of such treatment, or 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention, or where the life, health or legal situation of the detainee may be 
</p>
<p>irreversibly damaged.  
</p>
<p>65. The initiation of the challenge multiple times does not relieve authorities of the 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure the regular, periodic judicial or other review of the necessity and 
</p>
<p>proportionality of continuing detention, nor exclude the possibility of periodic review by 
</p>
<p>the court <i>proprio motu</i>. 
</p>
<p>66. Where a decision upholding the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention is subject 
</p>
<p>to appeal in accordance with national legislation, it should be adjudicated upon 
</p>
<p>expeditiously. Any appeals by the State are to be filed within legally defined limits and 
</p>
<p>circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assistance by legal counsel and access to legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>67. Access shall be provided without delay to legal counsel immediately after the 
</p>
<p>moment of deprivation of liberty and at the latest prior to any questioning by an authority, 
</p>
<p>and thereafter throughout the period of detention. This includes providing detainees with 
</p>
<p>the means to contact legal counsel of their choice. 
</p>
<p>68. Effective legal aid shall be provided promptly after the time of apprehension in order 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the unaffordable cost of legal counsel does not present a barrier to individuals 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty, or his or her representative, without adequate means to bring 
</p>
<p>proceedings before a court. 
</p>
<p>69. Respect for the confidentiality of communications, including meetings, 
</p>
<p>correspondence, telephone calls and other forms of communications, with legal counsel are 
</p>
<p>to be ensured. Such communications may be held in the sight of officials provided that they 
</p>
<p>are conducted out of their hearing. In the event that confidentiality is broken, any 
</p>
<p>information obtained shall be considered inadmissible as evidence. </p>


<p><b> 17</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Access to legal counsel should not be unlawfully or unreasonably restricted. If 
</p>
<p>access to legal counsel is delayed or denied, or detained persons are not adequately 
</p>
<p>informed of their right to assistance by legal counsel in a timely manner, a range of 
</p>
<p>remedies shall be available in accordance with the present Basic Principles and Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>71. Where the services of legal counsel are not available, every effort shall be made to 
</p>
<p>ensure that services available from suitably qualified legal assistance providers are 
</p>
<p>accessible to detainees under conditions that guarantee the full respect of the rights of 
</p>
<p>detainees as set out in international law and standards. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons able to bring proceedings before a court  
</b></p>
<p>72. A wider group of individuals with a legitimate interest in the case may bring 
</p>
<p>proceedings before a court, including family members, caregivers or legal guardian of the 
</p>
<p>detainee, State authorities independent of the detaining authority, the ombudsman or 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution, non-governmental organizations, the employer or co-
</p>
<p>workers. 
</p>
<p>73. When proceedings are initiated by a person other than the detainee, the court shall 
</p>
<p>make every effort to discover the detained person&#8217;s will and preferences, and accommodate 
</p>
<p>and support the detained person in participating effectively on his or her own behalf. 
</p>
<p>74. An informal, cost-free and simplified process to bring such proceedings before a 
</p>
<p>court shall be ensured. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>Appearance before the court  
</b></p>
<p>75. To ensure the effectiveness and fairness of proceedings and to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>protection of detainees from other violations, such as torture or other ill-treatment, a court 
</p>
<p>should guarantee the physical presence of the detainee before it, in particular for the first 
</p>
<p>hearing of the challenge to the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and 
</p>
<p>every time that the person deprived of liberty requests to appear physically before the court. 
</p>
<p>This shall be ensured through implementation of the following measures: 
</p>
<p>(a) Any person deprived of his or her liberty, and not only persons charged 
</p>
<p>with a criminal offence, shall enjoy the right to appear promptly before a court in 
</p>
<p>order to challenge the deprivation of liberty and the conditions of detention, 
</p>
<p>including acts of torture and ill-treatment; 
</p>
<p>(b) The court shall ensure that the detainee may communicate with the 
</p>
<p>judge without the presence of any official involved in his or her deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty; 
</p>
<p>(c) State authorities having control over the detainee who fail in their 
</p>
<p>obligation to produce without unreasonable delay the detained person before the 
</p>
<p>court, on demand of that person or by court order, should be sanctioned as a matter 
</p>
<p>of criminal and administrative law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 11 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equality of arms 
</b></p>
<p>76. To ensure that the procedure is guided by the adversarial principle and equality of 
</p>
<p>arms, the following conditions shall be guaranteed in all proceedings, whether of a criminal 
</p>
<p>or non-criminal nature: </p>


<p>(a) Full and complete access by detainees and their legal counsel to the 
</p>
<p>material related to the detention or presented to the court , as well as a complete copy 
</p>
<p>of them; 
</p>
<p>(b) The ability of detainees to challenge any documents relating to their 
</p>
<p>case file, including all the arguments and material elements adduced by the 
</p>
<p>authorities, including the prosecution, the security apparatus and the immigration 
</p>
<p>authorities, to justify the detention, which may be determinative in establishing the 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness and lawfulness of his or her detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>Admissibility of evidence obtained by torture or other prohibited treatment 
</b></p>
<p>77. Any statement established to have been made or any other evidence obtained as a 
</p>
<p>result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment shall not be invoked as 
</p>
<p>evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture or other prohibited 
</p>
<p>treatment as evidence that the statement was made or that other such acts took place. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 13 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disclosure of information 
</b></p>
<p>78. The detaining authority shall provide all relevant information to the judge, the 
</p>
<p>detainee and/or his or her lawyer. Disclosure is to include exculpatory information, which 
</p>
<p>includes not only information that establishes an accused person&#8217;s innocence but also other 
</p>
<p>information that could assist the detainee, for example, in arguing that his or her detention 
</p>
<p>is not lawful or that the reasons for his or her detention no longer apply. 
</p>
<p>79. Sanctions, including criminal penalties, shall be imposed on officials who withhold 
</p>
<p>or refuse to disclose information relevant to the proceedings or who otherwise delay or 
</p>
<p>obstruct proceedings. 
</p>
<p>80. The disclosure of information may be restricted only if the court concludes that:  
</p>
<p>(a) A restriction on disclosure is demonstrated to be necessary to pursue a 
</p>
<p>legitimate aim, such as protecting national security, respecting the rights or 
</p>
<p>reputation of another individual or protecting public order, health or morals, as long 
</p>
<p>as such restrictions are non-discriminatory and consistent with relevant standards of 
</p>
<p>international law;  
</p>
<p>(b) It has been demonstrated that less restrictive measures would be unable 
</p>
<p>to achieve the same result, such as providing redacted summaries of information that 
</p>
<p>clearly point to the factual basis for the detention.  
</p>
<p>81. Any proposed restriction on the disclosure of information is to be proportionate. An 
</p>
<p>assessment of proportionality requires a balance between how well the non-disclosure 
</p>
<p>protects the legitimate aims being pursued and the negative impact that this will have on the 
</p>
<p>ability of the person to respond to the case or to pursue a challenge to the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention. If a less restrictive measure is able to achieve the legitimate aim, 
</p>
<p>the more restrictive measure is to be refused. 
</p>
<p>82. If the authorities refuse to make the disclosure and the court does not have the 
</p>
<p>authority to compel such a disclosure, the court must order the release of the person 
</p>
<p>detained.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 14 
</b></p>
<p><b>Burden of proof  
</b></p>
<p>83. The State authorities shall establish before the court that:  </p>


<p><b> 19</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) The legal basis for the detention in question is in conformity with 
</p>
<p>international standards;  
</p>
<p>(b) The detention is justified in accordance with the principles of necessity, 
</p>
<p>reasonableness and proportionality;  
</p>
<p>(c) Other less intrusive means of achieving the same objectives have been 
</p>
<p>considered in the individual case. 
</p>
<p>84. The burden of proof must be met in a manner that is known in detail to the detainee, 
</p>
<p>complete with supporting evidence, including those who are defendants in security-related 
</p>
<p>cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 15 
</b></p>
<p><b>Standard of review 
</b></p>
<p>85. When reviewing the arbitrariness and lawfulness of the detention, the court is 
</p>
<p>empowered: 
</p>
<p>(a) To examine and act on the elements of inappropriateness, injustice, 
</p>
<p>lawfulness, legality, predictability, and due process of law, and on basic principles of 
</p>
<p>reasonableness, proportionality and necessity. Such an examination will take into 
</p>
<p>account details such as age, gender and marginalized groups; 
</p>
<p>(b) To consider whether the detention remains justified or whether release 
</p>
<p>is warranted in the light of all the changing circumstances of the detained 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s case, including health, family life, protection claims or other attempts to 
</p>
<p>regularize one&#8217;s status; 
</p>
<p>(c) To consider and make a pronouncement on whether alternatives to 
</p>
<p>detention have been considered, including non-custodial alternatives to detention in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial 
</p>
<p>Measures (the Tokyo Rules) and the United Nations Rules on the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok 
</p>
<p>Rules); 
</p>
<p>(d) To take into account any orders of detention made subsequent to the 
</p>
<p>commencement of court proceedings and prior to the rendering of the court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>decision. 
</p>
<p>86. When assessing whether the measures taken are in compliance with international 
</p>
<p>standards, the prohibition of particular grounds of detention or forms of detention are to be 
</p>
<p>complied with, and the needs of specific persons affected and any vulnerability are to be 
</p>
<p>taken into consideration, given that the arbitrariness and unlawfulness of detention may 
</p>
<p>include the unsuitability of detention for the persons in question. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 16 
</b></p>
<p><b>Remedies and reparations 
</b></p>
<p>87. Judicial orders of release must be executed as soon as they become operative, as 
</p>
<p>continued detention would be considered arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>88. A copy of the decision finding the detention arbitrary or unlawful is to be 
</p>
<p>transmitted to the person concerned, with notification of the procedures for obtaining 
</p>
<p>reparations. The person has the right to full compensation for material harm, elimination of 
</p>
<p>the consequences of material harm and restoration of all rights that were either denied or 
</p>
<p>infringed. </p>


<p>89. In the event of a detainee&#8217;s death, the right to compensation in accordance with 
</p>
<p>established procedures falls to the detainee&#8217;s heirs.  
</p>
<p>90. The enforceable right to receive compensation for anyone determined to have been 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily or unlawfully detained and for any harm suffered by the person as a result of 
</p>
<p>unlawful deprivation of liberty, irrespective of whether the detaining authorities were 
</p>
<p>responsible for such harm, shall be regulated by comprehensive legislation. Compensation 
</p>
<p>shall also be made available to persons subjected to criminal charges that were 
</p>
<p>subsequently dropped.

</p>
<p>following conditions are to be ensured: 
</p>
<p>(a) Reconsideration of a decision to intern or to place in assigned residence 
</p>
<p>alien civilians in the territory of a party to an international armed conflict , or 
</p>
<p>civilians in an occupied territory, or appeal in the case of internment or assigned

<p>case basis, any delay in bringing a person before the court or administrative board 
</p>
<p>must not exceed a few days and must be proportional in the particular context;

</p>
<p>of independence and impartiality, and the processes of which include and respect 
</p>
<p>fundamental procedural safeguards;

<p>without to delay to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of their detention and to

<p>96. With regard to detention in relation to a non-international armed conflict: 
</p>
<p>(a) Administrative detention or internment may only be permitted in the 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstance where a public emergency is invoked to justify  such

<p>(i) The emergency has risen to a level justifying derogation; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Administrative detention is required on the basis of the grounds and

<p>that takes into account any element leading to vulnerability, in particular with regard to 
</p>
<p>girls, younger children, children with disabilities, non-nationals, including migrants

</p>
<p>and fair manner, avoiding any risk of violation of the physical and psychological integrity

<p>of the child, and giving due respect to human dignity. Prior to the outcome of an

<p>100. To ensure that children have prompt and effective access to an independent and 
</p>
<p>child-sensitive process to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of their detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible

<p>remedies, the following specific measures shall be enacted: 
</p>
<p>(a) All legislation, policies and practices related to children deprived of

<p>(c) Children who are deprived of their liberty for any reason are able to 
</p>

<p><b> 23</b> 
</p>
<p>can understand and in a manner that is gender- and culture-sensitive. The said 
</p>
<p>information should in addition be provided to parents, guardians or caregivers of the

<p>child; 
</p>
<p>(e) Any child deprived of his or her liberty has the right to bring a 
</p>
<p>complaint in his or her own name or, if it is in his or her best interests, through a 
</p>
<p>representative or an appropriate body. Children are to be allowed to be heard either 
</p>
<p>directly or through a representative or an appropriate body in any proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Wherever possible, children should have the opportunity to be heard directly. If 
</p>
<p>children choose to be heard through a representative, steps are to be taken to ensure 
</p>
<p>that their views are transmitted correctly to the competent body and that the 
</p>
<p>representative is aware that he or she represents exclusively the interests of the child;  
</p>
<p>(f) National laws should stipulate measures aimed at the prevention of ill -
</p>
<p>treatment or intimidation of a child who brings or has brought such a complaint, and 
</p>
<p>should provide for sanctions against persons in violation of such laws; 
</p>
<p>(g) The child has the right to have the matter determined in the presence of 
</p>
<p>his or her parents or legal guardian, unless such an arrangement is not considered to 
</p>
<p>be in the best interests of the child. In cases of conflict of interest, courts and

<p>relevant complaint mechanisms should be empowered to exclude parents and/or legal 
</p>
<p>representatives from proceedings and to appoint an ad hoc legal guardian to 
</p>

<p>(h) Each case from the outset is to be handled expeditiously, without any 
</p>
<p>unnecessary delay. Decisions are to be rendered as soon as possible, and no later 
</p>
<p>than two weeks after a challenge has been made; 
</p>
<p>(i) The privacy and personal data of a child who is or who has been 
</p>
<p>involved in judicial or non-judicial proceedings and other interventions should be 
</p>
<p>protected at all stages, and such protection should be guaranteed by law. This 
</p>
<p>generally implies that no information or personal data may be made available or 
</p>
<p>published by the competent authorities that could reveal or indirectly enable the 
</p>
<p>disclosure of the child&#8217;s identity, including images of the child, detailed descriptions 
</p>
<p>of the child or the child&#8217;s family, names or addresses of the child&#8217;s family members 
</p>
<p>and audio and video records.

<p><b>  Guideline 19 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>101. Applicable and appropriate measures shall be taken to provide accessibility and 
</p>
<p>reasonable accommodation ensuring the right of all women and girls to equal and fair 
</p>
<p>access of the right to bring proceedings before a court to challenge the arbitrariness and 
</p>
<p>lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies. 
</p>
<p>These measures include:  
</p>
<p>(a) Introducing an active policy of incorporating a gender equality 
</p>
<p>perspective into all policies, laws, procedures, programmes and practices that are 
</p>
<p>designed to protect the rights and specific status and distinct needs of women and 
</p>
<p>girls who are subject to the deprivation of their liberty;  
</p>
<p>(b) Taking active steps to ensure that, where possible, persons who possess 
</p>
<p>education, training, skills and experience in the gender-specific needs and rights of 
</p>
<p>women are available to provide legal aid, advice and court support services in all 
</p>
<p>legal proceedings to female detainees.  </p>


<p>102. The practice of keeping girls and women in detention for the purpose of protecting 
</p>
<p>them from risks of serious violence (protective custody) should be eliminated. Alternative 
</p>
<p>measures are to ensure the protection of women and girls without jeopardizing their liberty. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 20 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>103. The involuntary committal or internment of persons on the grounds of the existence 
</p>
<p>of an impairment or perceived impairment, particularly on the basis of psychosocial or 
</p>
<p>intellectual disability or perceived psychosocial or intellectual disability, is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>States shall take all necessary legislative, administrative and judicial measures to prevent 
</p>
<p>and remedy involuntary committals or internments based on disability. 
</p>
<p>104. Where a person with a disability is deprived of his or her liberty through any 
</p>
<p>process, that person is, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in accordance 
</p>
<p>with international human rights law, necessarily including the right to liberty and security 
</p>
<p>of person, reasonable accommodation and humane treatment in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>objectives and principles of the highest standards of international law pertaining to the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>105. A mechanism complete with due process of law guarantees shall be established to 
</p>
<p>review cases of placement in any situation of deprivation of liberty without specific, free 
</p>
<p>and informed consent. Such reviews are to include the possibility of appeal. 
</p>
<p>106. Measures shall be taken to ensure accessibility and the provision of reasonable 
</p>
<p>accommodation to persons with disabilities in their place of deprivation of liberty, 
</p>
<p>including the following guarantees: 
</p>
<p>(a) Persons with a physical, mental, psychosocial, intellectual or sensory 
</p>
<p>disability deprived of their liberty are to be treated with humanity and respect, and in 
</p>
<p>a manner that takes into account their needs by the provision of reasonable 
</p>
<p>accommodation in order to facilitate their effective procedural performance;  
</p>
<p>(b) All health and support services, including all mental health -care 
</p>
<p>services, are to be provided based on the free and informed consent of the person 
</p>
<p>concerned. The denial of legal capacity of persons with disabilities and detention in 
</p>
<p>institutions against their will, without their consent or with the consent of a 
</p>
<p>substituted decision-maker constitutes arbitrary deprivation of liberty in violation of 
</p>
<p>international law. Perceived or actual deficits in mental capacity, namely, the 
</p>
<p>decision-making skills of a person that naturally vary from one to another, may not 
</p>
<p>be used as justification for denying legal capacity, understood as the ability to hold 
</p>
<p>rights and duties (legal standing) and to exercise those rights and duties (legal 
</p>
<p>agency); 
</p>
<p>(c)  Persons with disabilities are to have access to, on an equal basis with 
</p>
<p>other persons subject to detention, the physical environment, information and 
</p>
<p>communications, and other facilities provided by the detaining authority. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, all relevant measures are to be taken, including the identification and 
</p>
<p>removal of obstacles and barriers to access so that persons with disabilities who are 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty may live independently and participate fully in all aspec ts of 
</p>
<p>daily life in their place of deprivation of liberty;  
</p>
<p>(d) Accessibility should also take into account the gender and age of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, and equal access should be provided regardless of the type 
</p>
<p>of impairment, legal status, social condition, gender and age of the detainee;  
</p>
<p>(e) Persons with disabilities shall be provided with legal or other 
</p>
<p>appropriate support, including interpretation and peer support mechanisms , so that </p>


<p><b> 25</b> 
</p>
<p>individuals receiving services in mental health facilities or residential facilities of 
</p>
<p>any kind may be informed about their rights and remedies under domestic and 
</p>
<p>international law, including those contained in the present Basic Principles and 
</p>
<p>Guidelines, and organizations may act on behalf of those detained against the ir will. 
</p>
<p>107. The following measures shall be taken to ensure procedural accommodation and the 
</p>
<p>provision of accessibility and reasonable accommodation for the exercise of the substantive 
</p>
<p>rights of access to justice and equal recognition before the law: 
</p>
<p>(a) Persons with disabilities shall be informed about, and provided access 
</p>
<p>to, promptly and as required, appropriate support to exercise their legal capacity with 
</p>
<p>respect to proceedings related to the detention and in the detention setting itself. 
</p>
<p>Support in the exercise of legal capacity is to respect the rights, will and preferences 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities and should never amount to substituted decision -making; 
</p>
<p>(b) Persons with psychosocial disabilities are to be given the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>stand trial promptly, with support and accommodations as may be needed, rather 
</p>
<p>than declaring such persons incompetent;  
</p>
<p>(c) Persons with disabilities are to have access, on an equal basis with other 
</p>
<p>persons subject to detention, to buildings in which law enforcement agencies and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary are located. Jurisdictional entities must ensure that their services include 
</p>
<p>information and communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Appropriate measures shall be taken to provide signage in Braille and in easy  to read 
</p>
<p>and understand forms of live assistance and intermediaries, including guides, readers 
</p>
<p>and professional sign language interpreters, to facilitate accessibility to 
</p>
<p>communication in the facilities of jurisdictional entities;  
</p>
<p>(d) Individuals who are currently detained in a psychiatric hospital or 
</p>
<p>similar institution and/or subjected to forced treatment, or who may be so detained or 
</p>
<p>forcibly treated in the future, must be informed about ways in which they may 
</p>
<p>effectively and promptly secure their release, including injunctive relief; 
</p>
<p>(e) Injunctive relief should consist in an order requiring the facility to 
</p>
<p>release the person immediately and/or to cease immediately any forced treatment and 
</p>
<p>anysystemic measures, such as those requiring mental health facilities to unlock their 
</p>
<p>doors and to inform persons of their right to leave, and establishing a public 
</p>
<p>authority to provide for access to housing, means of subsistence and other forms of 
</p>
<p>economic and social support in order to facilitate  de-institutionalization and the right 
</p>
<p>to live independently and be included in the community. Such assistance 
</p>
<p>programmes should not be centred on the provision of mental health services or 
</p>
<p>treatment, but free or affordable community-based services, including alternatives 
</p>
<p>that are free from medical diagnosis and interventions. Access to medications and 
</p>
<p>assistance in withdrawing from medications should be made available for those who 
</p>
<p>so decide; 
</p>
<p>(f) Persons with disabilities are provided with compensation, as well as 
</p>
<p>other forms of reparations, in the case of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>The said compensation is also to take into account the damage caused by lack of 
</p>
<p>accessibility, denial of reasonable accommodation or lack of health care and 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation that have affected persons with a disability deprived of liberty.  </p>


<p><b>  Guideline 21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific measures for non-nationals, including migrants regardless of their migration 
</b></p>
<p><b>status, asylum seekers, refugees and stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>108. Any restrictions on the liberty of non-nationals, including migrants regardless of 
</p>
<p>their migration status, asylum seekers, refugees and stateless persons, is to be a measure of 
</p>
<p>last resort, necessary and proportionate, and imposed only where less restrictive alternatives 
</p>
<p>have been considered and been found to be inadequate to meet legitimate purposes.  
</p>
<p>109. All individuals who find themselves in the territory or subject to the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction shall be guaranteed effective and free access to the courts of law. This includes 
</p>
<p>the right: 
</p>
<p>(a) To be informed orally and in writing of the reasons for detention, and 
</p>
<p>on the rights of persons in detention, including the right to challenge the arbitrariness 
</p>
<p>and lawfulness of detention, in a language, means, mode or format that the person 
</p>
<p>detained understands. This may require the provision of information through 
</p>
<p>qualified interpreters and translators at no cost to the detainee and the publicizing of 
</p>
<p>information, including through posters and television monitors in places of 
</p>
<p>detention; 
</p>
<p>(b) To bring proceedings, either personally or through a representative, 
</p>
<p>before a court to challenge the necessity, proportionality, arbitrariness and lawfulness 
</p>
<p>of detention and to receive without delay appropriate and accessible remedies; 
</p>
<p>(c) To contact, and be contacted by, any interested parties that might be 
</p>
<p>able to address their needs and to provide them with relevant information or legal 
</p>
<p>assistance, including providing facilities to meet with such persons. This is 
</p>
<p>particularly important where migrant detention facilities are located in remote 
</p>
<p>locations far from population centres. In such situations, mobile courts and video 
</p>
<p>conferencing may be used to gain accessibility to a court of law but do not preclude 
</p>
<p>the right of a detained person to appear in person before a judge. 
</p>
<p>110. The monitoring of all places of immigration detention and public reporting by 
</p>
<p>relevant United Nations agencies, regional and international human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and consular officials 
</p>
<p>(conditional upon request by persons in immigration detention) shall be permitted to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the exercise of the right to bring proceedings before court to challenge the lawfulness 
</p>
<p>and arbitrariness of detention and to receive appropriate remedies is accessible and 
</p>
<p>effective.  
</p>
<p>111. Decisions regarding the detention of non-nationals are to take into account also the 
</p>
<p>effect of the detention on the physical and mental health of the said persons. When physical 
</p>
<p>and mental security cannot be guaranteed in detention, authorities should provide 
</p>
<p>alternatives to detention. 
</p>
<p>112. All decisions and actions taken in relation to non-nationals below the age of 18, 
</p>
<p>whether accompanied or unaccompanied, shall be guided by the right of the child to have 
</p>
<p>his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration, and shall accord with the specific 
</p>
<p>protections afforded to children in the present Basic Principles and Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>113. National legislative frameworks and migration policies shall reflect that the 
</p>
<p>detention of children because of their or their parent&#8217;s migration status always constitutes a 
</p>
<p>violation of the rights of the child, and contravenes the right of the child to have his or her 
</p>
<p>best interests taken as a primary consideration. 
</p>
<p>114. Unaccompanied children who are non-nationals shall be informed about their legal 
</p>
<p>status to ensure that they fully understand their situation. Public defence services and/or </p>


<p><b> 27</b> 
</p>
<p>guardians made available to children are to be adequately trained to work with children, 
</p>
<p>particularly taking into account the extreme vulnerability and need for care, and are to 
</p>
<p>speak a language they understand. Children who are non-nationals should not be placed in 
</p>
<p>detention centres or shelters for migrants, but in non-custodial community-based 
</p>
<p>alternatives to detention, where they may receive all services necessary for their protection, 
</p>
<p>such as adequate nutrition, access to quality education and leisure, care, physical and 
</p>
<p>psychological medical care and security. Special attention should be given to family 
</p>
<p>reunification. 
</p>
<p>115. In the case of migrants in an irregular situation, the scope of the judicial review 
</p>
<p>should not be confined to a formal assessment of the migrant&#8217;s current migration status, but 
</p>
<p>also include the possibility of release if detention is determined to be unnecessary, 
</p>
<p>disproportionate, unlawful or arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>116. In the case of asylum seekers, the scope of judicial review should recognize that 
</p>
<p>there is a right to seek asylum under international law and that, given that it is neither an 
</p>
<p>unlawful nor a criminal act, it cannot be invoked as grounds for their detention. Asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers and refugees are to be protected from penalization for their illegal entry or stay in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international refugee law, including through the use of detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guideline 22 
</b></p>
<p><b>Implementation measures  
</b></p>
<p>117. Legislative, administrative, judicial and other measures, including through the 
</p>
<p>development of common law principles, shall be adopted to give effect to the present Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles and Guidelines to ensure that the rights and obligations contained in them are 
</p>
<p>always guaranteed in law and practice, including in the event of a public emergency 
</p>
<p>threatening the life of the nation and the existence of which has been officially proclaimed. 
</p>
<p>118. The above-mentioned measures shall include a review of existing legislative, 
</p>
<p>administrative and other provisions to assess compatibility with the present Basic Principles 
</p>
<p>and Guidelines. The country visits of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention present an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with the Government of the State in question and 
</p>
<p>with representatives of civil society with the aim ofassisting in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>principles and guidelines.  
</p>
<p>119. For the proper implementation of these guarantees, States are encouraged to promote 
</p>
<p>appropriate training for those working in the field of the administration of justice, including 
</p>
<p>police and prison staff. This measure also includes providing training to judges, tribunal 
</p>
<p>and legal officers on how to apply customary international law and rules from the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as well as relevant international 
</p>
<p>standards. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stands ready to assist in fulfilling 
</p>
<p>this duty of States. 
</p>
<p>120. Legislation shall be enacted to consider a crime any act or omission that impedes or 
</p>
<p>restricts the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before a 
</p>
<p>court to challenge the arbitrariness and lawfulness of detention and to receive without delay 
</p>
<p>appropriate and accessible remedies. 
</p>
<p>121. Violations of the rights enshrined in the present Basic Principles and Guidelines 
</p>
<p>shall be investigated, prosecuted and punished. 
</p>
<p>122. The present Basic Principles and Guidelines shall be widely disseminated, including 
</p>
<p>to justice sector actors, the community and to national human rights institutions, national 
</p>
<p>preventative mechanisms, statutory oversight authorities and other institutions or 
</p>
<p>organizations with a mandate to provide accountability, oversight or inspections to places
