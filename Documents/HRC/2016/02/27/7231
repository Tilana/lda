<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate, by 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980. The 
</p>
<p>mandate was most recently extended by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 27/1 of 
</p>
<p>25 September 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
</p>
<p>or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In that 
</p>
<p>humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
</p>
<p>family members of victims of enforced disappearance and other sources reporting cases of 
</p>
<p>disappearances, and the Governments concerned. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 47/133 and of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (hereinafter &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>Declaration&#8221;), the Working Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in 
</p>
<p>fulfilling their obligations derived from the Declaration. The Human Rights Council, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 7/12, encouraged the Working Group to provide assistance in the implementation 
</p>
<p>by States of the Declaration and of existing international rules.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report reflects the activities of and communications and cases examined 
</p>
<p>by the Working Group covering the period from 17 May 2014 to 15 May 2015. A summary 
</p>
<p>of the decisions on individual cases taken by the Working Group and communications 
</p>
<p>transmitted to the States concerned during the reporting period is presented in a table (see 
</p>
<p>sect. III).  
</p>
<p>5. Since its inception, the Working Group has transmitted a total of 54,557 cases to 105 
</p>
<p>States. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet been clarified, 
</p>
<p>closed or discontinued stands at 43,563 in a total of 88 States. During the reporting period, 
</p>
<p>65 cases were clarified. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group notes with appreciation that there has been an improvement in 
</p>
<p>speed of the translation of the replies received from Governments concerning cases.  
</p>
<p>7. In spite of some improvements to the content and layout of the English web page of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group&#8217;s website, the Working Group regrets that the majority of the content 
</p>
<p>on the website is in English only. The Working Group once again calls on the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide adequate resources to 
</p>
<p>bring it up to date and render it more accessible.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group is grateful to the Human Rights Council and the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly for the recognition, through the granting of an additional post under the regular 
</p>
<p>budget, of its need to receive additional support, given its huge workload and variety of 
</p>
<p>activities. It is also thankful for the continuous support, including through voluntary 
</p>
<p>contributions, provided by donor States, notably Argentina, France and Japan. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 17 May 2014 to 15 May 2015

<p>pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/4. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group held its 105th session in Argentina from 2 to 6 March 2015, to 
</p>
<p>mark the 35th anniversary of its creation. The Working Group is grateful to the

<p>extended invitations to the Working Group to visit their countries: the Governments of Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka and Turkey, which invited the Working Group to undertake a visit in 2015; as well 
</p>
<p>as the Governments of Albania, which extended an invitation to the Working Group for 
</p>

</p>
<p>31. During the reporting period, the Working Group requested visits to Albania, 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>35. On 30 May 2014, the Working Group, jointly with other special procedures, issued a 
</p>
<p>press statement emphasizing that the decision of the Security Council not to refer the 
</p>
<p>situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court leaves the door 
</p>
<p>wide open for new atrocities in the ongoing conflict.3 
</p>
<p>36. On 13 June 2014, the Working Group, jointly with other special procedures, issued a 
</p>

<p>reconciliation could hardly be achieved in Thailand if human rights guarantees were 
</p>
<p>neglected.4

</p>
<p>deal with serious violations of human rights.11

<p>30 years in prison.13

<p>Parliament of Mexico to legislate on a number of human rights violations, including 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances.19  
</p>
<p><b> G. Thematic study on enforced disappearance and economic, social  
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group has completed its study on the relationship between enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and economic, social and cultural rights. The report is contained in an 
</p>
<p>addendum to the present report (A/HRC/30/38/Add.5). 
</p>
<p>53. That study examines the indivisibility of economic, social and cultural rights, and 
</p>
<p>civil and political rights in the case of enforced disappearances. Enforced disappearance, by 
</p>
<p>its nature, violates the economic, social and cultural rights of the disappeared person, his or 
</p>
<p>her family and others. In addition, those lacking the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights are, in many instances, more vulnerable to becoming victims of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance. 
</p>
<p>54. The study also emphasizes how people who are active in promoting or exercising the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights are, in many contexts, at a greater risk of 
</p>
<p>becoming victims of enforced disappearance. In such circumstances, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances are used as a tool to deter people from promoting and exercising economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group also observes that, under the Declaration, States have an 
</p>
<p>obligation to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances and to provide reparations to 
</p>
<p>all victims of enforced disappearances, taking into account the intrinsic connection between 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances and economic, social and cultural rights. Effective measures to 
</p>
<p>prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances, and to provide reparation to the victims, 
</p>
<p>require a comprehensive approach that encompasses proper promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights.

<p> 20 Urgent actions are cases of enforced disappearances occurred within three months prior to the receipt of a report by the Working Group; or cases 
</p>
<p>of enforced disappearances occurred prior to the three-month limit, but within one year prior to the receipt of a report by the Working Group, 
</p>
<p>provided that there is a link with a case that occurred within the three-month period. Standard cases are cases of enforced disappearances occurred 
</p>
<p>prior to the three-month limit. Prompt intervention letters concern cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against families of disappeared 
</p>
<p>persons, witnesses, lawyers, human rights defenders and other individuals concerned with disappearances. Urgent appeals concern allegations of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances; or allegations regarding persons deprived of liberty who are at risk of being disappeared. General allegations concern 
</p>
<p>alleged obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 21 The Working Group determined during its 106th session that one case was a duplicate and subsequently expunged it from the records. </p>

<p><b> IV. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>56. In addition to the observations formulated in its post-sessional documents (see para. 
</p>
<p>11 above), the Working Group makes the following country-specific observations based on 
</p>
<p>the cooperation received and on significant developments regarding its mandate during the 
</p>
<p>whole reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Albania 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Working Group thanks the Government of Albania for the invitation to the 
</p>
<p>Working Group to visit the country. The Working Group hopes that the visit can be carried 
</p>
<p>out in the course of 2016 
</p>
<p><b>  Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Working Group expresses its deep disappointment that, in spite of an official 
</p>
<p>communication received in February 2014 in which the Government of Algeria invited the 
</p>
<p>Working Group to visit Algeria during the second semester of 2014, it has not accepted the 
</p>
<p>different dates offered by the Working Group. The Working Group hopes that it can soon 
</p>
<p>be allowed to conduct a visit to the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bahrain  
</b></p>
<p>59. The Working Group thanks the Government for the reply to the general allegation 
</p>
<p>sent on 23 September 2014 (see A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, paras. 13-32, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, para. 13 and annex I). It would appreciate receiving additional 
</p>
<p>information on the specific steps taken by the Government to prevent and terminate alleged 
</p>
<p>cases of short-term enforced disappearance and on the measures taken to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>relatives of persons deprived of their liberty are informed accurately and promptly of their 
</p>
<p>detention, in accordance with article 10 (2) of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>60. On 27 October 2014, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Working Group regrets that no information has been received from the 
</p>
<p>Government in connection with a general allegation transmitted on 4 May 2011, concerning 
</p>
<p>the alleged frequent use of enforced disappearance as a tool by law enforcement agencies, 
</p>
<p>paramilitary and armed forces to detain and even extrajudicially execute individuals (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/22/45 and Corr.1, para. 33).  
</p>
<p>62. On 12 March 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of a 
</p>
<p>reminder sent on 28 October 2014. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be 
</p>
<p>received soon. </p>


<p><b>  Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>63. In relation to the press release issued on 19 November 2014 (A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, 
</p>
<p>para. 18), the Working Group reminds the Government that, according to the Declaration, 
</p>
<p>persons accused of committing enforced disappearances should be prosecuted, tried and, if 
</p>
<p>found guilty, appropriately punished.  
</p>
<p><b>  Brazil 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Working Group welcomes the release of the report of the Truth Commission, 
</p>
<p>which recognizes the right to truth in the context of the grave human rights violations that 
</p>
<p>occurred in the past.  
</p>
<p><b>  Burundi 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 27 May 2009, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
</p>
<p>the country. Despite reminders sent, no response yet has been received from the 
</p>
<p>Government. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group, on the basis of the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/28/71, para. 67), decided to request an invitation to undertake a visit to the country. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Working Group thanks the Government for the high number of replies which 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the Government&#8217;s commitment to engage with the Working Group and 
</p>
<p>allowed it to clarify some cases. It is however concerned that, during the reporting period, it 
</p>
<p>transmitted 66 reported cases of enforced disappearances under the urgent action procedure 
</p>
<p>to the Government (see A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, para. 53; A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, para. 45; 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WGEID/106/1, paras. 25 ff.) in relation to what seems to be a recent pattern of 
</p>
<p>short-term disappearances. It reiterates that, as provided in article 7 of the Declaration, no 
</p>
<p>circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances, and that 
</p>
<p>accurate information on the detention of such persons and their place or places of detention, 
</p>
<p>including transfers, shall be made promptly available to their family members, their counsel 
</p>
<p>or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in the information (art. 10 (2) of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration). 
</p>
<p>68. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
</p>
<p>the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of reminders 
</p>
<p>sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  El Salvador 
</b></p>
<p>69. With reference to a general allegation and a follow-up thereon transmitted to the 
</p>
<p>Government (see A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, paras. 52-57, and A/HRC/WGEID/106/1, paras. 
</p>
<p>39 ff.) the Working Group encourages the Government to intensify its efforts to ensure </p>


<p>truth and justice as well as adequate reparation to victims, in accordance with article 13 (1) 
</p>
<p>of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group also invites the Government to look into the allegations of new 
</p>
<p>modalities of current forms of disappearances and to support relatives and victims in this 
</p>
<p>regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Gambia 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group is concerned that, during the reporting period, it transmitted to 
</p>
<p>the Government seven cases under its urgent action procedure (see A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, 
</p>
<p>para. 58). No response was received thereto. The Working Group recalls articles 7 (&#8220;no 
</p>
<p>circumstances whatsoever &#8230; may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances&#8221;) and 10 
</p>
<p>(&#8220;accurate information on the detention of such persons and their place or places of 
</p>
<p>detention, including transfers, shall be made promptly available to their family members, 
</p>
<p>their counsel or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in the information&#8221;) of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group thanks the Government for the substantive reply dated 16 
</p>
<p>January 2015 to the communication transmitted on 22 December 2014 (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, paras. 61 and 62 and annex II) concerning the allegations of a 
</p>
<p>possible application of amnesty for the former Head of State Jos&#233; Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt on 
</p>
<p>charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In this respect, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the important of truth and justice for victims reiterating its previous observation 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/27/49, para. 77) that they are both fundamental elements both for reparation 
</p>
<p>for the victims and to ensure the non-recurrence of the heinous crimes that characterized the 
</p>
<p>civil war, including enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  India 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Working Group regrets that it has not received a reply to a letter, transmitted 
</p>
<p>jointly with two other special procedures mandate holders on 23 January 2015, concerning 
</p>
<p>the allegations of continuing construction work on the site of a newly discovered mass 
</p>
<p>grave (see A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, para. 66). The Working Group emphasized the 
</p>
<p>importance of preserving mass grave sites, including ensuring that an effective criminal and 
</p>
<p>forensic investigation can take place, and to take appropriate measures to assist victims to 
</p>
<p>achieve truth and justice.  
</p>
<p>74. On 16 August 2010, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country. No positive response has been received yet in spite of reminders sent. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon. 
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Working Group regrets that it has not received during the reporting period any 
</p>
<p>information regarding the outstanding cases, including the seven individuals abducted in 
</p>
<p>September 2013 (see AHRC/27/49, para. 80).  </p>


<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Working Group is concerned at the lack of replies from the Government to its 
</p>
<p>communications, including a general allegation transmitted on 30 September 2014 in 
</p>
<p>relation to enforced disappearances and other human rights violations reportedly carried out 
</p>
<p>by the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (see A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, paras. 71-78). It recalls 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 21/4, in which the Council urges States to cooperate with 
</p>
<p>the Working Group to help it to carry out its mandate effectively. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>reiterates that, as provided in article 7 of the Declaration, no circumstances whatsoever may 
</p>
<p>be invoked to justify enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>77. On 19 February 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
</p>
<p>visit to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of a 
</p>
<p>reminder sent on 28 October 2014. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be 
</p>
<p>received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>78. The follow-up report on the implementation of the recommendations made by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group after its visit to Mexico in 2011 (see A/HRC/19/58/Add.2) can be found in 
</p>
<p>document A/HRC/30/38/Add.4. The Working Group thanks the Government of Mexico for 
</p>
<p>its cooperation throughout the process and hopes that the recommendations contained 
</p>
<p>therein will be duly implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>  Morocco 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Working Group reiterates the observations contained in the previous annual 
</p>
<p>report (A/HRC/27/49, para. 86) on the importance to ensure the right to truth for the 
</p>
<p>families of victims, including a full and independent investigation into the allegations of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances. In this respect, the Working Group recommends the Government 
</p>
<p>to take in adequate account all the information available on enforced disappearances, 
</p>
<p>including that of forensic experts. It also recalls article 13, paragraph 4, of the Declaration, 
</p>
<p>which provides that the findings of investigation on cases of enforced disappearances shall 
</p>
<p>be made available upon request to all persons concerned, unless doing so would jeopardize 
</p>
<p>an ongoing criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Working Group is concerned that, during the reporting period, it transmitted to 
</p>
<p>the Government 57 new cases under its urgent action procedure (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, para. 93; A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, para. 96; A/HRC/WGEID/106/1, 
</p>
<p>para. 58). It reiterates that, as provided in article 7 of the Declaration, no circumstances 
</p>
<p>whatsoever may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances, and that accurate 
</p>
<p>information on the detention of such persons and their place or places of detention, 
</p>
<p>including transfers, shall be made promptly available to their family members, their counsel 
</p>
<p>or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in the information (art. 10 (2) of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration). The Working Group thanks the Government for the reply dated 6 May 2015 
</p>
<p>providing information on a high number of cases and reiterating the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to remain engaged with the Working Group. The reply will be considered in 
</p>
<p>detail at next session of the Working Group.  </p>


<p><b>Paraguay 
</b></p>
<p>81. In relation to the general allegation of 7 October 2014 (see A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, 
</p>
<p>paras. 97-107), while the Working Group appreciates the reply received on 7 January 2015 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/WGEID/105/1, paras. 111-115), it considers that more efforts should be made 
</p>
<p>to establish the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared persons and to identify the bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p>82. On 2 November 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
</p>
<p>visit to the country. No positive response has been received yet in spite of reminders sent. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>Rwanda 
</b></p>
<p>83. On 27 October 2014, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>Spain 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligation to either investigate 
</p>
<p>cases of enforced disappearances or, alternatively, cooperate with other countries who want 
</p>
<p>to investigate and prosecute these cases, including by extraditing suspects present in its 
</p>
<p>territory (see A/HRC/WGEID/106/1, para. 68). The Working Group emphasizes that, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 17 of the Declaration, acts constituting enforced disappearance shall 
</p>
<p>be considered a continuing offence as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the fate 
</p>
<p>and the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remain unclarified. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Working Group appreciates the invitation received from the Government to visit 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka from 3 to 12 August 2015. It notes however that, on 17 July 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Government has requested a postponement of the visit in the light of the proximity of the 
</p>
<p>dates scheduled for the visit with the Parliamentary elections. The Working Group notes the 
</p>
<p>commitment expressed by the Government to ensure that the visit can take place at a 
</p>
<p>mutually agreed date before the end of 2015.  
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Working Group continues to be gravely concerned about the situation in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, which may facilitate the occurrence of enforced disappearances. It 
</p>
<p>reiterates article 7 of the Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever 
</p>
<p>may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>87. On 19 September 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
</p>
<p>visit to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of 
</p>
<p>reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  </p>


<p><b>  Thailand 
</b></p>
<p>88. With reference to its previous observations on the matter (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WGEID/104/1, para. 140), the Working Group emphasizes that democratic order 
</p>
<p>and the rule of law are essential elements to prevent the occurrence of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances.  
</p>
<p>89. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
</p>
<p>the country. No positive response yet has been received from the Government in spite of 
</p>
<p>reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>Timor-Leste 
</b></p>
<p>90. The follow-up report on the implementation of the recommendations made by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group after its visit to Timor-Leste in 2011 (A/HRC/19/58/Add.1) can be found 
</p>
<p>in document A/HRC/30/38/Add.4. The Working Group regrets that the Government of 
</p>
<p>Timor-Leste did not cooperate with the Working Group in the process of producing the 
</p>
<p>follow-up report. It hopes that the recommendations contained in the report will be duly 
</p>
<p>implemented.  
</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Working Group appreciates the invitation received from the Government to visit 
</p>
<p>Turkey in November 2015 and looks forward to the visit.  
</p>
<p><b>  United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>92. On 13 September 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
</p>
<p>visit to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of a 
</p>
<p>reminder sent on 27 October 2014. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be 
</p>
<p>received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Working Group continues to be gravely concerned about the situation in 
</p>
<p>Ukraine, which may facilitate the occurrence of enforced disappearances. It reiterates 
</p>
<p>article 7 of the Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever may be 
</p>
<p>invoked to justify enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  Uruguay 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Working Group encourages the Government of Uruguay to deepen and 
</p>
<p>strengthen the efforts to secure the right to truth and justice for enforced disappearances, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Working Group is concerned about the deteriorating situation in Yemen, which 
</p>
<p>may facilitate the occurrence of enforced disappearances. It reiterates article 7 of the </p>


<p>Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group finalized its study on enforced or involuntary 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances and economic, social and cultural rights, which is presented as an 
</b></p>
<p><b>addendum to this report (see paras. 52-55 above). It will continue to conduct studies 
</b></p>
<p><b>on thematic issues of relevance to its mandate and has decided to conduct the next one 
</b></p>
<p><b>on enforced disappearances in the context of migration. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Sadly, enforced disappearances are not a crime of the past but continue to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>used across the world with the false and pernicious belief that they are a useful tool to 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>98. <b>During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 384 newly 
</b></p>
<p><b>reported cases of disappearance to 33 States. It used the urgent action procedure in 
</b></p>
<p><b>151 of those cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>receipt of the report by the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The year 2015 marked the thirty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Argentina for 
</b></p>
<p><b>its invitation to hold the 105th session of the Working Group in Argentina, from 2 to 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>March 2015, in a former secret detention centre, to symbolically mark that date. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Much has been achieved during those 35 years to bring truth and justice to victims, 
</b></p>
<p><b>although it is still too little vis-&#224;-vis the suffering of all relatives who are still searching 
</b></p>
<p><b>for their loved ones. During the reporting period, the Working Group was only able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>clarify 65 cases of enforced disappearance. More than 43,000 cases still remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>unclarified, many dating back decades. Cases remain outstanding with the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group for a number of reasons, notably for the lack of sufficient State willingness, 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity and/or efforts to establish the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared. 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should urgently take into account the sufferings of the families and strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>their efforts to search for the disappeared persons. The Working Group emphasized 
</b></p>
<p><b>in that respect the importance of expanding the use of forensic expertise and DNA 
</b></p>
<p><b>testing.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In spite of the large number of cases, underreporting remains a major problem, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and is due to various reasons, including fear of reprisals, weak administration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems of impunity, poverty, 
</b></p>
<p><b>illiteracy, language barriers, a practice of silence and restrictions on the work of civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. More assistance should be provided to family members and members of civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society to enable them to report cases to the Working Group and more importantly to 
</b></p>
<p><b>keep working on enforced disappearance issues.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Working Group cannot discharge its mandate without the cooperation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>States, particularly in providing information to the families about the fate or 
</b></p>
<p><b>whereabouts of disappeared persons. In that respect, the Working Group remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned that, of the 84 States with outstanding cases, a significant number have 
</b></p>
<p><b>never replied to the Working Group or have provided responses that do not contain 
</b></p>
<p><b>any relevant information. The Working Group urges all States to fulfil their 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations under the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly and the Human Rights Council to properly investigate cases of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances and to cooperate with the Working Group.  </b></p>


<p>102. <b>During the reporting period, the Working Group continued to observe a 
</b></p>
<p><b>pattern of </b>&#8220;<b>short-term</b>&#8221;<b> enforced disappearances being used in a number of countries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group expresses its deep concern at the phenomenon. It stresses that 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is no time limit, no matter how short, for an enforced disappearance to occur 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that accurate information on the detention of any person deprived of liberty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their place of detention shall be made promptly available to their family members.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Working Group is also concerned about the deteriorating situation in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>number of countries, as reflected in the present report. It reiterates article 7 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of 
</b></p>
<p><b>war, a state of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may 
</b></p>
<p><b>be invoked to justify enforced disappearances.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Working Group continues to note a pattern of threats, intimidation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reprisals against victims of enforced disappearance, including family members, 
</b></p>
<p><b>witnesses and human rights defenders working on such cases. It calls upon States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>take specific measures to prevent such acts, protect those working on cases of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances and punish the perpetrators, in accordance with article 13 (1) and (3) 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Declaration. The Working Group reiterates its support for the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a United Nations-wide senior focal point to engage with all stakeholders, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>Member States, to promote the prevention of, protection against and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>for reprisals and intimidation related to cooperation with the United Nations, its 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives and mechanisms (see A/HRC/27/49, para. 119). It regrets that no 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress has been made on that matter during the reporting period.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Country visits are an integral part of the mandate fulfilled by the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group. Visits allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforced disappearance, to assist States in reducing obstacles to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration and to ensure direct contact with the family members of victims. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group thanks the Governments of Albania, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Turkey for the invitations extended during the reporting period. It also recognizes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>support provided by the Governments of Croatia, Montenegro, Peru and Serbia 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the visits carried out in the reporting period. During that period, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group requested visits to Albania, Bahrain, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Macedonia, Rwanda and South Africa. In addition to those new requests, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group has requested in the past a visit to the following countries, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>having yet received a positive response: Bangladesh, Belarus, Burundi, China, Egypt, 
</b></p>
<p><b>India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe</b>. <b>There are other countries that have invited the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group to visit and/or confirmed invitations, but for which specific dates to visit have 
</b></p>
<p><b>not been agreed, such as Algeria and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group therefore calls upon all States with pending requests for visits to respond 
</b></p>
<p><b>favourably to them in the light of Human Rights Council resolution 21/4, and those 
</b></p>
<p><b>that have agreed to visits to respond as soon as possible with specific dates.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group once again calls upon States that have not signed and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disappearance to do so as soon as possible and to accept the competence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on Enforced Disappearances to receive individual cases under article 31, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and inter-State complaints under article 32 of the Convention.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Working Group is concerned about increasing instances of abductions 
</b></p>
<p><b>carried out by non-State actors, which may be tantamount of acts of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances. The Working Group has decided to continue paying attention to and 
</b></p>
<p><b>studying the question of disappearances carried out by non-State actors in order to </b></p>


<p><b>determine if those situations fall under its mandate and, if so, what actions should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken. The Working Group calls on all relevant stakeholders to take appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures in relation to this issue and to provide information to, and share their views 
</b></p>
<p><b>on this matter with, the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Working Group is grateful to the Human Rights Council and the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly for the recognition, through the granting of an additional post under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>regular budget, of its need to receive additional support, given its huge workload and 
</b></p>
<p><b>variety of activities. It is also thankful for the continuous support, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>voluntary contributions, provided by donor States, notably Argentina, France and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Japan The Working Group calls on all States for greater assistance to allow it to 
</b></p>
<p><b>better accomplish its mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The obligations to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearance and to secure 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to truth, justice and reparation of victims remain the same although there 
</b></p>
<p><b>are changing circumstances in which enforced disappearances occur or in which 
</b></p>
<p><b>public policies are developed. Thus new strategies to counter this heinous crime are 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed and the Working Group urges States to adopt and/or strengthen measures as 
</b></p>
<p><b>to fulfil the obligations laid out in the Declaration.
