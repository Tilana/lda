<p><b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, which covers the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 October 
</p>
<p>2014, the Secretary-General addresses the progress made in the implementation of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 25/28. In that resolution, the Council demanded that Israel, as the 
</p>
<p>occupying Power, cease immediately and completely all of its settlement activities in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan. It also condemned the continuing settlement and related activities, including the 
</p>
<p>expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, and the 
</p>
<p>confiscation and destruction of property. The Council called upon Israel to end human 
</p>
<p>rights violations linked to the presence of settlements and to fulfil its international 
</p>
<p>obligations to provide effective remedy for victims.  
</p>
<p>2. The information presented in the present report is based on monitoring and other 
</p>
<p>information-gathering activities carried out by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and information provided by other United 
</p>
<p>Nations entities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The report also contains information 
</p>
<p>received from Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organizations and media sources. It 
</p>
<p>should be read in conjunction with previous reports of the Secretary-General on Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly (A/HRC/20/13, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/38, A/63/519, A/64/516, A/65/365, A/66/364, A/67/375/, A/68/513 and 
</p>
<p>A/69/348). 
</p>
<p>3. In past reports, the various types of impact of settlements on the rights of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians and the key role played by the State of Israel in the creation and expansion of 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, were 
</p>
<p>analysed. In his previous report on settlements submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/38), the Secretary-General focused on the discriminatory nature of Israeli 
</p>
<p>planning policy, law and practice, which is contrary to international law and has a negative 
</p>
<p>impact on the human rights of Palestinians.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Secretary-General analyses the impact of Israeli settlements 
</p>
<p>and settler violence on the economic, social and cultural rights of Palestinians, and provides 
</p>
<p>an update on settler violence against Palestinians and their property, as well as on the 
</p>
<p>general lack of law enforcement and accountability for settlers in such cases.  
</p>
<p><b>II. Legal background 
</b></p>
<p>5. International humanitarian law and international human rights law apply, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>in relation to Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/25/38, para. 
</p>
<p>4 and A/69/348, para. 4). Israel, as the occupying Power, is bound by the Fourth Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention and the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague 
</p>
<p>Regulations).1 Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention establishes that &#8220;the occupying 
</p>
<p>Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it 
</p>
<p>occupies&#8221;. The construction and expansion of Israeli settlements, as well as other 
</p>
<p>settlement-related activities such as the construction of the wall violate this provision, and 
</p>
<p>are illegal under international law. This was confirmed by the Security Council in its 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  In its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of the Wall in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory (A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1, paras. 89-101), the International Court of Justice 
</p>
<p>found that, even if Israel is not a party to the Hague Regulations, they are nonetheless applicable to 
</p>
<p>Israel as customary law.  </p>


<p>resolution 465 (1980), the General Assembly in its resolution 68/82, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in its resolution 25/28 and the International Court of Justice (A/ES-10/273 and 
</p>
<p>Corr.1, para. 120). 
</p>
<p>6. In addition to its obligations under international humanitarian law and under 
</p>
<p>customary international law, Israel, as the occupying Power, must also comply with the 
</p>
<p>obligations arising from the international human rights treaties it has ratified, with respect 
</p>
<p>to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem (A/HRC/25/38, para. 5). As 
</p>
<p>much was confirmed by the International Court of Justice (A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1, paras. 
</p>
<p>102-113), and by the human rights treaty bodies monitoring the implementation of 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations resulting from such treaties (see CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, 
</p>
<p>para. 5, and CRC/C/ISR/CO/2-4, para. 3). The accession by the State of Palestine to several 
</p>
<p>human rights treaties does not affect the obligations of Israel under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law and international humanitarian law (A/69/348, para. 5). 
</p>
<p><b>III. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>7. During the period under review, Israel continued to expand existing settlements in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to approve plans for new ones. According to 
</p>
<p>an Israeli non-governmental organization, between 1 November 2013 and 31 October 2014, 
</p>
<p>4,554 housing units were tendered in Israeli settlements in the West Bank (2,856), 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem (1,698), and 10,183 housing units were promoted,2<b> </b>6,042 in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank and 4,141 in East Jerusalem. As previously reported, on 4 June, the Government 
</p>
<p>of Israel announced the issuing of tenders for more than 1,400 new settlement housing units 
</p>
<p>in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (A/69/348, para. 6).In September 2014, the 
plan to build 2,610 units in the Givat Hamatos settlement in East Jerusalem was approved 
</p>
<p>by the relevant planning committee, opening the path for the issuance of tenders.3 If 
</p>
<p>constructed, it would be the first government-led new settlement in East Jerusalem since the 
</p>
<p>construction of Har Homa in the late 1990s,4 and would sever the territorial continuity 
</p>
<p>between the Palestinian neighbourhoods of southern East Jerusalem and the southern West 
</p>
<p>Bank.5 
</p>
<p>8.  The Secretary-General notes the drop in the initiation of new construction in 
</p>
<p>settlements in 2014 when compared to 2013,6 a year when an exceptional amount of new 
</p>
<p>construction was recorded.7 The figures of 2014 are similar to the average number of new 
</p>
<p>building projects initiated in 2011 and 2012 (250-300 housing units per quarter). The 
</p>
<p>marketing of housing units in the settlements was, however, reportedly on the rise (by 
</p>
<p>866%) during the first seven months of 2014. 8  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Peace Now uses the term &#8220;promote&#8221; to indicate support from the Government of Israel in advancing 
</p>
<p>new settlement units in the multi-stage planning process.

</p>
<p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Bulletin Monthly Report, September 2014.  
</p>
<p> 6 According to the Central Bureau of Statistics of Israel, between April and June 2014, the building of 
</p>
<p>235 housing units were initiated in Israeli settlements in &#8220;Judea and Samaria&#8221; (West Bank), as against 
</p>
<p>801 housing units started during the same period in 2013.  
</p>
<p> 7 As reported by Peace Now. 
</p>
<p> 8 Marketing of housing units denotes when Israeli authorities sign an agreement with a buyer who won 
</p>
<p>a bid to construct a house or building. See Peace Now, &#8220;When marketing of units increases by 866%, 
</p>
<p>CBS data shows 70% drop in construction starts&#8221;, 9 September 2014.  </p>


<p>9. New outposts were also established during the period under review.9 Following the 
</p>
<p>kidnapping on 12 June of three Israeli youths, who were later found murdered (see paras. 
</p>
<p>39 - 53 below and A/HRC/28/80/Add.1), four outposts were established in the same area 
</p>
<p>where the incident took place, in the southern West Bank.10 The media reported that some 
</p>
<p>Israeli right-wing groups declared that at least one of the outposts had been established in 
</p>
<p>response to the kidnapping and killing of the three Israelis.11 The creation of the outposts 
</p>
<p>was reportedly supported by the municipalities of nearby settlements, which supplied trailer 
</p>
<p>homes and basic electricity and water infrastructure.12 Two of the outposts were dismantled 
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards by the Israeli authorities for being &#8220;illegal&#8221; under Israeli law. At the time 
</p>
<p>of writing, the other two outposts were reportedly still in place (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1).13  
</p>
<p>10. New housing units also advanced in East Jerusalem. On 27 October 2014, media 
</p>
<p>reported that the Israeli Prime Minister&#8217;s office had advanced plans for 660 housing units in 
</p>
<p>the Ramat Shlomo settlement and 400 in the Har Homa settlement.14 According to an Israeli 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organization, the construction of additional housing units in Ramat 
</p>
<p>Shlomo would reduce the buffer area between the settlement and the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. In early November, the Jerusalem District Planning and 
</p>
<p>Building Committee approved the Ramat Shlomo plan, with the number of housing units 
</p>
<p>reduced from 660 to 500.15 New housing units in Har Homa would effectively link the areas 
</p>
<p>of this settlement and Givat Hamatos (see para. 7 above).16 
</p>
<p>11. During the night of 29 September 2014, Israeli settlers moved into six buildings in 
</p>
<p>the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem, below the Old City. This 
</p>
<p>appears to have expanded the settler presence in Silwan by about 100 new settlers, an 
</p>
<p>increase of 35 per cent. It was reported that the buildings had been purchased, although 
</p>
<p>OHCHR is aware that some of the Palestinian owners are taking legal action, claiming that 
</p>
<p>they did not sell their property to the settlers. It is reported that Israeli security forces 
</p>
<p>allowed private security guards hired by the settlers to protect their move to the buildings in 
</p>
<p>the middle of the night. At the time of writing, the Israeli Police were protecting the new 
</p>
<p>settlers from possible attacks from Palestinians.17 The new influx of settlers and the 
</p>
<p>additional presence of the Israeli security forces in an area where the settlement presence 
</p>
<p>has been expanding in recent years contribute to general tensions between Palestinians and 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlers (A/69/348, paras. 31-32). 
</p>
<p>12. During the period under review, Israel undertook significant steps to enable further 
</p>
<p>expansion of settlements. Following an earlier declaration of State land west of Bethlehem 
</p>
<p>in April 2014 (ibid., para. 19), on 25 August 2014, the Israeli Civil Administration 
</p>
<p>announced the declaration as State land a further 3,799 dunums (930 acres) around the 
</p>
<p>settlement of Gva&#8217;ot, also in the vicinity of Bethlehem.18 According to the Israeli media, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Outposts are settlements that, although often established with some kind of government 
</p>
<p>  support, are not officially recognized under Israeli law.  
</p>
<p> 10 As reported by the non-governmental organization Kerem Navot. 
</p>
<p> 11 &#8220;Settlers set up new outpost in honor of murdered teens&#8221;, <i>Times of Israel</i>, 1 July 2014.  
</p>
<p> 12 Peace Now, &#8220;Alarming Developments on the Ground&#8221;, 7 July 2014.  
</p>
<p> 13 Kerem Navot reported that the outposts dismantled were Ramat Ha-shlosha and Tekoa E. The 
</p>
<p>remaining outposts are Givat oz Vegaon and Givat Sorek, both in the Southern West Bank.

</p>
<p> 18 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Bulletin Monthly Report, June &#8211; 
</p>
<p>August 2014.  </p>


<p>declaration was made in response to the killing of the three Israeli teenagers in June 2014.19 
</p>
<p>The affected areas are adjacent to the Green Line within the boundaries of five existing 
</p>
<p>Palestinian villages. Once the process is complete (see A/69/348, paras. 18-21 and 
</p>
<p>A/68/513, para. 20), it is expected that the area will be incorporated into the Gush Etzion 
</p>
<p>Regional Council, possibly as a new illegal settlement.20 This action reportedly constitutes 
</p>
<p>the largest appropriation of Palestinian land in 30 years.21 
</p>
<p>13. The settler population continued to grow during the period under review. According 
</p>
<p>to the official umbrella organization representing settlements (quoting figures obtained 
</p>
<p>from the Ministry of the Interior), during the first six months of 2014, the settler population 
</p>
<p>grew by 2 per cent and is expected to grow to 4 per cent by the end of the year, twice the 
</p>
<p>nationwide population growth rate of Israel.22 A report issued in 2014 indicated that, over 
</p>
<p>the past two decades, the population in Israeli settlements had grown by 240 per cent, 
</p>
<p>outstripping growth rates within Israel.23 Estimates of the current settlement population in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, range between 500,000 and 650,000 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/38, para. 8). 
</p>
<p>14. In past reports, the Secretary-General noted that Israel played a leading role in the 
</p>
<p>construction and expansion of settlements, including through the granting of benefits and 
</p>
<p>incentives to settlers (see A/68/513). During the period under review, public funds 
</p>
<p>continued to be allocated to settlements. In October 2014, the Israeli cabinet reportedly 
</p>
<p>approved the allocation of some $34.7 million to the settlement division of the World 
</p>
<p>Zionist Organization for the purposes of &#8220;developing agricultural and rural settlement&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p>Although it was not specified which part of this amount would be invested in settlements in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (ibid., para. 9), it might be surmised that the final 
</p>
<p>amount would be considerable, given the role of the division in assisting the Government in 
</p>
<p>establishing Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.25 Reportedly, in 2012, 
</p>
<p>the Government invested more per capita in settlements than within Israel, mainly for 
</p>
<p>education and welfare services.26  
</p>
<p>15. With regard to action intended to counter the growth of settlements, the European 
</p>
<p>Union decided to ban dairy and other products of animal origin produced in Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p>which reportedly was to come into force in January 2015.27 In a statement issued on 6 June

<p>other international enterprises reiterated that companies engaged in the Occupied

</p>
<p>light of the heightened risks of negative human rights impact in a conflict-affected area, and 
</p>
<p>take all necessary measures to ensure that they did not have an adverse impact on human 
</p>
<p>rights, in conformity with international law and the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (see also A/HRC/22/63, paras. 96-99 and 117).In 2012, the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General emphasized that the business and human rights agenda of the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>the said Guiding Principles should be an integral part of global efforts to bridge existing 
</p>
<p>governance gaps and safeguard protection and respect for human rights in the context of

<p>economic activities (A/HRC/21/21, para. 92).

<p><b>IV. Impact of Israeli settlements and settler violence on the human rights 
of Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p>16. Israeli settlements and acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers against 
</p>
<p>Palestinians continue to underpin a broad spectrum of human rights violations against 
</p>
<p>Palestinians (see A/HRC/25/38, A/68/513 and A/69/348).  
</p>
<p><b>  Denied or restricted access to agricultural land  
</b></p>
<p>17. As highlighted in previous reports, the access of Palestinians to agricultural lands is 
</p>
<p>severely restricted and often completely denied for a number of reasons, including 
</p>
<p>intimidation and attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians (A/67/375, paras. 19-21); 
</p>
<p>physical obstacles erected by the settlers themselves (A/67/375, paras. 19-21); the 
</p>
<p>imposition of military or security areas off limits to Palestinians, for instance, closed 
</p>
<p>military zones and fenced-off areas around settlements (A/64/516, paras. 30-31; A/65/365, 
</p>
<p>para. 16,); physical movement restrictions, such as the wall, in particular with respect to the 
</p>
<p>farm lands located in the seam zone (A/65/365, para. 33); and settlement roads that impede 
</p>
<p>access to agricultural lands (A/63/519, paras. 16 and 30-36).  
</p>
<p>18. In response to the difficulties faced by Palestinian farmers in gaining access to 
</p>
<p>Palestinian-owned land located in fenced-off areas around Israeli settlements and in areas 
</p>
<p>witnessing frequent incidents of settler violence, the Israeli authorities have, in recent years, 
</p>
<p>applied the &#8220;prior coordination&#8221; regime. This mechanism allows registered Palestinian 
</p>
<p>farmers to have access to their land for a limited number of days each year through 
</p>
<p>settlement gates, or to work in the fields under the protection of Israeli security forces 
</p>
<p>(A/67/375, para. 20). According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
</p>
<p>about 90 Palestinian communities in the West Bank that have land inside or in the vicinity 
</p>
<p>of 55 Israeli settlements and settlement outposts may have access to their land only through 
</p>
<p>&#8220;prior coordination&#8221; with the Israeli authorities.28  
</p>
<p>19. &#8220;Prior coordination&#8221;, which has mostly been applied during the olive harvest, does 
</p>
<p>not prevent attacks on trees and crops, which can occur at any time (A/67/375, para. 20). 
</p>
<p>Access to private Palestinian land at times when no &#8220;prior coordination&#8221; is available 
</p>
<p>remains uncertain and dangerous for farmers, particularly in areas with recurrent incidents 
</p>
<p>of settler violence. Another shortcoming of the mechanism is that it is mainly applied for 
</p>
<p>the olive harvest, not for other harvests. In a case documented by the Office for the 
</p>
<p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israeli security forces officers refused to protect 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, &#8220;The Impact of Israeli Settler Violence on the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Olive Harvest: The Case of Al Mughayyir Village&#8221;, October 2013. </p>


<p>Palestinian farmers when they were picking almonds, asserting that the &#8220;prior coordination&#8221; 
</p>
<p>was only for olives, even though the almond trees were in the same field.29 
</p>
<p>20. Furthermore, incidents have also been recorded in which Palestinian farmers have 
</p>
<p>been denied access to their lands even during the time allowed by &#8220;prior coordination&#8221;; for 
</p>
<p>example, on 20 October 2014, Palestinian farmers were reportedly denied access to their 
</p>
<p>olive orchards located in the village of Deir Istiya (Governorate of Salfit) by security 
</p>
<p>personnel from the settlement of Revava.30 
</p>
<p>21. Another way of restricting access of Palestinians to agricultural land is the permit 
</p>
<p>regime established by Israeli authorities for access to farming land in the seam zone, the 
</p>
<p>closed area located between the wall and the Green Line.31 Israeli authorities often cite 
</p>
<p>security reasons or claim that the portion of land is too small to qualify for a permit to deny 
</p>
<p>Palestinians such permits (according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Affairs, in the past four years, the approval rate in the northern West Bank is 50 per cent).32 
</p>
<p>For those who manage to obtain a permit, access is nonetheless frequently restricted. In 
</p>
<p>2013, there were 81 gates designated for access to agricultural lands in the seam zone; 
</p>
<p>however, only nine of them were kept opened every day, while another nine were kept 
</p>
<p>opened for only one or few more days per week. The majority (63) was kept opened only 
</p>
<p>during the olive harvest season, which lasts approximately 45 days.33 
</p>
<p>22. Palestinian farmers also see access to their private land restricted and often denied 
</p>
<p>by the civilian security coordinators and guards who operate in the Israeli settlements and 
</p>
<p>outposts in the West Bank. These coordinators and guards are drawn from residents of 
</p>
<p>settlements and outposts, and charged with guarding the settlements and outposts on behalf 
</p>
<p>of the Israeli army.34 They are trained and equipped with weapons by the Israel Defense 
</p>
<p>Forces, and are subject to the Military Justice Law.35 At the same time, they are appointed 
</p>
<p>by and act as the representatives of the settlements. As such, the civilian security 
</p>
<p>coordinators identify with the goals of their communities, the illegal settlements, which 
</p>
<p>seek to expand their boundaries, even if construction is on Palestinian-owned land. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR found that the lack of adequate supervision by the Israel Defense Forces and of 
</p>
<p>clearly defined powers leads to daily friction between the security coordinators and the 
</p>
<p>Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>23. Civilian security coordinators and guards have been granted police and law 
</p>
<p>enforcement powers, including the powers to detain, search and arrest persons they deem, 
</p>
<p>based on &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221;, pose a security threat, have committed or are about to 
</p>
<p>commit an offence.36 As a result, civilian security coordinators and guards have de facto a 
</p>
<p>considerable margin of discretion in the conduct of their activities. As observed by Yesh 
</p>
<p>Din, this has enabled them to obstruct arbitrarily the access of Palestinian farmers to their 
</p>
<p>private land located in the vicinity of settlements and outposts. Reportedly, there have been

<p>instances where civilian security coordinators and guards have denied Palestinians access to 
</p>
<p>farming plots located nearby a settlement or an outpost to prevent alleged attacks. In 
</p>
<p>addition, cases of Palestinians being injured or having their property confiscated by these 
</p>
<p>bodies while attempting to gain access to agricultural plots have been reported.37 
</p>
<p>24. In 2009, a series of military orders defined the &#8220;guarding zones&#8221; areas, in which 
</p>
<p>civilian security coordinators and guards operate, in the vicinity of settlements and 
</p>
<p>outposts, in the West Bank.38 The borders of these areas are wider than the municipal 
</p>
<p>boundaries of the settlements, which allows civilian security coordinators and civilian 
</p>
<p>guard squads to act beyond the jurisdiction of the settlements39 and dramatically expands 
</p>
<p>the impact of the settlements on the freedom of movement of Palestinians, as well as on 
</p>
<p>their right to work their land and earn a living from it.40  
</p>
<p>25. The access of Palestinian farmers to their lands is also impeded by attacks and 
</p>
<p>harassment by Israeli settlers. Documented cases of violence appear to be aimed at 
</p>
<p>spreading fear among Palestinian farmers and to deter them from farming their lands, in 
</p>
<p>particular in areas near settlements (A/67/375, para. 19). The phenomenon of settler 
</p>
<p>violence, and the general failure of Israel to ensure accountability for Israeli settlers who 
</p>
<p>break the law and to protect Palestinians against attacks to their person and property, have 
</p>
<p>been thoroughly analysed by the Secretary-General in previous reports (A/69/348, paras. 
</p>
<p>36-44; A/HRC/25/38, paras. 37-47). 
</p>
<p>26. About two-thirds of the land in the West Bank, including the majority of Area C, is 
</p>
<p>unregistered, mainly because of the suspension by Israel of the land registration process in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank at the beginning of the occupation in 1968.
41
</p>
<p> Combined with all of the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned factors that impede the access of Palestinians to agricultural land, this 
</p>
<p>facilitates the dispossession of Palestinians of their land, in particular in Area C of the West 
</p>
<p>Bank. An added factor in Area C is the application of the Ottoman Land Code, which 
</p>
<p>establishes that unregistered land belongs to the ruling Power unless a legitimate private 
</p>
<p>claim to the land arises. Entitlement for such a claim arises over unregistered land that has 
</p>
<p>been cultivated without interruption for a 10-year period, in the absence of which the land 
</p>
<p>is assigned to the ruling Power.
42
</p>
<p> Given the multiple obstacles faced by Palestinians to 
</p>
<p>cultivating their land, it is difficult to comply with the requirement of uninterrupted 
</p>
<p>cultivation for 10 years, which would allow Palestinians to register the land in their name.43 
</p>
<p>In the absence of land registration, Israel has subsequently claimed much of the

<p>Kerem Navot, another form of land registration regime also exists; the &#8220;first registration&#8221; or self-
</p>
<p>initiated land registration, established in 1964 under Jordanian rule, which in principle allows both 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlers and Palestinians to register small portions of land in the West Bank. Owing to the 
</p>
<p>expenses incurred in taxes, lawyers and the elaboration of maps required to use the register, few 
</p>
<p>Palestinian farmers can afford to register their land, while Israeli settlers, often supported by settler 
</p>
<p>organizations, are better placed to take advantage of it. See also B&#8217;Tselem, &#8220;Under the Guise of 
</p>

</p>
<p>2013, annex II, p. 107. The Ottoman Land Code also establishes that the State may take possession of 
</p>
<p>land (held on the basis of a land deed or <i>kushan</i>) that is not cultivated for three consecutive years. See 
</p>
<p>also Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Bulletin Monthly Report, 
</p>
<p>April 2014, and B&#8217;Tselem, &#8220;Under the Guise of Legality&#8221; (see footnote 41) pp. 25-26.

<p> 43 Under the &#8220;first registration&#8221; or self-initiated land registration (see footnote 41). </p>


<p>unregistered land as government property and declared it State land.44 Once declared State 
</p>
<p>land, it is often allocated to settlements (A/69/348, para. 20).45  
</p>
<p>27. The above circumstances create a situation of insecurity of tenure for Palestinian 
</p>
<p>landowners, which in turn create the conditions for Israeli settlers to take over land by 
</p>
<p>cultivating it and eventually registering it under their name.
46
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>28. According to the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of 
</p>
<p>Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security of the Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), States should remove and prohibit 
</p>
<p>all forms of discrimination related to tenure rights, including registration of land.47 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, States are to recognize informal land tenure in a manner that respects existing 
</p>
<p>rights and in ways that recognize the reality of the situation and promote social, economic 
</p>
<p>and environmental well-being. The Palestinians, who have long been present on and have 
</p>
<p>cultivated land in the West Bank, should have their legitimate tenure rights recognized and 
</p>
<p>be protected against dispossession of their land. This is in line with the obligation of Israel, 
</p>
<p>as the occupying Power, to protect the population in the occupied territory and their 
</p>
<p>property.48 
</p>
<p>29. Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property, and the denial or 
</p>
<p>restriction of access to agricultural land, undermine Palestinians&#8217; right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living (A/HRC/25/38, paras. 26-29), as set out in article 11 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Israel is party. The right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living encompasses the right of everyone to continuous improvement 
</p>
<p>in living conditions; however, it is evident that, rather than improving, the living conditions 
</p>
<p>of Palestinians are deteriorating as a consequence of Israeli settlement activities and settler 
</p>
<p>violence, while the settlements continue to prosper (see A/HRC/25/38, A/68/513, 
</p>
<p>A/69/348).  
</p>
<p>30. Before the occupation, agriculture was the main source of labour and resources for 
</p>
<p>Palestinians. Palestinian agriculture has, however, been adversely affected by measures 
</p>
<p>taken by Israel as the occupying Power, in particular land seizures and restrictions on 
</p>
<p>access to land and water resources (A/68/513, para. 40). From 1965 to 1994, cultivated 
</p>
<p>areas shrank by 30 per cent from 1965 to 1994, and Palestinian agricultural production was 
</p>
<p>reduced, from 50 per cent in 1968 to 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2013. 49 
</p>
<p>31. Agriculture constitutes the largest sector of the economy of Israeli settlements 
</p>
<p>(A/68/513, para. 41). Settlers do not face the same restrictions as Palestinians in their access 
</p>
<p>to agricultural land, and receive the protection and support of Israel. This generally allows 
</p>
<p>them to invest in new technologies and more efficient farming methods, which is reflected 
</p>
<p>in their productivity (A/HRC/22/63, paras. 22, 89-92; A/68/513, para. 28; A/69/348, paras. 
</p>
<p>28-32). Every year, Israeli settlers export some $285 million worth of agricultural products, 
</p>
<p>against only $19 million by Palestinians.50

<p><b>  Case study: the olive harvest  
</b></p>
<p>32. Almost half of the agricultural land in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (48 per 
</p>
<p>cent) is planted with 8 million olive trees, with the majority located in the West Bank. The 
</p>
<p>olive oil industry accounts for 25 per cent of all agricultural income of the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory; it is estimated that about 100,000 families depend to some extent on 
</p>
<p>the annual olive harvest for their livelihood (A/HRC/25/38, para. 26).51 Between 90 and 95 
</p>
<p>per cent of the olive harvest is used to produce olive oil. Production of olive oil depends on 
</p>
<p>the yield cycle, and accordingly fluctuates between 6,000 and 34,000 tons a year.52<b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. The restriction or denial of access for Palestinian farmers to olive orchards has a 
</p>
<p>negative impact on the production of olives, in particular in areas in the vicinity of 
</p>
<p>settlements, in the seam zone (where some 40,000 dunums (9,884 acres) of olive groves are 
</p>
<p>located), and in those areas where incidents of settler violence are recurrent. Olive orchards 
</p>
<p>require maintenance all year round. Restrictions on and delay or prevention of performance 
</p>
<p>of agricultural maintenance activities have an adverse impact on productivity and value of 
</p>
<p>the harvest. According to FAO, each olive grove requires a total of 133 days of work a year 
</p>
<p>to adequately maintain it, including tasks such as land clearing, fertilizing, ploughing, pest 
</p>
<p>control and harvesting. Owing to the restrictions imposed, most Palestinian farmers have 
</p>
<p>access to their olive orchards for just a few days a year, mainly confined, through the &#8220;prior 
</p>
<p>coordination&#8221; mechanism, to the harvest period, which is far less than the 133 days required 
</p>
<p>to adequately maintain the orchards.  
</p>
<p>34. Restrictions on access to olive orchards located in the seam zone have a negative 
</p>
<p>impact on the production and the value of the harvest. Data collected in the northern West 
</p>
<p>Bank since 2010 showed that olive trees in the seam zone had a reduction in yield of 
</p>
<p>between 40 and 60 per cent when compared to equivalent trees in areas where maintenance 
</p>
<p>activities could be carried out freely on a regular basis.53 
</p>
<p>35. Settler violence also has a negative impact on Palestinian agricultural productivity. 
</p>
<p>Attacks and intimidation against Palestinian farmers and the destruction of their property 
</p>
<p>take place on a regular basis, affecting their rural livelihoods. According to information 
</p>
<p>from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during the period under 
</p>
<p>review, 8,482 Palestinian-owned trees were damaged in the West Bank, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem. Although there has been a reduction in the number of trees affected in 
</p>
<p>comparison with 2013, the number of trees uprooted and damaged remains high.54  
</p>
<p>36. Settler violence usually increases during the olive harvest (A/67/375, para. 19).55 
</p>
<p>During the first month of the olive harvest, in October 2014, 15 incidents of settler 
</p>
<p>violence, resulting in damage to 277 trees, were recorded.56 For example, on 14 October, 21 
</p>
<p>Palestinian-owned olive trees were reportedly cut and damaged by settlers from the Bait

</p>
<p> 53 Ibid., February 2014, pp. 11-12. 
</p>
<p> 54 Between January and September 2014, 7,342 trees were damaged. During the same period in 2013, 
</p>
<p>the number of trees affected was 8,615.  
</p>
<p> 55 See the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, &#8220;Olive 
</p>
<p>harvest: continued settler attacks against refugee livelihoods&#8221;, October 2013. 
</p>
<p> 56 In 2013, 33 incidents were reported during the whole period of the olive harvest (October &#8211; December 
</p>
<p>2013), which resulted in damage to 1,522 trees.  </p>


<p>Ayin settlement, in the Bethlehem Governorate.57 On 22 October, a field of olives was set 
</p>
<p>alight, allegedly by Israeli settlers from the Yitzhar settlement in the Nablus Governorate.58  
</p>
<p>37. Statistics indicate that most attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian individuals and 
</p>
<p>on Palestinian-owned trees reportedly go unpunished. , Of the 246 investigations opened 
</p>
<p>between 2005 and 2014 monitored by Yesh Din, only four ended with an indictment and 
</p>
<p>223 were closed owing to possible investigative failures, such as a failure to identify 
</p>
<p>suspects or to collect evidence.59 The establishment of an anti-nationalistic crimes unit 
</p>
<p>within the &#8220;Judea and Samaria&#8221; (West Bank) police seems to be ineffective. Out of the 35 
</p>
<p>cases of damage by settlers to Palestinian trees documented by Yesh Din in 2013, 23 cases 
</p>
<p>were closed, apparently because of investigation failures, with no indictments issued.60  
</p>
<p>38. Physical attacks against Palestinian farmers were also recorded during the 2014 
</p>
<p>olive harvest. On 11 October, in the village of Kafr al-Labad, Tulkarem Governorate, 
Israeli settlers reportedly injured a 45-year-old Palestinian man and his 9-year-old son who 
</p>
<p>were picking olives with their family on land that does not require prior coordination for 
</p>
<p>access to it. Three Israeli settlers holding knives reportedly attacked them. The settlers 
</p>
<p>allegedly stole the harvest equipment and personal belongings, and seized five sacks of 
</p>
<p>olives, amounting to approximately 250 kg.61 In another incident on the same day, a 27-
</p>
<p>year-old Palestinian woman was injured by Israeli settlers when picking olives on a grove 
</p>
<p>located near the settlement of Kfar Tappuah, Salfit Governorate.62  
</p>
<p><b>V. Failure to maintain public order, settler violence  
and lack of accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>39. The persistent and troubling phenomenon of settler violence is directly related to the 
</p>
<p>continued existence, proliferation and expansion of illegal settlements inserted in and 
</p>
<p>between Palestinian communities throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as 
</p>
<p>described above and in previous reports of the Secretary-General (see A/69/348, paras. 36- 
</p>
<p>44).  
</p>
<p>40. Settler violence is one of the clearest and most direct negative consequences of the 
</p>
<p>settlements. It affects the enjoyment by Palestinians of their basic rights, including their 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of movement, an adequate standard of living, work, and education, as 
</p>
<p>they face difficulty in having access to schools or their land for fear of attack by settlers 
</p>
<p>(A/68/513, paras. 12-14).63 Repeated calls by the international community for the Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities to address the problem have generally not succeeded in prompting positive 
</p>
<p>action to improve the situation (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para.16 and A/69/348, paras. 36-44).

<p>Between 1 November 2013 and 27 October 2014, 207 Palestinians were recorded as injured 
</p>
<p>in settler-related incidents, including 88 by settlers themselves and 119 by Israeli security 
</p>
<p>forces. According to information received from OHCHR, five Palestinian fatalities were 
</p>
<p>recorded in settler-related incidents, including three killed by Israeli security forces and two 
</p>
<p>by Israeli settlers. During the same period, six Israelis were reportedly killed and 62 injured 
</p>
<p>by Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (see also paras. 52-53 below). 
</p>
<p>41. In this context, Israel has repeatedly failed to prevent or halt attacks on Palestinians 
</p>
<p>as it is obliged to do under international law.65 This failure is underpinned by a long-
</p>
<p>standing lack of accountability in cases involving settlers, whether in relation to physical 
</p>
<p>assaults or attacks on Palestinian property (see table below). As stated in previous reports, 
</p>
<p>Israel has an obligation to bring perpetrators to justice under international human rights law 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/38, para. 38 and A/68/513, paras. 42-52), as a key component of ensuring 
</p>
<p>protection, justice for victims and non-repetition of similar incidents. <b>

<p><b> B. Cases of settler violence 
</b></p>
<p>42. Incidents of settler violence against Palestinians and their property continued 
</p>
<p>throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The kidnapping and murder of three 
</p>
<p>Israeli teenagers, Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah, near Hebron in June 2014 
</p>
<p>sparked a wave of racist attacks by Israelis, including settlers, on Palestinians, particularly 
</p>
<p>in East and West Jerusalem but also across the West Bank. This culminated in the 
</p>
<p>abduction and murder by Israelis, including one settler, of Palestinian teenager Mohammad 
</p>
<p>Abu Khdeir from East Jerusalem, which in turn sparked violence by Palestinians against 
</p>
<p>Israelis (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>43. Such cases recorded in Jerusalem included physical attacks, &#8220;price tag&#8221; hits (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/38, para. 47)<b> </b>and damage to property. The attacks were perpetrated by both 
</p>
<p>settlers and other Israelis, but were all part of an increase in attacks in Jerusalem during the 
</p>
<p>period under review. In one case monitored by OHCHR, on 10 February 2014, several cars 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 65 Israel has a positive obligation to protect Palestinians from settler violence and, as the occupying 
</p>
<p>Power, also the obligation to maintain public order and safety in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including by providing Palestinians with all the guarantees accorded to protected persons under 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law. Fourth Geneva Convention, in particular, arts. 4 and 27; 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para.8, and Hague Regulations, art. 43. </p>


<p>were allegedly painted with &#8220;anti-Arab&#8221; graffiti and their tyres flattened in the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>44. In another case monitored by OHCHR, on 12 April 2014, at around midnight, three 
</p>
<p>Palestinians from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Beit Hanina went to withdraw 
</p>
<p>money from an automatic teller in the adjacent Pisgat Zeev settlement. As they were 
</p>
<p>leaving, they were blocked by some 25 settlers who reportedly declared that it was &#8220;a 
</p>
<p>Jewish neighbourhood&#8221; and that &#8220;Arabs are not allowed in&#8221;, and then severely beat them. 
</p>
<p>When the settlers left, the Palestinians informed an Israeli police patrol of the incident. The 
</p>
<p>police searched the area and arrested three suspects. On 13 April, the victims identified one 
</p>
<p>of the alleged perpetrators among those arrested. A few days later, however, the victims, 
</p>
<p>inquiring about the case, were informed that it was closed.  
</p>
<p>45. Incidents were also recorded in other areas of the West Bank. In a case monitored by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, on 23 May 2014, two Palestinians were allegedly attacked by a group of four 
</p>
<p>settlers on road #457 when they stopped their car near the Ma&#8217;ale Mikhmas settlement. One 
</p>
<p>was beaten with metal pipes for about 15 minutes. He suffered three fractures to his skull 
</p>
<p>and spent three days in intensive care. The other Palestinian, the driver, was stabbed in the 
</p>
<p>arm by one of the settlers, and wounded his hand when attempting to grab the knife. He 
</p>
<p>managed to drive off to look for help. When he returned to the site accompanied by three 
</p>
<p>Palestinian cars, the settlers fled the scene.  
</p>
<p>46. During the period under review, cases of Palestinians throwing stones &#8211; and in some 
</p>
<p>cases Molotov cocktails &#8211; at Israeli vehicles in the West Bank, resulting in material damage 
</p>
<p>and a number of injuries, were recorded. Assaults by Palestinians against Israelis, including 
</p>
<p>against settlers, were also reported (see section below). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Failure to protect 
</b></p>
<p>47. The failure of Israeli forces to protect and enforce the law against settlers has been 
</p>
<p>well documented (see A/HRC/25/38, paras. 42-47). While past initiatives have led to 
</p>
<p>increased protection for Palestinians and their property, for the most part the violence 
</p>
<p>continues unabated. Concerns persist in two primary respects: incidents in which the Israeli 
</p>
<p>security forces are present at the scene of an incident involving violence by a settler, but fail 
</p>
<p>to intervene to prevent or stop the attack, including by failing to make arrests; and a more 
</p>
<p>general failure to provide adequate protection at known trouble spots and during periods of 
</p>
<p>heightened risk. 
</p>
<p>48. Past reports included information on several cases in which Israeli soldiers appeared 
</p>
<p>to stand by while settlers committed offences (A/66/364, paras. 23-25; A/67/375, paras. 30-
</p>
<p>32; A/68/348, para. 40), despite having the authority and obligation to respond in cases 
</p>
<p>where the Israel Defense Forces are on the scene before the Israeli police.66 The State 
</p>
<p>Comptroller, responsible for, inter alia, auditing acts of Israeli institutions, in a report of 
</p>
<p>2013 raised similar concerns regarding the failure of the Israel Defense Forces to detain 
</p>
<p>suspects and to ensure the integrity of a potential crime scene.67 
</p>
<p>49. Recurrent incidents of settler violence in specific geographic areas have been 
</p>
<p>broadly documented.68 Accordingly, the authorities are aware of the locations and times of 
</p>
<p>year when greater protection is necessary. In 2012, the Office for the Coordination of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 66 See Yesh Din, Shadow report to the fourth periodic report of Israel, Human Rights Committee, 8 
</p>
<p>September 2014 (available from www.yesh-din.org/infoitem.asp?infocatid=628), pp. 19-20. 
</p>
<p> 67 Ibid., p. 20.  
</p>
<p> 68 See Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, map of Palestinian communities at risk of 
</p>
<p>Israeli settler violence, September 2012. See also A/69/348, paras. 38-44 and A/68/513, paras. 46-47. </p>


<p>Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 315,000 people in 110 communities were at high or 
</p>
<p>moderate risk of settler violence.69 They included Palestinian villages close to Yitzhar and 
</p>
<p>Bracha settlements in the Nablus area where, for example, 1,974 olive trees were reportedly 
</p>
<p>damaged between January 2013 and the end of September 2014.70 
</p>
<p><b> D. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>50. Where there is a willingness on the part of the Israeli authorities to enforce the law, 
</p>
<p>they are able to do so effectively. For example, as previously reported, following an attack 
</p>
<p>by Israeli settlers on an Israel Defense Forces post on 8 April 2014 sparked by the 
</p>
<p>demolition of some structures in Yitzhar settlement, the Government of Israel adopted a 
</p>
<p>position of &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; and five arrests were reportedly made (A/69/348, para. 41). 
</p>
<p>The stationing of a border police company in Yitzhar appears to have led to a decrease in 
</p>
<p>settler violence incidents in the surrounding Palestinian villages since May 2014.71 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there have been some cases of arrest of Israelis for committing &#8220;price tag&#8221; 
</p>
<p>attacks,72 an anti-nationalistic crimes unit has been created within the &#8220;Judea and Samaria&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(West Bank) police, and perpetrators are now reportedly classified as belonging to &#8220;illegal 
</p>
<p>associations&#8221;.73 The number of cases that actually lead to any kind of accountability is, 
</p>
<p>however, negligible.74  
</p>
<p>51. Overall, settlers committing violent acts against Palestinians are rarely prosecuted, 
</p>
<p>providing little deterrence against similar attacks. An examination of complaints of settler 
</p>
<p>violence since 2005 has revealed a lack of accountability in the vast majority of cases. 
</p>
<p>Indictments were served in only 72 of the 970 processed cases monitored between 2005 and 
</p>
<p>2014. A total of 887 files (or 91.4 per cent) of complaints were closed without an 
</p>
<p>indictment being served, of which 593 because the &#8220;offender was unknown&#8221;, 195 because 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;insufficient evidence&#8221; and 76 due to the &#8220;absence of criminal culpability&#8221;.75 This 
</p>
<p>reinforces a sense and culture of impunity for perpetrators, and exacerbates Palestinians&#8217; 
</p>
<p>sense of insecurity and lack of confidence in the Israeli judicial system.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Attacks on Israelis, and differentiated standards of due process  
</b></p>
<p>52. According to information provided by OHCHR, between 1 November 2013 and 27 
</p>
<p>October 2014, six Israelis (including two children) were killed, and 62 were wounded in 
</p>
<p>attacks committed by Palestinians - a worrying increase when compared with previous 
</p>
<p>years (see A/HRC/25/38, para. 39). The means deployed to investigate such incidents 
</p>
<p>appear to be greater than those for attacks against Palestinians. When the victims are Israeli, 
</p>
<p>large-scale arrest and detention campaigns are typically carried out by the Israel Defense 
</p>
<p>Forces throughout the West Bank, and by the Israeli police and border police in East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, in order to apprehend the suspects (A/66/364, para. 31). By contrast, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 69 31 per cent in the North, 34 per cent in the Centre and 35 per cent in the South of the West Bank; see

<p>investigations of attacks against Palestinians tend to raise serious questions about their 
</p>
<p>effectiveness in bringing perpetrators to account.  
</p>
<p>53. The difference witnessed in the justice systems applied is also matter of concern. 
</p>
<p>Most Palestinians accused of attacks against Israelis are tried by the Israeli military justice 
</p>
<p>system, while Israeli civilians, including settlers, accused of crimes are tried by civilian 
</p>
<p>courts.76 The Israeli military court system imposed on Palestinians in the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, does not afford suspects some of the fundamental guarantees of 
</p>
<p>the right to a fair trial, in particular the independence and impartiality of the tribunal 
</p>
<p>(A/67/372, para. 27).  
</p>
<p><b>VI. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p>54. An estimated 21,000 Israeli settlers currently live in the occupied Syrian Golan in 33 
</p>
<p>settlements heavily subsidised by Israel. These settlements enjoy a number of financial 
</p>
<p>incentives as well as a disproportionate allocation of water resources, which contributes to a 
</p>
<p>higher agricultural yield for settlers. By contrast, approximately 20,000 Syrians, the 
</p>
<p>majority from the Druze community, live in six villages dependent primarily on agricultural 
</p>
<p>income, but disadvantaged by restricted water supplies at higher prices and fewer economic 
</p>
<p>opportunities.
77
</p>
<p> The exploitation of natural resources in the occupied Syrian Golan, in 
</p>
<p>violation of international law, has continually been supported by the Government of Israel, 
</p>
<p>and includes permits and licences granted to extractive multinational corporations involved 
</p>
<p>in oil and gas mining (A/HRC/25/38, para. 48, and A/68/513, paras. 53-54). The 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s latest five-year development plan, announced in January 2014, aims to 
</p>
<p>provide better water infrastructure systems and accelerate de-mining efforts to support 
</p>
<p>settler farming communities in the occupied Syrian Golan (A/69/348).
 
 
</p>
<p>55. The beneficiaries of such developments may include the Israeli wine industry. A 
</p>
<p>total of 14 Israeli wineries, mostly founded in the late 1990s or early 2000s, are based in 
</p>
<p>Israeli settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan, and produce their wine from grapes grown 
</p>
<p>in the occupied territory. The oldest of the wineries based in several settlements in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Golan, Golan Heights Wineries, founded in 1983, produces an estimated 5.4 
</p>
<p>million bottles of wine annually. Many of the wineries, which market their produce 
</p>
<p>globally, reportedly do not label the origin of the grapes accurately on their bottles.
78 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. The Government is also reportedly focusing on investing in education for the benefit 
</p>
<p>of settlers in the occupied Syrian Golan. In August 2014, it was reported that an Israeli 
</p>
<p>academic institution, Ohalo College, based in Katzrin settlement in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan, was offering a wide range of financial incentives to prospective students in order to 
</p>
<p>increase enrolments.
79 
</p>
<p>The Secretary-General reiterates that the Security Council, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 497 (1981), reaffirmed that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of international law, 
</p>
<p>and relevant Security Council resolutions, and decided that the decision of Israel to impose

<p> 76 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that Israel ensure equal 
</p>
<p>access to justice for Palestinians and Israelis, including settlers; see CERD/C/ISR/CO/14, para. 27.

</p>
<p><b>VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>During the period under review, Israel continued to play a leading role in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Territory, in violation of international law, in particular article 49 of the Fourth 
</b></p>
<p><b>Geneva Convention. The settlements continue to be a central source of multiple 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations of Palestinians. In this context, Israel still largely fails to 
</b></p>
<p><b>comply with its international obligation to protect the Palestinian population from 
</b></p>
<p><b>violent acts committed by Israeli settlers, and to effectively prevent, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for, settler violence. Israeli policies and practices regarding access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian land have a negative impact on the rights of Palestinians, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>their rights to an adequate standard of living and to work.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Israel must stop obstructing and restricting the access of Palestinians to 
</b></p>
<p><b>agricultural land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Disproportionate 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictions, mostly related to settlements, are putting Palestinian livelihoods at a great 
</b></p>
<p><b>risk. Effective measures should be taken to ensure that Palestinians are able to have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to and cultivate their land on a continuous basis, beyond ad hoc mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as </b>&#8220;prior coordination&#8221;.<b> In addition, security of land tenure must be ensured, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by means of measures allowing Palestinians to register without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination the land they have been using for long periods of time.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Israel, as the occupying Power, is obliged to take all reasonable measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent violent attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians. Israel must ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>all acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>property are investigated independently, impartially, thoroughly, promptly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively and in a non-discriminatory manner. Investigations should be open to 
</b></p>
<p><b>public scrutiny and allow for the participation of victims. Alleged perpetrators should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be prosecuted and victims should be granted an effective remedy.</b> 
</p>
<p>60. <b>Israel must cease all settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as in the occupied Syrian Golan, and implement relevant United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolutions, including Security Council resolution 497 (1981), and withdraw from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>territories occupied in 1967. Israel must also immediately cease the exploitation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>natural resources from these territories.
