and Related Intolerance, it decided to establish the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights 
Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, with a mandate to elaborate, as a 
matter of priority and necessity, complementary standards in the form of either a convention or 
additional protocol(s) to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, filling the existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative 
standards aimed at combating all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial 
and religious hatred,

would be no renegotiation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,

second parts of the first session of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the 
Elaboration of Complementary Standards, and expressing the common desire of the international 
human rights system and the need to enhance the momentum of this process with a view to 
ensuring the timely fulfilment of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, 
</p>

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as well as appropriate remedies while 
combating all forms of impunity in this regard, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Endorses</i> the road map adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights 
Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards during the second part of its 
first session as a guiding framework document for all future work in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Chairperson-Rapporteur to ensure that the outcome referred to in the 
road map is circulated in a timely manner to all stakeholders, in order that complementary 
standards to strengthen and update international instruments against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all their aspects may be elaborated from 
the second session onwards; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> that all future sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee shall be convened in a 
consolidated period of 10 consecutive working days; </p>
