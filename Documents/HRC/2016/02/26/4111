<body><p>GE.<footnote name="11">A/HRC/13/39/Add.<footnote name="5">0. The Special Rapporteur observes that acts of torture and ill-treatment remain a 
widespread phenomenon in today&#8217;s world. In the last decade, State practices and 
approaches to torture, particularly in view of the ongoing security threats associated with 
the war on terror, responses to immigration concerns, citizen security and organized crime 
have tended to weaken or reinterpret the absolute prohibition on torture.  While civil society 
organizations and members of the judiciaries of those countries where such practices have 
taken place have condemned them, a net effect in some sectors of public opinion has been a 
tendency to countenance torture as a &#8220;necessary evil.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur believes it is 
his duty to confront this debate in all its legal, political, ethical and practical dimensions, 
and demonstrate that embarking on a path that permits torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment is not only immoral and illegal, but also counter-</footnote> </footnote>-10587

<p><b>  Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on torture and

Juan E. M&#233;ndez</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>This is the first report submitted by the incumbent Special Rapporteur to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur took up his appointment on 1 November 2010, 
replacing Manfred Nowak who had served two terms as Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>The report gives an overview of the activities of the mandate over the reporting 
cycle, including the activities carried out by the former Special Rapporteur up to the end of 
his mandate on 31 October 2010. The Special Rapporteur outlines his working methods and 
vision, and notes, in relation to follow-up country visits, that invitations from States to 
conduct follow-up visits constitute a good practice that should be disseminated. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur advocates a victim-centred approach to the work of his 
mandate. He believes that all human rights standards are subject to the norm of 
&#8220;progressive development,&#8221; in that they evolve in accordance with new repressive actions 
and features. In this regard, it is important to consolidate current interpretations of what 
constitutes torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, and to insist 
on effective implementation of States&#8217; obligations to prevent and to punish violations. In 
keeping with the progressive development of international jurisprudence, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that expansive interpretations of norms are possible as long as they 
better protect individuals from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. At the same time, such expansive interpretations should evolve from 
agreements among all stakeholders reached after frank and open debate.  It is the role of the 
Special Rapporteur to generate such discussion as appropriate.   
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>The Special Rapporteur intends to engage constructively with States with a view to 
ensuring enhanced respect for, and adherence to, the Convention, in particular, the 
exclusionary rule enshrined in article 15, and the necessity for States to ensure that torture 
is a criminal offence in domestic legislation, punishable by appropriate penalties and 
thereby necessitating effective investigation and prosecution of each instance of torture, as 
provided for in article 4 of the Convention. Noting with deep regret the long-term physical 
and psychological trauma that victims of torture experience, he intends to promote actions 
leading to the rehabilitation and other forms of reparation for victims of torture. He believes 
that, without undermining the rights of defendants to all guarantees of fair trial, victims 
should be allowed to participate actively in attempts to hold torturers accountable. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that there are credible and human rights- 
friendly forensic and other scientific alternatives which have been proven to achieve the 
desired results in law enforcement and crime prevention than torture and cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment. Scientific advances have made possible the provision of evidence 
to corroborate evidence that torture has been administered; hence these new techniques are 
important tools for achieving accountability. The Special Rapporteur wishes to further 
develop linkages between science and forensics as an effective alternative to be employed 
in law enforcement, countering terrorism and effective criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p>Lastly, the report re-emphasizes the mandate&#8217;s position on pretrial detention, non-
refoulement and diplomatic assurances, conditions in detention and torture in secret 
detention. It also highlights important issues requiring longer term consideration and 
engagement with States. </p>

interrogators or investigators for more than the time required by law to obtain a judicial 
warrant of pretrial detention which, in any case, should not exceed 48 hours. He further

<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Council to the interim report 
submitted to the General Assembly1 in accordance with resolution 64/153, and covering the 
mandate&#8217;s activities for the period January to July 2010. The present report covers the key 
activities undertaken by the mandate holders since the submission of the interim report to 
the General Assembly on 10 August 2010.    
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications concerning human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the period from 19 December 2009 to 30 November 2010, the Special 
Rapporteur sent 64 letters of allegations of torture to 35 Governments, and 137 urgent 
appeals on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to 53 Governments.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 2010, the Special Rapporteur undertook visits to Jamaica, Papua New Guinea and 
Greece (see A/HRC/16/52/Add.<footnote name="3">8. The Special Rapporteur places great importance on coordination with other 
mechanisms. He intends to work closely with other mandate holders, in particular those 
addressing extra-judicial executions, disappearances, arbitrary detention, counter-terrorism, 
health, migrants and violence against women, to ensure that cross-cutting issues are 
approached in a holistic manner.    
</footnote>, 4 and 5 respectively), as well as a follow-up mission to

</p>
<p>27. On 4 November, it was announced that Juan E. M&#233;ndez had taken up his duties as 
Special Rapporteur as of 1 November 2010, replacing Manfred Nowak who had served as

</p>
<p>28. On 11 November, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint press release with five other 
experts concerning the brutal human rights violations in Somalia, where civilians are the 
victims of executions, torture, stoning, decapitation, amputation and floggings carried out 
by insurgents. 
</p>
<p>29. On 9 December, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint statement on International 
Human Rights Day through the International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Follow-up mission to the Republic of Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur conducted a fact-finding mission to Kazakhstan2 from 5 to 
13 May 2009 and formulated a number of recommendations to improve the situation of 
torture and ill-treatment in that country. In April 2010, the Government of Kazakhstan 
officially invited the Special Rapporteur for a follow-up visit to the country to discuss the 
implementation of his recommendations with the Government, civil society organizations 
and the Central Asia Regional Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR).  
</p>
<p>31. Over the past six years, the Special Rapporteur has only been able to carry out 
limited follow-up of his missions. The official practice is to send questionnaires to 
Governments and civil society organizations in the respective States requesting information 
on the measures taken since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last visit. The information is then 
incorporated into a follow-up report that is published annually. However, with the 
exception of a follow-up visit to Moldova in September 2009, which focused specifically 
on the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), the Special Rapporteur is rarely officially 
invited by Governments to revisit their country to discuss the implementation of his 
recommendations. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur commends the Government of 
Kazakhstan for its official invitation to pay a follow-up visit, which indicates a serious 
commitment to combating torture and improving the conditions of detention, and 
constitutes a best practice example. The  Special Rapporteur carried out the follow-up 
mission3 to Kazakhstan from 29 September to 1 October 2010. 
</p>

<p>Torture in November 2008. Among other measures, President Nazarbayev&#8217;s Decree of 
August 2010, &quot;Measures to improve law enforcement and the judicial system in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;, endorsing several systemic reforms intended to humanize the 
prison system and reduce overcrowding in all places of detention, was presented by the 
authorities as a major breakthrough that would transform Kazakhstan&#8217;s criminal justice 
system. The current criminal justice system is still punitive, however, the Government 
expects that the planned reforms will produce a shift towards a more restorative justice 
system. In an effort to reduce the prison population, the decree includes a bill 
decriminalizing 19 offences which do not present a danger to society and converting them 
into administrative offences. However, while such decriminalization is aimed at 
humanization, it should be implemented with care since existing procedures under the Code 
on Administrative Offences offer fewer safeguards compared to the Criminal Procedure 
Code. As such, shifting 19 offences out of the Criminal Code means that future offenders 
will be deprived of basic human rights guarantees normally available under the Criminal 
Procedure Code. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that alternative 
measures of punishment and prevention will also be developed to reduce overcrowding, 
together with a reduced sentence term for eleven crimes.  
</p>
<p>33. While welcoming the measures taken since his initial visit, the Special Rapporteur 
emphasized that there is still an acute need for ongoing reform of the criminal justice 
system. Furthermore, he pointed out that many legislative measures still needed to be taken 
to combat torture. Safeguards against torture, such as immediate registration upon arrest or 
apprehension, information about the detainee&#8217;s rights, prompt access to legal counsel, or the 
right to inform relatives, need to be developed or reinforced. Moreover, the Special 
Rapporteur and the participants in the consultations urged that all victims of torture be 
provided with effective remedies, adequate reparation and access to professional 
rehabilitation. Finally, the Special Rapporteur observed that there was need for 
improvement in the treatment of prisoners, especially with regard to medical treatment, 
education of penitentiary staff, and rehabilitation into society of former detainees. Ensuring 
the effectiveness of complaint mechanisms in closed institutions was considered a critical 
area requiring further improvement.  
</p>
<p>34. The incumbent Special Rapporteur, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, emphasizes the importance of 
follow-up country visits as an important way to continue the process of reform and other 
measures aimed at eradicating torture and ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
States that had been visited by previous mandate holders to conduct follow-up activities. To 
this end, he welcomes the opportunity to engage with States on following up conclusions 
and recommendations formulated by the Special Rapporteur based on country visits, as well 
as by the Universal Periodic Review and Treaty Body States reviews. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Methodology of the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture  
</b></p>

<p>37. The Special Rapporteur proposes a victim-centred approach to his mandate, while at 
the same time seeking to strengthen existing international standards and norms. Cognisant 
of the frequently changing and evolving nature of torture, he intends to work towards 
ensuring the extension of those standards and norms to cover new areas of concern. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that all human rights standards are subject to the norm of 
&#8220;progressive development,&#8221; in that they evolve in accordance with emerging new features 
of repression. In that sense, it is important to consolidate current interpretations of what 
constitutes torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, as well as 
insist that States effectively implement their obligations to prevent and punish violations. 
He considers that his mission includes formulating proposals to expand protection to 
situations that have not been previously envisioned. This should be guided by experience 
and thoughtful consideration of the values involved and the adoption of &#8220;best practices&#8221; by 
all States. In this connection, he considers it his duty to promote open and frank discussion 
with States and other stakeholders on areas where reality demands a progressive 
interpretation of existing norms and their expansion to situations not previously 
contemplated. Such development should proceed through a broad consensus that emerges  
after careful consideration and open discussion. The Special Rapporteur intends to place 
special emphasis on strengthening the application and implementation of existing standards. 
He advocates a straight-forward and effective approach to allegations of torture or ill-
treatment. In his view, the State has a responsibility to investigate every allegation of 
torture, and to prosecute and punish perpetrators if the allegations are proven. This feature, 
which is unique to the prohibition of torture as a human rights standard, requires States to 
apply due diligence to every allegation of ill-treatment in order to determine whether the act 
indeed contravenes the law and, if so, to mobilize its institutions to prosecute and punish 
the perpetrators, and offer reparation to the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation and coordination with other mechanisms 
</b></p>

<p>41. The Special Rapporteur will also engage with the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime and the World Health Organization to help facilitate the integration of a human-
rights approach into drug-use prevention, treatment and managed care, not only in detention 
centres, but also with regard to vulnerable groups in which persons may be deprived of 
their liberty, including in relation to the physically challenged, persons with intellectual 
disability and the terminally ill. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to working with regional bodies, such as the 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CPT); the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa; the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights (IACHR) and other relevant bodies, to further strengthen international and regional 
standards on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>43. The methods of work4 of the Special Rapporteur on Torture require that the Special 
Rapporteur maintain contact and, where appropriate, engage in consultation with related 
bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations human rights machinery, including the Board 
of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and the 
Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (E/CN.4/1997/7, Annex, paragraph 
10). The Special Rapporteur considers the Fund of great importance to the work of non-
governmental organizations that provide humanitarian assistance to victims of torture and 
members of their family. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur will continue to work 
closely with the Fund with a view to complementing his victim-centred approach and 
ensuring victims are included in judicial processes and have access to appropriate remedies 
and reparation. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur, as did his predecessors, urges Governments and other donor 
organisations to support the work of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of 
Torture through financial and other means so as to enable it to continue providing 
appropriate assistance to organizations working to meet the psychological, medical, social, 
legal and economic needs of victims and survivors of torture. 
</p>
<p>45. Given the special emphasis that international law places on prosecuting crimes of 
torture, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to working closely with the International 
Criminal Court and other international tribunals of criminal justice, while respecting the 
respective spheres of those bodies. He also hopes to encourage States to ensure that torture 
is enshrined as a criminal offence in domestic legislation and hence subject to prosecution, 
as provided for under article 4 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter &#8220;the Convention&#8221;), and to 
disseminate such actions as &#8220;best practices&#8221; where they are effective and respect fair trial 
guarantees. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that, in this context, the threat of 
prosecution and punishment can serve a very effective preventive purpose. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visit methodology 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur wholly embraces, and reiterates the importance of, strict 
adherence to the methods of work established and refined under previous mandate holders5. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See E/CN.4/1997/7, Annex, approved by the Commission in resolution 2001/62 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/RES/2001/62), paragraph 30. 
 5 See E/CN.4/2006/6, paragraphs 20-27.  </p>


<p>He considers it an essential prerequisite for him to effectively carry out his mandate of 
assessing the situation of torture worldwide, through country visits, and formulating 
relevant recommendations to eradicate torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Thematic issues  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Victim-centred approach to torture 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur notes, with deep regret, the long-term physical and 
psychological damage that torture inflicts on its victims. Such long-term physical and 
psychological trauma requires concerted efforts by States, civil society and other actors to 
address the need for justice and rehabilitation of victims of torture.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the efforts of various organizations to 
ensure appropriate remedies and reparation for victims. He commends the adoption of the 
&#8220;Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law&#8221; by  the General Assembly as an important step towards 
fulfilling minimum standards for victims. However, he remains dissatisfied by the lack of 
progress in institutionalizing these basic principles and guidelines in most States. He notes 
that victims have only been awarded formal rights, including at the national level, but that 
these rights are often modest and peripheral to the justice systems.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that efforts to combat torture require a more 
victim-centred perspective that seeks an integrated long-term approach to adequate redress 
and reparation, including compensation and rehabilitation for victims of torture and their 
families. He recommends that the perspectives of victims of torture be included in the 
development of programmes and policies aimed at addressing torture. In that respect, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of a victim-centred approach to dealing with 
victims and survivors of torture. Similarly, he believes that victims have an important role 
to play as interested parties in holding torturers accountable for their actions. Indeed, the 
criminal procedures of some States are more hospitable than others to this engagement by 
victims; nevertheless, without undermining defendants&#8217; rights to all guarantees of a fair 
trial, victims should be allowed to participate actively in attempts to hold torturers 
accountable. Efforts to provide assistance to victims must seek to recognize and validate the 
traumatising experience of torture they have suffered, prevent further isolation by 
reintegrating them into society, and address the fundamental aim of torture which is, often, 
to isolate and engender fear in victims in order to break their will. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Expanding the exclusionary rule  
</b></p>

<p>productive to law-enforcement efforts.  He hopes, in this context, to join many others who 
wish to counter this worrying trend towards a severe erosion of some of the gains of the last 
four decades.   
</p>
<p>51. Under the rubric of fighting the war on terror, confronting organized crime and 
insecurity in the streets or maintaining an effective immigration policy, States have, 
regrettably, attempted to dilute cardinal principles necessary to preventing and suppressing 
torture and ill-treatment. Of particular concern are attempts to justify restrictions or 
limitations to the applicability of article 15 of the Convention, citing, as primary arguments, 
a supposed &#8220;necessity to avert serious imminent harm&#8221; or the &#8220;ticking bomb scenario&#8221; or, 
where the State is not complicit in the torture, that information provided by third parties, 
even if obtained under torture, is admissible.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur recalls that international customary law and treaty law 
require States to &#8220;ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a 
result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221;6 This exclusionary rule 
is fundamental for upholding the absolute and non-derogable nature of the prohibition of 
torture by providing a disincentive to use torture. Its essential preventive function is also 
crucial to fair trial guarantees. The Special Rapporteur calls for strict adherence to the 
international prohibitions established under international treaties and developed through the 
Convention, as well as regional and national judicial processes. 
</p>
<p>53. Attempts to restrict the applicability of the exclusionary rule represent a serious 
threat to international efforts to eradicate torture. It is of deep concern that States regularly 
receive and rely on information &#8211; either as intelligence or evidence for proceedings &#8211; whose 
sources present a real risk of having been acquired as a result of torture and ill-treatment 
from third party States. Receiving or relying on information from third parties which may 
be compromised by the use of torture does not only implicitly validate the use of torture 
and ill-treatment as an acceptable tool to gain information, but creates a market for 
information acquired through torture, which in the long term undermines the goal of 
preventing and eradicating torture.  
</p>
<p>54. While article 15 of the Convention covers judicial and administrative proceedings, it 
is silent on the question of the applicability of its provisions to intelligence or other 
executive decisions not directly arising from judicial or administrative proceedings. This is 
rendered more troublesome by difficulties in delineating purely &#8220;non-formal preventative&#8221; 
action by executive decisions arising from formal administrative proceedings. For instance, 
a State may rely on information provided by a third party, and which may have been 
obtained through torture, to arrest and detain an individual for the purpose of investigating 
his alleged suspicious activities. In such a case, aspects of administrative proceedings such 
as a deportation order may be used in the process of arresting the suspect. Thus, by virtue of 
article 15, it is argued that State institutions must take appropriate measures to ascertain 
whether or not the information on which a decision is based has been obtained as a result of 
torture. However, does the fact that the information was obtained through torture prevent 
the State from arresting the individual in the first place? Can it be used as intelligence or as 
the subject of an executive decision? Are diplomatic assurances relating to the origins of 
the information provided by third parties sufficient? We should be mindful of the real 
possibility that a policy of using such information for purposes other than trials, could 
provide an incentive to State agents to forego prosecutions altogether, and instead engage in 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
</p>
<p>article 15. </p>


<p>disappearances, extra-judicial executions, and other illegal repressive measures that could 
lead to a total breakdown in the rule of law. These and other equally important questions 
relating to the applicability of the exclusionary rule to executive decisions and intelligence 
gathering merit further consideration in future reports of this mandate. 
</p>
<p>55. In his report7 to the 13th session of the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism 
takes the view that &#8220;reliance on information from torture in another country, even if the 
information is obtained only for operational purposes, inevitably implies the &#8220;recognition of 
lawfulness&#8221; of such practices and therefore triggers the application of principles of State 
responsibility. Hence, States that receive information obtained through torture or inhuman 
and degrading treatment are complicit in the commission of internationally wrongful acts. 
Such involvement is also irreconcilable with the obligation erga omnes of States to 
cooperate in the eradication of torture.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur shares this view and 
believes that this is a good starting point for future deliberation on the subject.   
</p>
<p>56. In the considered opinion of the Special Rapporteur, in order for the &#8220;exclusionary 
rule&#8221; to work as a preventative measure and create a disincentive for would-be abusers to 
deploy ill-treatment as a tool for extracting confessions or corroborating information, its 
applicability must be extended to cover intelligence and executive decisions. In other 
words, it can only remain effective if it is applicable to all and any information which may 
form the basis of a judicial or administrative process or decisions by the executive and its 
agencies. The Special Rapporteur intends to ensure enhanced respect for, and adherence to, 
the principle set out in article 15 of the Convention one of the central themes for his 
engagement with States and other actors during his tenure. Questions relating to the 
applicability of the exclusionary rule to executive decisions and intelligence gathering will 
be the subject of further consideration in future reports of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur also intends to explore the possibility of a teleological 
interpretation of the exclusionary rule contained in article 15 of the Convention, as he 
believes that this norm is both a fundamental due process standard as well as a tool to 
discourage investigators and security agents from practicing torture and ill-treatment. In 
this regard, it would be important to consider whether the exclusion of evidence should be 
extended not only to confessions and statements obtained under torture, but also to all other 
pieces of evidence obtained through legal means but whose leads originate in an act of 
torture. In some jurisdictions, this approach has been called the &#8220;fruit of the poisonous tree&#8221; 
doctrine. While acknowledging that the international standard does not go so far, the 
Special Rapporteur would certainly recommend that States, as a matter of their own internal 
practices, voluntarily adopt a similar rule in their domestic criminal procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Forensic science and torture 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his conviction that torture and ill-treatment are and 
always will be ineffective means or tools for intelligence or information gathering and law 
enforcement. Confessions and statements obtained under torture are inherently unreliable, 
and often disorient and disperse the efforts of law enforcement and investigations 
personnel.  It is therefore crucial to recognize that alternatives to brutality are available and, 
indeed, effective in addressing the needs of States in fighting crime in all its forms. The 
Special Rapporteur feels that it is important to counter the attitude that is prevalent in many 
</p>
<p>  
 7 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms while countering terrorism (A/HRC/10/3), February 4, 2009, paragraph 55.  </p>


<p>States and societies that the use of torture and ill-treatment is practically inevitable.  In this 
connection, advances in forensic and other sciences present a more promising answer to 
these questions than so called &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; or torture and cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>59. The mandate holder believes that his role as Special Rapporteur does not only give 
him an opportunity to assess the situation with regard to torture, but also to provide credible 
and human rights-friendly forensic and other scientific alternatives which have been proven 
to achieve better results than the use of torture. During his tenure, the Special Rapporteur 
intends to identify and further develop the linkages between forensic and other sciences, not 
only with a view to eradicating torture and providing corroborating evidence of torture, but 
also to offer States credible forensic and other scientific alternatives to employ in law 
enforcement, counter-terrorism and effective criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Non-refoulement and diplomatic assurances 
</b></p>
<p>60. Council resolution 13/19 urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (<i>refouler</i>), extradite or in 
any other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, and stresses the 
importance of effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard&#8221;.<footnote name="8">A/HRC/RES/13/19, paragraph 8. 
 9   See CAT, article 3; Refugee Convention, article 33; ICCPR, article 7; ECHR, article 3. 
 10 See E/CN.4/2006/6, paragraph 32; A/HRC/10/44/Add.2, paragraph 68. </footnote>   
</p>
<p>61. Non-refoulement, as an important principle of international treaty law and 
international customary law, is provided for in international and regional human rights 
mechanisms,9 and the jurisprudence of international and regional human rights bodies, such 
as the Human Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur observes that the principle of non-refoulement has been at 
the core of discussions both in light of immigration laws, and in the context of countering 
terrorism. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that diplomatic assurances do not release 
States from their non-refoulement obligations nor are they necessarily the best way to 
prevent torture and refoulement. Indeed, diplomatic assurance has been proven to be 
unreliable, and cannot be considered an effective safeguard against torture and ill-treatment, 
particularly in States where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person would 
face the danger of being subjected to torture or ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>63. Like his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur regards the practice of diplomatic 
assurances &#8220;as an attempt to circumvent the absolute prohibition of torture and non-
refoulement&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p><b> E. Pretrial detention 
</b></p>

<p>notes that pretrial detention is often carried out for the purpose of extracting a confession 
under torture. Experience shows that most acts of torture, and certainly the most cruel and 
egregious, happen in the first few hours or days after a person&#8217;s arrest, and while he/she is 
technically under preventive detention. In this respect, he recalls article 15 of the 
Convention, and like his predecessors, recommends that no statement of confession made 
by a person deprived of liberty, other than that made before a court, should be admissible or 
be afforded probative value in any judicial proceeding.  
</p>
<p>65. In order to identify structural methods of assisting States in developing, adopting 
and fulfilling the above-mentioned obligations, the Special Rapporteur will encourage 
Governments to reinforce their legislative norms through protocols, instruments and 
methodological guides targeted at ensuring effective guarantees for persons deprived of 
their liberty. These measures include effective realization of the right of detainees in 
custody to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before an independent court (e.g., the 
right to habeas corpus). Further, States should promote and apply non-custodial measures 
such as bail and probation, respect medical inspection upon admission and compulsory 
medical inspection during transfer, and introduce video and audio recordings of 
proceedings in interrogation rooms. There must be formal procedures by which a detainee 
is informed of his/her rights, including the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer, as 
well as effective sanctions for failure to respect these rights. The Special Rapporteur 
recognizes the importance of continuing dialogue with States with a view to strengthening 
legislative mechanisms aimed at preventing torture and ill-treatment in pretrial detention. 
He notes that various mandate holders have expressed concerns about pretrial detention, 
and undertakes to hold further discussions with them in order to identify and promote best 
practices on measures to prevent, punish and eradicate torture and other ill-treatment in 
pretrial detention. This will also be done by using fact-finding country visits and 
information provided by reliable sources to identify challenges and illustrate good 
practices. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conditions in detention  </b></p>
<p>66. In previous reports11, conditions of detention have been documented extensively 
based on information received from various sources, in particular, factual observations 
made as a result of fact-finding missions. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by 
the large number of places of detention that do not meet minimum international standards.  
He plans to engage with States that permit such conditions as well as with those that lack 
the ability or resources to institute minimum standards. He will seek to address the 
systematic deprivation of the most basic human rights standards relating to conditions of 
detention, including those related to food, water, clothing, health care and minimum space, 
as well as hygiene, privacy and security necessary for a humane and dignified existence, as 
conditions that in and of themselves can constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Torture in secret detention  
</b></p>

<p>68. The Special Rapporteur considers the issues of torture and ill-treatment of victims in 
secret detention as a key concern that falls squarely within his mandate. He intends to 
follow up on any new and credible allegations concerning the ongoing use of places of 
secret detention by States or their complicity regarding their existence. Eradicating such 
practices is central to the prevention of torture and the Special Rapporteur believes that 
engagement in this issue cannot be seen as an unwarranted expansion of the definition of 
torture set forth in article 1 of the Convention or of the treaty&#8217;s establishment of 
responsibility for its occurrence.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur believes that frequent and unannounced visits, including 
timely and unlimited internal monitoring by independent mechanisms in all places of 
deprivation of liberty, are crucial for the prevention of torture. The Special Rapporteur 
further recalls the recommendations made by the experts of the joint study on global 
practices in relation to secret detention in the context of countering terrorism to, inter alia, 
fully respecting safeguards for persons deprived of their liberty and providing victims with 
judicial remedies and adequate, effective and prompt reparation.   
</p>
<p><b> H. Issues for longer-term consideration  
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the question as to whether the death penalty, 
as well as some health and drug policies, prolonged solitary confinement, some treatments 
for mental disability, and domestic violence constitute <i>per se</i> cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment has given rise to much debate and discussion in the Human Rights 
Council. He recognizes the sensitive nature of these issues and believes that the 
international community as a whole would greatly benefit from a dispassionate and rational 
discussion of the issues. The Special Rapporteur will look more deeply into these issues and 
also suggests that they be the subject of further research by the Human Rights Council and 
its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Human Rights Council for the confidence 
bestowed upon him by appointing him Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He looks forward to constructive 
and open dialogue with the Council with the aim of furthering the universally shared 
interest in eradicating torture and ill-treatment worldwide. He calls for a redoubling 
of efforts by the mandate of Special Rapporteur, States, civil society and treaty bodies 
to achieve this goal. It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that it will also require, at 
times, some difficult and hard choices. Similarly, the implementation of his mandate 
will, inevitably, raise differences of opinion with regard to the substance, 
interpretation and approach, all of which may cause some discomfort for some States; 
however, the brutal nature of torture requires that all parties work quickly and 
constructively to address these mutual concerns. The Special Rapporteur intends to 
point out challenges fairly and objectively, and to acknowledge progress where it 
exists while working diligently with stakeholders to achieve a world without torture. 
He urges States to approach this difficult issue in a spirit of openness and good faith as 
he himself will do.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>In view of this, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the basic good faith 
measure that States can undertake to show their commitment to addressing torture 
remains the ratification, without reservation, of the United Nations Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and its Optional Protocol (the &#8220;Protocol&#8221;). The Convention and its Protocol are </b></p>


<p><b>important first steps towards eradicating this serious international crime. This 
notwithstanding, ratification is not a substitute for States to take effective measures as 
necessary to prevent and suppress torture and ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls conclusions and recommendations made by 
previous mandate holders in their reports12 to the Human Rights Council and to the 
General Assembly, in particular those related to preventing torture, combating 
impunity for torture, providing victims of torture with an effective remedy and 
adequate reparation, as well as conditions of detention. He believes that they are 
integral to the global efforts to prevent and suppress torture and ill-treatment.  
</b></p>
<p>74.  <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to ratify the Protocol and promptly 
designate or establish a truly independent and effective National Preventive 
Mechanism (NPM) in accordance with the Protocol. He also urges enhanced 
cooperation with relevant treaty body mechanisms, including the Committee against 
Torture, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and the Human Rights 
Committee. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the work of the United Nations Voluntary 
Fund for Victims of Torture and the various non-governmental organisations working 
for the rehabilitation of victims of torture. He recalls the obligation of States to ensure 
the right of torture victims to obtain reparation, including redress, fair and adequate 
compensation and the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.13 In this regard, he 
calls upon Governments to make voluntary contributions to the Voluntary Fund for 
Victims of Torture so as to enable it to continue providing organizations with funds 
for psychological, medical, social, legal and economic assistance. He also entreats 
States to support the work of the organizations through financial and other means, as 
well as create an enabling environment for the organisations to provide redress and 
rehabilitation for torture victims. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of the &#8220;exclusionary rule&#8221; in 
preventing and suppressing torture, and recalls the obligations of States to ensure that 
any statement established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be 
invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made. To this end, he recommends strict adherence to 
this most fundamental of rules. He stresses that the exclusionary rule should not only 
apply to judicial and administrative proceedings, but also interpreted to include 
intelligence and decisions by the executive and its agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the important role that forensic and other 
sciences play in eradicating the use of torture. To this effect, he calls for a concerted 
effort to further improve forensic and other scientific tools and mechanisms used in 
law enforcement, counter-terrorism and effective criminal prosecution in order to 
ensure that torture is not practiced. He acknowledges that there is need for further 
capacity building and technology transfer to those States that do not possess adequate 
capacities or technologies. He urges States to continue working with the relevant 
international organisations to ensure such capacity building and technology transfers.
