1.(cid:160) Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business
Buckingham Exploration Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 4, 2006. The Company is an Exploration Stage Company, as defined by Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 915, Development Stage Entities.(cid:160)
exploration of mineral properties. The Company does not presently have any mineral properties.
(cid:160)The Company ’s principal business is the acquisition and
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of 
business. The Company has never generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or 
foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain 
necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at November 30, 2009, the Company has a working capital deficit of $247,585 and an 
accumulated deficit of $6,765,536. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any 
adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going 
concern.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient funds to pay the expected operating expenses for the next twelve months.
The Company currently trades on the OTCBB under the symbol ‘BUKX.OB’.

a)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars.(cid:160)
August 27, 2009, the financial statements included the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hyde Park Uranium, Inc. and Alpha Beta Uranium, Inc. The Company 
entered into an agreement dated August 27, 2009 for the settlement of the outstanding convertible debenture described in Note 9. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed 
to transfer all of the issued and outstanding shares of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hyde Park Uranium, Inc and Alpha Beta Uranium, Inc., and all of the property and equipment and 
mineral properties of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries to Regal to settle the convertible debenture. The Company’s fiscal year-end is May 31.

(b)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Interim Financial Statements
The interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with 
the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles 
for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for 
the year ended May 31, 2009, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 15, 2009 with the SEC.
The financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present 
fairly the Company’s financial position at November 30, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the six months ended November 30, 2009 and 2008. The results 
of operations for the six months ended November 30, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year.

(cid:160) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(c)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to long lived assets, stock-based 
compensation expense, secured convertible debentures and deferred income tax asset allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical 
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of 
assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and 
adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
(d)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
(e)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Property and Equipment
Property and equipment comprised of office furniture and motor vehicles are recorded at cost and amortized using the declining balance method at 25% per annum.
(f)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Basic and Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on 
the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock 
method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares 
assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. A total of 5,030,000 (2008 
– 14,380,000) outstanding warrants and 3,025,000 (2008 – 3,025,000) options outstanding issuable have been excluded from the three and six months ended November 30, 2009 and 2008 
calculation as they would be anti-dilutive.
Components of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six month period ended November 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(g)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Comprehensive Loss
ASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at November 30, 2009 and 
2008, the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.
(h)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Mineral Property Costs
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on April 4, 2006 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the 
acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized. The Company 
assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment at each fiscal quarter end. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be 
economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the 
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.
(i)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability for closure and removal costs associated with the legal obligations upon retirement or removal of any 
tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of assets in accordance with ASC 440 Asset Retirement and

(cid:160) Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant 
adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; 
current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the 
asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair 
value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal 
in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.

(cid:160) Financial Instruments
ASC 825, Financial Instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes 
a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value 
hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which 
significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or 
liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, receivables, and accounts payable.
Pursuant to ASC 825, the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company 
believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
(l)(cid:160)
Income Taxes
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740, Income Taxes as of its inception. 
Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been 
recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.
(m)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Based Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods 
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity 
instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized 
based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. During the six month period ended November 30, 2009, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $nil (2008 - $91,484) 
as general and administrative expense.
(n)(cid:160)
(cid:160) Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated in accordance with ASC 740 
Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or 
balances are included in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The Company has not, to the date of these financials 
statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

(cid:160) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(cid:160)  
Forward Looking Statements 
(cid:160)  
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In 
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including "could", "may", "will", "should", "expect", "plan", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "predict", "potential" 
and the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. 
(cid:160)  
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, 
actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. 
(cid:160)  
Business Overview
(cid:160)  
Buckingham Exploration Inc. (“Buckingham”, “we” or “our”) was incorporated as a Nevada company on April 4, 2006. We have been engaged in the acquisition, exploration and 
development of mineral properties since our inception. We sold our two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hyde Park Uranium Inc. Alpha Beta Uranium Inc., Colorado corporations through which 
we acquired mineral claims in the state of Colorado. Currently we are looking for other mineral properties to acquire. Our common stock became eligible for trading on the OTC Bulletin 
Board on May 8, 2007 under the ticker symbol “BUKX.OB”. 
(cid:160)  
Uncertainties
(cid:160)  
We are currently reviewing numerous properties in a search for suitable acquisition targets to initiate an exploration program. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in 
locating prospective mining claim and that any of these claims contain a commercially viable ore body. We anticipate that we will require additional financing in order to pursue full 
exploration of these claims. We do not have sufficient financing to undertake acquisition and exploration of new mineral claims at present and there is no assurance that we will be able to 
obtain the necessary financing.
(cid:160)  
There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our future mineral properties. Further exploration beyond the scope of our planned exploration activities 
will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic feasibility of mining of any of our properties is determined. There is no assurance that further exploration will result in a final 
evaluation that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our mineral properties.

(cid:160)  
Since our inception on April 4, 2006 to November 30, 2009, we have not generated any revenue and we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $6,765,536. We may not generate 
significant revenues even if our exploration program indicates that mineral deposits may exist on our future mineral claims. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses over the next 
two years.

(cid:160)  
During the three months ended November 30, 2009, we incurred a net loss of $56,541 compared to our net loss of $192,502 for the three months ended November 30, 2008. We did not 
record any income (loss) per share for the three months ended November 30, 2009 nor for the three months ended November 30, 2008. We generated a net income of $296,714 or $0.01 
per share for the six month period ended November 30, 2009, as compared to a net loss of $431,834 or a net loss of $0.01 per share(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Our total expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2009 were $89,053 and consisted of $33,933 in general and administrative expenses, and $55,120 in professional fees.(cid:160)

For the six month period ended November 30, 3009, out total expenses came to $132,007 and consisted of $64,370 in general and administrative expenses and $67,637 in professional 
fees. Our total expenses for the six months ended November 30, 2008 were $296,432. They consisted of $243,855 in general and administrative expenses and $52,577 in professional 
fees.
(cid:160)  
The decrease in total expenses was mainly due to reduced overhead expenses as a result of curtailing our exploration activities in response to a lack of financial resources. 
(cid:160)  
Pursuant to the Execution and Settlement Agreement dated August 27, 2009 with Regal Uranium Inc., the Company settled its outstanding convertible debentures and accrued interest in 
consideration  for  all  of  its  interest  in  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  along  with  mineral  properties  and  equipment  held  by  the  subsidiaries.  As  a  result  of  the  transfer,  the 
Company recorded a gain of $32,970 on disposal of discontinued operations for the three month period ended November 30, 2009, and a gain of $449,667 for the six month period ended 
November 30, 2009. We also recorded a loss of $192,502 for the comparable three month period of 2008, and a loss of $431,834 for the six month period ended November 30 of 2008. . 
(cid:160)  
From April 4, 2006 (Date of Inception) to August 31, 2009 we accumulated total operating loss from discontinued operations of $4,576,502 including $22,525 in amortization cost, $67,479 
in  general  and  administrative  expenses,  $4,530,126  in  impairment  of  mineral  property  costs,  $10,382  in  professional  fees,  $385,920  in  mineral  property  costs,  and  $14,058  in  loss  on 
disposal of property and equipment. 
(cid:160)  
Our  professional  fees  consisted  primarily  of  legal,  accounting  and  auditing  fees.  Our  general  and  administrative  expenses  include  management  fees,  consulting  fees,  foreign  exchange 
loss, transfer agent and filing fees, office supplies, travel expenses, rent, communication expenses (cellular, internet, fax and telephone), bank changes, advertising and promotion costs, 
office maintenance, courier and postage costs and office equipment. 
(cid:160)  
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
(cid:160)  
As of November 30, 2009 we have a cash of $2,618, receivables of $4,090 and no prepaid expenses for total current assets of $6,708. Our working capital deficit is $247,585. Our deficit 
accumulated during the exploration stage was $6,765,536 and was funded through equity financing and shareholder loans. During the three months ended November 30, 2009, we received 
an advance of $6,900 from related parties. Since our inception on April 4, 2006 to August 31, 2009 we have raised net proceeds of $3,661,575 from the sale of our common stock. 
(cid:160)  
During the six months ended November 30, 2009, we used net cash of $7,554 in operating activities and received net cash of $6,900 from financing activities.(cid:160)
of net cash used in operating activities and $342,404 net cash received from financing activities for the same period in 2008. We did not use any cash in, or receive any cash from investing 
activities during the six month period ended November 30, 2009 as our financial resources were limited.
(cid:160)  
From April 4, 2006 (Date of Inception) to November 30, 2009 we used net cash of $1,714,390 in operating activities, $2,284,862 in investing activities, and received net cash of $4,001,870 
from financing activities.
(cid:160)

On September 24, 2008, we entered into convertible debenture purchase agreements and granted 5,000,000 warrants to purchase one share each of Buckingham’s common stock at an 
exercise price of $0.10 per share for a period of 2 years. The total amount invested in Buckingham was $500,000. The principal and accrued interest of the convertible debentures could be 
converted into common stock at the holder’s option at a price of $0.05 per share any time on or after October 25, 2008 until the full amount owed under each convertible debenture is 
repaid. Buckingham had reserved a minimum of 5,000,000 common shares pursuant to the holders’ options to have the convertible debentures repaid in shares. 
(cid:160)  
Buckingham had the option, for a period of one year after September 24, 2008, of repaying any amounts borrowed and re-borrowing any amounts repaid under the convertible debentures 
without penalty or premium. The outstanding principal of the convertible debentures and interest accrued thereon at a rate of 10% per annum is repayable in equal monthly installments 
over a 24 month period starting one year after September 24, 2008. The convertible debentures carried a security interest in all current and future assets of Buckingham and its 
subsidiaries.
(cid:160)  
The debenture was secured by a security interest in(cid:160)all our current and future assets and assets of our subsidiaries.  
(cid:160)  
On  June  5,  2009,  we  entered  into  agreements  with  debenture  holders  to  issue  33,820,000  restricted  common  shares  to  settle  interest  accrued  up  to  May  31,  2009  in  the  amount  of 
$33,820. We issued 1,0146,00 restricted common shares to one of the debenture holders. We further issued 2,367,400 restricted common shares to two debenture holders on September 
21, 2009. 
(cid:160)   
During the three months ended August 31, 2009, we defaulted on the convertible debentures and received a notice of default under the terms of the debenture with Regal Uranium Inc. We 
subsequently entered in an Execution and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) dated August 27, 2009 with Regal Uranium Inc. for the settlement of the outstanding 
convertible debenture in the amount of $150,000 plus accrued interest. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to transfer all of our issued and outstanding shares in our 
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hyde Park Uranium Inc. and Alpha Beta Uranium, Inc. and all of our property and equipment and our mineral properties to Regal Uranium Inc.

Future Financings
(cid:160)  
We  have  no  revenues,  have  achieved  losses  since  inception,  and  rely  upon  the  sale  of  our  securities  to  fund  operations.  We  will  not  generate  revenues  even  if  our  exploration  program 
indicates  that  a  mineral  deposit  may  exist  on  our  future  mineral  claims.  Accordingly,  we  will  be  dependent  on  future  additional  financing  in  order  to  acquire  new  prospective  claims, 
maintain our operations and continue our exploration activities. 
(cid:160)  
We will require additional financing in order to proceed with acquisition and the exploration of(cid:160)
order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. We currently do not have any 
arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings. 
(cid:160)  
If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our prospective acquisitions, exploration activities and administrative 
expenses in order to stay within the amount of capital resources that are available to us. Specifically, we anticipate that we would defer drilling programs and certain acquisitions pending 
our obtaining additional financing.

Acquisition of Plant and Equipment and Other Assets
(cid:160)  
We do not anticipate the sale or acquisition of plant or equipment during the next twelve months. We are currently actively reviewing potential mineral properties to acquire. Any 
acquisitions are subject to obtaining additional financing.
(cid:160)  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
(cid:160)  
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues 
or(cid:160)expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Inflation 
(cid:160)  
The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than 
reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.

Critical Accounting Policies
(cid:160)  
Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of the 
significant accounting policies is included in note(cid:160)2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2009 filed in an Annual Report on Form 10 -K. We have 
identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application 
of significant judgment by management.
(cid:160)  
Use of Estimates 
(cid:160)  
The  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.  The  Company  regularly  evaluates  estimates  and  assumptions  related  to  long  lived  assets,  stock-based 
compensation  expense,  secured  convertible  debentures  and  deferred  income  tax  asset  allowances.  The  Company  bases  its  estimates  and  assumptions  on  current  facts,  historical 
experience  and  various  other  factors  that  it  believes  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying  values  of 
assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and 
adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
(cid:160)  
Mineral Property Costs 
(cid:160)  
The  Company  has  been  in  the  exploration  stage  since  its  inception  on  April  4,  2006  and  has  not  yet  realized  any  revenues  from  its  planned  operations.  It  is  primarily  engaged  in  the 
acquisition  and  exploration  of  mining  properties.  Mineral  property  exploration  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  initially  capitalized.  The  Company 
assesses  the  carrying  costs  for  impairment  under  ASC  360, Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment  at  each  fiscal  quarter  end.  When  it  has  been  determined  that  a  mineral  property  can  be 
economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the 
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations. 
(cid:160)  
Stock-Based Compensation 
(cid:160)  
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Based Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods 
or  services  are  the  consideration  received  for  the  issuance  of  equity  instruments  are  accounted  for  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  the  fair  value  of  the  equity 
instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized 
based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. During the six month period ended November 30, 2009, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $nil (2008 - $91,484) 
as general and administrative expense.

On September 25, 2009, we implemented an audit committee comprised of our sole director, C. Robin Relph, in accordance with the requirements of the British Columbia Instrument 51-

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 
(cid:160)  
On September 21, 2009, we issued 1,352,800 restricted common shares at $0.01 per share to a debenture holder in consideration of interest payable to the debenture holder totaling

(cid:160)  
On  September  21,  2009,  we  issued  1,014,600  restricted  common  shares  at  $0.01  per  share  to  a  debenture  holder  in  consideration  of  interest  payable  to  the  debenture  holder  totaling
