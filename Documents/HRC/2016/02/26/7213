<p> <i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 in which the Assembly 
decided that the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Should address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and 
systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon; and 
</p>
<p> (b) Shall respond promptly to human rights emergencies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, relevant human rights instruments and 
international humanitarian law, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 on the 
Laws and Customs of War on Land which prohibit attacks and bombardment of civilian 
populations and objects and lay down obligations for general protection against dangers arising 
from military operations against civilian objects, hospitals, relief materials and means of 
transportation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the commitments of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that each High Contracting Party to the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) is under obligation 
to take action against persons alleged to have committed or to have ordered the commission of 
grave breaches of the Convention, and recalling the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> Israeli military operations in Lebanon, which constitute gross and 
systematic human rights violations of Lebanese people, </p>

<p> A/HRC/S-2/L.1 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Appalled</i> at the massive violations of the human rights of the people of Lebanon by Israel 
resulting in the massacre of thousands of civilians, injuries, extensive damage to civilian 
infrastructure, displacement of 1 million people, and outflows of refugees fleeing heavy shelling 
and bombardment against the civilian population, 
</p>
<p> <i>Strongly condemning</i> the indiscriminate and massive Israeli air strikes, in particular on 
the village of Qana on 30 July 2006, and the targeting of United Nations peacekeepers at the 
United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon on 25 July 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the strong condemnation by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights of the killing of civilians in Qana, her call to take measures to protect civilian 
lives and civilian objects and her reiteration of the need for independent investigation, with the 
involvement of international experts, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting the extreme concern</i> expressed by the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food about the continuing adverse impact on the human rights and the 
humanitarian situation of the civilian population in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that attacks and killings of innocent civilians and the destruction of houses, 
property and infrastructure in Lebanon are a breach of the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, international law and international humanitarian law as well as are flagrant 
violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the urgent need to address the dire humanitarian situation in Lebanon, 
including through the immediate lifting of the blockade of Lebanon imposed by Israel, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the environmental degradation caused by Israeli strikes against 
power plants and their adverse impact on health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the targeting of the communication and media networks in Lebanon, </p>

and the displacement of 1 million civilians, according to a preliminary assessment, thus 
exacerbating the magnitude of the human suffering of the Lebanese; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also condemns</i> the Israeli bombardment of vital civilian infrastructure resulting in 
extensive destruction and heavy damage to public and private properties; 
</p>

human rights;

humanitarian law: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To investigate the systematic targeting and killings of civilians by Israel in 
Lebanon; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To examine the types of weapons used by Israel and their conformity with the 
international law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To assess the extent and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human life, property,
