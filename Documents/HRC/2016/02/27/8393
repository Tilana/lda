<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolutions 12/13 and 15/7 concerning human rights and indigenous peoples, 
the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit to the Council an annual report on the rights of indigenous peoples 
containing information on relevant developments of human rights bodies and mechanisms, 
and activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) at 
Headquarters and in the field that contribute to the promotion of and respect for, and the 
full application of, the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and follow up on the effectiveness of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report focuses particularly on some illustrative examples of the activities 
and the initiatives undertaken at Headquarters and by field presences that contribute to the 
full application of the rights of indigenous peoples. They do not aim to offer an exhaustive 
overview of the work of OHCHR on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. The report also presents an 
overview of the recent developments undertaken by United Nations treaty bodies, the 
Human Rights Council special procedures and mechanisms, including the universal 
periodic review. The significance of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
has been further reinforced by the recent endorsement of Member States that had previously 
voted against its adoption at the General Assembly in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, OHCHR continued to work for the promotion and 
the full application of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
These rights figure prominently in the Strategic Management Plan of the High 
Commissioner. The Declaration is a shared tool and framework for action in this area.  
</p>
<p>4. At the international level, OHCHR continued to service the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by, inter alia, supporting the preparation and organization 
of its annual sessions and organizing a technical workshop in 2011 to contribute to its 
thematic studies. OHCHR also continues to organize coordination meetings between the 
three United Nations mechanisms devoted to indigenous peoples, including the Expert 
Mechanism, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the United 
Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.  
</p>
<p>5. OHCHR continued to manage the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations to support the participation of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations in the sessions 
of the Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum. At its twenty-fourth session, from 7 to 
11 February 2011, the Board of Trustees of the Fund recommended 30 grants for 
representatives of indigenous communities and organizations to attend the tenth session of 
the Permanent Forum, as well as 24 grants to attend the fourth session of the Expert 
Mechanism. Following the enlargement of the mandate of the Fund by the General 
Assembly in November 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Fund also set aside resources to 
enable indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives to attend, for up to five days, sessions of the 
Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies, which will be held between September 2011 
and March 2012.  </p>


<p><b> A. Thematic work: Headquarters 
</b></p>
<p>6. A significant development for OHCHR was the launch of the United Nations 
Indigenous Peoples Partnership, an initiative that will function through a multi-donor trust 
fund along with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). The 
Partnership was launched on 20 May 2011 at the tenth session of the Permanent 
Forum. The key aim of the Partnership is to facilitate implementation of the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 
1989 (No. 169) through joint United Nations country programmes with indigenous peoples 
and States. The Partnership will fund programmes in the areas of (a) access to justice; (b) 
access to land and ancestral territories; (c) legislative review and reform; (d) democratic 
governance and indigenous peoples' institutions; and (e) natural resources and extractive 
industries (conflict prevention, dispute resolution and benefit-sharing).  
</p>
<p>7. In 2011, OHCHR also dedicated a theme at its annual meeting of heads of field 
presences on countering discrimination with a focus on the protection of indigenous 
peoples' and minority rights. The meeting, held in April 2011, brought together the Office&#8217;s 
56 heads of field presences, and held discussions on, inter alia, strategies for addressing 
challenges faced by indigenous peoples in realizing their rights.  
</p>
<p>8. As part of deepening work with OHCHR field presences, the Indigenous Peoples 
and Minorities Section organized a regional consultation in Managua on 15 and 16 
December 2010 for OHCHR field presences in the Latin America and Caribbean region to 
share best practices on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, 
including a focus on the issue of free, prior and informed consent. Another relevant theme 
at the session included processes and mechanisms for consultation with indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>9. In response to a recommendation by the Permanent Forum, OHCHR, ILO and the 
secretariat of the Permanent Forum jointly organized an expert meeting with the theme, 
&quot;Keeping track: indicators, mechanisms and data for assessing the implementation of 
indigenous peoples' rights&#8221;, which was held place in Geneva on 20 and 21 September 
</p><p>2010. At the expert meeting, participants took stock of the efforts made to develop 
indicators and generate data on the situation of indigenous peoples, and discussed the 
possible main features of an integrated assessment framework that would assist actors at 
local, national and international levels.  
</p>
<p>10. Further to another recommendation by the Permanent Forum to convene a workshop 
on the situation of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation, OHCHR is in the process of 
reviewing the final draft of the guidelines on indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation and 
initial contact after a series of consultations in Latin America.  
</p>
<p>11. As part of its effort to promote the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
OHCHR helped organize an international conference from 31 October to 2 November 2010 
in partnership with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Government of Mexico 
entitled &#8220;Promoting inclusive parliaments: the representation of minorities and indigenous 
peoples in Parliament&#8221;. The Conference concluded in Chiapas with the adoption of a 
Chiapas Declaration by the parliamentarians present. The outcome document contains 
recommendations on, inter alia, the role of parliamentarians in following up the 
implementation of recommendations from special procedures mandate holders and United 
Nations human rights treaty bodies, as well as raising awareness about the Declaration.   
</p>
<p>12. Following the above conference, OHCHR joined the secretariat of the Permanent 
Forum, IPU and UNDP to develop a handbook for parliamentarians on the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. An advisory board of prominent indigenous experts and </p>


<p>parliamentarians was set up and the drafting process has begun. A final version of the 
handbook is expected by December 2011. 
</p>
<p>13. Another area of promoting the Declaration was in the work of the Office with 
national human rights institutions. OHCHR organized a consultation in partnership with the 
New Zealand Human Rights Commission on the operationalization of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by national human rights institutions to 
discuss, inter alia, the proposal by the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights 
Institutions and OHCHR to produce a practical guide for national human rights institutions 
across the world. The consultation was held in Auckland, New Zealand, from 1 to 3 
December 2010, and will be followed by a series of consultations to validate the content of 
the practical guide, which is expected to be finalized by the end of 2011. 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to the development of tools to promote the Declaration, OHCHR 
continues to contribute to the work of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Issues, a mechanism for international cooperation on indigenous issues working 
closely with the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. On 16 and 17 September 2010, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) hosted the annual meeting of the Support Group at its 
headquarters in Geneva on the theme of indigenous peoples&#8217; health. In addition, the 
OHCHR Regional Office for Central America also participated in a meeting of the 
Regional Inter-Agency Working Group on Indigenous Peoples, which comprises 10 
regional members of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>15. In order for the Declaration to yield concrete results, there is a need to build capacity 
and expertise at the national level. The indigenous fellowship programme run by OHCHR 
is one important tool to build such capacity in civil society. Since April 2010, 26 fellows 
have received extensive training from OHCHR and its partners at Headquarters in Geneva 
through the English-, Spanish-, French- and Russian-language fellowship programmes. In 
addition, OHCHR has introduced the position of a Senior Indigenous Fellow as part of its 
efforts to restructure and improve the programme. The first Senior Fellow joined OHCHR 
in May 2011 for a period of three months. OHCHR has also sought to place some of its 
fellows into its field offices. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>16. During 2010, the OHCHR Regional Office for Central America implemented a 
project to draft an assessment of the situation of indigenous peoples' human rights with a 
view to developing a plan of action. The Regional Office facilitated the creation of a 
regional consultative mechanism with members of indigenous peoples from five countries 
in Central America. This mechanism has played an instrumental role in improving 
knowledge and awareness of the impact of violations of indigenous peoples' rights, 
including a gendered understanding. The mechanism has also drawn attention to the right to 
land and the duty to be consulted, as well as free and informed consent. On the basis of the 
findings, the Regional Office also conducted a participatory session with the United 
Nations system, State officials and indigenous peoples' organizations to design a plan of 
action, which will allow the Office to implement a three-year project on selected areas of 
concern.  
</p>
<p>17. In Asia, the OHCHR Regional Office for South-East Asia continued to cooperate 
with United Nations agencies at the regional level for the promotion and protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples. The Office organized a host of meetings with the UNDP 
Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples, with a focus on (a) a rights-based approach to 
development; (b) natural resources and livelihoods; and (c) follow-up to United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and processes. In July 2010, the Regional Office also attended a </p>


<p>strategy planning workshop of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
Indigenous People&#8217;s Task Force, organized by the Asian Indigenous Peoples Pact and 
Forum Asia. The workshop focused on the recognition of indigenous peoples within 
ASEAN. 
</p>
<p>18. In Africa, the OHCHR Central Africa Regional Office (United Nations Centre for 
Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa) contributed to the organization of a 
subregional seminar on the application of international norms and principles relating to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. The seminar, organized by the Indigenous Peoples and 
Minorities Section of OHCHR in collaboration with the ILO Regional Office for Central 
Africa, from 26 to 28 May 2010 in Yaound&#233;, was aimed at examining ways for better 
including the norms and principles related to the rights of indigenous peoples in the 
implementation of national programmes and policies in the subregion. The event brought 
together representatives of Governments, civil society organizations and indigenous 
representatives.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Country engagements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Monitoring activities  
</b></p>
<p>19. Activities carried out in relation to indigenous issues at the country level included 
monitoring, support for legal reform, technical cooperation and capacity-building 
initiatives, as well as awareness-raising. In Latin America, OHCHR field presences 
monitored a host of concerns on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, including processes of 
consultation relating to development and extractive industries, situations of unrest and 
conflict, and the protection of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>20. The Office in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) received complaints from 
representatives of various indigenous peoples on either the lack of or poor implementation 
by State institutions of their duty to consult on legal measures, infrastructure and extractive 
projects. OHCHR received complaints relating to this issue particularly on extractive 
industry projects, which have an impact on the lives of indigenous communities. It also 
continued to monitor the lack of consultation by State institutions with indigenous peoples 
affected by potential infrastructure projects, such as road projects that would cross the 
Isiboro Secure Park and Madidi Park. In addition, the Office received information 
regarding environmental pollution in the territories of some indigenous communities owing 
to toxic contamination generated by extractive industries in the Chaco region and in the 
vicinity of the Poop&#243; Lake. 
</p>
<p>21. During the period under review, OHCHR Colombia continued to fulfil its mandate 
to monitor violations of the human rights of indigenous peoples. This included monitoring 
judicial proceedings aimed at investigating the massacre of at least seven members of the 
Aw&#225; people. Special attention was also paid to cases of arbitrary detention of indigenous 
leaders, threats against their personal integrity, and confinement of indigenous peoples 
during internal armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR Colombia currently participates in a review process of the protection 
mechanisms established for the Embera Kat&#237;o from the Alto Sinu on the basis of a decision 
of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2001. The process is being 
conducted in cooperation with civil society organizations, the Embera Kat&#237;o authorities and 
Government officials. Participation includes field visits to the community concerned and 
meetings with relevant Government officials.  
</p>
<p>23. The Office in Guatemala monitored the forced eviction of 12 indigenous 
communities in Valle del Polochic, Alta Verapaz. In the context of increasing social </p>


<p>conflicts relating to the exploitation of natural resources and access to land, special 
attention was paid to cases of arbitrary detentions of indigenous leaders, threats against 
their personal integrity and the killing of four indigenous leaders in Quebrada Seca, Izabal. 
</p>
<p>24. In Mexico, the Office conducted a number of monitoring missions related to the 
rights of indigenous peoples and on threats to human rights defenders. They included a 
mission to Oaxaca to interview authorities and indigenous leaders on the killing of two 
human rights defenders working on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and the monitoring of a trial 
of an indigenous human rights defender in Guerrero, who was eventually released free of 
all charges.  
</p>
<p>25. The Office also conducted a monitoring mission to Chiapas to assess the impact on 
human rights of mining activities and to assess the consultation of indigenous peoples in the 
development of the Sustainable Rural Towns initiative, which aims to provide access to 
education and health. During a field visit to the community of Paso La Reina, OHCHR 
looked at the issue of consultation of indigenous peoples in the context of construction of a 
hydroelectric dam.    
</p>
<p>26. In Asia, OHCHR country offices monitored cases of land concessions, protests, and 
bonded labour issues affecting indigenous communities. OHCHR Cambodia continued to 
monitor the impact of economic land concessions and land-grabbing for agro-industrial 
purposes, such as rubber and cassava plantations, and mining and oil activities that affect 
indigenous peoples. In some cases, concessions have been granted without respecting the 
duty to consult with indigenous communities, thereby threatening their livelihood, culture, 
traditions, burial grounds and forests. Some contentious land cases have resulted in 
violence against land rights activists as well as members of communities disputing their 
eviction. OHCHR Cambodia has, in certain cases, sought to facilitate dialogue between 
members of Government, representatives of private enterprises, civil society organizations 
and leaders of indigenous communities with a view to encouraging respect for human rights 
in the context of land disputes. 
</p>
<p>27. In a current programme, OHCHR Cambodia is assisting communities to undertake a 
process of self-identification as indigenous peoples and registration with the Ministry of 
Land Management so that they are entitled to apply for collective land title. The process is 
mandated by the Land Law of 2001, which recognizes indigenous communities as legal 
entities prior to securing legal tenure. Current efforts of the Office are focused on assisting 
the Phnong peoples of Bousra Commune, Mondulkuri province, to protect their rights in 
the light of the economic land concessions of 2008 that threaten to affect more than 800 
families. Efforts by OHCHR in this regard focus on (a) accelerating registration of 
indigenous communities who are not yet recognized as legal entities; and (b) assisting with 
the provision of communal land ownership to indigenous communities to ensure that they 
have security of tenure. 
</p>
<p>28. In Nepal, the Office continued to monitor protests and demonstrations organized by 
indigenous peoples across the country to demand self-determination and the creation of 
autonomous States in the proposed federal system of Nepal. By monitoring various cases, 
OHCHR played a preventive role in areas characterized by a volatile political situation. The 
Office in Nepal also continued to monitor the implementation of the Supreme Court 
decision of 2006 ordering the Government to implement existing laws prohibiting child 
exploitation, including the Kamalari practice.1 Through its work with local organizations 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Kamalari practice is a form of bonded labour where children belonging to the Tharu indigenous 
</p>
<p>group are sent to work with wealthy families, and often subjected to physical abuse and sexual 
exploitation. </p>


<p>focused on the rescue and rehabilitation of Kamalari children, district and regional 
advocacy networks have been established. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Technical cooperation and capacity-building activities 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Office supported Governments on indigenous issues by means of a range of 
technical cooperation activities. OHCHR in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) continued to 
support actions aimed at changing patterns of discrimination and exclusion of indigenous 
peoples. Several of these actions were part of legislative and institutional developments 
concerning the implementation of constitutional provisions. The Office provided various 
round tables that drafted the bill against racism and all forms of discrimination with 
technical support, including legal analysis. Together with support from Headquarters, 
OHCHR provided support through a workshop to the Vice Ministry of Decolonization, 
which is responsible for addressing racism and racial discrimination through a plan of 
action.  
</p>
<p>30. OHCHR also provided the Vice Ministry of Indigenous Justice with support for the 
process of consultation on a bill on jurisdictional boundaries. This was done through 
dissemination of information on the bill, organizing a series of workshops and training 
sessions on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, with a focus on consultation within the framework 
of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, monitoring the 
consultations as such, and participating in the round-table discussions that incorporated 
inputs collected during the consultation process into the draft bill. During the consultation, 
representatives of indigenous peoples expressed their support for the draft bill; however, the 
final text of the bill, as adopted on 29 December 2010, contains a number of amendments 
that do not reflect the comments made by indigenous peoples during the consultation 
process. While the Constitution of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) provides for the right to 
consultation with indigenous peoples, and Law 3760 of 2007 incorporates the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a national law, to date, internal 
legislation to regulate consultation has only been adopted for the exploitation of 
hydrocarbons. 
</p>
<p>31. In Colombia, the Office provides ongoing support for the implementation of a plan 
to protect the Awa indigenous people, as ordered by the Constitutional Court of Colombia 
in 2009. Support efforts includes hosting and working with a national consultant financed 
by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to help implement the plan. Together 
with UNDP and the Office of the Resident Coordinator, OHCHR Colombia provided 
technical advice to support the creation of a high-level commission to make public policy 
recommendations for the protection of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>32. OHCHR Colombia provided Government officials and members of parliament with 
technical advice during the discussion of a draft law for victims of the internal armed 
conflict and land restitution. The draft law includes the duty of the State to consult with 
ethnic groups with a view to obtain their consent. The Office also launched an initiative 
aimed at carrying out broad national participatory processes with ethnic communities to 
discuss their visions, aspirations, concerns, comments and experiences on the principle of 
free, prior and informed consultation and consent, with the potential of it becoming a 
legally binding instrument. In July 2010, the first phase of the project was carried out with 
expert assistance from the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>33. OHCHR Guatemala carried out workshops on the duty to consult with Government 
officials, indigenous authorities, civil society organizations, journalists and the private 
sector to contribute to the understanding of this duty in compliance with international 
standards. The Office also participated in meetings with a governmental commission in 
charge of drafting a regulation on the duty of States to consult. The Office highlighted the </p>


<p>fact that this legal instrument should comply with international human rights standards and 
be based on broad consultations with indigenous communities and organizations.  
</p>
<p>34. During the reporting period, OHCHR Guatemala concluded the implementation of 
the project entitled &#8220;Contributing to the eradication of racism and ethnic and gender 
discrimination, particularly against indigenous women&#8221;, jointly with the Presidential 
Commission against Racism and Discrimination against Indigenous Peoples and the 
Indigenous Women&#8217;s Defenders Office.  The Office worked on strengthening the legal 
units of both organizations, and workshops were also held with prosecutors from across the 
country to strengthen investigation and the prosecution of cases of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>35. The Office in Guatemala has also facilitated dialogue between State authorities and 
representatives of the Garifuna indigenous peoples, encouraging their inclusion and 
participation of the Garifuna in Government institutions that have a mandate to address 
racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>36. In Mexico, the Office participated in an expert panel at the Congress of the Union 
for the discussion of a draft law on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to consultation, entitled 
&#8220;Anteproyecto de la Ley General de Consulta a los Pueblos y Comunidades Indigenas&#8221;, and 
discussed its harmonization with international standards, in particular the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>37. At the request of the Judicial Academy of Peru for technical assistance, the Regional 
Office for South America organized a training session for public prosecutors and judges 
from the Academy on the direct applicability and interpretative effect of international 
human rights treaties in domestic courts. The course included a focus on international 
instruments for indigenous peoples and subjects such as legal pluralism. The two-month 
course involved (a) two weeks of compulsory attendance (20-24 September and 11-15 
October 2010) in Lima; (b) three levels of evaluation; and (c) online follow-up. The first 
week involved the expert participation of a judge from the Constitutional Court of 
Colombia, a legal official from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, ILO legal 
officers and the regional and deputy regional representatives of OHCHR. The course was 
attended by 55 public prosecutors and judges, and broadcast live, including in the 
indigenous regions of Peru. 
</p>
<p>38. In Asia, the Office worked to address the complexities of the legal framework and 
accompanying procedural requirements in Cambodia that have put indigenous communities 
at risk of land grabbing and loss of livelihoods. OHCHR Cambodia supports Government 
networks (Ministry of Rural Development, Land Management and the Interior), the United 
Nations, civil society and indigenous communities in strengthening the capacity of 
indigenous peoples and their partners in the domestic legal framework and its 
implementation for security of land tenure. Support is provided through technical advice, 
training sessions and workshops. 
</p>
<p>39. The OHCHR Central Africa Regional Office joined the Governments of Cameroon 
and of the Congo in the commemoration of the International Day of Indigenous Peoples on 
9 August 2010, in Ngambe Tikar (Cameroon) and Brazzaville (Congo) respectively, to 
raise awareness of Government and indigenous representatives on the rights of indigenous 
peoples contained in the Declaration. More specifically, the Regional Office, in cooperation 
with United Nations system partners, supported the Government of the Congo during a 
week of public awareness-raising and outreach activities, including a press briefing, an 
exhibition and a conference debate on 9 August 2010. The activities facilitated an important 
dialogue between indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives and the Government at the national 
level, and raised awareness further on the importance of adopting and promulgating the 
national law on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  </p>


<p>40. In order to facilitate the adoption of the national law on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in 
the Congo, the OHCHR Central Africa Regional Office also joined the United Nations 
system and other partners on advocacy initiatives. The law was adopted on 30 December 
2010 by Parliament and the Senate in Brazzaville shortly after the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. The law is the first of its kind in Africa and 
marks a significant step in the recognition and protection of the rights of marginalized 
indigenous peoples of the country, including such groups as the Baaka, Mbendjele, Mikaya, 
Luma, Gyeli, Twa and Babongo peoples.  
</p>
<p>41. Furthermore, the Regional Office conducted bilateral meetings with Cameroon, 
various diplomatic missions and the Ministry of External Relations in Cameroon to inform 
them of the establishment of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership in an effort 
to garner support and contributions for the Partnership as a tool to enhance technical 
cooperation and capacity-building. The Regional Office also indicated its willingness to 
contribute to the validation phase of a research study by the Ministry of External Relations 
on the definition of indigenous peoples in Cameroon with a view to prepare a draft law on 
the protection of indigenous peoples in Cameroon. 
</p>
<p> 42. The Regional Office for Southern Africa hosted an indigenous fellow from Namibia 
for a period of four months. The fellow recently completed the annual OHCHR Indigenous 
Fellowship Programme in Geneva, and is part of the efforts made by OHCHR Headquarters 
to create national fellowship opportunities and provide &#8220;on-the-job&#8221; training in country 
offices. </p>
<p>43. OHCHR in Moscow has also supported the indigenous fellowship programme by 
hosting an indigenous fellow for three months. In addition, it has focused on capacity-
building and enhancing knowledge of indigenous peoples who engage with United Nations 
human rights mechanisms. In 2010, as part of the OHCHR indigenous fellowship 
programme, the Office facilitated training sessions in Moscow and Geneva attended by 
eight representatives of indigenous communities, in collaboration with the Peoples&#8217; 
Friendship University of the Russian Federation, United Nations agencies and non-
governmental organizations. The Office in the Russian Federation also facilitated the 
translation and printing of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights in the Komi-
Permian language. This concluded a series of translations of the Universal Declaration into 
10 languages of indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>44. In Latin America, OHCHR in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) provided capacity-
building assistance to civil society organizations for their participation in the seventy-eighth 
session of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, where they held a 
dialogue with Committee experts. This participation, together with the Government, 
allowed the Committee to attain a holistic understanding of the situation in the country. At 
the request of the Guaran&#237; People&#8217;s Assembly, training sessions were organized for 100 
Guaran&#237; leaders on the topics of participation and the rights of indigenous women in 
Bolivia (Plurinational State of). The Office also supported meetings of the Guaran&#237; people 
during the ninth and tenth sessions of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New 
York.  
</p>
<p>45. A three-day training session was conducted in Cochabamba by OHCHR in Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) for 30 indigenous communicators. The session was the first of three 
focused on international human rights instruments and values. In addition, participants 
initiated the production of brochures on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
translated into the languages spoken by their communities of origin.  
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR Colombia raised awareness about the content of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples through public speeches, technical 
meetings and workshops with indigenous peoples, civil society organizations and </p>


<p>Government officials. The Office has further distributed the Declaration and related United 
Nations documents to various stakeholders, including judges of the Constitutional Court, 
with the aim of increasing their knowledge about the protection of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>47. In October 2010, OHCHR Colombia participated in a training programme for senior 
legal officers of the military and conducted a special session on the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of indigenous peoples. In this context, the Office addressed specific concerns 
with respect to military actions and the rights of indigenous peoples, with a particular focus 
on the use of lands, territories and natural resources, and the principle of free, prior and 
informed consent. Issues raised also included the risks of forced displacement due to 
military presence and actions, restrictions to freedom of movement and protection of 
indigenous peoples from illegal armed groups.   
</p>
<p>48. In the context of the Maya programme, OHCHR Guatemala concluded the first 
phase of the technical training programme for strategic human rights litigation for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, which was attended by 32 students and 24 representatives of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations. A total of 12 technical programmes for strategic 
litigation (on consultation, natural resources, land, non-discrimination and cultural rights) 
were designed and completed by students. Training programmes have been initiated for the 
second group. 
</p>
<p>49. OHCHR Guatemala also organized a two-day workshop with 54 indigenous leaders 
from the Latin America region to exchange experiences about the protection of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; collective rights in the context of exploitation of natural resources.   
</p>
<p>50. The Office in Mexico organized a regional forum on the theme, &#8220;Rights to 
consultation: the impact of development projects on rights to lands, territories and natural 
resources&#8221; on 27 and 28 May 2010, in Oaxaca de Ju&#225;rez. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations 
from the States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Chiapas and Veracuz shared their experiences on 
defending their rights in the context of large-scale development projects. The Office made 
presentations on international standards, with a specific focus on the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>51. The OHCHR Regional Office for Central America supported the National 
Coordination Organization, which represents seven indigenous peoples in Panama in their 
advocacy to seek ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 by providing capacity-building 
training in several provinces and indigenous territories on the content of the Convention. As 
a result, the Ministry of the Interior assembled a working group to study the matter; during 
the universal periodic review, the Government of Panama made a voluntary pledge to 
consider adhering to ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>52. The Regional Office for Central America also initiated training activities to facilitate 
the use of human rights bodies by indigenous peoples&#8217; and organizations. With support 
from OHCHR Headquarters, the Office designed a programme to strengthen the capacities 
of Coodinadora Nacional de Mujeres Ind&#237;ginas de Panam&#225; on the basis of a methodology 
designed for trainers on the international human rights framework (the Declaration, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other 
international human rights instruments) to enhance interaction with United Nations human 
rights mechanisms. The Office also worked in close coordination with the United Nations 
country teams in Panama and El Salvador to ensure that indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns were 
taken into account during the elaboration of the Common Country Assessment and the 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework. 
</p>
<p>53. On 4 and 5 May 2010, the Regional Office for South America participated in an 
international seminar in Lima on the theme, &#8220;The duty of States to consult with indigenous 
peoples in Peru and Latin America&#8221;, organized by a group of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations, the national human rights coordinator, Oxfam and Agencia Espa&#241;ola de </p>


<p>Cooperaci&#243;n Internacional para el Desarrollo. The Regional Office gave the inaugural 
keynote address and made closing comments, which highlighted the role of international 
instruments and the importance of consultation with indigenous peoples. The seminar was 
attended by more than 200 participants and drew broad media attention in Peru. On 19 May 
2010, Congress adopted a law regulating the content, principles and procedure of the duty 
to consult with indigenous peoples, the first of its kind in the Latin America and the 
Caribbean region; the law is now pending Presidential enactment. Parliament adopted the 
law after 10 months of intense negotiations among Government officials, indigenous 
peoples&#8217; organizations and human rights non-governmental organizations, national human 
rights institution and other stakeholders. Following adoption, the Regional Office organized 
follow-up actions with indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, human rights lawyers and the 
ILO Regional Office. Five weeks after adoption of the law by Congress, the President of 
Peru vetoed it. At the end of the reporting period, the law had still not taken effect. 
</p>
<p>54. On 26 November 2010, the Regional Office for South America conducted a training 
session on United Nations mechanisms dealing with indigenous peoples for 30 young 
indigenous leaders from Chile. The activity was organized by the Human Rights 
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Santiago. The session included the -
dissemination of books and materials on indigenous peoples for participants. 
</p>
<p>55. The Central Africa Regional Office conducted a training session on the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples at a workshop for technical focal 
points from 10 ministerial departments, including social affairs, agriculture, justice and 
external relations, jointly organized by ILO and Plan International, in Cameroon on 28 
September 2010. It also produced a series of outreach materials to raise awareness on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and contributed to a better understanding of the Declaration, as 
well as the full application of its provisions. The outreach materials included a public 
information kit, with the support of UNICEF Congo, UNFPA Congo, the European Union 
and the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Congo. The kit included 1,000 booklets on 
questions and answers on indigenous peoples and human rights in Central Africa, 600 
copies of the fact sheet on the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and 
several hundred copies of posters produced by indigenous peoples in the Congo.  
</p>
<p>56. In line with its regular engagement to enhance the capacity of indigenous activists 
on human rights mechanisms, OHCHR Nepal conducted a training session for trainers 
jointly with a national indigenous organisation. The session was held in November 2010 
with the objective of helping participants to advocate for the inclusion of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights in the new Constitution of Nepal in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights bodies and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>57. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its third session in 
July 2010. In addition to discussing the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, the Expert Mechanism adopted a progress report on its study on 
indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making. On 9 and 10 March, the 
Office hosted an expert workshop on the right to participate in decision-making for the 
Expert Mechanism. The main objective of the workshop was to obtain additional 
substantive input to the final thematic study of the Expert Mechanism, particularly on (a) 
good practices of indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making; and (b) 
recommendations for the implementation of the right to participate with a focus on the 
principle of free, prior and informed consent. Following the workshop, the study was </p>


<p>finalized and submitted for adoption by the Expert Mechanism, together with advice No. 2, 
at its Fourth Session in July 2011.2 
</p>
<p><b> B. Special procedures and treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Special procedures 
</b>58. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples carried out visits to 
several countries, including New Zealand, Guatemala, Congo, New Caledonia (France), 
Suriname and Costa Rica. As an example, OHCHR Guatemala supported the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples which focused on the duty to 
consult. The visit generated a wide discussion on the subject of consultation within the 
country, increased awareness in the private sector and prompted an initiative by the 
Government to regulate this right. Further details on the activities of the Special Rapporteur 
will be presented in his report to the Human Rights Council at its eighteenth session 
(A/HRC/18/35). 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also continued to contribute to the work of the Permanent 
Forum and the Expert Mechanism through meetings and dialogue. He held separate 
meetings with indigenous representatives to receive communications during the annual 
sessions of both the Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>60. During the reporting period, other special procedures mandate holders also looked 
into the situation of indigenous peoples within their respective mandates. Thematic 
mandate holders addressed the issue in various forms, such as in the recent report submitted 
by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
(A/HRC/17/26) to the Human Rights Council, with a focus on multiple forms of 
discrimination, including against indigenous women. In his report submitted to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fifth session (A/65/281), the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
explored threats posed by increasing pressures on land, paying particular attention to 
indigenous peoples. In the report, the Special Rapporteur explored how States and the 
international community could better respect, protect and fulfil the right to food by giving 
increased recognition to land as a human right. 
</p>
<p>61. Some thematic mandate holders also addressed indigenous rights during their 
country visits. On the basis of her mission to Brazil in November 2010, the independent 
expert in the field of cultural rights examined, inter alia, the cultural rights of indigenous 
peoples (A/HRC/17/38/Add.1). The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism highlighted the fact that 
atrocities committed during the internal armed conflict in Peru affected indigenous 
communities and peasants and the lack of an inclusive policy with regard to indigenous 
peoples (A/HRC/16/51/Add.3). The Special Rapporteur also highlighted the importance of 
the collective reparations programme in Peru, which is an important means of addressing 
the distinct needs of indigenous peoples affected by the internal armed conflict. In her end 
of mission statement on 21 January 2011 in India, the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders expressed concern for those working for, inter alia, the rights of 
<i>Adivasis</i> (tribal peoples).  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>2.  Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>  <b>(a) Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b> 
</p>
<p>  
  2 A/HRC/EMRIP/2011/2. </p>


<p>62. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination continued to pay 
particular attention to the situation of indigenous peoples in the concluding observations 
adopted after the consideration of reports submitted by States parties, as well as during the 
consideration of situations under its early warning and urgent action procedure. In some 
concluding observations, the Committee recalled its general recommendation No. 23 (1997) 
on the rights of indigenous peoples. During the period under review, concluding 
observations relating to indigenous peoples issues were addressed to eight State parties. 
</p>
<p>63. The Committee regretted the absence of information from a number of State parties 
on the ethnic and linguistic make-up of the population, including indigenous peoples, which 
would enable both the Committee and the State party to better assess the implementation of 
the International Convention  on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  at 
the national level. In this regard, the Committee reiterated its recommendation according to 
which State parties should adopt measures or appropriate statistical tools to ensure that self-
identification is the primary means for determining whether people are indigenous or not. 
The Committee also addressed the issue of lack of legal recognition of indigenous peoples 
by some State parties, including recognition of collective rights to indigenous peoples, in 
particular the right to ancestral land. 
</p>
<p>64. The Committee continued to pay attention to activities carried out by transitional 
corporations that may have a negative impact on the traditional lifestyle of indigenous 
peoples. It continued to address the issue of effective participation and representation of 
indigenous peoples in public and political affairs, as well as in decision-making bodies. It 
also continued to address the issue of full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights 
by indigenous peoples. The Committee remained concerned about the issues of effective 
access to justice and of judicial and administrative remedies for indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>65. Under its early warning and urgent action procedure, the Committee issued letters of 
concerns and recommendations regarding the situation of indigenous peoples in 14 
countries. In particular, it expressed great concern about the lack of consultation with 
indigenous peoples prior to granting land concessions, including the absence of seeking 
their prior, free and informed consent before carrying out mining activities or other projects 
on their traditional lands that may affect their lifestyle. The Committee recommended that 
State parties should consult with indigenous peoples before carry out mining activities or 
other projects in order to obtain their prior, free and informed consent. In a number of 
situations under its early warning and urgent action procedure, the Committee addressed the 
negative impact of mining activities on the environment and recommended that State 
parties should carry out independent impact assessments of such activities. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>66. At its one-hundredth session, the Human Rights Committee examined a State party 
report and expressed its particular concern at the situation of women and girls performing 
domestic work, which primarily affects rural and indigenous women and girls. Under 
articles 3 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Committee 
noted that they were subject to particularly harsh working conditions, excessive work hours 
and were either unpaid or poorly paid for their work. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>67. During the forty-fourth session of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, concluding observations regarding the rights of indigenous peoples were addressed 
to a number of States parties. Recommendations included the recognition of an indigenous 
official language; the establishment of concrete measures to review processes concerning 
infrastructure, development and mining projects and full implementation decisions of the 
Constitutional Court;<b> </b>the<b> </b>adoption of legislation in consultation with and the participation 
of, inter alia, indigenous peoples, that clearly established the right to free, prior and </p>


<p>informed consent, in conformity with ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples  and relevant decisions of the Constitutional Court; the design of specific 
strategies to generate employment opportunities; the registration of newborn indigenous 
children; and protecting the rights of indigenous women displaced by internal armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>68. At its forty-fifth session, the Committe addressed indigenous concerns to one State 
party. It recommended that the State party should ensure that the indigenous community 
could return to and remain undisturbed on the lands from which they were evicted. It 
recommended the establishment of an authority for the representation of the community for 
consultation and consent, as well as State party consideration to ratify ILO Convention No. 
</p><p>169. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p>69. In consideration of a State party report, the Committee against Torture noted that 
arrest warrants were often insufficiently substantiated by evidence and that arrests were 
used as a means of stigmatizing certain groups, inter alia, indigenous people (Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, art. 2). 
The Committee recommended that the State party should take steps to eradicate preventive 
administrative detention and mass arrests, and act on the recommendations made by the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. It also expressed concern about threats against 
victims of forced displacement who had asked for the return of their land. It noted that 
those mainly affected were, inter alia, indigenous peoples. The Committee was concerned 
under article 14 of the Convention that land belonging to displaced persons had been seized 
by illegal armed groups and, in some cases, sold to third parties for mono-cultivation and 
the exploitation of natural resources. It therefore urged the State party to take effective 
measures to ensure the return of land to victims of displacement and respect the land 
ownership of, inter alia, indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Committee jalso took note of information from the State party on the 
preparation of a draft bill on cooperation and coordination between the indigenous and 
ordinary justice systems, setting out, in articles 4 and 19, the principle of reviews for 
constitutionality. It expressed concern that neither the periodic report nor the answers given 
by the delegation of the State party provided sufficient information on how conflicts of 
jurisdiction between the two systems would be resolved (articles 2 and 16). It therefore 
recommended that the State party should take the steps necessary to ensure that conflicts of 
jurisdiction between ordinary and indigenous justice systems are resolved through a 
procedure laid down by law. 
</p>
<p>71. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women  expressed 
concern about the lack of effective access to the justice system for indigenous women. In 
relevant concluding observations, the Committee requested State parties to take all 
appropriate measures to remove impediments that women may face in gaining access to 
justice and to put in place measures to ensure women&#8217;s access to justice. It specifically 
recommended that States parties should enhance women&#8217;s awareness of their rights through 
legal literacy programmes and legal assistance, and ensure that judges, lawyers, prosecutors 
and public defenders are familiar with the rights of women, including indigenous women, 
as well as with the obligations of States parties under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>72. During the period under review, the Committee continued to pay particular attention 
to the lack of access to health care for indigenous women, and recommended that State 
parties should close the existing gaps in the infant and maternal mortality rates between 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations. </p>


<p>73. The Committee remained concerned about the lack of temporary special measures in 
the form of compulsory targets and quotas to address the underrepresentation of indigenous 
women in decision-making positions in political and public life. In this regard, the 
Committee reiterated its recommendation that State parties should adopt temporary special 
measures in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention and the Committee&#8217;s 
general recommendation No. 25. 
</p>
<p><b>(f) Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>74. A number of State parties were considered by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child at its fifty-fourth session; some were also reviewed under the Optional Protocol of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
Concluding observations on indigenous peoples regarded, inter alia, taking all appropriate 
measures in the light of articles 3 and 4 of the Convention, to the maximum extent of 
available resources; ensuring sufficient budgetary allocations for services for children, with 
a particular focus on the protection of the rights of children belonging to disadvantaged 
provinces and groups, including indigenous children; the translation of the Convention and 
the optional protocols thereto into indigenous languages; and the implementation of a birth 
registration strategy for indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>75. At its fifty-fifth session, the Committee considered 11 State parties (10 under both 
optional protocols and one under the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict). Concluding observations on indigenous peoples regarded, inter alia, the 
State party taking measures under article 4 of the protocol to eliminate the root causes of 
recruitment of persons under the age of 18 years by armed groups distinct from the State, 
with special attention paid to preventing the recruitment of, inter alia, indigenous children, 
and to ensuring that these measures were developed in consultation with affected 
communities; addressing the situation of racism and discrimination against specific 
indigenous communities; and establishing culturally sensitive health care for indigenous 
women and children. The Committee also drew attention to its general comment no. 11 on 
indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>76. At the fifty-sixth session, the Committee considered nine State parties under both 
optional protocols. Concluding observations on indigenous peoples regarded, inter alia, 
upholding the identity of a particular indigenous community capable of vindicating 
traditional rights in accordance with international norms; improving the situation of 
children belonging to indigenous groups and recognition of treaty rights; and guaranteeing 
the right of indigenous children to enjoy their own culture. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>77. Issues concerning indigenous peoples were frequently raised in the context of the 
universal periodic review, including in reviews concerning Australia, Guyana, Kenya, the 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Panama and Sweden. Recommendations 
concerned, inter alia, the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169; the implementation of 
recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples; 
harmonizing domestic legal frameworks with international human rights standards; the 
implementation of recommendations by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights; and measures for effective political participation. 
</p>
<p>78. OHCHR Nepal supported the meaningful participation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; organizations in the universal periodic review. During preparation for the review, 
OHCHR Nepal organized awareness-raising initiatives on advocacy opportunities that the 
review provides. It also facilitated discussion and advocacy on indigenous peoples&#8217; issues </p>


<p>and recommendations among such key stakeholders as national human rights institutions, 
the international community and civil society. OHCHR Nepal also supported the 
participation of indigenous peoples in the preparation of the State report submitted for the 
review. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>79.  <b>During the period under review, OHCHR further strengthened its work to 
advance the rights of indigenous peoples at the country level and increased its efforts 
to clarify concepts contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. The work facilitated consultative processes in Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) and elsewhere, as well as the adoption of new legislation, 
including the law on indigenous peoples in the Congo. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Through various activities with the United Nations country teams, 
Governments and civil society, OHCHR also built the capacity of indigenous 
communities to advance their rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>81.<b> Furthermore, OHCHR promoted cooperation and coordination within the 
United Nations system and among the three United Nations mandates dedicated to 
indigenous issues. A key development was the launch of the United Nations 
Indigenous Peoples Partnership, which endeavours to advance the implementation of 
the Declaration as &#8220;one United Nations&#8221; in partnership with indigenous peoples and 
States. </b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>In addition to the work of the United Nations mechanisms devoted to the rights 
of indigenous peoples, human rights treaty bodies and the universal periodic review 
process frequently highlighted gaps and recommended measures to advance the rights 
of indigenous peoples in line with the Declaration. The extension of the mandate of the 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations will now allow an increasing number of 
indigenous peoples to attend the sessions of treaty bodies and the Human Rights 
Council to give greater visibility to their issues.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> During the period under review, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples received further endorsements by Member States, and 
confirmed its role as a global tool for advancing these rights. OHCHR and various 
human rights mechanisms also pursued a broad range of activities and initiatives to 
help Member States, indigenous peoples and others concerned to make sure that the 
principles of the Declaration are reflected in laws, policies and practices.
