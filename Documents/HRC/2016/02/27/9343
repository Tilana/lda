<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report contains my findings as Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, following my official mission to Ghana from 7 to 14 July 2007. It 
addresses specific forms of violence encountered by women and girls within the context of the 
dual normative system in the country and women&#8217;s subordinate status in the society at large. 
</p>
<p> The formal State institutions coexist with a customary system of traditional authorities. 
While traditional authorities are also fully bound by Ghana&#8217;s international commitments to 
gender equality to the extent that they exercise public power, they tend to favour respect for local 
custom over gender equality. Customary law, which is constitutionally recognized as a source of 
law, discriminates against women, especially in relation to questions of inheritance and property. 
</p>
<p> Violence against women remains widespread and some groups of women are particularly 
vulnerable. The girl child may be sexually abused in the family, subjected to early or child 
marriage or exploited as a <i>kayaye </i>(porter<i>)</i> or domestic worker. Female genital mutilation and the 
ritual servitude of <i>trokosi</i> also remain prevalent in some parts of the country, even though these 
practices have been criminalized and are on the decrease. Women accused of witchcraft are often 
violently driven from their communities and forced to take refuge in &#8220;witch camps&#8221;. Many 
widows are subjected to violent evictions from their homes and loss of inheritance, leaving them 
destitute. 
</p>
<p> The police, courts, social services and the health sector are not sufficiently equipped and 
trained to effectively protect women facing violence. The Domestic Violence Victims Support 
Unit, which is tasked to investigate crimes involving domestic violence against women, is 
under-resourced and often inadequately trained. 
</p>
<p> The Domestic Violence Act, which was adopted in 2007, marks an important step forward, 
but needs to be swiftly followed by the adoption of a gender-sensitive domestic violence action 
plan and an earmarked budget to implement the Act. 
</p>
<p> High and extreme levels of poverty and the external debt burden limit the Government&#8217;s 
ability to allocate sufficient resources for universal basic education, gender parity in education 
and the socio-economic development of marginalized regions and districts. The international 
community has an obligation to support the Government through targeted aid, debt relief and 
fairer terms of trade. 
</p>
<p> Based on my findings, I call on the Government to enact legislation to strengthen women&#8217;s 
protection and equality; support women&#8217;s social, political and economic empowerment; ensure 
that traditional authorities comply with national and international commitments to women&#8217;s 
rights; and sufficiently fund and implement the Domestic Violence Act and corresponding action 
plan. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, I carried out an official visit to Ghana from 7 
to 14 July 2007. During the course of my mission, which took me to the Greater Accra Region, 
the Volta Region and the Northern Region, I held consultations with Members of Parliament, the 
Minister for Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs, the Minister for Health, the Minister of Chieftaincy 
and Culture, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Chief Justice, and other senior 
government officials at the national and local level. I also visited the women&#8217;s section of 
Nsawam Prison, the International Needs Vocational Training Centre in Adidome, the Gambaga 
Outcast Home (also referred to as the &#8220;Gambaga Witches Camp&#8221;), and the training centre for 
girls in Tamale and met with civil society organizations, traditional authorities and individual 
victims of violence. I would like to thank everyone for their support and cooperation in the 
preparation and conduct of the mission. 
</p>
<p>2. This report starts with a discussion of the dual governance and legal structure in Ghana and 
the challenges that traditional authorities and customary law pose for the advancement of 
women. The report then addresses the status of women and focuses on some of the major forms 
of violence women encounter in the family and community. 
</p>
<p>3. I look forward to a continued dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the 
implementation of recommendations made in this report. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE GOVERNANCE AND LEGAL STRUCTURE 
</b></p>
<p>4. Ghana is characterized by a dual structure, where formal State institutions coexist with a 
customary system built around chiefs, councils of elders and other traditional authorities. This 
duality is most apparent in rural areas, where close to two thirds of Ghanaians live.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Formal structure 
</b></p>
<p>5. The administrative and legal structures are largely based on the institutions inherited from 
colonial rule.<b>1</b> The legal system follows the common law tradition and despite efforts to devolve 
State power to Ghana&#8217;s 10 regions and 110 districts, the governance structure remains 
centralized. The capacity of the State to deliver basic services, combat poverty and implement 
the law is weak, especially in rural areas. The Government&#8217;s options are further constrained by 
an external debt burden.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  On 6 March 2007, Ghana celebrated the 50th anniversary of its declaration of independence 
</p>
<p>from colonial rule. 
<b>2
</b>  The proportion of the population with an income of less than $1 a day has fallen from 
</p>
<p>about 51 per cent in the early 1990s to 35 per cent in 2004. Very high levels of extreme poverty 
remain most acute in rural areas (<i>Africa Research Bulletin</i>, August 2006, vol. 43). Over 
30 per cent of the population lack access to safe water and 68 per cent lack sanitation services. 
Most diseases seen in clinics are water-related, J.O. Ad&#233;s&#236;n&#224;, ed., <i>Social Policy in Sub-Saharan 
African Context</i> (London, Palgrave, 2007) p. 233. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>6. The current Constitution that restored multiparty politics came into force in 1992. The 
principle of non-discrimination on the basis of sex is engrained in the Constitution. Ghana is a 
party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(ratified without reservations in 1986) and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (ratified without reservations in 2007). It has 
consented to the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The Constitution explicitly guarantees the institution of chieftaincy, together with its 
traditional councils, and precludes the State from interfering in the appointment of chiefs. In 
return, chiefs are barred from taking part in active party politics and may not stand for election to 
Parliament. To the extent that they exercise public power, traditional authorities are fully bound 
by Ghana&#8217;s international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The chieftaincy system 
</b></p>
<p>8. The chieftaincy system is hierarchically organized and composed of a diverse group of 
tribal kings, paramount chiefs, chiefs and sub-chiefs. Some traditional authorities are illiterate 
men operating entirely on the basis of experience and the teachings of oral tradition, others are 
university educated professionals. Although the customary system recognizes certain female 
authorities and grants them a limited degree of authority, virtually all chiefs in Ghana are men.<b>4</b> 
Deriving their legitimacy from a claim to tradition, traditional authorities tend to be socially 
conservative, putting respect for local custom before gender equality. 
</p>
<p>9. While the status of the customary system varies between localities, traditional authorities 
generally wield considerable influence. In many rural areas, tribal chiefs administer communal 
and tribal land rights. Chiefs and the council of elders also serve as arbitrators in disputes, 
including smaller criminal cases and family conflicts, since they are more easily accessible than 
the State courts, charge smaller fees and have the social clout to enforce decisions. In addition, 
traditional authorities deal with all matters supposedly involving supernatural interference 
(e.g. witchcraft). The State authorities are usually not in a position to resolve such matters. 
</p>
<p>10. Some chiefs may even get involved in serious crimes, such as rape or defilement of 
minors, and broker settlements between families. This illegal usurpation of State power may 
result in impunity for perpetrators and neglect of victim support. Nevertheless, local State 
officials are often unwilling to challenge these chiefs, since the balance of power is often tilted 
against the State. In some of the rural districts, for instance, local police officers explained to me 
that they would always seek the local chief&#8217;s permission before launching an investigation into a 
reported crime.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Customary law 
</b></p>
<p>11. Custom is recognized by the Constitution as a source of law. It is applied by customary 
authorities as well as by State courts, unless it is found to violate the Constitution. Customary 
law is also subject to statute law. Therefore, while it discriminates against women, especially in 
areas of inheritance and property, where statute law provides for a particular matter, it cannot 
override that provision.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Inheritance 
</b></p>
<p>12. According to the traditional doctrine of customary law, the proceeds of the joint efforts of a 
man, his wife and children and any property acquired from these proceeds are considered to be 
the individual property of the man. Therefore, a woman was not entitled to a share in her 
husband&#8217;s estate if he died intestate<b>6</b> until the enactment of the Intestate Succession Law of 1985 
(PNDC Law 111), which legally overrides customary law. In practice, particularly rural families 
and traditional authorities intervening in inheritance disputes often do not know, or deliberately 
disregard the statutory law and apply the discriminatory customary norms instead. Even State 
officials are sometimes insufficiently informed about the contents of the Intestate Succession 
Law, which distributes estates on the basis of a very complex formula between the deceased 
man&#8217;s wife/wives, his children, other family members and customary law heirs.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Consequences of divorce 
</b></p>
<p>13. Women who are going through a divorce find themselves in an even weaker legal position 
than widows, because of the discrepancy between customary law and statutory law. The 
Matrimonial Causes Act 1971 (Act 367) foresees a separation of property between the spouses. 
Since customary law presumes that all property acquired during marriage is the sole property of 
the husband, women are often deprived of an equitable share of the marital property, when they 
divorce. An exception applies if a woman can prove that she made a &#8220;substantial contribution&#8221; to 
the acquisition or maintenance of the property. However, the Government clarified in writing 
</p>

<p><b>5
</b>  Preliminary comments of the Government of Ghana on my report, 18 January 2008 (hereafter 
</p>
<p>Preliminary comments of the GOG). 
<b>6
</b>  This position was explicitly upheld by judgement of the High Court in <i>Quartey v. Martey</i> 
</p>
<p>(1959) Ghana L. Rep. 377, which was handed down before the Intestate Succession Law was 
enacted. This doctrine is followed by both patrilineal and matrilineal communities. In patrilineal 
groups, the inheritance passes to the deceased man&#8217;s own descendants. In the Akan-speaking 
matrilineal groups, where descent is determined through the mother, the inheritance passes from 
the deceased husband to the closest living male descendant of his mother, i.e. the deceased man&#8217;s 
maternal brother, the son of his maternal sister or the son of the deceased mother&#8217;s sister. 
<b>7
</b>  Note that the Intestate Succession Law does not apply to distribution of business assets. </p>

</p>
<p>that the provisions of Act 367 apply to either party in the marriage. Accordingly, as per 
section 20 (1) of the Act, the Court &#8220;may order either party to the marriage to pay to the other 
party a sum of money or convey to the other party movable or immovable property as settlement 
of property rights or in lieu thereof or as part of financial provisions that the Court thinks just 
and equitable&#8221;.<b>8</b> The Government noted that the shortcoming of the Act is that it applies 
principally to monogamous marriages. Therefore, while section 41 (2) of the Act makes the Act 
applicable to non-monogamous marriages including customary law marriage, the Act allows 
customary law to be applied.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The 1992 Constitution recognizes the shortcomings of the legal status quo and requires 
Parliament to enact, as soon as practicable, legislation on the property rights of spouses to ensure 
that spouses have equal access to property jointly acquired during marriage and that such 
property is equitably distributed between the spouses upon dissolution of the marriage. At the 
time of my visit - 15 years after the Constitution entered into force - no such law had been 
passed. 
</p>
<p>15. The property of spouses bill, prepared by the Minister of Justice, would substantially 
improve the legal status quo. According to the bill, divorce courts distributing marital property 
are to take into account the contributions &#8220;in cash or kind&#8221; made by each spouse. At a minimum, 
each spouse is to receive one third of the property acquired during the marriage. The bill would 
apply to all marriages, including polygamous customary marriages and de facto unions (common 
law marriages). 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Review of customs 
</b></p>
<p>16. In view of the shortcomings of customary law, the Constitution mandates the National 
House of Chiefs, a deliberative body bringing together paramount chiefs from all regions, to 
&#8220;undertake an evaluation of traditional customs and usages with a view to eliminating those 
customs and usages that are outmoded and socially harmful&#8221;.<b>10</b> So far, the House of Chiefs has 
failed to launch a genuine effort to bring the customary law in line with statutory law, the 
Constitution and Ghana&#8217;s international obligations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  The Government noted that the effectiveness of the provisions in Act 367 ensuring fairness to 
</p>
<p>a female spouse has been proven in a number of cases; in particular, it referred to the case of 
<i>Ribeiro v. Ribeiro</i> (No. 2) (1989-90), GLR SC 130 (Preliminary comments of the GOG).

</p>
<p><b>II.  STATUS OF WOMEN IN GHANA 
</b></p>
<p>17. Ghana is an ethnically, linguistically, culturally and religiously heterogeneous society, 
resulting in variations of social convention.<b>11</b> There are also considerable economic disparities 
between the coastal regions and the marginalized northern parts of the country. However, the 
strong patriarchal normative framework, discussed above, and the family structure favour men 
over women in both matrilineal and patrilineal communities. Although social attitudes are 
gradually changing, especially in urban settings, women continue to occupy a subordinate 
position to men in virtually every domain of life.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The institutions of family and marriage 
</b></p>
<p>18. The male head of household model prevails, which makes all domestic chores the 
exclusive responsibility of women and girls. Although women are more often than not the 
family&#8217;s main source of income, men are perceived as the &#8220;provider&#8221;.<b>12</b> This sexual division of 
labour corresponds to the obedience of women to male authority and their conformity to 
differential sexual norms upheld in society. In this respect, infidelity is tolerated for men, but 
constitutes a social taboo for women. Children - girls and boys - are groomed from an early age 
to internalize these stereotypical gender roles. 
</p>
<p>19. Unequal gender relations are sustained by discriminatory marriage practices and marital 
relations. Marriage entailing the transfer of the bride from one family to the other is perceived 
as a contract binding two families. In all ethnic groups, the groom&#8217;s family pays a dowry 
(money, goods or livestock) to the bride&#8217;s family, which leads some men to believe that they 
own their wife. 
</p>
<p>20. In some cases, particularly in the three northern regions, young women and girls are 
exchanged between families to offset dowry payments. Almost by definition, this practice 
involves a forced marriage for both the bride and the groom; therefore, from the start, seeds of 
conflict and potential violence are sown into the matrimonial union. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  According to the Ghana Living Standards Survey (Fourth Round 2000) heads of households 
</p>
<p>are: 52.6 per cent Akan-speakers (including Asante and Fanti); 12.4 per cent Ewe; 10.2 per cent 
Ga-Adangbe; 3.8 per cent Dagomba; 3.2 per cent Guan; 2.7 per cent Dagarti; 1.9 per cent 
Grussi/Frafra; 1.3 per cent Hausa; and 11.9 per cent other groups. Of heads of households, 
72.8 per cent belong to a Christian denomination and a minority are Muslims (11.8 per cent), 
although they account for nearly 60 per cent of households in the Northern Region. Only 
7.8 per cent of all persons surveyed indicated that they profess a traditional African religion, 
but many Ghanaians who identify with the Christian or Muslim faith also follow traditional 
belief systems. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  The Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2003 indicated that 51.4 per cent of all 
married/cohabiting women had cash earnings that met over half of all household expenditures. 
At the same time, 40.9 per cent of all married/cohabiting women reported that their husband 
decided on large household purchases. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>21. Polygamy is another practice that entrenches women&#8217;s subordinate position.<b>13</b> According 
to the 2006 Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS Survey), more than one in five 
women (21.6 per cent) aged 15-49 years lived in a polygamous union. Polygamy is particularly 
prevalent in the three northern regions, where close to 40 per cent of women live in polygamy.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The Children&#8217;s Act of 1998 sets 18 as the minimum age for marriage and criminalizes 
child marriages. However, child and early marriages continue to be performed, because the law 
is not adequately enforced. This compromises girls&#8217; development and undermines their ability to 
negotiate unequal power relations to their advantage. Girls married at younger ages are more 
likely to drop out of school, are socially more isolated and less assertive in pursuing their 
sexual, reproductive and other rights. According to the 2006 MICS Survey, more than one in 
four married women (25.9 per cent) were under 18 when they married and 4.4 per cent were 
under 15. The same survey showed that 2.1 per cent of married women aged 15-19 years (i.e. the 
age group that should have enjoyed the protection of the 1998 Act) entered into marriage before 
they were 15. Since these marriages are unregistered, the women also lack access to non-penal 
forms of legal redress. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>23. Ghana still has a considerable way to go to fulfil the second and third Millennium 
Development Goals, which call for the achievement of universal primary education and gender 
equality, including at all levels of education. In 2005, the net enrolment in primary education 
stood at only 65 per cent for boys and girls alike. A wide gender gap emerges from the early 
stages of the schooling cycle, because far more girls than boys drop out of primary school. 
In 2005, only 69 per cent of girls who enrolled completed the full course of primary education 
(compared to 75 per cent of boys). The trend continues in secondary school, where the 2005 net 
enrolment rate was 37 per cent for boys and 30 per cent for girls.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  Ghanaian Family Law recognizes three distinct forms of marriage: civil marriage, marriage 
</p>
<p>under customary law and Islamic marriage registered under the Marriage of Mohammedans 
Ordinance. Customary law entitles a man to have several wives, but a woman may not have 
multiple husbands. The Marriage of Mohammedans Ordinance allows Muslim men to have up to 
four wives. In practice, many polygamous marriages are never formally registered and spouses 
live in de facto unions (common law marriages). The Government, however, has indicated that 
registration is not a prerequisite of legality; once all the required customary rites are performed a 
marriage is considered legal (Preliminary comments of the GOG). 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  2006 MICS Survey figures: Upper West Region: 44.4 per cent; Northern Region: 
39.5 per cent, Upper East Region: 39.3 per cent.

</p>
<p>24. High levels of extreme poverty continue to be a major obstacle to achieving universal 
education for all children, but particularly for girls. It is not surprising that the country&#8217;s poorest 
districts in northern Ghana tend to have the lowest school enrolment and retention rates. The 
Government has invested considerable funds into a capitation grant programme. This programme 
aims at freeing families from the burden of school levies imposed at the district level, while 
providing schools with a much-needed inflow of funds.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The World Food Programme (WFP) supports these laudable Government efforts through 
an on-site school feeding programme, which targets impoverished districts in the north and will 
provide 290,000 primary school children with one cooked meal a day to encourage increased 
attendance and enhance the capacity of malnourished pupils to follow the lessons. 
</p>
<p>26. These initiatives seem to have contributed to a substantial increase in enrolment. The 
Ministry of Education estimates that enrolment at the primary level in 2006/2007 has increased 
by 7.8 per cent in comparison to 2005/2006. At the junior secondary school level an 8.8 per cent 
increase was noted. In particular, the increase in the enrolment of girls in basic education was 
slightly higher than that for boys. 
</p>
<p>27. Poverty is only one aspect of the problem. High dropout rates among girls are also rooted 
in differential values attached to the education of girls and boys. Many families take their 
daughters out of school, because they see education as a mere distraction from a girl&#8217;s domestic 
responsibilities. Donors have launched innovative programmes to create incentives for families 
to keep girls in school. The WFP launched a pilot project in 2006, which provides girls in the 
late stages of primary school and in junior secondary school (i.e. girls with a high dropout risk) 
with take-home food rations if they achieve at least 85 per cent attendance. The United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has provided girls in remote areas with bicycles so that they can 
complete their morning household chores and still get to school in time. Such programmes are 
helpful, but cannot replace sustained efforts on the part of the Government, civil society and the 
international community to change the underlying discriminatory mentalities themselves. 
</p>
<p>28. Child marriage, early marriage and teenage pregnancy also contribute to high dropout rates 
among girls. Girls who become pregnant are often ridiculed by their peers and shamed into 
dropping out. Some districts also seem to have adopted a policy to suspend pregnant girls from 
schools to deter pregnancy among other girls. Officials at the central Government level assured 
me that the suspension of pregnant girls, which constitutes a blatant violation of their human 
right to education, is contrary to official education policy.<b>17</b>

</b>  According to reports, the grant unfortunately does not always cover indirect school expenses 
</p>
<p>such as the cost of a school uniform. 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  There have been other instances of blatant gender discrimination by local officials. During my 
visit, reports emerged that the authorities at the St. Louis Training College in Kumasi had lined 
up 630 female teacher trainees and subjected them to an intimate search, due to a suspicion that 
one of them might have recently had an abortion. </p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>29. The labour market participation among Ghanaian women, including married women and 
women with children, is very high and practically at the same level as that of men. According to 
the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey, 75.1 per cent of women and 75.6 per cent of men in 
Ghana were employed. It is also noteworthy that women seem to have considerable autonomy 
over the use of their earnings. Nearly three in four women surveyed (73 per cent) stated that they 
are solely responsible for decisions on the use of their earnings, which they generally contribute 
to family sustenance and the care of their children. Remarkably, more rural women than urban 
women reported to have full control over their earnings. 
</p>
<p>30. The labour market, however, remains strongly segregated by gender. Whereas women 
work mainly in sales and services, including as self-employed traders, men are primarily 
employed in agriculture and public sector jobs. The gender segregation also works vertically; 
women are underrepresented in better paying skilled posts. Three times as many men as women 
work as professional, technical or managerial staff (10 per cent v. 3 per cent), while 23 per cent 
of employed men and 16 per cent of employed women undertake skilled manual labour. 
</p>
<p>31. All of the above results in a large wage gap, where women earn about 29 per cent less than 
men.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Public decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>32. Women are heavily underrepresented among public decision-makers. Ghana, 
with 10.9 per cent female parliamentarians, ranks 89th of 189 in the Inter-Parliamentary Union&#8217;s 
ranking of women in national Parliaments.<b>19</b> Female parliamentarians I spoke with highlighted 
difficulties in accessing campaign funding and made the criticism that female candidates were 
rarely fielded in voting districts where their own political party was likely to win. At the district 
level, women&#8217;s representation also stands at only about 10 per cent, despite the fact that a third 
of district assembly members are directly appointed by the President. 
</p>
<p>33. The situation is slightly better in the executive and in the judiciary. Six out of 40 members 
of Cabinet (15 per cent) and about 17 per cent of judges are women. In June 2007, for the first 
time in the country&#8217;s history, a woman was appointed as Chief Justice. 
</p>
<p>34. The Cabinet has approved Affirmative Action Policy Guidelines which call for an increase 
to 40 per cent in the representation of women in key positions in public service, in the national 
executive and in policymaking institutions. These guidelines are not binding and there is little 
concerted effort to implement the 40 per cent target.

<p><b>III.  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Physical and sexual abuse in the family 
</b></p>
<p>35. Physical abuse by the husband or other intimate partner is widespread. While there is a 
lack of up-to-date data, 72 per cent of respondents to a 1998 survey reported that wife beating 
was a common practice in their community.<b>20</b> Results of another survey published the following 
year indicated that one third (33 per cent) of all women were experiencing physical violence at 
the hands of current or previous partners at the time of the survey.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>36. The use of violence to enforce patriarchal control over women enjoys widespread social 
acceptance. According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey, 19.8 per cent of men and an 
even more astonishing 34 per cent of women consider it acceptable for a husband to beat his 
wife, if she goes out without telling him. Women are often expected to silently endure abuse 
&#8220;to protect their family&#8221;. Women who report their husbands or other family members to the 
authorities may be ostracized. 
</p>
<p>37. There is also a widespread belief that a husband is entitled to sexual intercourse from his 
wife at his behest and may enforce this entitlement by force. According to the 2003 Survey, 
10.1 per cent of men and 19.9 per cent of women considered it justified if a husband beat his 
wife for refusing to have sex with him. Ghanaian law, which for so long explicitly protected this 
male prerogative, has been amended. The Statute Law Revision Commissioner, in exercise of his 
powers under the laws of Ghana to remove unconstitutional provisions, removed section 42 (g) 
from the Criminal Offences Act, 1960, (Act 29), whereby a married woman was deemed to have 
given her blanket consent to her husband using force in sexual relations, thereby preventing the 
prosecution of marital rape.<b>22</b> According to the Government, current laws in Ghana do not 
support rape in marriage.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Harmful attitudes towards women are reinforced by certain religious and other community 
leaders, who exhort women to stand by their husband under all circumstances, while at the same 
time failing to take a clear stand against wife battery and marital rape. 
</p>
<p>39. Reports also indicate that rape of underage girls committed by men within the family 
circle, including brothers, fathers, stepfathers and other &#8220;fatherly figures&#8221;, is a big problem, 
although there is no reliable data on the exact size of the problem.

</p>
<p>40. Unlike wife beating and marital rape, society does not condone incest. Yet, families will 
often try to cover up the crime to avoid shame, rather than ensure that the perpetrator is punished 
and the child protected from further harm. Tanya, a girl from the Eastern Region, for instance, 
was 14 years old when her father raped her on repeated occasions and injured her severely.<b>24</b> 
Tanya&#8217;s stepmother refused to help her, but she was able to report the assault to the police with 
the help of a neighbour. Tanya&#8217;s family pressured her to drop the complaint, telling her that she 
was possessed by demons that would turn her into an adult woman at night and make her seduce 
her own father. When she refused, she was ejected from the home. 
41. A practice known as <i>tazaba</i> (direct translation: sister in bed) is reportedly still practised in 
some communities in Bongo District, Upper East Region. A daughter of a man without any sons 
is given to a paternal cousin to produce a male heir for the family name. The girl does not marry 
her cousin (who may already have a wife) and any son born from that relationship is considered 
to belong to the family of the girl&#8217;s father. After giving birth to a son, the girl is freed and may 
get married, but due to the stigma of single motherhood it is unlikely that she will find a 
husband.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ritual servitude and sexual abuse 
</b></p>
<p>42. Some communities in the southern Volta Region and certain districts of the Greater Accra 
Region still practise an outlawed custom, which involves ritual servitude and sexual exploitation 
of girls. The custom requires a family to offer a virgin daughter as a <i>trokosi <b></b></i><b>26</b> to a traditional 
fetish shrine to ward off the punishment of the gods for crimes or moral wrongdoings committed 
by a family member. The misdeeds for which atonement is sought may often date back 
generations. One former <i>trokosi,</i> for instance, told me that her family gave her to a fetish shrine 
when she was 8 years old, because her great-grandfather had failed to repay a debt and 
subsequently family members had started to die from seemingly mysterious causes. 
</p>
<p>43. A girl designated to become a <i>trokosi </i>is usually committed at a very young age 
(6 to 10 years old) to the shrine, where an initiation ritual betrothing the girl to the gods is 
performed. The ritual establishes a relationship of spiritual bondage between the girl and the 
shrine. From the moment of her betrothal, the <i>trokosi</i> must wear special insignia indicating her status and outsiders are prohibited from having any sexual contact with the girl. If a man sleeps 
with a <i>trokosi</i>, his family is believed to have incurred the wrath of the gods, therefore, must also 
offer a virgin daughter to the shrine. Meanwhile, the girl with whom the man had sexual 
relations is ritually &#8220;purified&#8221; and remains a <i>trokosi </i>at the shrine.<b> 
</b></p>

<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  The Ewe word <i>trokosi</i> can be translated as &#8220;slave to the gods&#8221; or alternatively as &#8220;wife to the 
gods&#8221;. The practice is thought to have originated in the seventeenth century as a means to attract 
the support of the gods, especially in times of crisis and war. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>44. In addition to performing ritual duties and domestic chores at the shrine, a <i>trokosi</i> is 
usually also expected to work long hours on farmland belonging to the shrine. She does not 
receive anything in return for her labour and her family is required to provide her with food and 
all other necessities. 
</p>
<p>45. Once a <i>trokosi</i> reaches puberty, the shrine&#8217;s fetish priest (<i>tronua</i>) is entitled to sleep with 
the girl to consummate the marriage between her and the gods. Groomed from a very young age 
into accepting their servitude at the shrine, the girls are not in a position to refuse. Daughters 
born from such sexual relations also have certain obligations to the shrine. 
</p>
<p>46. After serving several years at the shrine, a <i>trokosi </i>may be released from servitude if her 
family pays for a special ceremony, but she will retain a relationship with the shrine and continue 
to perform certain rituals there. Released <i>trokosi </i>are allowed to marry, but are often unable to 
find a husband. If a <i>trokosi</i> dies, her family is expected to replace her with another girl and the 
cycle of ritual servitude and exploitation recommences. 
</p>
<p>47. In 1998, the Government passed a law against ritual servitude (among other things), 
criminalizing the practice of <i>trokosi</i>, although there have been no prosecutions under the law. 
Government officials were under the impression that the practice had since almost vanished. 
Information obtained from other sources indicates that the practice continues to thrive. 
Reportedly, there are at least 23 shrines in the Volta Region and 3 in the Greater Accra Region 
which still accept <i>trokosi</i>.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>48. In many districts, the local authorities are reluctant to enforce the law against ritual 
servitude, fearing a popular backlash. Some also seem to fear adverse spiritual consequences for 
themselves. While a number of national authorities, including the Commission on Human Rights 
and Administrative Justice and the Ministry for Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs have taken a 
strong stance against the practice of <i>trokosi</i>, there are many other elected politicians who fail to 
publicly denounce it in order not to alienate key constituencies.

after which they might continue the practice. </p>

</p>
<p>49. Certain intellectuals defend <i>trokosi </i>as an indigenous religious tradition that provides girls 
with a form of apprenticeship. None of the former <i>trokosi</i>, with whom I have spoken, shared this 
view. One 17-year-old girl, the daughter of a <i>trokosi</i> and a fetish priest who had herself served in 
a shrine, asked me why only girls and not boys had to suffer to atone for the misdeeds of their 
families. 
</p>
<p>50. International Needs Ghana (ING) and other non-governmental organizations have led 
efforts to liberate <i>trokosi</i> and put an end to the practice. According to ING&#8217;s own estimates 
3,500 girls have so far been liberated and 50 shrines have stopped accepting <i>trokosi</i>. ING seeks 
to liberate <i>trokosi</i> with the cooperation and consent of affected communities. Communities 
willing to cooperate are provided with much needed development infrastructure such as schools 
and boreholes. Fetish priests and shrine owners are encouraged to accept livestock or monetary 
donations, instead of girls, from families seeking to appease the gods. Once liberation is agreed, 
a ritual will be performed to break the spiritual bondage tying the <i>trokosi</i> to the shrine. Liberated 
<i>trokosi</i> are provided with the skills to reintegrate into ordinary life at the ING Vocational 
Training Centre, which is also open to other girls and women from affected communities. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Female genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p>51. Female genital mutilation (FGM) has been traditionally practised by several ethnic groups 
from northern Ghana. Victims can also be found among immigrants from neighbouring 
countries, where FGM is highly prevalent.<b> </b>UNICEF has estimated that 5.4 per cent of all women 
in Ghana aged 15-49 have been subjected to FGM.<b>28</b> 
52. In 1994, Ghana criminalized the practice. Since then, successful prosecutions of those 
performing FGM have been reported from the Upper West and Upper East Regions. In 2007, 
Parliament further strengthened the law against FGM by increasing the maximum penalty to 
10 years of imprisonment and extending the range of persons who can be prosecuted for 
involvement in an act of FGM. Officials at all levels of Government, including the President, 
have also publicly condemned FGM. 
</p>
<p>53. While there are indications that the practice of FGM in Ghana may be declining, new cases 
continue to be reported. Civil society organizations and medical practitioners note that FGM is 
increasingly performed on younger girls, who are less likely to resist or report the crime. Some 
families apparently also send their daughters abroad to have the procedure carried out. The fact 
that in some neighbouring countries FGM is not criminalized or the legislation against it is not 
enforced, and since Ghanaian law does not apply extraterritorially, makes it difficult for the 
Ghanaian authorities to take action, even if they find out about such cases. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/FGM-C_final_10_October.pdf. Any procedure 
involving partial or total removal or other injury of the external female genital organ for cultural, 
religious or other non-therapeutic reasons and causing physical and/or psychological harm must 
be regarded as FGM, regardless of the methods used and conditions under which it is carried out. </p>

</p>
<p><b>D.  Girl domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>54. Ghanaian law sets the minimum age for formal and informal employment at 15, although 
children are permitted to engage in &#8220;light work&#8221; from the age of 13, provided that it does not 
harm their health or development, or school attendance and the capacity to benefit from 
schoolwork. Children under 18 are not allowed to undertake certain types of hazardous labour 
and are prohibited from working at night. Yet harmful child labour remains a problem. A 2004 
International Labour Office (ILO) study estimated that about 11 per cent of school-age children 
in Ghana and 56.5 per cent of rural school-age children in northern Ghana are engaged in some 
form of labour.<b>29</b> A World Bank paper on child labour in Ghana found that girls were more likely 
than boys to engage in harmful forms of labour.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>55. Many rural families living in extreme poverty send their daughters to urban areas to live 
with more affluent families, where they serve as domestic workers in exchange for shelter, food 
and sometimes a minimal income. The ILO found that most child domestic workers started their 
work between the ages of 11 and 16 and worked 8 to 12 hours per day without sufficient rest, 
which would imply that they are engaged in one of the worst forms of child labour as defined by 
ILO Convention No. 182.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  <i>Kayaye</i> street girls 
</b></p>
<p>56. Girls also migrate on their own from impoverished areas in the north to the big urban 
centres in the south, where they work in the markets and streets as head load carriers (<i>kayaye</i>), 
informal petty traders or in other menial jobs. Most of the girls are only 10-14 years old when 
they first migrate and some are even younger. The girls, an estimated 90 per cent of whom are 
illiterate, typically migrate to escape extreme poverty and a lack of opportunities. Many girls 
also see the <i>kayaye</i> experience as an opportunity to acquire the items they will need in order to 
get married later on in life. 
</p>
<p>57. Family problems, including exploitation and abuse, are often additional factors pushing 
girls to leave their homes. In accordance with local culture, some children are sent to live with 
paternal or maternal relatives, who were traditionally meant to foster family solidarity and 
kinship ties. However, with the erosion of social convention, today these children are often 
exploited and abused by their relatives. Amina from Tamale, for instance, was 6 years old when 
she was sent to live with an aunt, who made her sell food in the local market. If she sold well, 
she would receive food, if not she would be beaten. When she was 8 years old, she stole a small

<p>amount of money from her aunt and took the bus to Kumasi (Ashanti Region) to work as a 
<i>kayaye</i>. Disappointed by the little money she made in Kumasi, she returned to Tamale only to 
head south again to Accra when she was 10 years old. 
</p>
<p>58. The girls seem mostly to migrate on their own, encouraged by their peers and often with 
the knowledge of their family. Some reports indicate that organized networks increasingly 
approach impoverished families to recruit girls. 
</p>
<p>59. Once they arrive in the urban centres, the <i>kayaye </i>work and live under dangerous and 
miserable conditions. They usually live on the streets, having to pay owners of wooden market 
stalls for a place with a roof to spend the night. Being vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, they 
often have to seek the &#8220;protection&#8221; of older street boys in exchange for sex. As a result many end 
up getting pregnant outside marriage and are often ostracized when they return to the north as 
single mothers. Some girls occasionally prostitute themselves to add to their earnings, which 
increases the prejudices they encounter once they return home. 
60. Girls Growth and Development (GIGDEV) in Tamale is a civil society organization that 
helps former <i>kayaye</i> integrate back into society, by providing them with vocational training and 
basic education. Fatima, 18 years old, is one of the girls taking part in GIGDEV&#8217;s programme. 
She told me that she had to live with her aunt after her mother and grandmother had died, 
because her father was unwilling to take responsibility for her. The aunt exploited and abused 
Fatima, and at the age of 10 she migrated to Accra to work as a <i>kayaye</i> in the Agbogboloshie 
wholesale market. When she was 14, her boyfriend, a fellow street boy, raped her and she 
became pregnant. She gave birth and returned to the north. Fatima is learning to sew at GIGDEV 
and wants to buy a sewing machine with a microcredit loan. 
</p>
<p>61. Some girls abandon <i>kayaye</i> work altogether and are fully drawn into Ghana&#8217;s growing 
child prostitution sector, which increasingly also seems to cater to foreign child sex tourists. 
Girls have reportedly also been trafficked and subjected to commercial sexual exploitation in 
other West African countries and Western Europe. While the Government has reacted by 
adopting a comprehensive Human Trafficking Act in 2005, still more needs to be done to 
enforce the Act and strengthen Ghana&#8217;s anti-trafficking cooperation with other countries. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Women accused of witchcraft 
</b></p>
<p>62. There are many cases, in which women - and occasionally men - are accused of practising 
witchcraft to bring harm to members of their family or community. 
</p>
<p>63. Belief in supernatural forces is deeply rooted in Ghanaian culture and still widely held, 
especially in rural areas and among the less educated. Being accused of practising witchcraft is 
therefore a very serious charge that can have grave consequences. Accused women are often 
driven violently from their homes and communities, physically assaulted and, in extreme cases, 
also murdered. 
</p>
<p>64. Despite its serious ramifications, an accusation of witchcraft can be easily triggered. 
A community member may dream that a certain woman is a witch or an adverse event occurs in 
the community that cannot be explained, such as a suspicious or unexpected death of a 
community member. Negative human sentiments such as jealousy or the desire to find a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>scapegoat are also at the base of witchcraft allegations. In some cases, witchcraft allegations 
seem to be deliberately directed at women who are successful and are seen as a threat to the 
patriarchal order. 
</p>
<p>65. Therefore, while any woman can potentially be accused of being a witch, the victims of 
those accusations who suffer the most serious consequences are almost always elderly women, 
who lack family protection and do not have the power to defend themselves against their 
accusers. 
</p>
<p>66. Violence against women branded as witches is reported from all regions, but the issue is 
more visible in the north due to the existence of so-called &#8220;witches&#8217; camps&#8221;. This misleading 
term refers to settlements established with the consent of the local community, where women 
accused of witchcraft can seek refuge and protection from persecution by their own community 
or family. In that sense, a witches&#8217; camp is a protection mechanism comparable to a women&#8217;s 
shelter. In some cases, family members may also join the accused at the witches&#8217; camp. 
67. During the course of my visit, I visited the settlement in Gambaga (East Mamprusi District, 
Northern Region), which is officially called the Gambaga Outcast Home.<b>32</b> Its origins are said to 
date back to around 1900, when a local Imam took pity on women accused of witchcraft and 
provided them with refuge. Eventually, the local chief (the <i>Gambarana</i>) assumed this protective 
role. The <i>Gambarana</i> is thought to be vested with the special spiritual power to determine 
whether a woman is a witch or not. It is also believed that he can purify witches and extinguish 
their supernatural powers. 
</p>
<p>68. Around 80 women, aged between 40 and 70, live at the Gambaga Outcast Home, which is 
a compound of thatched huts situated adjacent to the village. Some women have lived in 
Gambaga for more than 20 years, because their community or family steadfastly refused their 
return. The local population in Gambaga is not afraid to live and interact with these women, 
since tradition holds that the local gods neutralize a witch&#8217;s power to practise her craft once she 
comes to Gambaga. Nevertheless, a certain stigma remains and women accused of witchcraft can 
usually only engage in certain limited income-generating activities such as firewood collection. 
Since they also lack the support of their own family, the women are completely destitute. 
</p>
<p>69. The Gambaga Outcast Home Project, an exemplary initiative, provides support to women 
and facilitates their reintegration into their home communities. Since the convictions of the local 
population about witchcraft are very strong, the project does not question the very notion of 
witchcraft, but tries to address the social and the spiritual dimensions of each individual case. 
Aisha, 47, is one of the women supported by the project. She had to flee to Gambaga, when a 
woman from her community dreamt that she was a witch and subsequently died from a 
seemingly inexplicable cause. Community members severely beat her and her husband, when he

</b>  In the Northern Region, &#8220;witches&#8217; camps&#8221; have also been established with the consent of the 
</p>
<p>local community in Gnaani (Yendi District), Gushiegu Town, Kpatinga, Naboli (all Gushiegu 
District) and Kukuo (Bimbilla District). Women accused of witchcraft often also flee to urban 
areas, where the allegations levelled against them are not known. </p>

</p>
<p>tried to protect her. They burned her house and threatened to kill her. When she came to 
Gambaga, the <i>Gambarana</i> determined that she was indeed a witch and should, at least for the 
moment, not return to her community. 
</p>
<p>70. After intense negotiations, the project staff managed to convince Aisha&#8217;s home community 
to rebuild Aisha&#8217;s house and allow her to occasionally visit her husband. The <i>Gambarana</i> has 
supported the reintegration process by performing a ritual to free the bewitched soul of the 
woman who supposedly died from Aisha&#8217;s alleged witchcraft. At the time of my visit, another 
ritual was being planned to fully remove Aisha&#8217;s supposed witchcraft powers and reconcile her 
with her community. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Situation of widows 
</b></p>
<p>71. While the customary law denies women a right to inherit, it obliges the heirs of the 
deceased to maintain his widow and children. In many cases, however, not even this 
obligation is respected and widows are evicted from their homes by those invoking customary 
inheritance rights. The Intestate Succession Law seeks to protect widows against eviction by 
making it a criminal offense to evict a widow or her children from the family home within the 
first six months of the husband&#8217;s death. Unfortunately, this protective norm is often wrongly 
interpreted as permitting evictions after six months have passed. 
</p>
<p>72. Several communities also still practise levirate marriage/widow inheritance, requiring the 
widow to marry (formally or informally) her late husband&#8217;s brother. In other communities, the 
woman is &#8220;inherited&#8221; by one of the sons born to another wife of the deceased husband. These 
marriages are more than a social support arrangement for the widow, since the man is permitted 
to have sexual relations with the widow.<b>33</b> Nevertheless, women are in no position to refuse. If 
they do they may be violently ejected from their homes and left destitute. 
73. Reports also indicate that some communities still practise humiliating and sometimes 
outright cruel widowhood rites. These rites often seek to determine whether the woman had been 
faithful to her late husband. The Widows and Orphans Ministry in Bolgatanga (Upper East 
Region) has documented a number of these practices and successfully engaged communities in 
awareness-raising initiatives to abolish humiliating and violent rites. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  Children born from such relationships are considered to belong to the dead husband and are 
</p>
<p>therefore often neglected by the natural father. </p>

<p><b>IV.  STATE RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic Violence Act 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Domestic Violence Act was adopted by the Ghanaian Parliament in May 2007,<b>34</b> after 
three years of extensive consultations with stakeholders and sometimes heated public debate. 
Following a broad and gender-neutral definition of domestic violence, the Act criminalizes 
physical, sexual and psychological abuse, intimidation, threats and harassment between spouses 
and other intimate partners, former partners, family members and co-tenants. 
</p>
<p>75. In section 1 (b) (iii) the Act also criminalizes &#8220;economic abuse&#8221; in the domestic 
relationship, which is defined as the &#8220;deprivation or threatened deprivation of economic or 
financial resources which a person is entitled to by law, the disposition or threatened disposition 
of moveable or immovable property in which another person has a material interest and hiding or 
hindering the use of property or damaging or destroying property in which another person has a 
material interest&#8221;. In the context of the extreme poverty prevailing in Ghana, practices such as 
property grabbing can have serious consequences beyond physical and sexual violence and it is 
appropriate to specifically criminalize such acts. 
</p>
<p>76. Furthermore, the Act stipulates that the use of violence in the domestic setting is not 
justified on the basis of consent, thereby ensuring that the crime of marital rape can now be 
prosecuted in Ghanaian courts. 
</p>
<p>77. Courts now also have the power to issue protection orders. Among other things, courts may 
order a perpetrator of domestic violence to seek counselling or treatment, pay his victim&#8217;s 
medical expenses, and relocate from the common domicile, while continuing to pay rent. If a 
protection order is breached, courts are to impose fines and/or imprisonment of up to two years. 
</p>
<p>78. Criminal sanctions - monetary fines or imprisonment - against a perpetrator of domestic 
violence may have a negative impact on the entire family (to the extent that the perpetrator had 
actually assumed his maintenance and support duties). Therefore, the Act allows courts to refer 
cases of non-aggravated domestic violence to settlement by an alternative dispute resolution 
method. The Act stipulates several safeguards seeking to ensure that &#8220;settlement&#8221; does not 
equate to impunity and revictimization. Both perpetrator and victim must attend counselling and, 
where necessary, the accused must seek psychiatric help. In addition, the courts are to appoint a 
probation officer. 
</p>
<p>79. I welcome the plans of the Ministry for Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs to develop a 
comprehensive domestic violence action plan in consultation with other stakeholders. In order to 
ensure its effectiveness, the action plan must be guided by empirical facts and gender analysis 
and prioritize the two most prevalent forms of domestic violence: violence against women and 
violence against children, particularly the girl child. In addition, an adequate budget must be 
earmarked for the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act and its action plan.

</b>  Act 732. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Capacity of the police and justice sector 
</b>80. In 2005, the Ghana police service transformed its Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU) into 
a Domestic Violence Victims Support Unit (DoVVSU) tasked to investigate all crimes involving 
domestic and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>81. DoVVSU is seriously under-resourced. At the time of my visit, it had only 66 desks and 
offices and 320 staff. Large parts of rural Ghana were not adequately covered. Moreover, it 
lacked the basic equipment to effectively investigate crimes; for instance, it only had 5 cars and 
10 motor bikes at its disposal in the entire country. In practice, this often meant that a victim of 
domestic violence has to hire a taxi, at her own expense, to take police to arrest an alleged 
perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>82. Police also require more training to fully understand the dynamics and gender dimensions 
of domestic violence and the needs of the traumatized victim. Many police officers are said to 
attempt on-the-spot settlements between perpetrator and victim, even though the Domestic 
Violence Act gives such powers only to courts, subject to specific safeguards. 
</p><p>83. Many of my interlocutors also criticized the length of judicial proceedings. Domestic 
violence cases are often adjourned several times, until victims run out of courage or funds to 
pursue their case. In our discussions, the Chief Justice acknowledged this problem. Apart from 
additional efforts to reform the overburdened justice system, she suggested that courts reserve 
special days to swiftly deal with cases involving domestic violence in a comprehensive manner. 
</p>
<p>84. There are also problems with the data compiled by law enforcement authorities. For 
instance, statistics kept by DoVVSU reflect only the types of reported crimes, without indicating 
the victim&#8217;s sex and her/his relationship to the perpetrator. Such data<b> </b>is virtually meaningless, 
especially considering the gender neutral definition of domestic violence in the Domestic 
Violence Act.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Victim support and protection 
</b></p>
<p>85. Section 7 of the Domestic Violence Act requires the police to provide victims of domestic 
violence with the protection the circumstances of each case requires. Yet, there are almost no 
facilities to physically protect women at risk of violence. In the whole country, there is only one 
women&#8217;s shelter, which is operated by the non-governmental Ark Foundation and relies 
exclusively on donor funds. Police often have no choice but to keep women, who have to flee 
from their home but have nowhere else to go, overnight in the police station, before sending 
them back to the abusive environment the next day. 
</p>
<p>86. Under section 8 (4) of the Act, victims are legally entitled to free medical treatment 
provided by the State in case of emergency or a life-threatening situation, but this norm is not 
implemented. Instead, State hospitals and doctors charge a fee of 15-30 new cedis (about 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>35
</b>  See my thematic report on indicators on violence against women and State response

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.3

</p>
<p>US$ 15-30) to issue a medical certificate confirming the abuse. Victims, who are not covered by 
the Ghana National Health Insurance, have to pay this fee themselves. Unless they find a 
sympathetic medical doctor who provides the certificate free of charge, poor, uninsured women 
have to drop their criminal complaint, because they cannot afford to obtain the medical evidence 
necessary to secure a successful prosecution. 
</p>
<p>87. Many of my interlocutors also made the criticism that victims do not receive enough 
follow-up and counselling, because the Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment, which is 
the responsible body, employs too few social workers to deal with domestic violence cases. Such 
assistance is often left to dedicated non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>88. The case of 16-year-old Catherine from Accra illustrates how the combination of the 
existing shortcomings can place women at a serious risk. At the age of 14, Catherine&#8217;s father 
sexually molested her with his hand and pressured her to have intercourse with him. She refused 
and went to the police station which referred her to DoVVSU, where her statement was taken 
and an arrest warrant was given for her to take back to the police station. There, she was told that 
no cars were available and she would have to hire a taxi for the arrest warrant to be executed. 
Not being able to afford the taxi fare, Catherine dropped the case. She returned home after a 
non-governmental organization obtained assurances from the father that he would not harm her. 
Since her return, the father has physically abused her on a regular basis and has refused to pay 
for her schooling. None of her relatives, including her own mother who lives in a new 
relationship, is willing to provide her with shelter. Catherine lives under serious risk of violence, 
including rape by her father. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The realization of commitments to gender equality made under the Constitution, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), 
the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW) and the Protocol 
to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa 
remains a challenge to the Ghanaian Government and society at large, as women and girls 
continue to hold a subordinate status. The Domestic Violence Act of 2007 marks an 
important step forward, which needs to be swiftly followed by the adoption of a domestic 
violence action plan and an earmarked budget to implement the Act. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Violence against women is widespread and some groups of women are particularly 
vulnerable. The girl child may be sexually abused in the family, subjected to early or child 
marriage or exploited as a <i>kayeye </i>or domestic worker. Female genital mutilation (FGM) 
and ritual servitude of <i>trokosi</i> also remain prevalent in some parts of the country, even 
though these practices have been criminalized and are on the decrease. Some women are 
accused of practising witchcraft and driven violently from their communities. Widows are 
often deprived of their inheritance and in some places subjected to humiliating and abusive 
widowhood rites. The police, courts, social services and the health sector are not 
sufficiently equipped and trained to effectively protect women facing violence. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Constitutionally recognized traditional authorities and the customary law, which 
wield considerable influence in rural areas, often pose additional challenges for the 
advancement of women. The State authorities, civil society and the international </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>community need to engage and, where necessary, compel the customary system to fully 
respect the rights women and girls are entitled to under the Constitution and international 
law. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>High levels of poverty and the external debt burden limit the Government&#8217;s margin 
of operation to prioritize the allocation of sufficient resources for universal basic education, 
gender parity in education and the economic and social development of marginalized 
regions and districts. The international community has a responsibility to support the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to promote gender equality and eliminate violence against women 
through targeted funding and technical cooperation, further debt relief and, perhaps most 
importantly, fairer terms of trade. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In the light of my findings, I would like to make the following recommendations to the 
Government and other relevant actors: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political leadership and policy development 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Denounce publicly and unequivocally all forms of violence against women and girls 
including marital rape, wife beating, child and other forced marriages, <i>trokosi</i>, 
FGM, humiliating widowhood rites and inheritance/property grabbing. Elected 
politicians, officials, traditional authorities and other persons vested with public 
authority must not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to 
justify or condone such violence. They should also discourage the practice of 
dowry and polygamy and publicly question the existence of harmful witchcraft; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Engage traditional authorities at all levels in a frank and public dialogue, about 
how traditions and customary laws can be reformed to respect the rights of women 
guaranteed under the Constitution and international law; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure the compliance of the House of Chiefs with the constitutional mandate to 
evaluate traditional customs and practices, with a view to eliminating those that 
are outmoded and harmful, including customs that discriminate against women; 
publish and widely disseminate an annual report documenting progress made in 
this regard; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that at least 50 per cent of district assembly members appointed by the 
President are women. Political parties should adopt special temporary measures to 
enhance women&#8217;s access to leadership positions within the party and field at least 
30 per cent female candidates in &#8220;safe&#8221; voting districts that their political party is 
likely to win. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Legislative reform 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Enact, within this parliamentary term, the bill on the property rights of spouses. 
Parliament should consider amending the existing bill, so that all property 
acquired by any of the spouses during marriage (other than bequests, third party 
gifts or damages for personal suffering) is equally divided between the spouses; </b></p>
