<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>The present joint study on global practices in relation to secret detention in the context of 
countering terrorism was prepared, in the context of their respective mandates, by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (represented by its Vice-
Chair), and the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances (represented by its 
Chair). Given that the violation of rights associated with secret detention fell within their 
respective mandates, and in order to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure their complementary 
nature, the four mandate holders decided to undertake the study jointly. 
</p>
<p> In conducting the present study, the experts worked in an open, transparent manner. They 
sought inputs from all relevant stakeholders, including by sending a questionnaire to all States 
Members of the United Nations. Several consultations were held with States, and the experts 
shared their findings with all States concerned before the study was finalized. Relevant excerpts 
of the report were shared with the concerned States on 23 and 24 December 2009.  
</p>
<p> In addition to United Nations sources and the responses to the questionnaire from 44 
States, primary sources included interviews conducted with persons who had been held in secret 
detention, family members of those held captive, and legal representatives of detainees. Flight 
data were also used to corroborate information. In addition to the analysis of the policy and legal 
decisions taken by States, the aim of the study was also to illustrate, in concrete terms, what it 
means to be secretly detained, how secret detention can facilitate the practice of torture or 
inhuman and degrading treatment, and how the practice of secret detention has left an indelible 
mark on the victims, and on their families as well.  
</p>
<p> The study initially describes the international legal framework applicable to secret 
detention. At the outset, an explanation is given of the terminology used for the purpose of the 
study on what constitutes secret detention in the context of countering terrorism. The legal 
assessment concludes that secret detention is irreconcilably in violation of international human 
rights law, including during states of emergency and armed conflict. Likewise, it is in violation 
of international humanitarian law during any form of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p> Secret detention violates the right to personal liberty and the prohibition of arbitrary arrest 
or detention. No jurisdiction should allow for individuals to be deprived of their liberty in secret 
for potentially indefinite periods, held outside the reach of the law, without the possibility of 
resorting to legal procedures, including <i>habeas corpus</i>. Secret detainees are typically deprived of 
their right to a fair trial when State authorities do not intend to charge or try them. Even if 
detainees are criminally charged, the secrecy and insecurity caused by the denial of contact to the 
outside world and the fact that family members have no knowledge of their whereabouts and fate 
violate the presumption of innocence and are conducive to confessions obtained under torture or 
other forms of ill-treatment. At the same time, secret detention amounts to an enforced 
disappearance. If resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner, secret detention may even 
reach the threshold of a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p> Every instance of secret detention is by definition incommunicado detention. Prolonged 
incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or </p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 3 
 
degrading treatment or punishment, and may in itself constitute such treatment. The suffering 
caused to family members of a secretly detained (namely, disappeared) person may also amount 
to torture or other form of ill-treatment, and at the same time violates the right to the protection 
of family life. 
</p>
<p> It is not only States whose authorities keep the detainee in secret custody that are 
internationally responsible for violations of international human rights law. The practice of 
&#8220;proxy detention&#8221;, involving the transfer of a detainee from one State to another outside the 
realm of any international or national legal procedure (&#8220;rendition&#8221; or &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221;), 
often in disregard of the principle of non-refoulement, also involves the responsibility of the 
State at whose behest the detention takes place. The Geneva Conventions, applicable to all 
armed conflicts, also prohibit secret detention under any circumstances.  
</p>
<p> The study also provides an historical overview of the use of secret detention. Secret 
detention in the context of counter-terrorism is not a new phenomenon. From the Nazi regime, 
with its <i>Nacht und Nebel Erla&#223; </i>(the night and fog decree), to the former Soviet Union and its 
Gulag system of forced-labour camps, States have often resorted to secret detention to silence 
opposition.  
</p>
<p> Striking similarities can be identified in the security measures of the 1970s and 1980s used 
in Latin American countries and, in the past century, in other regions, such as Africa, Asia, 
Europe and the Middle East. 
</p>
<p> The methods used then as now consist in, inter alia, broad emergency laws, the enhanced 
role of military and special courts, the practice of torture and/or ill-treatment, kidnappings 
(renditions), enforced disappearances and, notably, secret detention. The aim is always the same: 
to have a deterrent effect, to ensure that detainees would vanish without a trace, and that no 
information would be given with regard to their whereabouts or fate. 
</p>
<p> The study then addresses the use of secret detention in the context of the so-called &#8220;global 
war on terror&#8221; in the post-11 September 2001 period. In this chapter, the experts describe the 
progressive and determined elaboration of a comprehensive and coordinated system of secret 
detention of persons suspected of terrorism, involving not only the authorities of the 
United States of America, but also of other States in almost all regions of the world. Following a 
description of the legal and policy decisions taken by the United States authorities, the experts 
give an overview of the secret detention facilities held by them. The report then enumerates 
proxy detention sites and related practices of extraordinary rendition. Various United Nations 
bodies have in the past heavily criticized the policy of extraordinary rendition in a detailed way, 
dismissing it as a clear violation of international law. They have also expressed concern about 
the use of diplomatic assurances.  
</p>
<p> The experts also address the level of involvement and complicity of a number of countries. 
For purposes of the study, they provide that a State is complicit in the secret detention of a 
person when it (a) has asked another State to secretly detain a person; (b) knowingly takes 
advantage of the situation of secret detention by sending questions to the State detaining the 
person, or solicits or receives information from persons kept in secret detention; (c) has actively 
participated in the arrest and/or transfer of a person when it knew, or ought to have known, that 
the person would disappear in a secret detention facility, or otherwise be detained outside the </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/42* 
page 4 
 
legally regulated detention system; (d) holds a person for a short time in secret detention before 
handing them over to another State where that person will be put in secret detention for a longer 
period; and (e) has failed to take measures to identify persons or airplanes that were passing 
through its airports or airspace after information of the CIA programme involving secret 
detention has already been revealed. 
</p>
<p> The study subsequently highlights the fact that secret detention in connection with 
counter-terrorism policies remains a serious problem on a global scale, through the use of secret 
detention facilities similar to those described in the study; the declaration of a state of 
emergency, which allows prolonged secret detention; or forms of &#8220;administrative detention&#8221;, 
also allowing prolonged secret detention. The cases and situations referred to, while not 
exhaustive, serve the purpose of substantiating the existence of secret detention in all regions of 
the world within the confines of the definition presented earlier. 
</p>
<p> In their conclusions, the experts reiterate that international law clearly prohibits secret 
detention, which violates a number of human rights and humanitarian law norms that may not be 
derogated from under any circumstances. If secret detention constitutes an enforced 
disappearance and is widely or systematically practiced, it may even amount to a crime against 
humanity. However, in spite of these unequivocal norms, the practice of secret detention in the 
context of countering terrorism is widespread and has been reinvigorated by the &#8220;global war on 
terror&#8221;. The evidence gathered by the experts clearly shows that many States, referring to 
concerns relating to national security - often perceived or presented as unprecedented 
emergencies or threats - resort to secret detention.  
</p>
<p> Secret detention effectively takes detainees outside the legal framework and renders 
safeguards contained in international instruments meaningless, including, importantly, that of 
<i>habeas corpus</i>. The most disturbing consequence of secret detention is, as many of the experts&#8217; 
interlocutors pointed out, the complete arbitrariness of the situation, together with the uncertainty 
surrounding the duration of the secret detention, and the feeling that there is no way the 
individual can regain control of his or her life.  
</p>
<p> States of emergency, armed conflicts and the fight against terrorism - often framed in 
vaguely defined legal provisions - constitute an &#8220;enabling environment&#8221; for secret detention. As 
in the past, extraordinary powers are today conferred on authorities, including armed forces, law 
enforcement bodies and/or intelligence agencies, under states of emergency or global war 
paradigms without, or with very restricted, control mechanisms by parliaments or judicial bodies. 
</p>
<p>  In many contexts, intelligence agencies operate in a legal vacuum with no law, or no 
publicly available law, governing their actions. Many times, although intelligence bodies are not 
authorized by legislation to detain persons, they do so, sometimes for prolonged periods. In such 
situations, oversight and accountability mechanisms are either absent or severely restricted, with 
limited powers and hence ineffective.  
</p>
<p> Secret detention has relied on systems of trans-border (regional or global) cooperation; in 
many instances, foreign security forces indeed operate freely in the territory of other States. It 
also leads to the mutual exchange of intelligence information between States. A crucial element 
in international cooperation has been the transfer of alleged terrorists to other countries, where 
they may face a substantial risk of being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 5 
 
degrading treatment, in contravention of the principle of non-refoulement. Practices such as 
&#8220;hosting&#8221; secret detention sites or providing proxy detention have been supplemented by 
numerous other facets of complicity, including authorizing the landing of airplanes for 
refuelling, short-term deprivation of liberty before handing over the &#8220;suspect&#8221;, the covering up of 
kidnappings, and so on. With very few exceptions, too little has been done to investigate 
allegations of complicity.  
</p>
<p> Secret detention as such may constitute torture or ill-treatment for the direct victims as well 
as for their families. The very purpose of secret detention, however, is to facilitate and, 
ultimately, cover up torture and inhuman and degrading treatment used either to obtain 
information or to silence people. While in some cases elaborate rules are put in place authorizing 
&#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques that violate international standards of human rights and humanitarian 
law, most of the time secret detention has been used as a kind of defence shield to avoid any 
scrutiny and control, making it impossible to learn about treatment and conditions during 
detention.  
</p>
<p> The generalized fear of secret detention, and its corollaries such as torture and 
ill-treatment, tends to effectively result in limiting the exercise of a large number of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. These include the freedom of expression and the freedom of 
association, as they often go hand in hand with the intimidation of witnesses, victims and their 
families. 
</p>
<p> The experts are extremely concerned that many victims of secret detention from many 
countries around the world indicated their fear of reprisal, against themselves personally or 
against their families, if they cooperated with the study and/or allowed their names to be used. 
The injustice done by secretly detaining somebody is prolonged and replicated all too frequently 
once the victims are released, because the concerned State may try to prevent any disclosure 
about the fact that secret detention is practiced on its territory. 
</p>
<p> In almost no recent cases have there been any judicial investigations into allegations of 
secret detention, and practically no one has been brought to justice. Although many victims feel 
that the secret detention has stolen years of their lives and left an indelible mark, often in terms 
of loss of their livelihood and frequently their health, they have almost never received any form 
of reparation, including rehabilitation or compensation.  
</p>
<p> Such a serious human rights violation therefore deserves appropriate action and 
condemnation. The experts conclude with concrete recommendations that are aimed at curbing 
the resort to secret detention and the unlawful treatment or punishment of detainees in the 
context of counter-terrorism:  
</p>
<p> (a) Secret detention should be explicitly prohibited, along with all other forms of 
unofficial detention. Detention records should be kept, including in times of armed conflict, as 
required by the Geneva Conventions, and should include the number of detainees, their 
nationality and the legal basis on which they are being held, whether as prisoners of war or 
civilian internees. Internal inspections and independent mechanisms should have timely access to 
all places where persons are deprived of their liberty for monitoring purposes, at all times. In 
times of armed conflict, the location of all detention facilities should be disclosed to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross; </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/42* 
page 6 
 
 (b) Safeguards for persons deprived of their liberty should be fully respected. No undue 
restrictions on these safeguards under counter-terrorism or emergency legislation are 
permissible. In particular, effective <i>habeas corpus</i> reviews by independent judicial bodies are 
central to ensuring respect for the right to personal liberty. Domestic legislative frameworks 
should therefore not allow for any exceptions from <i>habeas corpus</i>, operating independently of 
the detaining authority and from the place and form of deprivation of liberty. The study shows 
that judicial bodies can play a crucial role in protecting people against secret detention. The law 
should foresee penalties for officials who refuse to disclose relevant information during <i>habeas 
corpus</i> proceedings; 
</p>
<p> (c) All steps necessary to ensure that the immediate families of those detained are 
informed of their relatives&#8217; capture, location, legal status and condition of health should be taken 
in a timely manner; 
</p>
<p> (d) Any action by intelligence services should be governed by law, which in turn should 
be in conformity with international norms. To ensure accountability in intelligence cooperation, 
truly independent intelligence review and oversight mechanisms should be established and 
enhanced. Such mechanisms should have access to all information, including sensitive 
information. They should be mandated to undertake reviews and investigate upon their initiative, 
and to make public reports;  
</p>
<p> (e) Institutions strictly independent of those that have allegedly been involved in secret 
detention should promptly investigate any allegations of secret detention and extraordinary 
rendition. Those individuals found to have participated in secretly detaining persons and any 
unlawful acts perpetrated during such detention, including their superiors if they have ordered, 
encouraged or consented to secret detentions, should be prosecuted without delay and, where 
found guilty, given sentences commensurate to the gravity of the acts perpetrated;  
</p>
<p> (f) The status of all pending investigations into allegations of ill-treatment and torture of 
detainees and detainee deaths in custody should be made public. No evidence or information 
obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment should be used in any 
proceedings;  
</p>
<p> (g) Transfers, or the facilitation of transfers, from one State to the custody of authorities 
of another State must be carried out under judicial supervision and in line with international 
standards. The principle of non-refoulement of persons to countries where they would be at risk 
of torture or other inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment should be honoured; 
</p>
<p> (h) Victims of secret detention should be provided with judicial remedies and reparation 
in accordance with relevant international norms, which recognize the right of victims to 
adequate, effective and prompt reparation proportionate to the gravity of the violations and the 
harm suffered. Given that families of disappeared persons have been recognized as victims under 
international law, they should also benefit from rehabilitation and compensation; 
</p>
<p> (i) States should ratify and implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. Given that the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture requires the 
setting up of monitoring systems covering all situations of deprivation of liberty, adhering to this </p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 7 
 
international instrument adds a layer of protection. States should ratify the Optional Protocol and 
create independent national preventive mechanisms that are in compliance with the Paris 
Principles, and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. Other regional systems may wish to replicate the system put in place 
through the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons; 
</p>
<p> (j) Governments have an obligation to protect their citizens abroad and provide consular 
protection to ensure that foreign States comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> (k) Under international human rights law, States have the obligation to provide witness 
protection, which is also a precondition for combating secret detention effectively.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present joint study on global practices in relation to secret detention in the context of 
countering terrorism was prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention (represented by its Vice Chair), and the Working Group on Enforced and 
Involuntary Disappearances (represented by its Chair). 
</p>
<p>2. The study was prepared within the mandates of the above-mentioned special procedures. In 
particular, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/28, requested the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism to make concrete recommendations on the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and to work in close coordination with 
other relevant bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations, in particular with other special 
procedures of the Council, in order to strengthen the work for the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts.  
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 8/8, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to study, in a comprehensive manner, 
trends, developments and challenges in relation to combating and preventing torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and to make recommendations and 
observations concerning appropriate measures to prevent and eradicate such practices. 
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 6/4, the Council requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to 
seek and receive information from Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, and receive information from the individuals concerned, their families or their 
representatives relevant to its mandate, and to formulate deliberations on issues of a general 
nature in order to assist States to prevent and guard against the practice of arbitrary deprivation 
of liberty. Like other mandates, it was asked to work in coordination with other mechanisms of 
the Council.  
</p>
<p>5. In its resolution 7/12, the Council requested the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances to consider the question of impunity in the light of the relevant 
provisions of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, 
having in mind the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through 
action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II, and 
E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), and to provide appropriate assistance in the implementation by States 
of the Declaration and existing international rules. 
</p>
<p>6. In the above context, the four mandates endeavoured to address global practices in relation 
to secret detention in counter-terrorism. In the joint study, they describe the international legal 
framework applicable to secret detention and provide a historical overview of the use of secret 
detention. The study addresses the use of secret detention in the context of the &#8220;global war on 
terror&#8221; in the post-11 September 2001 period. To the extent possible, in order to demonstrate that 
the practice of secret detention is regrettably not an uncommon one, it also highlights a number 
of cases where it has been utilized in and by States from various geographical regions. Owing to 
its global nature, the present study cannot be exhaustive but rather aims to highlight and illustrate </p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 11 
 
by examples the wide spread practice of secret detention and related impunity. Finally, the study 
concludes with concrete recommendations regarding these practices, aimed at curbing the use of 
secret detention and the unlawful treatment or punishment of detainees in the context of 
counter-terrorism.  
</p>
<p>7. Owing to the secrecy of the practice of secret detention, it was often difficult to gather 
first-hand information; nevertheless, a wide array of national, regional and international sources 
was consulted. While United Nations sources were drawn upon, primary sources included 
responses to a questionnaire sent to all Member States (annex I) and interviews with current or 
former detainees (summaries of which are given in annex II). In some cases, secondary sources 
such as media and other sources were used. Such accounts, while not always verifiable are 
utilized when regarded by the mandate holders as credible. Responses to the questionnaire were 
received from 44 States. A number of interviews were held with people who had been held in 
secret detention, family members of those held captive, as well as legal representatives of 
individuals held. The mandate holders conducted face to face interviews in Germany and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Other interviews were conducted by 
telephone. Formal meetings at the level of capitals were held with officials in Berlin, London and 
Washington, D.C. The mandate holders thank those States that cooperated with them and 
facilitated their joint work. They also wish to thank the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as well as others who provided valuable research 
and other assistance to the study. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SECRET DETENTION UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Terminology 
</b></p>
<p>8. For the purpose of the present report, it is construed that a person is kept in secret detention 
if State authorities acting in their official capacity, or persons acting under the orders thereof, 
with the authorization, consent, support or acquiescence of the State, or in any other situation 
where the action or omission of the detaining person is attributable to the State,1 deprive persons 
of their liberty; where the person is not permitted any contact with the outside world 
(&#8220;incommunicado detention&#8221;); and when the detaining or otherwise competent authority denies, 
refuses to confirm or deny or actively conceals the fact that the person is deprived of his/her 
liberty hidden from the outside world, including, for example family, independent lawyers or 
non-governmental organizations, or refuses to provide or actively conceals information about the 
fate or whereabouts of the detainee. In the present report, the term &#8220;detention&#8221; is used 
synonymously with &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221;, &#8220;keeping in custody&#8221; or &#8220;holding in custody&#8221;. The 
distinction drawn between &#8220;detention&#8221; and &#8220;imprisonment&#8221; in the preamble to the Body of

adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 43/173, in the section entitled &#8220;Use of Terms&#8221;, 
does not purport to provide a general definition.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Secret detention does not require deprivation of liberty in a secret place of detention; in 
other words, secret detention within the scope of the present report may take place not only in a 
place that is not an officially recognized place of detention, or in an officially recognized place 
of detention, but in a hidden section or wing that is itself not officially recognized, but also in an 
officially recognized site. Whether detention is secret or not is determined by its incommunicado character and by the fact that State authorities, as described in paragraph 1 above, do not disclose 
the place of detention or information about the fate of the detainee.  
</p>
<p>10. Any detention facility may fall within the scope of the present study. It can be a prison, 
police station, governmental building, military base or camp, but also, for example, a private 
residence, hotel, car, ship or plane.  
</p>
<p>11. Incommunicado detention, where the detainees may only have contact with their captors, 
guards or co-inmates, would amount to secret detention also if the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) is granted access by the authorities, but is not permitted to register the 
case, or, if it is allowed to register the case, is not permitted by the State to, or does not, for 
whatever reason, notify the next of kin of the detainee on his or her whereabouts. In other words, 
access by ICRC alone, without it being able to notify others of the persons&#8217; whereabouts, would 
not be sufficient to qualify the deprivation of liberty as not being secret. However, it is 
understood that ICRC, in principle, would not accept access to a detention facility without the 
possibility of exercising its mandate, which includes notification of the family about the 
whereabouts and fate of the detainee.<b>3 </b>If ICRC access is granted within a week,<b>4</b> it has been 
deemed sufficient to leave the case outside the scope of the present study. ICRC access to certain 
detainees may only be exceptionally and temporarily restricted for reasons of imperative military 
necessity in an armed conflict.<b>5</b>

<p><b>4</b>  Compare, for instance, article 70 of the Third Geneva Convention: &#8220;Immediately upon capture, 
or not more than one week after arrival at a camp, even if it is a transit camp, likewise in case of

12. A case falls within the scope of the present study on secret detention in the name of 
counter-terrorism only if State authorities or persons acting under the orders, or with the 
authorization, consent, support or acquiescence of the State, or in any other way attributable to 
the State, detain secretly persons: 
</p>
<p>(a) Who have committed, or are suspected of planning, aiding or abetting, terrorist 
offences, irrespective of what classification of these offences is used by a Government;  
</p>
<p>(b) In any situation where terrorism or related notions (such as extremism or 
separatism)<b>6</b> are used to describe or justify the context in, or basis upon, which a person has been 
detained; 
</p>
<p>(c) In any situation where extraordinary detention powers or procedures are triggered 
(under notions such as anti-terrorism acts, states of emergency or national security acts). 
</p>
<p>13. The qualification by States of certain acts as &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; is often aimed at applying a 
special regime with limited legal and procedural safeguards in place. The Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism has expressed concern that the absence of a universal and comprehensive definition of 
the term of &#8220;terrorism&#8221;, leaving it to individual States to define it carries the potential for 
unintended human rights abuses and even deliberate misuse of the term. He added that &#8220;it was 
essential to ensure that the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is confined in its use to conduct that is of a 
genuinely terrorist nature.&#8221;<b>7</b> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also noted with concern 
the frequent attempts by Governments to use normal legislation or to have recourse to 
emergency or special laws and procedures to combat terrorism and thereby permit, or at least 
increase, the risk of arbitrary detention. It added that such laws, either per se or in their 
application, by using an extremely vague and broad definition of terrorism, bring within their 
fold the innocent and the suspect alike, and thereby increase the risk of arbitrary detention, 
disproportionately reducing the level of guarantees enjoyed by ordinary persons in normal 
circumstances. Legitimate democratic opposition, as distinct from violent opposition, becomes a 
victim in the application of such laws.&#8221;<b>8</b> Examples of such a type of criminal offence couched in 
broad terms relate to the subversion of State powers or simply anti-subversion laws&#8221;.9 Such

Extremism, agreed upon in 2001 by Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, 
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The parties agree to &#8220;reciprocally recognize acts of terrorism, 
separatism and extremism irrespective of whether their own national legislations include the 
corresponding acts in the same category of crimes or whether they use the same terms to 
describe them&#8221;.

attempts to circumvent the guarantees of applicable international human rights law inform a 
broad approach as to the scope of the present study of what constitutes secret detention in the 
context of countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>14. Organized crimes, such as drug or human trafficking, are not covered by the present study, 
unless anti-terrorism legislation is invoked. Whether the State has conferred on the case a link to 
terrorism may have to be inferred from elements uttered by State officials or if the person is later 
prosecuted on terrorism-related charges.  
</p>
<p>15. Detention by non-State actors, when not attributable to the State, is not addressed in the 
present study. Hence, hostage-taking, kidnapping or comparable conduct by terrorists, criminals, 
rebels, insurgents, paramilitary forces or other non-State actors do not fall within the ambit of the 
report, which focuses on secret detention by or attributable to States and is addressed to the 
Human Rights Council as an intergovernmental body. 
</p>
<p>16. Victims of the human rights violation of secret detention are not only the detainees 
themselves, but also their families, who are not informed of the fate of their loved ones deprived 
of their rights and held solely at the mercy of their captors. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Secret detention and international human rights  
law and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>17. Secret detention is irreconcilable with international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law. It amounts to a manifold human rights violation that cannot be justified under 
any circumstances, including during states of emergency.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Secret detention and the right to liberty of the person 
</b></p>
<p>18. Secret detention violates the right to liberty and security of the person and the prohibition 
of arbitrary arrest or detention. Article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights affirms that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person, that no one 
should be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention nor be deprived of his or her liberty except on 
such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. Furthermore, 
article 9, paragraph 4, of the Covenant stipulates that anyone deprived of their liberty by arrest or 
detention should be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may 
decide, without delay, on the lawfulness of their detention and order their release if the detention 
is not lawful. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 8, highlighted that 
article 9, paragraphs 1 and 4, and paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights as far as the right to be informed at the time of the arrest about the reasons

therefore, is applicable to all deprivations of liberty, &#8220;whether in criminal cases or in other cases 
such as, for example, mental illness, vagrancy, drug addiction, educational purposes, 
immigration control, etc.&#8221;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The practice of secret detention in itself violates the above-mentioned guarantees, or in 
most cases, automatically or inherently entails such consequences that amount to a violation. As 
secret detainees are held outside the reach of the law, no procedure established by law is being 
applied to them as required by article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Even if a State authorized in its domestic laws the practice of secret detention, such laws 
would in themselves be in violation of the right to liberty and security and would therefore not 
stand. Secret detention without contact with the outside world entails de facto that the detainees 
do not enjoy the right enshrined in article 9, paragraph 4 of the Covenant, namely the possibility 
to institute habeas corpus, <i>amparo</i>, or similar proceedings, personally or on their behalf, 
challenging the lawfulness of detention before a court of law that is competent to order their 
release in the event that the detention is found to be unlawful.  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has classified secret detention as being per se 
arbitrary, falling within category I of the categories of arbitrary detention that it has developed. 
The Working Group qualifies deprivation of liberty as arbitrary in terms of category I when it is 
clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of liberty.<b>11 </b>In its opinion 
No. 14/2009<b>12 </b>concerning a case of detention unacknowledged by the Government at an 
undisclosed place of custody, the Working Group held that no jurisdiction could allow for 
incommunicado detention where no access to counsel or relatives was granted and no judicial 
control over the deprivation of liberty was exercised; in short, where no legal procedure 
established by law whatsoever was followed.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>21. In its opinion No. 12/2006,<b>14</b> the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention considered the 
deprivation of liberty of two individuals, one of whom was held at a secret place of detention, to 
be arbitrary under category I, as both had not been formally charged with any offence, informed 
of the duration of their custodial orders, brought before a judicial officer, allowed to name a 
lawyer to act on their behalf, nor otherwise been provided the possibility to challenge the legality 
of their detention.<b>15</b>

22. Opinion No. 29/2006 of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention<b>16</b> concerned 26 
individuals who were alleged to have been captured in various countries, partly handed over into 
the custody of the United States of America under its secret Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
rendition programme in the context of the so called &#8220;global war on terror&#8221;. They were held 
incommunicado at various &#8220;black sites&#8221; under the jurisdiction of the United States for prolonged 
periods of time, without charge or trial, access to courts of law, and without their families being 
informed or aware of their fate or whereabouts. In spite of the absence of a response by the 
Government of the United States to these allegations, the Working Group considered itself in a 
position to render an opinion on the cases of these 26 individuals, many of whom were suspected 
of having been involved in serious crimes, and held that their detention clearly fell within 
category I of arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>23. In most cases, secret detention, as it is outside any international or national legal regime, 
also implies that the duration of detention is not known to the detainee; it rests at the sole 
discretion of the authorities ordering the detention. Hence, the very nature of secret detention 
may result in potentially, or actually, indefinite periods of detention, which render this type of 
detention arbitrary on this additional ground.<b>17</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Secret detention and the right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>24. Secret detention outside the protection of the law is often resorted to with the purpose of 
depriving the detainee of the rights that he or she would otherwise enjoy as a person charged 
with a criminal offence, namely the right to a fair trial, as enunciated in article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the complementary guarantees 
contained in article 9, paragraphs 2 and 3. Article 9, paragraph 2 of the Covenant stipulates that 
anyone who is arrested should be promptly informed of any charges against him. Paragraph 3 of 
the same article requires that anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge be brought 
promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power. 
</p>
<p>25. The above-mentioned provisions presuppose that anyone suspected of having committed a 
recognizable criminal offence and arrested on these grounds must be informed of the underlying 
charges if the interest of justice requires the prosecution of such a crime; otherwise, the State 
could circumvent the additional rights extended to suspects of a crime spelled out in articles 9 
and 14 of the Covenant. Equally, if someone suspected of a crime and detained on the basis of 
</p>
<p>     
confinement, ill-treatment and failure to inform the relatives about their detention; No. 47/2005 
(A/HRC/4/40/Add.1) and No. 8/1998 (E/CN.4/1999/63/Add.1).

</p>
<p><b>17</b>  For example, see opinion No. 22/2004 (E/CN.4/2006/7/Add.1) on the arbitrary character of 
detention for an unspecified period of time. </p>

  page 17 
 
article 9 of the Covenant is charged with an offence but not brought to trial, the prohibitions of 
unduly delaying trials as provided for by article 9, paragraph 3, and article14, paragraph 3 (c) of 
the Covenant may be violated at the same time.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>26. As the present study shows, in the majority of cases, State authorities who arrest and detain 
people incommunicado in a secret location often do not intend to charge the detainee with any 
crime, or even to inform him or her about any charges or to put the person on trial without undue 
delay before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law where the guilt 
or innocence of the accused could be established, in violation of article 14, paragraphs 1 (clause 
2), 2, 3 (a) and (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Such detainees do 
not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence, and cannot 
communicate freely with counsel of their own choosing as required by article 14, paragraph 3 (c) 
of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has considered secret detention a violation of 
the right to fair trial.<b>19</b> Certain practices inherent in secret detention, such as the use of secrecy 
and insecurity caused by denial of contact to the outside world and the family&#8217;s lack of 
knowledge of the whereabouts and fate of the detainee to exert pressure to confess to a crime, 
also infringe the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself or to confess guilt derived 
from the principle of presumption of innocence.<b>20 </b>Secret detention is furthermore conducive to 
confessions obtained under torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Secret detention and enforced disappearance  
</b></p>
<p>28. Every instance of secret detention also amounts to a case of enforced disappearance. 
Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance defines enforced disappearance as:  
</p>
<p>The arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the 
State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or 
acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty 
or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such 
a person outside the protection of the law.  
</p>
<p>This definition does not require intent to put the person concerned outside the protection of the 
law as a defining element, but rather refers to it as an objective consequence of the denial, refusal 
or concealment of the whereabouts and fate of the person.<b>21</b> The International Convention, in its 
                                                 
<b>18</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 32 (CCPR/C/GC/32), para. 61.

<p><b>19  </b>Opinions No. 5/2001 (E/CN.4/2002/77/Add.1), para. 10 (iii) and No. 14/2009 
(A/HRC/13/30/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>20</b>  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 14, para. 2.

Disappearance. </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/42* 
page 18 
 
article 17, paragraph 1, explicitly prohibits secret detention. The Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances confirmed in its general comment on article 10 of the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance that under no circumstances, 
including states of war or public emergency, can any State interest be invoked to justify or 
legitimize secret centres or places of detention which, by definition, would violate the 
Declaration, without exception.&#8221;<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Article 24, paragraph 1, of the International Convention explicitly includes in the definition 
of &#8220;victim&#8221; of enforced disappearances not only the disappeared person, but also any individual 
who has suffered harm as the direct result of an enforced disappearance.&#8221; When exercising its 
mandate to monitor the implementation by Member States to the Declaration on the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances has always adopted the perspective that families of the disappeared are to be 
considered victims themselves. According to article 1.2 of the Declaration, any act of enforced 
disappearance places the persons subjected thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicts 
severe suffering on them and their families.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>30. Since secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance, if resorted to in a widespread 
or systematic manner, such aggravated form of enforced disappearance can reach the threshold 
of a crime against humanity. In its article 7, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
labels the &#8220;enforced disappearance of persons&#8221; as a crime against humanity if it is committed as 
part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with 
knowledge of the attack.23 Article 5 of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance states that the widespread or systematic practice of 
enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable 
international law, and should attract the consequences provided for under such applicable 
international law, thus confirming this approach. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Secret detention and the absolute prohibition of  
torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>31. Every instance of secret detention is by definition incommunicado detention. According to 
the Human Rights Committee, even comparably short periods of incommunicado detention may 
violate the obligation of States, as contained in article 10, paragraph 1, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to treat all persons deprived of their liberty with 
humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. The Committee 
confirmed that &#8220;prisoners should be allowed under necessary supervision to communicate with 
their family and reputable friends at regular intervals, by correspondence as well as by receiving 
mail.&#8221;<b>24</b> Although shorter time periods may also be prohibited, incommunicado detention of 15

days constitutes a violation of article 10 of the Covenant.25 Incommunicado detention includes 
situations where a detainee&#8217;s family is informed that the person is &#8220;safe&#8221;, without disclosure of 
the location or nature of the person&#8217;s detention. 
</p>
<p>32. The ill-treatment threshold may be reached when the period of incommunicado detention is 
prolonged and additional circumstances prevail. For example, in the case of <i>Polay Campos v. 
Peru</i>,<b>26</b> the Human Rights Committee found a violation of both articles 7<b>27</b> and 10 of the 
Covenant as the detained submitter of the complaint had not been allowed to speak or to write to 
anyone, including legal representatives, for nine months, and had been kept in an unlit cell for 23 
and a half hours a day in freezing temperatures. It held that the incommunicado detention to 
which the author was subjected for longer than eight months constituted inhuman and degrading 
treatment.<b>28 </b>Similarly, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has stated that prolonged 
isolation and deprivation of communications are in themselves cruel and inhuman treatment, 
even if it is not known what has actually happened during the prolonged isolation of the 
particular individual.<b>29 </b>In <i>El-Megreisi v. Libyan Arab Jamahiriya</i>,<b>30</b> the Human Rights 
Committee found that the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had violated articles 10, 
paragraphs 1 and 7 of the Covenant by detaining an individual for six years, the last three of 
which incommunicado and in an unknown location, which in the view of the Committee reached 
the torture threshold.  
</p>
<p>33. The practice of secret detention, as reflected by the cases covered in the present study, also 
confirms that incommunicado detention, including secret detention, facilitates the commission of 
acts of torture. 
</p>
<p>34. The General Assembly, in its resolution 60/148, and the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 8/8, both state that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places 
may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

and 7.1, taking into account that the prisoner during his period of pre-trial detention was further 
confined to a cell, which was grossly overcrowded, and had to sleep on a wet concrete floor.

punishment, and could in itself constitute a form of such treatment.<b>31</b> The link between secret 
detention and torture and other forms of ill-treatment is hence twofold: secret detention as such 
may constitute torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; and secret detention may be 
used to facilitate torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p>35. In addition, secret detention not only violates the prohibition against torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment as defined above with regard to the victim of secret detention; but the 
suffering caused to family members of a disappeared person may also amount to torture or other 
forms of ill-treatment,<b>32 </b>and also violates the right to family in terms of article 17, paragraph 1, 
and article 23, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  State responsibility in cases of secret detention by proxy 
</b></p>
<p>36. Secret detention, involving the denial or concealment of a person&#8217;s detention, whereabouts 
or fate has the inherent consequence of placing the person outside the protection of the law. The 
practice of &#8220;proxy detention&#8221;, where persons are transferred from one State to another outside 
the realm of any international or national legal procedure (&#8220;rendition&#8221; or &#8220;extraordinary 
rendition&#8221;) for the specific purpose of secretly detaining them, or to exclude the possibility of 
review by the domestic courts of the State having custody of the detainee, or otherwise in 
violation of the well-entrenched principle of non-refoulement, entails exactly the same 
consequence. The practice of &#8220;proxy detention&#8221; involves the responsibility of both the State that 
is detaining the victim and the State on whose behalf or at whose behest the detention takes 
place. 
</p>
<p>37. According to article 2, clause 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, each State party undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory 
and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant, without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status. The Human Rights Committee clarified, in its general 
comment No. 31, that a State party must respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant 
to anyone within the power or effective control of that State party, even if not situated within the 
territory of the State party.33 Similarly, the International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion

on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories</i>, recognized that the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, but concluded that 
the Covenant extends to &#8220;acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside of its own 
territory&#8221;.<b>34</b> An excessively literal reading of article 2, paragraph 1 of the Covenant would defeat 
the very purpose of the Covenant.<b>35</b> As far as the Convention against Torture is concerned, article 
2, paragraph 1, and article16, paragraph 1, refer to each State party&#8217;s obligation to prevent acts of 
torture &#8220;in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. The removal of a person to a State for the purpose of holding that person in secret 
detention, or the exclusion of the possibility of review by domestic courts of the sending State, 
can never be considered compatible with the obligation laid down in article 2, paragraph 2, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
has dismissed this practice of &#8220;reverse diplomatic assurances&#8221;, in which the sending Government 
seeks assurances that the person handed over will be deprived of liberty, even though there are 
no criminal charges against him and no other recognizable legal basis for detention, as being at 
variance with international law.<b>36</b> In its opinion No. 11/2007,<b>37</b> the Working Group, concurring 
with the view of the Human Rights Committee expressed in its general comment No. 31, 
declared the Government of Afghanistan responsible for the arbitrary detention of an individual 
who was being detained at Bagram Airbase, under the control of the United States of America, 
but on Afghan soil with the knowledge of Afghan authorities.  
</p>
<p>39. Similarly, the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment not only expressly bans torture, but in its article 4, paragraph 1, it also implicitly 
prohibits complicity in acts of torture, as it requires each State party to ensure that all acts of 
torture, including those acts by any person that constitute complicity or participation in torture, 
are criminal offences under its criminal law. This approach has been supported by the Committee 
against Torture in its jurisprudence.<b>38</b> In particular, the Committee considered complicity to 
include acts that amount to instigation, incitement, superior order and instruction, consent, 
acquiescence and concealment.<b>39</b>

40. A State would thus also be responsible when it was aware of the risk of torture and 
ill-treatment, or ought to have been aware of the risk, inherently associated with the 
establishment or operation of such a facility or a given transfer to the facility, and did not take 
reasonable steps to prevent it; or when the State has received claims that someone had been 
subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, or an enforced disappearance, or otherwise received 
information suggesting that such acts may have taken place but failed to have the claims 
impartially investigated.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>41. A transferring State could also be internationally responsible under general rules of 
attribution of State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts. Recognizing that 
internationally wrongful conduct is often the result of the collaboration of more than one State, 
rather than one State acting alone - particularly found to be the case in the phenomenon of secret 
detention practices of the so called &#8220;global war on terror&#8221; - the general principles of State 
responsibility under international law establish the unlawfulness of the complicity of States in 
wrongful acts.<b>41</b> In particular, a State that aids or assists another State in the commission of an 
internationally wrongful act is internationally responsible if it does so knowing the 
circumstances and if the act would have been wrongful if it had been committed by the assisting 
State. The real or probable conduct by another State may be decisive in assessing whether the 
first State has breached its own international obligations. Article 16 of the Articles on 
Responsibility of the Status for Internationally Wrongful Acts, reflecting a rule of customary 
international law,<b>42</b> provides that:  
</p>
<p>A State which aids or assists another State in the commission of an internationally 
wrongful act by the latter is internationally responsible for doing so if: (a) that State does 
so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and (b) the act 
would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State. 
</p>
<p>42. Additionally, under the rules of State responsibility, where one State is in &#8220;serious breach&#8221; 
of its obligations under peremptory norms of international law - as would be the case if a State 
were to be torturing detainees - other States have a duty to cooperate to bring such a serious 
breach of the prohibition against torture to an end, and are required not to give any aid or 
assistance to its continuation. 
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, the practice of &#8220;proxy detention&#8221; by a State in circumstances where there is a 
risk of torture in the hands of the receiving State could amount to a violation of the State&#8217;s 
obligation under customary international law on non-refoulement - that is, not to transfer a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would

be in danger of being subjected to torture.<b>43</b> The Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance state that the principle of non-refoulement applies to the risk of 
enforced disappearances. Article 17, paragraph 1, of the International Convention provides that 
&#8220;no State party shall expel, return (&#8216;refouler&#8217;), surrender or extradite a person to another State 
where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being 
subjected to enforced disappearance.&#8221; The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has argued 
that the risk of arbitrary detention in the country of destination, which includes secret detention, 
should prohibit the transfer of a person into the jurisdiction of the receiving State as well.<b>44</b> 
Diplomatic assurances from the receiving State for the purpose of overcoming the obstacle of the 
non-refoulement principle do not release States from their obligations under international human 
rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Secret detention and derogations from international human rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. Article 4, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits 
States to derogate from certain rights contained therein &#8220;in times of public emergency which 
threatens the life of the nation&#8221;. However, this provision subjects such measures to a number of 
procedural and substantive safeguards regarding derogation measures: the State must have 
officially proclaimed a state of emergency; the derogation measures must be limited to those 
strictly required by the exigencies of the situation; they must not be inconsistent with other 
international obligations of the State; and they must not be discriminatory. In its general 
comment No. 29,<b>46</b> the Human Rights Committee highlighted the exceptional and temporary 
character of derogations, stating that the Covenant required that, even during an armed conflict, 
measures derogating from the Covenant were allowed only if and to the extent that the situation 
constituted a threat to the life of the nation.<b> </b>Derogation measures must be lifted as soon as the 
public emergency or armed conflict ceases to exist. Most importantly, derogation measures must 
be &#8220;strictly required&#8221; by the emergency situation. This requirement of proportionality implies 
that derogations cannot be justified when the same aim could be achieved through less intrusive 
means. 
</p>
<p>45. Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Covenant lists certain rights that cannot be derogated from, 
including the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
(art. 7).

46. Although articles 9 and 14 of the Covenant are not among the non-derogable rights 
enumerated in article 4, paragraph 2, the Human Rights Committee confirmed in its general 
comment No. 29 that the prohibitions against taking of hostages, abductions or unacknowledged 
detention were not subject to derogation.<b>47</b> It also considered that it was inherent in the 
protection of rights explicitly recognized as non-derogable in article 4, paragraph 2, that they 
must be secured by procedural guarantees, including, often, judicial guarantees. The provisions 
of the Covenant relating to procedural safeguards could never be made subject to measures that 
would circumvent the protection of non-derogable rights. Article 4 may not be resorted to in a 
way that would result in derogation from non-derogable rights. Safeguards related to derogation, 
as embodied in article 4 of the Covenant, were based on the principles of legality and the rule of 
law inherent in the Covenant as a whole. As certain elements of the right to a fair trial are 
explicitly guaranteed under international humanitarian law during armed conflict, the Committee 
found no justification for derogation from these guarantees during other emergency situations, 
and was of the opinion that the principles of legality and the rule of law required that 
fundamental requirements of fair trial be respected during a state of emergency. Only a court of 
law could try and convict a person for a criminal offence. The presumption of innocence has to 
be respected. In order to protect non-derogable rights, the right to take proceedings before a court 
to enable the court to decide without delay on the lawfulness of detention should not be 
diminished by a State party&#8217;s decision to derogate from the Covenant.<b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>47. In short, the main elements of articles 9 and 14 of the Covenant, namely the right to <i>habeas 
corpus</i>, the presumption of innocence and minimum fair trial guarantees, as well as the 
prohibition of unacknowledged detention, must be respected even in times of emergency, 
including armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in its opinions No. 43/2006, 2/2009 
and 3/2009,<b>49 </b>concurred with the view of the Human Rights Committee that the right to <i>habeas 
corpus </i>must prevail even in states of emergency. The Working Group similarly stated that the 
right not to be detained incommunicado over prolonged periods of time could not be derogated 
from, even where a threat to the life of the nation existed.<b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>49. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances confirmed in its general 
comment on article 10 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance that under no circumstances, including states of war or public emergency, could 
any State interest be invoked to justify or legitimize secret centres or places of detention which, 
by definition, would violate the Declaration, without exception.<b>51</b>

50. As the disappearance of persons is inseparably linked to treatment that amounts to a 
violation of article 7 of the Covenant, according to the jurisprudence of the Human Rights 
Committee,<b>52</b> the prohibition against enforced disappearance must not be derogated from, either. 
Similarly, article 1, paragraph 2, of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance stipulates:  
</p>
<p>No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, 
internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a 
justification for enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>51. Even if one were (wrongfully)<b>53 </b>to classify the global struggle against international 
terrorism in its entirety as a &#8220;war&#8221; for the purpose of applying the Third and Fourth Geneva 
Conventions, international human rights law continues to apply: the Covenant applies also in 
situations of armed conflict to which the rules of international humanitarian law are applicable. 
While, in respect of certain Covenant rights, more specific rules of international humanitarian 
law may be especially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation of those rights, both spheres 
of law are complementary, not mutually exclusive.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>52. In its advisory opinion on the <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, the 
International Court of Justice clearly affirmed the applicability of the Covenant during armed 
conflicts, stating that &#8220;the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one&#8217;s life applies also in 
hostilities. The test of what constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then must be 
determined by the applicable <i>lex specialis</i>, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict.&#8221;<b>55 </b>The

Court further developed its view in its advisory opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the 
Construction of a Wall in the Occupied</i> <i>Palestinian Territories</i>:  
</p>
<p>The protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed 
conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in 
article 4 of the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]. As regards the 
relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there are thus 
three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international 
humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may 
be matters of both these branches of international law.56  
</p>
<p>53. In its judgement in the Case concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo 
(<i>Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i>), the Court already applied international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law in parallel, without as a first step 
identifying the <i>lex specialis</i> or the exclusive matter.<b>57 </b>In their report on the mission to Lebanon 
and Israel from 7 to 14 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
stated that human rights law and international humanitarian law were not mutually exclusive, but 
existed in a complementary relationship during armed conflict; a full legal analysis required 
consideration of both bodies of law. In respect of certain human rights, more specific rules of 
international humanitarian law might be relevant for the purposes of their interpretation.<b>58</b> A 
complementary approach forming the basis of the present study is also supported by the principle 
of systemic integration contained in article 31, paragraph 3 (c), of the Vienna Convention on the 
Law of Treaties, which provides that, in interpreting an international treaty there shall be taken 
into account, together with the context &#8230; any relevant rules of international law applicable in the 
relations between the parties [of the treaty].&#8221;<b>59</b>

<p>     
stated that in the case of a conflict between the provisions of the two legal regimes [international

<p><b>7.  Secret detention and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>54. International humanitarian law prohibits secret detention as clearly as international human 
rights law does. Under the Geneva Conventions, which apply to all armed conflicts, there are 
situations in which persons falling into two categories may be detained: prisoners of war and 
civilians. Generally, prisoners of war are to be released at the end of active hostilities. Civilians 
may be detained by an occupying power under very strict conditions, namely (a) if such 
detention is &#8220;necessary for imperative reasons of security&#8221;<b>60</b> and (b) for penal prosecutions. The 
use of novel status designations to avoid Geneva Convention protections, such as &#8220;unlawful 
enemy combatants&#8221;, is irrelevant in this context from a legal point of view, as &#8220;it does not 
constitute a category recognized and defined under international law&#8221;.<b>61 </b>This is true also for 
non-international armed conflicts, albeit the notion of prisoners of war is not directly 
applicable.<b>62 
</b></p>
<p>55. Notwithstanding the capacity to detain individuals, the entire system of detention provided 
for by the Geneva Conventions is founded on the notion that detainees must be registered and 
held in officially recognized places of detention. According to article 70 of the Third Geneva 
Convention, prisoners of war are to be documented, and their whereabouts and health conditions 
made available to family members and to the country of origin of the prisoner within one week. 
Article 106 of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing the treatment of civilians establishes 
virtually identical procedures for the documentation and disclosure of information concerning 
civilian detainees<b>.</b> According to ICRC, these procedures are meant to ensure that internment is 
not a measure of punishment; interned persons must therefore not be held incommunicado.63 The

<p>56. As incommunicado detention is also prohibited under international humanitarian law

place of detention.<b>67 </b>Article 5 of the Fourth Geneva Convention permits the detaining power to 
deny to persons these rights and privileges &#8220;where absolute military security so requires&#8221; when 
an individual found physically in the State&#8217;s own territory is &#8220;definitely suspected of or engaged 
in activities hostile to the security of the State&#8221;, or when an individual in occupied territory is 
&#8220;detained as a spy or saboteur, or as a person under definite suspicion of activity hostile to the 
security of the Occupying Power&#8221;. While the article states that these persons &#8220;shall also be 
granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person under the present Convention at the 
earliest date consistent with the security of the State or Occupying Power&#8221;, ICRC stresses that 
article 5 may only be applied in individual cases of an exceptional nature, when the existence of 
specific charges makes it almost certain that penal proceedings will follow. Bare suspicion of 
hostile activities would not suffice; it would have to be a definite suspicion of such 
activities. The burden of definite suspicion is a high burden that must be individualized and must 
not be of a general nature.<b>68</b>

<p><b>III.  SECRET DETENTION PRACTICES IN PAST CONTEXTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The emergence of the recent practice of secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>57. The phenomenon of secret detention, closely intertwined with enforced disappearances, 
can be traced at least to the <i>Nacht und Nebel Erla&#223;</i> of the Nazi Germany, the &#8220;night and fog 
decree&#8221;, according to which suspected resistance movement members could be arrested in 
occupied Europe and secretly transferred to Germany &#8220;under cover of night&#8221;.<b>69</b> These measures

were intended to have a deterrent effect, because detainees would vanish without leaving a trace 
and no information would be given as to their whereabouts or fate.<b>70 </b> 
</p>
<p>58. An incipient form of these practices was, however, already well known in the former 
Soviet Union, with its <i>Gulag<b></b></i><b>71</b> system of forced-labour camps, first established under Vladimir 
Lenin during the early Bolshevik years. The Gulag system ultimately resulted in a vast penal 
network, including hundreds of camp complexes, which functioned throughout the State, many 
in Siberia and the Soviet Far East. The system was enhanced after 1928 under Joseph Stalin.  
</p>
<p>59. Even though the above-mentioned practices were encompassed in a broader context of war 
or perpetuation of a state of terror, secret detention in the context of counter-terrorism is not a 
new phenomenon. Striking similarities can be identified between security measures in the 1970s 
and 1980s in the context of Latin America, but also other regions, such as northern Africa and 
South-East Asia, on the one hand, and the counter-terrorism measures adopted worldwide since 
11 September 2001, on the other. The methods used then, as now, consisted of, inter alia, broad 
emergency laws, the enhanced role of military and special courts, the practice of torture and/or 
ill-treatment, kidnappings (renditions), enforced disappearances and notably secret detention.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  The recent practice of secret detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Secret detention in Latin America 
</b></p>
<p>60. Secret detention in Latin America was closely linked to the widespread pattern of enforced 
disappearances. On the basis of the reports produced by various national truth and reconciliation 
commissions, in the 1970s and 1980s, patterns of secret detention were identified in, inter alia, 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.<b>72 </b>Thousands of Latin 
Americans were secretly kidnapped, tortured and killed by national security services. When 
these dictatorial regimes came to an end, some of the countries, on the basis of their archives, 
decided to prosecute former Government officials, as well as police and military officers. In 
other countries these attempts have long been hampered by impunity created as a result of, inter 
alia, amnesty laws or pardons.

61. Latin American Governments justified practices of secret detention, among other 
exceptional measures, referring to the national security doctrine, which provided fertile ground 
for the creation of a repressive system by the military in which, in the name of security, human 
rights and fundamental freedoms were violated on a massive scale, and the rule of law and the 
democratic system damaged. The model was formulated in the 1940s, on the basis of French 
counter-insurgency concepts used in Algeria and Indochina. It was spread by the United States 
through the training of Latin American armies in &#8220;the school of the Americas&#8221;, located in 
Panama. Politically, the doctrine was strongly influenced by the bipolar cold war paradigm. It 
extended the notion of the alleged internal war against communism, which soon acquired a 
regional dimension. Practices of secret detention were first used against armed movements, later 
against left-wing groups, Marxist and non-Marxist, and ultimately against all groups suspected 
of political opposition. The latter were labelled as &#8220;subversives&#8221;, &#8220;terrorists&#8221; or &#8220;communists&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>62. Practices of secret detention ran in parallel, at the national and regional levels. They were 
carried out by several governmental entities, which worked with little regulation and wide 
authority to interpret the few rules and regulations that did exist. Each entity had its own staff 
and facilities. Each organization worked in secrecy.<b>73</b> The prime example of the regional scope 
of these practices was operation Condor, involving the exchange of intelligence information, and 
relying upon inter-State programmes of renditions.<b>74 </b>The operation was endorsed by the Chilean 
National Intelligence Directorate, which operated as the main intelligence service engaged in 
political repression between 1974 and 1977. Among its different functions, it was responsible for 
running secret detention centres, where victims were interrogated and tortured.<b>75</b> The Directorate 
soon began to work in Argentina, and later in other Latin American countries, the United States 
and Europe.<b>76 </b>Similar intelligence services were established in Argentina, Paraguay and 
Uruguay, and integrated into a coordination network, closely linked to the United States.<b>77</b>  
</p>
<p>63.  In Argentina, for instance, there were close to 500 secret detention centres, operating 
mainly on military or police premises.<b>78</b> Others were located in such diverse settings as hospitals,

Government offices, automobile repair shops, schools, farms and even the basement of the 
upscale Galerias Pacifico in downtown Buenos Aires.<b>79</b> The largest secret detention centres were 
the Navy Mechanics School (Escuela de Mecanica de la Armada) and the Club Atl&#233;tico, a 
federal police facility, both in very visible Buenos Aires locations; the Campo de Mayo army 
base and Vesubio, a former summer residence, both in the province of Buenos Aires; La Perla, a 
military base in C&#243;rdoba Province; and La Cacha, located within the offices of the penitentiary.<b>80 
</b>Notwithstanding the fact that it was estimated that these facilities held some 14,500 detainees, 
the military authorities repeatedly denied the existence of secret detention centres.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>64. In Chile, torture methods were routinely practiced on all detainees held in secret facilities. 
Some of the secret detention facilities mentioned in the report of the Chilean National 
Commission on Truth and Reconciliation were Tejas Verdes, Cuatro Alamos, Londres No. 38, 
Jos&#233; Domingo Ca&#241;as, Villa Grimaldi, The Discotheques or La Venda Sexy, Casa Caj&#243;n del 
Maipo, la Firma, Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var con la calle Ossand&#243;n, Nido 20 y Cuartel Venecia. According to 
information provided by the Government, the report of the National Commission on Political 
Prison and Torture of 2004 indicated that there were 1132 places used for purposes of detention 
throughout the country.<b>82 </b>The sites themselves were equipped with permanent installations for 
applying enhanced methods of interrogation and special personnel trained to use them. The 
guards were not the same as the officers who were in charge of interrogations, although the latter 
could take part in inflicting torture and indeed did so directly.<b>83</b> For years there were secret 
detention sites to which officials of the judicial branch had no access. The courts did not act to 
remedy this unlawful situation or even to condemn it, despite continuous claims made in habeas 
corpus appeals.<b>84 </b>This was compounded by the fact that, during the Pinochet regime, the 
authority to &#8220;arrest&#8221; included the authority to order solitary confinement. This, together with the 
lack of provisions requiring the disclosure of the place where a person was being held, facilitated 
the use of secret detention.<b>85</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>79</b>  According to the information provided by the Government, there are no records indicating 
that Galerias Pacifico was used as a secret detention centre.

65. In the late 1970s, during an on-site observation in El Salvador, a special commission<b>86</b> 
verified the existence of a group of cells in which, according to claimants, several people were 
being detained in secret and tortured.87 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
received reports alleging that the authorities of El Salvador were holding individuals arbitrarily 
in secret places of the National Guard, the National Police and the Treasury Police.<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p>66. In Peru, the vast majority of more than 3,000 cases of disappearances reported to the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances occurred between 1983 and 1992 in 
the context of the Government&#8217;s fight against terrorist organizations, especially the Communist 
Party of Peru (<i>Sendero Luminoso</i>).<b>89</b> A number of cases of secret detention were examined by the 
Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission.<b>90</b>  
</p>
<p>67. In Uruguay, many disappeared persons were reported to be held in clandestine detention 
centres, allegedly run by Argentine and Uruguayan military personnel.<b>91</b> The Inter-American 
Commission also received consistent reports of prolonged incommunicado detentions in the 
country during the 1970s and 1980s.<b>92</b> These and other allegations of clandestine detention 
centres were later confirmed by the final report of the Peace Commission.<b>93</b>  
</p>
<p>68. More generally, during the 1970s and 1980s, Latin American Governments adopted 
legislation concentrating all powers in the executive branch, including decisions on detentions, 
their form and place. The legislation itself was in most cases extremely broad, providing for a 
vague definition of terrorism-related crimes, treated as political or ideological offences, and 
subject to disproportionate sanctions.<b>94</b>  
</p>
<p>69. The practice of secret detention was also facilitated by the introduction of states of 
emergency, followed by repeated renewals or extensions and, in some cases, by straightforward

perpetuations.<b>95 </b>States of emergency gave more powers to the military and provided room for 
discretion in the repressive measures against terrorism. In Uruguay, a state of emergency was 
declared in 1968 and extended until the end of the dictatorial period in 1985. In Paraguay, the 
state of siege lasted for 35 years, although the Constitution stipulated that it could only be 
declared for limited periods and subject to exceptional circumstances.96 In most of these 
countries, the practice of secret detention was compounded by derogations from or modifications 
of national constitutions, while in others they were subordinated to the regulations of military 
Governments. 
</p>
<p>70. Many Governments in regions other than Latin America have also resorted to secret 
detention in the context of counter-terrorism-related activities. Although on numerous occasions 
terrorism as such was not invoked as the basis of detention, accusations such as disruption of 
public order, involvement in a <i>coup d&#8217;&#233;tat </i>or allegedly unlawful activities of the opposition, 
were recurrently used by Governments. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Secret detention in Africa 
</b></p>
<p>71. In the 1990s, allegations of more than 200 secret detention centres in Kinshasa were 
brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur on torture. These were allegedly run by the 
police or the armed forces of the Zaire.<b>97</b> In its concluding observations on the country in 2006, 
the Committee against Torture took note of the outlawing of unlawful places of detention beyond 
the control of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, such as prison cells run by the security services and 
the Special Presidential Security Group, where persons had been subjected to torture.<b>98</b> 
</p>
<p>72. In 1994, serious concerns were expressed by the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances regarding increasing patterns of disappearances of suspected 
opponents of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, in particular regarding allegations of 
detainees being held in secret interrogation or detention centres in Addis Ababa and other 
locations.<b>99</b> A number of people detained in Hararge province on suspicion of supporting the

Oromo Liberation Front were allegedly held in, inter alia, 23 secret detention centres in Deder 
district.<b>100 </b>The existence of secret detention centres in Deder district was denied by the 
authorities.<b>101</b> 
</p>
<p>73. In South Africa, during states of emergency in the 1980s, at least 40,000 people were 
detained, many of them charged with representing a danger to public peace.<b>102</b> Under the Internal 
Security Act, administrative detention in some instances effectively amounted to secret 
detention. In most cases, no one was allowed access to the detainee or to information about him 
or her, and the name of the detainee could only be disclosed by the Minister for Law and Order 
or a person authorized by him.<b>103 </b> 
</p>
<p>74. In the Sudan, the use of secret detention facilities, or &#8220;ghost houses&#8221;, has for years been the 
subject of attention of both the United Nations human rights bodies and civil society.104 These 
were used mainly in the northern part of the country, but also in Darfur and Khartoum.105 One of 
the most notorious and well-known secret detention centres was the &#8220;City Bank&#8221; or al-Waha 
(&#8220;the Oasis&#8221;).<b>106 </b>The common pattern of detentions consisted of security officers arresting 
individuals on suspicion of opposition activities, blindfolding them on the way to the detention 
centres, and then subjecting them to severe torture for periods ranging from a few weeks to 
several months, completely cutting them off from the outside world.<b>107</b> <i>Amnesty International

<p><b>3.  Secret detention in Northern Africa and the Middle East 
</b></p>
<p>75. In Algeria, in the context of internal strife during the 1990s, and in particular between 1993 
and 1998, the security forces and State-armed militias arrested thousands of men on suspicion of 
involvement in terrorist activities, in circumstances leaving the relatives of those arrested men 
with no knowledge of their whereabouts.<b>109 </b>As a result, the relatives were often forced to request 
the issuance of a declaration of absence from judges and officials, who were in most cases 
denying or concealing the whereabouts of the arrested men.<b>110 </b>A number of the disappeared 
persons are reported to have been members or sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation Front.<b>111</b> 
</p>
<p>76. Patterns of enforced disappearances and secret detentions facilities were also identified in 
Morocco as of the early 1960s.<b>112 </b>In most cases, the victims were human rights activists, trade 
unionists or involved in activities of political opposition.<b>113</b> Since Morocco took control of 
Western Sahara at the end of 1975, hundreds of Sahrawi men and women known or suspected of 
pro-independence activities had disappeared after having been arrested by Moroccan security 
forces. Many of the victims were reported to have been confined in secret detention centres, such 
as El Ayun, Qal&#8217;at M&#8217;gouna, Agdz, Derb Moulay Cherif in Casablanca, and Tazmamart. The 
Moroccan authorities had continuously denied any knowledge of such detention centres. For

instance, in response to a question by the Human Rights Committee in November 1990 about the 
secret detention centres of Qal&#8217;at M&#8217;Gouna and Tazmamart, the Moroccan delegation replied 
that &#8220;these prisons are not on any list held in the prison administration division at the Ministry of 
the Interior&#8221;.114 Cells in some police stations or military barracks, as well as secret villas in the 
Rabat suburbs, were also allegedly used to hide the disappeared.<b>115 </b>Until 1991, the Government 
of Morocco not only denied any knowledge of these disappeared and their whereabouts, but also 
their existence.<b>116 </b>The Equity and Reconciliation Commission considered some of the cases of 
secret detention occurring between 1936 and 1999.<b>117</b> In its submission concerning the present

<p><b>4.  Secret detention in Asia 
</b></p>
<p>79. In Cambodia, secret detention facilities were used by the Communist Party of Kampuchea 
during the Khmer Rouge Regime both to persecute political opposition and to intimidate the 
civilian population. While those individuals who were sent to Tuol Sleng prison (S-21) were 
regarded as established &#8220;enemies&#8221; of the Party, those sent to the so-called re-education camp 
(S-24) were considered to be &#8220;elements&#8221;, because it was unclear whether they were enemies or 
friends.<b>123</b> The S-24 facility was used primarily for the purposes of forced labour. The 
Government of Cambodia denies the occurrence of secret detention after the fall of the Khmer 
Rouge regime. However, in the 1990s, reports were made regarding the involvement of senior 
regional and provincial military officers and their units in the continuing use of secret detention 
facilities in Battambang province for the purposes of detaining abducted civilians, extorting 
money, asserting illegal power and executing those detained.<b>124 </b> 
</p>
<p>80. In India, no fewer than 1 million people were detained under preventive detention laws 
during the 1975/77 state of emergency. Many were alleged to be held in secret places of 
detention, for instance in Punjab. Others were abducted and made to disappear by members of 
the police and State security forces, especially in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in the 
North-eastern states.<b>125</b> Most of them were legally precluded from an enforceable right to 
compensation for unlawful detention. While the Constitution, the Penal Code and the Criminal 
Procedure Code prohibited secret detention and stipulated prompt access to a judicial authority, 
relatives, lawyers and medical assistance, such guarantees were not included in other relevant 
laws, such as the Terrorism and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, which was in force in the 
States of Jammu, Kashmir and Punjab. According to a number of allegations, in the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir, arrests were often not recorded by, or even reported to, the local police so 
that legal remedies, including applications for habeas corpus, were ineffective.<b>126 </b>In the late 
1990s, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances received consistent 
allegations according to which more than 2,000 people were being held in long-term 
unacknowledged detention in interrogation centres and transit camps in the north-east of the 
country and in Jammu and Kashmir.<b>127 </b>

81. In Nepal, a number of suspected members of the Maoist Communist Party, which had 
declared a &#8220;people&#8217;s war&#8221; in February 1996, were held in secret detention.<b>128</b> In the late 1990s, 
the increasing pattern of disappearances and secret detentions was communicated to the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances by numerous non-governmental 
organizations. It was reported that police officers in civilian clothes were forcing people into 
vehicles and taking them to unofficial places of detentions, such as the Maharajgunj Police 
Training Centre.<b>129</b> 
</p>
<p>82. In Sri Lanka, the protracted conflict between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has perpetuated the use of secret detention.<b>130</b> In general, Sri Lankan army 
officials, dressed either in military uniform or civilian clothes, would arrest ethnic Tamils and 
hold them in secret places of detention for a week or longer. One such location mentioned in the 
report of the Special Rapporteur on torture was an army camp located off Galle Road, 
Kollupitiya, Colombo. The detainees were often interrogated under torture, the purpose of which 
was to make them confess their involvement with the LTTE.<b>131 </b>In 1992, the Government adopted 
a law giving more power to the armed forces and authorizing the use of secret detention 
camps.<b>132 </b>Although the emergency regulations subsequently issued in June 1993 outlawed secret 
detention, there were reliable reports indicating that people continued to be held in undisclosed 
places where torture was practised, and no action was taken against the perpetrators.<b>133</b> 
</p>
<p>83. In the Philippines, the practice of secret detention or &#8220;safe houses&#8221; was not formally 
banned until the establishment of the Presidential Committee in 1986.<b>134 </b>These practices were 
not uncommon in the preceding years during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, especially 
when martial law was in force.

affected both communities living on the island, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike. The 
United Nations has long been engaged in the various processes for resolution of both the Cyprus 
problem<b>135 </b>and the question of missing persons.<b>136 </b>In 1975, the Commission on Human Rights 
called for the intensification of efforts aimed at tracing and accounting for missing persons,<b>137 </b>a 
call echoed by the General Assembly in its resolution 3450 (XXX), in which it also requested the 
Secretary-General to make every effort for the accomplishment of the same objective through 
close cooperation with ICRC. 
</p>
<p>85. Notwithstanding the above-mentioned calls and the one for the establishment of an 
investigatory body under the chair of ICRC,<b>138</b> the question of missing persons remained at a 
deadlock until 1981. In its first report, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances included Cyprus in its country survey, but decided not to provide an analysis of 
the situation because of the delicate and complex nature of the question.<b>139</b> In 1981, an 
agreement between the two communities was reached under the auspices of the United Nations, 
by which the Committee on Missing Persons was created.<b>140</b> Its mandate is solely to establish the 
fate of the missing persons. In this regard, 502 cases of Turkish Cypriots and 1493 of Greek 
Cypriots have been officially reported to it as missing. Despite the position of the Working 
Group that its role was to assist the Committee,<b>141</b> the Committee&#8217;s function remained at a 
standstill. A 31 July 1997 agreement between the leaders of the two communities to provide each 
other all information at their disposal on the location of graves did not yield any practical 
result.142 Finally, following a change of political stance by both communities, the Committee 
resumed its work in 2004. To date, 585 exhumations and 196 identifications have been made.<b>143</b>

Turkish Cypriots were declared inadmissible in 2002.<b>144</b> In the cases of <i>Cyprus v. Turkey<b></b></i><b>145</b> and

</p>
<p><b>C. The United Nations and regional responses towards the  
outlawing of the practice of secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>87. The United Nations has paid increasing attention to the issue of secret detention and its 
relation to enforced disappearances since 1978, in the context of denunciations by numerous 
non-governmental organizations and widespread concerns with human rights situations in Chile, 
Cyprus and Argentina. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was one of the first 
international human rights bodies to respond to the phenomenon of enforced disappearances and 
secret detentions during the 1970s, both in general terms and with regard to specific cases in 
Chile since the military <i>coup d&#8217;&#233;tat</i> of 11 September 1973.<b>147 </b> 
</p>
<p>88. In 1978, the General Assembly, deeply concerned by reports from various parts of the 
world relating to enforced or involuntary disappearances of persons as a result of excesses on the 
part of law enforcement or security authorities or similar organizations, adopted a resolution 
dealing specifically with disappeared persons and requested the Commission on Human Rights 
to make appropriate recommendations.<b>148</b> On 6 March 1979, the Commission established a 
mandate for experts to study the question of the fate of missing and disappeared persons in Chile. 
In his report, Felix Ermacora, the expert in charge of the study, proposed, inter alia<i>,</i> a number of 
preventive measures, such as the prohibition of secret places of detention, the maintenance of a 
central register of arrest and detention, the right of civilian judges to visit all places of 
detention.<b>149</b>  
</p>
<p>89. Subsequently, the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1979/38, requested the 
Commission on Human Rights to consider, as a matter of priority, the question of disappeared

persons, with a view to making appropriate recommendations at its thirty-sixth session. It also 
requested the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to 
consider the subject with a view to making general recommendations to the Commission at its 
intervening session. 
</p>
<p>90. In its resolution 5 B (XXXII), the Subcommission pointed out that the danger involved for 
such disappeared persons warranted urgent reaction on the part of all individuals and institutions, 
as well as of Governments.150 It considered the question of enforced and involuntary 
disappearances at its thirty-fourth session; on 10 September 1981, it adopted resolution 15 
(XXXIV), in which it reiterated, inter alia, the right of families to know the fate of their relatives, 
and strongly appealed for the reappearance of all detainees held in secret detention.<b>151</b> 
</p>
<p>91. In 1980, the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 20 (XXXVI), created a 
working group to examine questions relevant to enforced or involuntary disappearances of 
persons. The same year, the General Assembly, in its resolution 35/193, welcomed the 
establishment of the group and appealed to all Governments to cooperate with it.  
</p>
<p>92. The Subcommission decided, in its resolution 1983/23, that, at its next session, it would 
prepare a first draft of a declaration against unacknowledged detention of persons, whatever their 
condition.<b>152</b> In 1984, a first draft was discussed in the Subcommission&#8217;s Working Group on 
Detention, as a result of which the Subcommission, in its resolution 1984/3, requested the 
Working Group to submit a revised draft declaration to the Subcommission at its thirty-eighth 
session.<b>153</b> The purpose of the draft was to provide for a commitment that Governments (a) 
disclose the identity, location and condition of all persons detained by members of their police, 
military or security authorities acting with their knowledge, together with the cause of such 
detention; and (b) seek to locate all other persons who have disappeared. In countries where 
legislation did not exist to this effect, steps should be taken to enact such legislation as soon as 
possible. However, the resolution was not adopted by the Commission on Human Rights in 
1985, and was referred back to the Subcommission for reconsideration.<b>154 </b> 
</p>
<p>93. Following the 1988 session of the Working Group on Detention, a draft declaration on the 
protection of all persons from enforced or involuntary disappearances was proposed and, 
following amendments by the intersessional working group, was adopted first by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1992/29, then in the same year by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 47/133.

94. Ever since, the Commission continuously called upon its special rapporteurs and working 
groups to give special attention to questions relating to the effective protection of human rights 
in the administration of justice, in particular with regard to unacknowledged detention of 
persons, and to provide, wherever appropriate, specific recommendation in this regard, including 
proposals for possible concrete measures under advisory services programmes.<b>155</b> 
</p>
<p>95. In 1988, in its resolution 43/173, the General Assembly adopted the Body of Principles for 
the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. This was the result 
of a long-standing process of ascertaining detainees&#8217; rights that had begun under the 
Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.<b>156</b> This instrument 
provides for the application of a set of safeguards while in detention, compliance with which in 
principle would avoid or substantially decrease the likelihood of threat to life and limb of 
detainees.<b>157</b> The adoption of the document served as an incentive for the elaboration of 
complementary regional instruments, such as the Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition 
and Prevention of Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa,<b>158</b> 
adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in its resolution 61 (XXXII) 
02 (2002), and the Principles and Best Practices on the Protection of Persons Deprived of Liberty 
in the Americas,<b>159 </b>of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>96. Other instances have contributed to outlawing practices of secret detention. As early as 
1978, the Human Rights Committee received the first communication under the Optional 
Protocol relating to a disappearance and secret detention case in Uruguay. The case concerned a 
certain Mr. Bleier, suspected of being connected with the subversive activities of the banned 
Communist Party, who had been arrested by that country&#8217;s authorities without a court order in 
October 1975 and was being held incommunicado at an unknown place of detention.160 The

Committee found that the Government of Uruguay was in breach of articles 7, 9 and 10.1 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>97. A decisive moment in the long-standing process of outlawing practices of secret detention 
was the adoption of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Forced 
Disappearance, which has been open for signature and ratification since 6 February 2007.161 This 
process started in 2001, when the Commission on Human Rights requested a study to identify 
any gaps in the existing international criminal and human rights framework with a view to 
drafting a legally-binding normative instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced 
disappearance.<b>162 </b>On the basis of the study prepared by an independent expert on the existing 
international criminal and human rights framework for the protection of persons from enforced 
or involuntary disappearances,<b>163 </b>and with his assistance, the Commission drafted the 
International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Forced Disappearance, the final 
text of which was adopted by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 2006/1. The 
Convention contains elements necessary for filling the gaps in the framework of the current 
protection against enforced disappearances and secret detentions.

<p><b>IV. SECRET DETENTION PRACTICES IN THE GLOBAL  
&#8220;WAR ON TERROR&#8221; SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 
</b></p>
<p>98. In spite of the prominent role played by the United States of America in the development 
of international human rights and humanitarian law, and its position as a global leader in the 
protection of human rights at home and abroad following the terrorist attacks on New York and 
Washington, D.C. on 11 September 2001, the United States embarked on a process of reducing 
and removing various human rights and other protection mechanisms through various laws and 
administrative acts, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force,<b>164 </b>the USA Patriot Act 
of 2001, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (which 
sought to remove <i>habeas corpus</i> rights), as well as various executive orders and memoranda 
issued by the Office of Legal Counsel that interpreted the position of the United States on a

<p><b>164 </b> &#8220;Joint Resolution: To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those 
responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States&#8221;, 17 September 2001. This 
authorized the President &#8220;to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, 
organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist 
attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order 
to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, 
organizations or persons.&#8221;  </p>

number of issues, including torture. It also sanctioned the establishment of various classified 
programmes much more narrowly than before.<b>165</b> 
</p>
<p>99. The Government of the United States declared a global &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, in which 
individuals captured around the world were to be held neither as criminal suspects, put forward 
for federal court trials in the United States, nor treated as prisoners of war protected by the 
Geneva Conventions, irrespective of whether they had been captured on the battlefield during 
what could be qualified as an armed conflict in terms of international humanitarian law. Rather, 
they were to be treated indiscriminately as &#8220;unlawful enemy combatants&#8221; who could be held 
indefinitely without charge or trial or the possibility to challenge the legality of their detention 
before a court or other judicial authority. 
</p>
<p>100. On 7 February 2002, the President of the United States issued a memorandum declaring 
that &#8220;common article 3 of Geneva does not apply to either Al-Qaida or Taliban detainees&#8221;, that 
&#8220;Taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and, therefore, do not qualify as prisoners of war 
under article 4 of Geneva&#8221;, and that &#8220;because Geneva does not apply to our conflict with 
Al-Qaida, Al-Qaida detainees also do not qualify as prisoners of war&#8221;. This unprecedented 
departure from the Geneva Conventions was to be offset by a promise that, &#8220;as a matter of 
policy, the United States Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the 
extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the 
principles of Geneva&#8221;.<b>166 </b>This detention policy was defended by the Government in various 
submissions to the United Nations,<b>167 </b>including on 10 October 2007, when the Government 
stated that the law of war, and not the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was 
the applicable legal framework governing the detentions of &#8220;enemy combatants&#8221;,<b>168 </b>and therefore 
such detentions did not fall within the mandate of the special procedures mandate holders.<b>169</b> 
</p>
<p>101. By using this war paradigm, the United States purported to limit the applicable legal 
framework of the law of war (international humanitarian law) and exclude any application of 
human rights law. Even if and when human rights law were to apply, the Government was of the 
view that it was not bound by human rights law outside the territory of the United States. 
Therefore, by establishing detention centres in Guantanamo Bay and other places around the 
world, the United States was of the view that human rights law would not be applicable there. 
Guantanamo and other places of detention outside United States territory were intended to be 
outside the reach of domestic courts for <i>habeas corpus</i> applications by those held in custody in

those places.<b>170</b> One of the consequences of this policy was that many detainees were kept 
secretly and without access to the protection accorded to those in custody, namely the protection 
of the Geneva Conventions, international human rights law, the United States Constitution and 
various other domestic laws. 
</p>
<p>102. The secret detention policy took many forms. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
established its own secret detention facilities to interrogate so-called &#8220;high value detainees&#8221;. It 
asked partners with poor human rights records to secretly detain and interrogate persons on its 
behalf. When the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq started, the United States secretly held 
persons in battlefield detention sites for prolonged periods of time. The present chapter therefore 
focuses on various secret detention sites and those held there, and also highlights examples of the 
complicity of other States. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The &#8220;high-value detainee&#8221; programme and CIA secret detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>103. On 17 September 2001, President Bush sent a 12-page memorandum to the Director of the 
CIA through the National Security Council, which authorized the CIA to detain terrorists and set 
up detention facilities outside the United States.<b>171 </b>Until 2005, when the United Nations sent its 
first of many communications regarding this programme to the Government of the United States, 
little was known about the extent and the details of the secret detention programme. Only in 
May 2009 could a definitive number of detainees in the programme be established. In a released, 
yet still redacted, memo, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stephen G. Bradbury 
stated that, to date, the CIA had taken custody of 94 detainees [redacted], and had employed 
enhanced techniques to varying degrees in the interrogations of 28 of those detainees.<b>172</b> 
</p>
<p>104. In the report of 2007 on his country visit to the United States (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3), the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism<b> </b>described what was known at that time of these &#8220;enhanced 
techniques&#8221; and how they were regarded: 
</p>
<p>As a result of an apparent internal leak from the CIA, the media in the United States 
learned and published information about &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; used by the 
CIA in its interrogation of terrorist suspects and possibly other persons held because of

its long-standing position that &#8220;the Covenant does not apply extraterritorially&#8221;

<p>their links with such suspects. Various sources have spoken of techniques involving 
physical and psychological means of coercion, including stress positions, extreme 
temperature changes, sleep deprivation, and &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; (means by which an 
interrogated person is made to feel as if drowning). With reference to the well-established 
practice of bodies such as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against 
Torture, the Special Rapporteur concludes that these techniques involve conduct that 
amounts to a breach of the prohibition against torture and any form of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>105. Several of the 28 detainees who, according to Mr. Bradbury, were subjected to &#8220;enhanced 
techniques to varying degrees&#8221; were also &#8220;high value detainees&#8221;. Fourteen people were 
transferred from secret CIA custody in an undisclosed location to confinement at the Defense 
Department&#8217;s detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, as announced by President Bush on

facts reported in opinion No. 29/2006 (United States of America), adopted by the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention on 1 September 2006,<b>176 </b>the only available source on the 
conditions in the above-mentioned facilities is a report by ICRC leaked to the media by 
United States Government officials.<b>177 </b>In spite of the fact that the ICRC report was never 
officially published, the experts decided to refer to it since information on the 14 was scarce and 
the United States of America, in spite of requests to be allowed to speak to Guantanamo 
detainees,<b>178 </b>did not authorize them to do so. That report details the treatment that most of the 14 
had described during individual interviews, and concluded that there had been cases of beatings, 
kicking, confinement in a box, forcible shaving, threats, sleep deprivation, deprivation/restriction 
on food provisions, stress positions, exposure to cold temperatures/cold water, suffocation by 
water and so on. It stressed that, for the entire detention periods, which ranged from 16 months 
to more than 3 and a half years, all 14 persons had been held in solitary confinement and 
incommunicado detention. According to the report, they had no knowledge of where they were 
being held, and no contact with persons other than their interrogators or guards.&#8221;<b>177</b> ICRC

<p>regime. This regime was clearly designed to undermine human dignity and to create a 
sense of futility by inducing, in many cases, severe physical and mental pain and suffering, 
with the aim of obtaining compliance and extracting information, resulting in exhaustion, 
depersonalization and dehumanization. The allegations of ill-treatment of the detainees 
indicate that, in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in 
the CIA program, either singly, or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many 
other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel 
inhuman or degrading treatment.&#8221;<b> 177</b> 
</p>
<p>107. Despite the acknowledgement in September 2006 by President Bush of the existence of 
secret CIA detention facilities, the United States Government and the Governments of the States 
that hosted these facilities have generally refused to disclose their location or even existence. The 
specifics of the secret sites have, for the most part, been revealed through off-the-record 
disclosures.  
</p>
<p>108. In November 2005, for example, the <i>Washington Post</i> referred to &#8220;current and former 
intelligence officers and two other US Government officials&#8221; as sources for the contention that 
there had been a secret CIA black site or safe house in Thailand, &#8220;which included underground 
interrogation cells&#8221;. <b>179</b> One month later, ABC news reported on the basis of testimonies from 
&#8220;current and former CIA officers&#8221; that Abu Zubaydah had been:  
</p>
<p>Whisked by the CIA to Thailand where he was housed in a small, disused warehouse on an 
active airbase. There, his cell was kept under 24-hour closed circuit TV surveillance and 
his life-threatening wounds were tended to by a CIA doctor specially sent from Langley 
headquarters to assure Abu Zubaydah was given proper care, sources said. Once healthy, 
he was slapped, grabbed, made to stand long hours in a cold cell, and finally handcuffed 
and strapped feet up to a water board until after 0.31 seconds he begged for mercy and 
began to cooperate.<b>180 </b> 
</p>
<p>The details of Abu Zubaydah&#8217;s treatment have been confirmed by his initial FBI interrogator, 
who has not confirmed or denied that the location where Abu Zubaydah was held was in 
Thailand.<b>181</b> The <i>Washington Post</i> also reported that the officials had stated that Ramzi

Binalshibh had been flown to Thailand after his capture.<b>182</b> The <i>New York Times</i> again stated in 
2006 that Abu Zubaydah was held in Thailand &#8220;according to accounts from five former and 
current government officials who were briefed on the case.&#8221;<b>183</b> In January 2008, the <i>Asia Times</i> 
reported that political analysts and diplomats in Thailand suspected that the detention facility 
was &#8220;situated at a military base in the northeastern province of Udon Thani&#8221;.<b>184 </b> 
</p>
<p>109. The sources of the <i>Washington Post</i> stated that, after &#8220;published reports revealed the 
existence of the site in June 2003, Thai officials insisted the CIA shut it down&#8221;.<b>182 </b>The<i> New York 
Times</i> alleged later that local officials were said to be growing uneasy about &#8220;a black site outside 
Bangkok code-named Cat&#8217;s Eye&#8221; and that this was a reason for the CIA to want &#8220;its own, more 
permanent detention centers&#8221;.<b>185</b> 
</p>
<p>110. In 2008, the <i>Washington Post</i> described on the basis of interviews with &#8220;more than two 
dozen current and former U.S. officials&#8221; how a &#8220;classified cable&#8221; had been sent between the CIA 
station chief in Bangkok and his superiors &#8220;asking if he could destroy videotapes recorded at a 
secret CIA prison in Thailand &#8230; from August to December 2002 to demonstrate that 
interrogators were following the detailed rules set by lawyers and medical experts in 
Washington, and were not causing a detainee&#8217;s death.&#8221; The newspaper also reported &#8220;several of 
the inspector general&#8217;s deputies traveled to Bangkok to view the tapes.&#8221; <b>186</b> The Office of the 
Inspector General reviewed 92 videotapes in May 2003, 12 of which included &#8220;enhanced 
interrogation techniques&#8221; and identified 83 waterboarding sessions on Abu Zubaydah at a 
&#8220;foreign site&#8221;. From the OIG report it seems that Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri 
were detained and interrogated at the same place.<b>187</b> This information could not be verified, as

independent sources informed the experts that the facility was indeed in Thailand and that it was 
known as the &#8220;Cat&#8217;s Eye&#8221;. The videotapes were however allegedly destroyed in November 2005 
by the CIA and, according to the <i>New York Times</i>, the tapes had been held &#8220;in a safe at the CIA 
station in Thailand, the country where two detainees - Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim 
al-Nashiri - were interrogated.&#8221;<b>188</b> 
</p>
<p>111. In its submission for the present study, the Government of Thailand denied the existence of 
a secret detention facility in Thailand in 2002/03, stating that international and local media had 
visited the suspected places and found no evidence of such a facility. In the light of the detailed 
nature of the allegations, however, the experts believe it credible that a CIA black site existed in 
Thailand, and calls on the domestic authorities to launch an independent investigation into the 
matter. 
</p>
<p>112. In June 2007, in a report submitted to the Council of Europe, rapporteur Dick Marty stated 
that he had enough &#8220;evidence to state that secret detention facilities run by the CIA did exist in 
Europe from 2003 to 2005, in particular in Poland and Romania.&#8221;<b>189</b> The report drew on 
testimony from over 30 current and former members of intelligence services in the United States 
and from Europe. According to the Rapporteur, the Romanian &#8220;black site&#8221; was allegedly in force 
from 2003 to the second half of 2005. He also noted that &#8220;the majority of the detainees brought 
to Romania were, according to our sources, extracted &#8216;out of [the] theater of conflict&#8217;. This 
phrase is understood as a reference to detainee transfers originating from Afghanistan and, later, 
Iraq&#8221;.<b>189</b> In August 2009, former United States intelligence officials disclosed to the <i>New York 
Times</i>, that Kyle D. Foggo, at that time head of the CIA&#8217;s main European supply base in 
Frankfurt, oversaw the construction of three CIA detention centres, &#8220;each built to house about a 
half-dozen detainees&#8221;. They added that &#8220;one jail was a renovated building on a busy street in 
Bucharest&#8221;.<b>190 </b> 
</p>
<p>113. While the identities of many detainees who were held in these facilities have not been 
revealed yet, it is known that on or around 24 April 2004, Mohammed al-Asad (see para. 133 
below) was transferred with at least two other people from Afghanistan to an unknown, modern 
facility apparently run by United States officials, which was carefully designed to induce 
maximum disorientation, dependence and stress in the detainees. Descriptions of the facility and 
its detention regime were given by Mr. al-Asad to Amnesty International, which established that

he had been held in the same place as two other Yemeni men, Salah Ali and Mohammed Farag 
Ahmad Bashmilah.<b>191</b> Research into flight durations and the observations of Mr. al-Asad, 
Mr. Ali, and Mr. Bashmilah suggest that the facility was likely located in Eastern Europe. 
Mr. al-Asad was held in a rectangular cell approximately 3.5x2.5 m, in which he was chained to 
the floor in the corner. The first night, Mr. al-Asad was kept naked in his cell. The cell included a 
speaker, which played noise similar to an engine or machine, and two cameras. For most of his 
time in the facility, the light in his cell was kept on all night. At one point, Mr. al-Asad met with 
a man who identified himself as the prison director and claimed that he had just flown in from 
Washington, D.C. Similarly, Mr. Bashmilah described how the facility where he was held was 
much more modern than the one in Afghanistan. White noise was blasted into his cell, the light 
was kept on constantly, and he was kept shackled. The guards in the facility were completely 
dressed in black, including black face masks, and communicated to one another by hand gestures 
only. The interrogators spoke to each other in English and referred to information arriving from 
Washington, D.C.192 On 5 March 2005, the United States informed Yemen that Mr. Bashmilah 
was in American custody. On 5 May 2005, Mr. Bashmilah was transferred to Yemen, along with 
two other Yemeni nationals, Mr. al-Asad and Salah Nasser Salim Ali Darwish.

Mohammed Omar Abdel-Rahman<b>197</b> were also detained in the facility in Poland. The Polish 
press subsequently claimed that the authorities of Poland - during the term of office of President 
Aleksander Kwa&#347;niewski and Prime Minister Leszek Miller - had assigned a team of &#8220;around a 
dozen&#8221; intelligence officers to cooperate with the United States on Polish soil, thereby putting 
them under exclusive American control and had permitted American &#8220;special purpose planes&#8221; to 
land on the territory of Poland.<b>198 </b>The existence of the facility has always been denied by the 
Government of Poland and press reports have indicated that it is unclear what Polish authorities 
knew about the facility. 
</p>
<p>115. While denying that any terrorists had been detained in Poland, Zbigniew Siemi&#261;tkowski, 
the head of the Polish Intelligence Agency in the period 2002-2004, confirmed the landing of 
CIA flights.<b>199 </b>Earlier, the Marty report had included information from civil aviation records 
revealing how CIA-operated planes used for detainee transfers landed at Szymany airport, near 
the town of Szczytno, in Warmia-Mazuria province in north-eastern Poland, and at the Mihail 
Kogalniceanu military airfield in Romania between 2003 and 2005. Marty also explained how 
flights to Poland were disguised by using fake flight plans.<b>200 </b> 
</p>
<p>116. In research conducted for the present study, complex aeronautical data, including &#8220;data 
strings&#8221;<b>201</b> retrieved and analysed, have added further to this picture of flights disguised using 
fake flight plans and also front companies. For example, a flight from Bangkok to Szymany, 
Poland, on 5 December 2002 (stopping at Dubai) was identified, though it was disguised under 
multiple layers of secrecy, including charter and sub-contracting arrangements that would avoid

filings of initial flight plans come from diverse entities, including aviation service providers, Air 
Navigation Services authorities, airport authorities and Government agencies. Specialist 
operators of the Integrated Initial Flight Plan Processing System (IFPS) process each message,

there being any discernible &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; of a United States Government operation, as well as 
the filing of &#8220;dummy&#8221; flight plans. The experts were made aware of the role of the CIA chief 
aviation contractor through sources in the United States. The modus operandi was to charter 
private aircraft from among a wide variety of companies across the United States, on short-term 
leases to match the specific needs of the CIA Air Branch. Through retrieval and analysis of 
aeronautical data, including data strings, it is possible to connect the aircraft N63MU with three 
named American corporations, each of which provided cover in a different set of aviation 
records for the operation of December 2002. The aircraft&#8217;s owner was and remains &#8220;International 
Group LLC&#8221;; its registered operator for the period in question was &#8220;First Flight Management&#8221;; 
and its registered user in the records of the Eurocontrol Central Route Charges Office, which 
handles the payment of bills, was &#8220;Universal Weather&#8221;. Nowhere in the aviation records 
generated by this aircraft is there any explicit recognition that it carried out a mission associated 
with the CIA. Research for the present study also made clear that the aviation services provider 
Universal Trip Support Services filed multiple dummy flight plans for the N63MU in the period 
from 3 to 6 December 2002. In a report, the CIA Inspector General discussed the interrogations 
of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Two United States sources with knowledge of 
the high-value detainees programme informed the experts that a passage revealing that 
&#8220;enhanced interrogation of al-Nashiri continued through 4 December 2002&#8221; and another, 
partially redacted, which stated that:  
</p>
<p>However, after being moved, al-Nashiri was thought to have been withholding 
information&#8221;, indicate that it was at this time that he was rendered to Poland. The passages 
are partially redacted because they explicitly state the facts of al-Nashiri&#8217;s rendition - 
details which remain classified as &#8220;Top Secret&#8221;.<b>202</b> 
</p>
<p>117. Using a similar analysis of complex aeronautical data, including data strings, research was 
also able to demonstrate that a Boeing 737 aircraft, registered with the Federal Aviation 
Administration as N313P, flew to Romania in September 2003. The aircraft took off from Dulles 
Airport in Washington, D.C. on Saturday 20 September 2003, and undertook a four-day flight 
&#8220;circuit&#8221;, during which it landed in and departed from six different foreign territories - the Czech 
Republic, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Morocco - as well as Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba. Focus was also placed on a flight between the two listed European &#8220;black site&#8221; 
locations - namely from Szymany (Poland) to Bucharest - on the night of 22 September 2003, 
although it was conceivable that as many as five consecutive individual routes on this circuit - 
beginning in Tashkent, concluding in Guantanamo - may have involved transfers of detainees in 
the custody of the CIA. The experts were not able to identify any definitive evidence of a 
detainee transfer into Romania taking place prior to the flight circuit. 
</p>
<p>118. In its response to the questionnaire sent by the experts, Poland stated that:  
</p>
<p>On 11 March 2008, the district Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Warsaw instituted proceedings on 
the alleged existence of so-called secret CIA detention facilities in Poland as well as the 
illegal transport and detention of persons suspected of terrorism. On 1 April 2009, as result 
of the reorganization of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the investigation was referred to the

<p>Appellate Prosecutor Office in Warsaw. In the course of investigation, the prosecutors 
gathered evidence, which is considered classified or secret. In order to secure the proper 
course of proceedings, the prosecutors who conduct the investigation are bound by the 
confidentiality of the case. In this connection, it is impossible to present any information 
regarding the findings of the investigation. Once the proceedings are completed and its 
results and findings are made public the Government of Poland will present and submit all 
necessary or requested information to any international body. 
</p>
<p>While the experts appreciate the fact that an investigation has been opened into the existence of 
places of secret detention in Poland, they are concerned about the lack of transparency into the 
investigation. After 18 months, still nothing is known about the exact scope of the investigation. 
The experts expect that any such investigation would not be limited to the question of whether 
Polish officials had created an &#8220;extraterritorial zone&#8221; in Poland, but also whether officials were 
aware that &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; were applied there. 
</p>
<p>119.  In its response to the questionnaire sent by the experts, Romania provided a copy of the 
report of the Committee of Enquiry of Parliament concerning the investigation of the statements 
on the existence of CIA imprisonment centres or of flights of aircraft hired by the CIA on the 
territory of Romania.<b>203</b> 
</p>
<p>120. With regard to Europe, ABC news recently reported that Lithuanian officials had provided 
the CIA with a building where as many as eight terrorist suspects were held for more than a year, 
until late 2005, when they were moved because of public disclosure of the programme.<b>204</b> More 
details emerged in November 2009 when ABC news reported that the facility was built inside an 
exclusive riding academy in Antaviliai.<b>205</b> Research for the present study, including data strings 
relating to Lithuania, appears to confirm that Lithuania was integrated into the secret detention 
programme in 2004. Two flights from Afghanistan to Vilnius could be identified: the first, from 
Bagram, on 20 September 2004, the same day that 10 detainees previously held in secret 
detention, in a variety of countries, were flown to Guantanamo; the second, from Kabul, on 28 
July 2005. The dummy flight plans filed for the flights into Vilnius customarily used airports of

alternate or back-up landing point. 
</p>
<p>121. On 25 August 2009, the President of Lithuania announced that her Government would 
investigate allegations that Lithuania had hosted a secret detention facility. On 5 November 
2009, the Lithuanian Parliament opened an investigation into the allegation of the existence of a 
CIA secret detention on Lithuanian territory. In its submission for the present study, the 
Government of Lithuania provided the then draft findings of this investigation, which in the 
meantime had been adopted by the full Parliament. In its findings, the Seimas Committee stated 
that the State Security Department (SSD) had received requests to &#8220;equip facilities in Lithuania 
suitable for holding detainees&#8221;. In relation to the first facility, the Committee found that 
&#8220;conditions were created for holding detainees in Lithuania&#8221;. The Committee could not 
conclude, however, that the premises were also used for that purpose. In relation to the second 
facility, the Committee found that:  
</p>
<p>The persons who gave testimony to the Committee deny any preconditions for and 
possibilities of holding and interrogating detainees &#8230; However, the layout of the building, 
its enclosed nature and protection of the perimeter as well as fragmented presence of the 
SSD staff in the premises allowed for the performance of actions by officers of the partners 
without the control of the SSD and use of the infrastructure at their discretion. 
</p>
<p>The report also found that there was no evidence that the SSD had informed the President, the 
Prime Minister or other political leaders of the purposes and contents of its cooperation with the 
CIA regarding these two premises.  
</p>
<p>122. While the experts welcome the work of the Seimas Committee as an important starting 
point in the quest for truth about the role played by Lithuania in the secret detention and 
rendition programme, they stress that its findings can in no way constitute the final word on the 
country&#8217;s role. On 14 January 2010, President Dalia Grybauskaite rightly urged Lithuanian 
prosecutors to launch a deeper investigation into secret CIA black sites held on the country&#8217;s 
territory without parliamentary approval.<b>206</b> 
</p>
<p>123. The experts stress that all European Governments are obliged under the European 
Convention of Human Rights to investigate effectively allegations of torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.<b>207</b> Failure to investigate effectively might lead to a situation 
of grave impunity, besides being injurious to victims, their next of kin and society as a whole, 
and fosters chronic recidivism of the human rights violations involved. The experts also note that 
the European Court of Human Rights has applied the test of whether &#8220;the authorities reacted 
effectively to the complaints at the relevant time&#8221;.<b>208 </b>A thorough investigation should be capable 
of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for any ill treatment; it &#8220;must

be &#8216;effective&#8217; in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be 
unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities&#8221;.<b>209 </b>Furthermore, according 
to the European Court, authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what 
happened<b>210 </b>and &#8220;should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation 
or as the basis of their decisions&#8221;.<b>211</b> 
</p>
<p>124. According to two high-ranking Government officials at the time, revelations about the 
existence of detention facilities in Eastern Europe in late 2005 by the <i>Washington Post</i> and ABC 
news led the CIA to close its facilities in Lithuania and Romania and move the Al-Qaida 
detainees out of Europe. It is not known where these persons were transferred; they could have 
been moved into &#8220;war zone facilities&#8221; in Iraq and Afghanistan<b>204</b> or to another black site, 
potentially in Africa. The experts were not able to find the exact destination of the 16 high-value 
detainees between December 2005 and their move to Guantanamo in September 2006. No other 
explanation has been provided for the whereabouts of the detainees before they were moved to 
Guantanamo in September 2006. 
</p>
<p>125.  Other locations have been mentioned as the venues for secret detention facilities<b> </b>outside 
territories under United States control (or operated jointly with the United States military). The 
first is Guantanamo, which was mentioned by the United States officials who spoke to the<i> 
Washington Post</i> in 2005, when it was reported that the detention facility had existed &#8220;on the 
grounds of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay&#8221;, but that &#8220;some time in 2004, the CIA 
decided it had to give [it] up &#8230; The CIA had planned to convert it into a state-of-the-art facility, 
operated independently of the military [but] pulled out when US courts began to exercise greater 
control over the military detainees, and agency officials feared judges would soon extend the 
same type of supervision over their detainees&#8221;.<b>212 </b>More recently, former Guantanamo Bay guards 
have described &#8220;an unnamed and officially unacknowledged&#8221; compound located out of sight 
from the main road between two plateaus, about a mile north of Camp Delta, just outside Camp 
America&#8217;s perimeter with the access road chained off. The unacknowledged &#8220;camp no&#8221; is 
described as having had no guard towers and being surrounded with concertina wire, with one 
part of the compound having &#8220;the same appearance as the interrogation centers at other prison 
camps&#8221;. At this point, it is unclear whether this facility was run by the CIA or the Joint Special 
Operations Command. The experts are concerned about the possibility that three Guantanamo

detainees (Salah Ahmed al-Salami, Mani Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal al-Zahrani) might 
have died during interrogations at this facility, instead of in their own cells, on 9 June 2006.<b>213</b>  
</p>
<p>126. There have also been claims that the United States used two military bases in the Balkans 
for secret detention: Camp Bondsteel, in Kosovo, and Eagle Base, in Tuzla, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. In November 2005, Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Alvaro 
Gil-Robles told <i>Le Monde</i> that the United States military ran a Guantanamo-type detention 
centre in Camp Bondsteel. He said he had been &#8220;shocked&#8221; by conditions at the centre, which he 
witnessed in 2002, and which resembled &#8220;a smaller version of Guantanamo&#8221;.<b>214</b> In December 
2005, the United Nations Ombudsman in Kosovo, Marek Antoni Nowicki, also spoke about 
Camp Bondsteel, saying &#8220;there can be no doubt that for years there has been a prison in the 
Bondsteel base with no external civilian or judicial oversight. The prison looks like the pictures 
we have seen of Guantanamo Bay&#8221;. Mr. Nowicki said that he had visited Camp Bondsteel in late 
2000 and early 2001, when it was the main detention centre for Kosovo Force (KFOR), the 
NATO-led peace-keeping force, but explained that he had had no access to the base since 
2001.<b>215 </b>The United States base in Tuzla was allegedly used to &#8220;process&#8221; eight detainees, 
including Nihad Karsic and Almin Hardaus. Around 25 September 2001, Karsic and Hardaus 
were arrested at work and taken to Butmir Base, then to Eagle Base, Tuzla, where they allegedly 
were held in secret detention. The men say that they were held in solitary confinement, stripped 
naked, forcibly kept awake, repeatedly beaten, verbally harassed, deprived of food and 
photographed.<b>216</b> 
</p>
<p>127. Further developments were witnessed in 2009. In October, three of the experts sent a letter 
to the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom,<b>217 </b>Pakistan and the Syrian Arab 
Republic regarding Mustafa Setmariam Nassar, aged 42, a Spanish citizen of Syrian origin and 
author of a number of books and other publications on Islam and jihad. They pointed to 
allegations received that, on an unknown date in October 2005, he had been apprehended in 
Pakistan by forces of the Pakistani intelligence on suspicion of having been involved in a number 
of terrorist attacks, including the 11 September 2001 attacks against the United States and the 11 
March 2004 bombings in Madrid. He was detained in Pakistan for a certain period of time

United States. While no official news of Mr. Nassar&#8217;s whereabouts has been received since his 
apprehension in October 2005, it is alleged that, in November 2005, he was held for some time at 
a military base facility under United States authority in Diego Garcia. It is now assumed that he 
is currently being held in secret detention in the Syrian Arab Republic. Official United States 
documents and web postings, as well as media reports, indicate that the United States authorities 
had been interested in Mr. Nassar before his disappearance in 2005. In June 2009, in response to 
a request made through Interpol by a Spanish judge for information relating to Mr. Nassar&#8217;s 
whereabouts, the FBI stated that Mr. Nassar was not in the United States at that time. The FBI 
did not, however, address whether Mr. Nassar was in United States custody elsewhere or 
whether it knew where he was then held. Following queries by non-governmental organizations 
regarding the whereabouts of Mr. Nassar, the CIA responded on 10 June 2009, stating that &#8220;the 
CIA can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records responsive to your 
request&#8221; and that, even if the CIA was in a position to answer the request, the records would be 
classified and protected from disclosure by United States laws.218 According to Reprieve, 
Mr. Nassar may have been transferred to Syrian custody.219 According to the Government of the 
United Kingdom, it has received assurances from the United States that it has not interrogated 
any terrorist suspect or terrorism-related detainee in Diego Garcia in any case since 11 
September 2001, and that the allegations of a CIA holding facility on the island are false. The 
Government was therefore confident that the allegations that Mr. Nassar had been held on Diego 
Garcia were inaccurate.

<p>128. Following the transfer of the 14 high-value detainees from CIA custody to Guantanamo, 
President Bush, in a delivered speech on 6 September 2006, announced the closure of the CIA&#8217;s 
&#8220;high-value detainee programme&#8221;. He stressed that, &#8220;as more high-ranking terrorists are 
captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical - and having a CIA 
programme for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving 
information&#8221;.<b>220 </b>Later in 2006 and in 2007, he indicated that &#8220;the CIA interrogation and 
detention program&#8221; would continue.<b>221 </b>Subsequent events support this claim as the Department

of Defense announced in 2007 and 2008 the transfer of high-value detainees from CIA custody 
to Guantanamo. 
</p>
<p>129. On 27 April 2007, the Department of Defense announced that another high-value detainee, 
Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, described as &#8220;a high-level member of Al-Qaida&#8221;, had been transferred to 
Guantanamo.<b>222 </b>On the same day, Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, stated that the 
detainee had been transferred to Defense Department custody that week from the CIA although 
he &#8220;would not say where or when al-Iraqi was captured or by whom&#8221;. However, a United States 
intelligence official stated that al-Iraqi &#8220;had been captured late last year in an operation that 
involved many people in more than one country&#8221;.<b>223 </b>Another high-value detainee, Muhammad 
Rahim, an Afghan described as a close associate of Osama bin Laden, was transferred to 
Guantanamo on 14 March 2008. In a press release, the Department of Defense stated that, &#8220;prior 
to his arrival at Guantanamo Bay, he was held in CIA custody&#8221;.<b>224 </b>According to reports in 
Pakistani newspapers, he was captured in Lahore in August 2007.<b>225</b> 
</p>
<p>130. The Government of the United States provided no further details about where the 
above-mentioned men had been held before their transfer to Guantanamo; however, although it 
is probable that al-Iraqi was held in another country, in a prison to which the CIA had access (it 
was reported in March 2009 that he &#8220;was captured by a foreign security service in 2006&#8221; and 
then handed over to the CIA),<b>226</b> the Department of Defense itself made it clear that the CIA had

66 prisoners in the CIA programme were regarded as less significant. Some of them were 
subsequently handed over to the United States military and transferred to Guantanamo, while 
others were rendered to the custody of their home countries or other countries. In very few cases 
were they released.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>132. Outside of the specific &#8220;high-value detainee&#8221; programme, most detainees were held in a 
variety of prisons in Afghanistan. Three of these are well-known: a secret prison at Bagram 
airbase, reportedly identified as &#8220;the Hangar;&#8221;<b>228 </b>and two secret prisons near Kabul, known as the 
&#8220;dark prison&#8221; and the &#8220;salt pit&#8221;. During an interview held with the experts, Bisher al-Rawi 
indicated that, in the dark prison, there were no lights, heating or decoration. His cell was about 
5x9 feet with a solid steel door and a hatch towards the bottom of it. He only had a bucket to use 
as a toilet, an old piece of carpet and a rusty steel bar across the width of the cell to hang people 
from. All the guards wore hoods with small eye holes, and they never spoke. Very loud music 
was played continuously. He also indicated that he had been subjected to sleep deprivation for up 
to three days and received threats. Binyam Mohamed provided a similar account to the experts, 
as did the lawyer of Khaled El-Masri and Suleiman Abdallah. The experts heard allegations 
about three lesser-known prisons, including one in the Panjshir valley, north of Kabul, and two 
others identified as Rissat and Rissat 2, but it was not yet possible to verify these allegations. Of 
the prisoners identified as having been held in secret CIA custody (in addition to the 
above-mentioned high-value detainees), seven were eventually released and four escaped from 
Bagram in July 2005, namely Abu Yahya al-Libi, a Libyan; Omar al-Faruq, a Kuwaiti, captured 
in Bogor, Indonesia, in 2002; Muhammad Jafar Jamal al-Kahtani, a Saudi, reportedly captured in 
Khost province, Afghanistan, in November 2006; and Abdullah Hashimi, a Syrian, also known 
as Abu Abdullah al-Shami.<b>229 </b>Five prisoners were reportedly returned to the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya in 2006: Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi; Hassan Raba&#8217;I and Khaled al-Sharif, both captured in 
Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2003, who had &#8220;spent time in a CIA prison in Afghanistan&#8221;; Abdallah 
al-Sadeq, seized in a covert CIA operation in Thailand in the spring of 2004; and Abu Munder 
al-Saadi, both held briefly before being rendered to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.<b>230</b> In May 2009,

to Abu Salim prison in Tripoli, although he refused to be interviewed. Human Rights Watch 
interviewed four other men, who claimed that, &#8220;before they were sent to the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, United States forces had tortured them in detention centers in Afghanistan, and 
supervised their torture in Pakistan and Thailand&#8221;. One of the four was Hassan Raba&#8217;i, also 
known as Mohamed Ahmad Mohamed al-Shoroeiya, who stated that, in mid-2003, in a place he 
believed was Bagram prison in Afghanistan, &#8220;the interpreters who directed the questions to us 
did it with beatings and insults. They used cold water, ice water. They put us in a tub with cold 
water. We were forced [to go] for months without clothes. They brought a doctor at the 
beginning. He put my leg in a plaster. One of the methods of interrogation was to take the plaster 
off and stand on my leg&#8221;.<b>231</b>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Laid Saidi, an Algerian seized in the United Republic of Tanzania on 10 May 2003, was 
handed over to Malawians in plain clothes who were accompanied by two middle-aged 
Caucasian men wearing jeans and T-shirts. Shortly after the expulsion, a lawyer 
representing Mr. Saidi&#8217;s wife filed an affidavit with a Tanzanian court, saying that 
immigration documents showed that Mr. Saidi had been deported through the border 
between Kasumulu, United Republic of Tanzania, and Malawi. He was held for a week 
in a detention facility in the mountains of Malawi, then rendered to Afghanistan, where 
he was held in the &#8220;dark prison&#8221;, the &#8220;salt pit&#8221; and another unidentified prison. About a 
year after he was seized, he was flown to Tunisia, where he was detained for another 
75 days, before being returned to Algeria, where he was released.<b>232</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Three Yemenis - Salah Nasser Salim Ali Darwish, seized in Indonesia in October 2003, 
Mohammed al-Asad and Mohammed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah - were held in a number 
of CIA detention facilities until their return to Yemen in May 2005, where they 
continued to be held, apparently at the request of the United States authorities. 
Mr. Bashmilah was detained by Jordanian intelligence agents in October 2003, when he 
was in Jordan to assist his mother who was having an operation. From 21 o 
26 October 2003, Mr. Bashmilah was detained without charge and subjected to torture 
and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, including prolonged beatings and being 
threatened with electric shocks and the rape of his mother and wife.233 A

<p>while countering terrorism to the Governments of the United States, Indonesia, Yemen 
and Jordan on the cases of Bashmilah and Salim Ali, who were both detained and 
tortured in Jordan.234 Only the latter country responded, declaring that no record 
showing that the two men had been arrested for the violations of either the penal, 
disciplinary or administrative codes, and that they did not have documented files 
indicating that they posed a security concern, eliminating the possibility of their arrest 
for what may be described as terrorism.<b>235</b> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
adopted its opinion No. 47/2005 (Yemen) on the case on 30 November 2005, declaring 
their detention to be arbitrary as being devoid of any legal basis. In its reply to the 
allegations, the Government of Yemen confirmed that Mr. Bashmilah and Mr. Salim Ali 
had been handed over to Yemen by the United States. According to the Government, 
they had been held in a security police facility because of their alleged involvement in 
terrorist activities related to Al-Qaida. The Government added that the competent 
authorities were still dealing with the case pending receipt of the persons&#8217; files from the 
United States authorities in order to transfer them to the Prosecutor.<b>236</b>

held for another six weeks, before being freed in Gaza.<b>239</b>

<p>&#8226; Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish national residing in Germany, interviewed by the experts for

transferred into the custody of the United States at that country&#8217;s airbase in Kandahar, 
Afghanistan, before being taken to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay on 1 February

2006, he told Reprieve that he had been seized by the Iranian authorities while returning 
from a religious visit to Pakistan with his wife and newborn child in December 2001, 
then handed over to the Afghan authorities, who handed him on to the CIA. He said that 
the Americans &#8220;asked me about my relationship with Al-Qaida. I told them I had 
nothing to do with Al-Qaida. They then put me in jail under circumstances that I can 
only recall with dread. I lived under unimaginable conditions that cannot be tolerated in 
a civilized society.&#8221; He said that he was first placed in an underground prison for 77 
days: &#8220;this room was so dark that we couldn&#8217;t distinguish nights and days. There was no 
window, and we didn&#8217;t see the sun once during the whole time.&#8221; He said that he was 
then moved to &#8220;prison number three&#8221;, where the food was so bad that his weight 
dropped substantially. He was then held in Bagram for 40 days before being flown to 
Guantanamo.<b>240</b>

<p>He was arrested in Iran in late 2001. He was held there for about three months before 
being handed over to the authorities in Afghanistan who in turn handed him over to 
the custody of the US. He was held in a prison in Kabul. During US custody, 
officials cut his clothes with scissors, left him naked and took photos of him before 
giving him Afghan clothes to wear. They then handcuffed his hands behind his back, 
blindfolded him and started interrogating him. The apparently Egyptian interrogator, 
accusing him of belonging to Al-Qaida, threatened him with death. He was put in an 
underground cell measuring approximately two metres by three metres with very 
small windows. He shared the cell with ten inmates. They had to sleep in shifts due 
to lack of space and received food only once a day. He spent three months there 
without ever leaving the cell. After three months, Walid al-Qadasi was transferred to 
Bagram, where he was interrogated for one month. His head was shaved, he was 
blindfolded, made to wear ear muffs and a mouth mask, handcuffed, shackled, 
loaded on to a plane and flown out to Guantanamo, where he was held in solitary 
confinement for one more month. In April 2004, after having been detained for two 
years, he was transferred to Sana&#8217;a prison in Yemen.

al-Huwari, an Algerian, transferred to Algerian custody from Guantanamo in November 2008; 
and Zakaria al-Baidany, also known as Omar al-Rammah, a Yemeni, still held at Guantanamo. 
According to Mr. al-Huwari, both were rendered to the &#8220;dark prison&#8221;, and were also held in other 
detention facilities in Afghanistan: &#8220;The Americans didn&#8217;t capture me. The Mafia captured me. 
They sold me to the Americans&#8221;. He added: &#8220;When I was captured, a car came around and 
people inside were talking Russian and Georgian. I also heard a little Chechnyan. We were 
delivered to another group who spoke perfect Russian. They sold us to the dogs. The Americans 
came two days later with a briefcase full of money. They took us to a forest, then a private plane

place about two hours away. He was kept naked for 22 days, at times shackled, and subjected to 
extreme climatic conditions and simulated drowning. After six months, he was transferred to 
United States custody, allegedly pursuant to the CIA rendition programme. He was taken to 
Kabul and held in the &#8220;dark prison&#8221; for nine months, where he suffered severe physical and 
psychological torture by unidentified persons. He was then transferred to Bagram airbase, where 
he was held for a further four months in United States custody. Again, he was allegedly 
subjected to severe physical and psychological torture by what he believed were the same 
unidentified persons he had encountered in the &#8220;dark prison&#8221;.<b>258</b> 
</p>
<p>135. Four others detainees, held in Bagram, are known because lawyers established contact with 
their families and filed <i>habeas corpus</i> petitions on their behalf: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Redha al-Najar, a Tunisian who was seized in Karachi in May 2002. 
&#8226; Amine Mohammad al-Bakri, a Yemeni who was seized in Bangkok on 
</p>
<p>28 December 2002 by agents of the intelligence services of the United States or of 
Thailand. Throughout 2003, his whereabouts were unknown. The Thai authorities 
confirmed to Mr. al-Bakri&#8217;s relatives that he had entered Thai territory, but denied 
knowing his whereabouts. In January 2004, Mr. al-Bakri&#8217;s relatives received a letter 
from him through ICRC, informing them that he was being kept in detention at the 
Bagram airbase. It was reported that Mr. al-Bakri was detained owing to his commercial 
connections with Mr. Khalifa, a cousin of Osama bin Laden later assassinated in 
Madagascar.<b>259</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Fadi al-Maqaleh, a Yemeni seized in 2004, who was sent to Abu Ghraib before Bagram. 
&#8226; Haji Wazir, an Afghan seized in the United Arab Emirates in late 2002.<b>260</b> 
</p>
<p>136. The whereabouts of 12 others are unknown, and the others remain to be identified. It is 
probable that some of these men have been returned to their home countries, and that others are 
still held in Bagram. The experts received allegations that the following men were also held: Issa 
al-Tanzani (Tanzanian), also identified as Soulayman al-Tanzani, captured in Mogadishu; Abu 
Naseem (Libyan), captured in Peshawar, Pakistan, in early 2003; Abou Hudeifa (Tunisian), 
captured in Peshawar, Pakistan, at the end of 2002; and Salah Din al-Bakistani, captured in 
Baghdad. Marwan Jabour also mentioned eight other prisoners. One was Yassir al-Jazeeri 
(Algerian), seized in Lahore, March 2003 (whom he met), and he heard about seven others: 
Ayoub al-Libi (Libyan), seized in Peshawar in January 2004; Mohammed (Afghan, born Saudi),

Adnan (nationality unknown), seized before June 2004; an unidentified Somali (possibly Shoeab 
as-Somali or Rethwan as-Somali); another unidentified Somali; and Marwan al-Adeni (Yemeni), 
seized in or around May 2003. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>137. Although the Government of the United States stated that the Geneva Conventions applied 
to detainees seized during the occupation, an unknown number of persons were deliberately held 
&#8220;off the books&#8221; and denied ICRC access. In Abu Ghraib, for example, the abuse scandal that 
erupted following the publication of photographs in April 2004 involved military personnel who 
were not only holding supposedly significant detainees delivered by the United States military, 
but others delivered by the CIA or United States Special Forces units. The existence of &#8220;ghost 
detainees&#8221;, who were clearly held incommunicado in secret detention, was later exposed in two 
United States investigations.  
</p>
<p>138. In August 2004, a report into detainee detentions in Iraq (chaired by former Secretary of 
Defense James R. Schlesinger) noted that &#8220;other Government agencies&#8221; had brought a number of 
&#8220;ghost detainees&#8221; to detention facilities, including Abu Ghraib, &#8220;without accounting for them, 
knowing their identities, or even the reason for their detention&#8221;, and that, on one occasion, a 
&#8220;handful&#8221; of these detainees had been &#8220;moved around the facility to hide them from a visiting 
ICRC team&#8221;.<b>261 </b> 
</p>
<p>139. In another report issued in August 2004, Lieutenant General Anthony R. Jones and Major 
General George R. Fay noted that eight prisoners in Abu Ghraib had been denied access to ICRC 
delegates by Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the Commander of the Coalition Joint Task 
Force in Iraq: &#8220;Detainee-14 was detained in a totally darkened cell measuring about 2 metres 
long and less than a metre across, devoid of any window, latrine or water tap, or bedding. On the 
door the delegates noticed the inscription &#8216;the Gollum&#8217;, and a picture of the said character from 
the film trilogy &#8216;The Lord of the Rings&#8217;.&#8221;<b>262</b> 
</p>
<p>140. Although the Schlesinger report noted the use of other facilities for &#8220;ghost detainees&#8221;, the 
locations of these other prisons, and the numbers of detainees held, have not yet been thoroughly 
investigated. In June 2004, the then United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 
admitted that a suspected leader of Ansar al-Aslam had been held for more than seven months 
without ICRC being notified of his detention; he also stated: &#8220;He was not at Abu Ghraib. He is 
not there now. He has never been there to my knowledge&#8221;.<b>263 </b>According to another report, the

prisoner was known as &#8220;Triple X&#8221; and his secret detention was authorized by Lieutenant General 
Ricardo Sanchez, who issued a classified order in November 2003 &#8220;directing military guards to 
hide [him] from Red Cross inspectors and keep his name off official rosters&#8221;.<b>264 </b>In addition, 
some locations may well be those in which prisoners died in United States custody. In 2006, 
Human Rights First published a report identifying 98 deaths in United States custody in Iraq, 
describing five deaths in CIA custody, including Manadel al-Jamadi, who died in Abu Ghraib, 
and others at locations including Forward Operating Base Tiger, in Anbar province, a forward 
operating base near Al-Asad, a base outside Mosul, a temporary holding camp near Nasiriyah 
and a forward operating base in Tikrit.<b>265</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Proxy detention sites 
</b></p>
<p>141. Since 2005, details have emerged of how the United States was not only secretly capturing, 
transferring and detaining people itself, but also transferring people to other States for the 
purpose of interrogation or detention without charge. The practice had apparently started almost 
simultaneously with the high-value detainee programme. The British Government<b>266 </b>transmitted 
to the experts a summary of conclusions and recommendations of the Intelligence and Security 
Committee report on rendition (2007), in which it was noted that &#8220;the Security Service and SIS 
were &#8230; slow to detect the emerging pattern of &#8220;renditions to detention&#8221; that occurred during 
2002&#8221;. The CIA appears to have been generally involved in the capture and transfer of prisoners, 
as well as in providing questions for those held in foreign prisons. Beyond that, a clear pattern is 
difficult to discern: some prisoners were subsequently returned to CIA custody (and were 
generally sent on to Guantanamo), while others were sent back to their home countries, or 
remained in the custody of the authorities in third countries.  
</p>
<p>142. The Government of the United States has acknowledged that &#8220;some enemy combatants 
have been transferred to their countries of nationality for continued detention.&#8221;<b>267</b> In its report to 
the Committee against Torture on 13 January 2006, the Government attempted to deflect 
criticism of its policy of sending detainees to countries with poor human rights records, including 
those where they might face the risk of torture, declaring that &#8220;the United States does not transfer 
persons to countries where the United States believes it is &#8216;more likely than not&#8217; that they will be

which a detainee is transferred that it will not torture the individual being transferred&#8221;.<b>268</b> Various 
United Nations bodies, including the experts<b>269</b> and the Committee against Torture,<b>270 </b>have 
criticized heavily this policy of &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; in a detailed way in the past, defining it 
as a clear violation of international law. They also expressed concern about the use of 
assurances.<b>271</b> 
</p>
<p>143. Given the prevailing secrecy regarding the CIA rendition programme, exact figures 
regarding the numbers of prisoners transferred to the custody of other Governments by the CIA 
without spending any time in CIA facilities are difficult to ascertain. Equally, little is known 
about the number of detainees who have been held at the request of other States, such as the 
United Kingdom and Canada. While several of these allegations cannot be backed up by other 
sources, the experts wish to underscore that the consistency of many of the detailed allegations 
provided separately by detainees adds weight to the inclusion of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, the 
Syrian Arab Republic, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Djibouti as proxy detention facilities where 
detainees have been held on behalf of the CIA. Serious concerns also exist about the role of 
Uzbekistan as a proxy detention site. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Jordan 
</b></p>
<p>144. At least 15 prisoners, mostly seized in Karachi, Pakistan, or in the Pankisi Gorge in 
Georgia, claim to have been rendered by the CIA to the main headquarters of the General 
Intelligence Department of Jordan in Amman, between September 2001 and 2004.<b>272</b> They 
include three men and one juvenile subsequently transferred to Guantanamo via Afghanistan:

<p>&#8226; As confirmed by the Government of Sweden in its response to a letter sent by the 
experts, following a decision made by the Government to refuse asylum in Sweden to 
the Egyptian citizens Mohammed Alzery and Ahmed Agiza and to expel them, they 
were deported to Egypt by the Swedish Security Police with the assistance of the 
United States authorities (CIA). Both have said that they were tortured in Egyptian 
custody.<b>281</b> Alzery was released on 12 October 2003 without charge or trial, but was 
placed under police surveillance. Ahmed Agiza had already been tried and sentenced in 
absentia by an Egyptian military court at the time of the decision by the Government of 
Sweden to deport him. In April 2004, the court&#8217;s decision was confirmed and Agiza was 
convicted on terrorism charges following a trial monitored by Human Rights Watch, 
which described it as &#8220;flagrantly unfair&#8221;.

<p>&#8226; Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi, a Libyan, an emir of the Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan, 
was seized by Pakistani officials in late 2001 while fleeing Afghanistan and was 
rendered to Egypt where, under torture, he claimed that there were links between 
Al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein, which were used by the United States administration to 
justify the invasion of Iraq. Also held in secret CIA detention sites in Afghanistan, and 
possibly in other countries, he was returned to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in 2006,

<p>&#8226; The eighth man, Ahmad Abou El-Maati, a Canadian-Egyptian national, was seized at 
Damascus airport on his arrival from Toronto on 11 November 2001. He was held in the 
Far Falestin prison in the Syrian Arab Republic until 25 January 2002, when he was 
transferred to Egyptian custody, where he remained in various detention sites (including 
in secret detention until August 2002) until his release on 7 March 2004. During the 
initial period of his detention in Egypt, he was subjected to heavy beatings and threats 
of rape against his sister. At a later stage during the secret detention phase, he was 
handcuffed with his hands behind his back practically continuously for 45 days in a 
solitary confinement cell, which he described as being very painful and which made it 
hard to use the toilet and wash. He was also subjected to sleep deprivation.<b>285</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>147. At least nine detainees were rendered by the CIA to the Syrian Arab Republic between 
December 2001 and October 2002, and held in Far Falestin, run by Syrian Military Intelligence. 
All those able to speak about their experiences explained that they were tortured. As in the case 
of Egypt (see para. 146 above), other men were seized at the request of the Canadian authorities: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Muhammad Haydar Zammar, a German national, was seized in Morocco on 8 
December 2001, and rendered by the CIA to Far Falestin on 22 December 2001. In 
October 2004, he was moved to an &#8220;unknown location&#8221;; in February 2007, he received 
a 12-year sentence from the Higher State Security Court. He was convicted of being a 
member of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, a crime punishable by death in the Syrian 
Arab Republic.<b>286</b> In its reply for the present study, the Government of Morocco 
indicated that the police had arrested Mr. Zammar following information that he had 
been implicated in the events of 11 September 2001. The Government also stated that 
Mr. Zammar had not been subjected to secret or arbitrary detention in Morocco, and that

<p>Jordan alleged that Mr. Arar had arrived in Amman as an ordinary passenger, but was 
asked to leave the country because his name was on a list of wanted terrorists, and given 
a choice of destination. It also alleged that he had asked to be voluntarily taken by car to 
the Syrian Arab Republic.<b>293 </b>During his period at Far Falestin, he was severely beaten 
with a black cable and threatened with electric shocks. &#8220;The pattern was for Mr. Arar to 
receive three or four lashes with the cable then to be questioned, and then for the 
beating to begin again.&#8221;<b>294 </b>The torture allegations were found to be completely 
consistent with the results of the forensic examinations conducted in Canada. On 14 
August 2003, Mr. Arar was moved to Sednaya prison and released on 29 September. 
The official inquiry in the Arar case also stressed the catastrophic impact of the 
described events in terms of his and his family&#8217;s economic situation and his family life 
in general.<b>295</b>  
</p>
<p>148. When Ahmad Abou El-Maati (see para. 146) was held in Far Falestin in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, he was held in solitary confinement in poor conditions and subjected to ill-treatment, 
including blindfolding, forced to remove almost all his clothes, beaten with cables, forcible 
shaving and had ice-cold water poured on him.<b>296</b> Abdullah Almalki, a Canadian-Syrian national, 
also spent time in secret detention in the Syrian Arab Jamahiriya, in Far Falestin, from 3 May to 
7 July 2002, when he received a family visit. On 25 August 2003, he was sent to Sednaya prison. 
He was released on 10 March 2004. He returned to Canada on 25 July 2004 after being acquitted 
of all charges by the Syrian State Supreme Security court.<b>297</b>  
</p>
<p>149. Another Canadian, Muayyed Nureddin, an Iraqi-born geologist, was detained on the border 
of the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq on 11 December 2002, when he returned from a family 
visit in northern Iraq. He was secretly<b> </b>detained for a month in Far Falestin, then released 
on 13 January 2003.<b>298</b>

Republic stated that the country had no secret prisons or detention centres. There were no cases 
of secret detention, and no individuals had been arrested without the knowledge of the competent 
authorities. No authorization had been granted to the security service of any foreign State to 
establish secret detention facilities in the Syrian Arab Republic. A number of foreign individuals 
had been arrested in the country at the request of other States, and had been informed of the legal

informed of whether the individuals concerned had been brought before the Courts or transferred 
outside of the country. Individuals belonging to different terrorist groups had been prosecuted 
and detained in public prisons, in compliance with relevant international standards. They would 
be judged by the competent judicial authorities. Court proceedings would be public and be held 
in the presence of defence lawyers, families, human rights activists and foreign diplomats. Some 
would be publicized through the media. The Interpol branch within the Security Service of the 
Ministry of the Interior was cooperating with international Interpol branches with regard to 
suspected terrorist and other criminal activities.

and held in Temara prison, including the following:<b>299</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Abou Elkassim Britel, of Moroccan origin and an Italian citizen through marriage and 
naturalization, was seized in Lahore, Pakistan, on 10 March 2002. He stated that he was 
tortured in Pakistani custody. On 23 May 2002, he was rendered by the CIA to 
Morocco, where he was held in secret detention until February 2003, and where he 
alleged he was also tortured. He was released in February 2003, but in May 2003 was 
seized again, held for another four months in Temara, then sentenced to 15 years in 
prison, which was reduced to nine years on appeal.300 In its submission for the present 
study, the Government of Morocco stated that Mr. Britel had not been subjected to 
&#8220;arbitrary detention or torture&#8221; between May 2002 and February 2003, or between May 
and September 2003. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian national and British resident, was seized in Karachi, 
Pakistan, on 10 April 2002. He was held for approximately three months, during which 
time he was subjected to torture. On 21 July 2002, he was rendered by the CIA to 
Morocco, where he was held for 18 months in three different unknown facilities. During 
that period, he was allegedly threatened, subjected to particularly severe torture and 
other forms of ill-treatment; deprived from sleep for up to 48 hours at a time; and his 
prayers were interrupted by turning up the volume of pornographic movies. In 
January 2004, he was flown to the CIA &#8220;dark prison&#8221; in Kabul, and in May he was 
moved to Bagram. He was flown to Guantanamo on 20 September 2004, and was

<p><b>5.  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>152. From December 2001 until the summer of 2002, when the majority of the detainees who 
ended up in Guantanamo were seized, detention facilities in Pakistan, where several hundred 
detainees were held before being transferred to Kandahar or Bagram, were a crucial component 
of what was then, exclusively, a secret detention programme. Many of these men, seized near the 
Pakistani border, or while crossing from Afghanistan to Pakistan, were held in prisons in Kohat 
and Peshawar, but others were held in what appear to be impromptu facilities, which were 
established across the country in numerous locations. The then President of Pakistan, Pervez 
Musharraf, stated that:  
</p>
<p>Since shortly after 9/11, when many Al-Qaida members fled Afghanistan and crossed the 
border into Pakistan, we have played multiple games of cat and mouse with them. The 
biggest of them all, Osama bin Laden, is still at large at the time of this writing, but we 
have caught many, many others. Some are known to the world, some are not. We have 
captured 672 and handed over 369 to the United States. We have earned bounties totalling 
millions of dollars.<b>302</b> 
</p>
<p>153. Two former prisoners, Moazzam Begg and Omar Deghayes, described their experiences of 
secret detention in Pakistan to the experts: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Omar Deghayes, a Libyan national and British resident, was arrested in April 2002 at 
his home in Lahore after a hundred people in black tracksuits surrounded the house. In 
the presence of an American officer, he was then taken, handcuffed and hooded, to a 
police station and, shortly afterwards, to an old fortress outside Lahore, where he was 
held with other men from Palestine, Tunisia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Egypt, 
and beaten and kicked, and heard electroshocks and people screaming. According to his 
account, &#8220;the place was run by Pakistanis and appeared to be a maximum security 
prison for extremist opponents that were traded with different States such as Libya and 
the United States.&#8221; He also stated that he was tortured for a month without any contact 
with the external world, and that the ill-treatment included punching, beating, kicking, 
stripping, being hit in the back with wooden sticks, and stress positions for up to three 
days and three nights. In mid-May, two Americans in plain clothes visited, took 
photographs and asked questions. He was then moved to a place in Islamabad, which 
looked like a barracks, where he was held incommunicado for one month without access 
to a lawyer or ICRC, and was interrogated in a nearby house by American officers, who 
identified themselves as CIA, and, on one occasion, by a British agent from MI-6. He 
said that torture took place in the barracks but not during the interrogations, and that he 
was subjected to drowning and stress positions, and recalled a room full of caged snakes 
that guards threatened to open if he did not speak about what he had done in 
Afghanistan. He then met with British and American officers, who finally &#8220;acquired&#8221;

<p>him with other detainees, and took him to Bagram, where he was heavily tortured and 
sexually abused by American soldiers. He was flown to Guantanamo in August 2002, 
and released in December 2007.<b>303 </b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Moazzam Begg, a British citizen, moved to Kabul, with his wife and three children, to 
become a teacher and a charity worker in 2001. After leaving Afghanistan in the wake 
of the United States-led invasion, on 31 January 2002, he was abducted from a house in 
Islamabad, where he was living with his family, and taken to a place in Islamabad (not 
an official detention facility), where those who held him were not uniformed officers 
and there were people held in isolation. Held for three weeks, he was moved to a 
different venue for interviews with American and British intelligence officers, but his 
wife did not know where he had been taken, and he was denied access to a lawyer or 
consular services. He was then taken to a military airport near Islamabad and handed 
over to American officers. He was held in Afghanistan and Guantanamo for three years, 
and was released in January 2005.<b>304 </b>

<p><b>6.  Ethiopia

<p>154. The Government of Ethiopia served as the detaining authority for foreign nationals of 
interest to United States and possibly other foreign intelligence officers between 
30 December 2006 and February 2007.<b>305</b> On 2 May 2007, a number of special procedures 
addressed the Government of Ethiopia, adding the following details:  
</p>
<p>In December 2006, the conflict between the militias of the Council of Somali Islamic 
Courts and the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, supported by armed forces of 
Ethiopia, caused a large flow of refugees seeking to cross the border from Somalia into 
Kenya. On 2 January 2007, Kenyan authorities announced the closure of the border for 
security reasons. Since then, it is reported that the Kenyan security forces have been 
patrolling the border and have arrested a number of those seeking to cross it. Kenya has 
deported at least 84 of those arrested back to Somalia, from where they were taken to 
Ethiopia.<b>306</b> 
</p>

February 2007: Bashir Ahmed Makhtal (mentioned in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication)

and Mohamed Ezzoueck. The latter, a British national, was detained on 20 January 2007 in 
Kiunga village, Kenya, after crossing the Somali-Kenyan border and then transferred to Nairobi, 
where he was held in three different locations. Mr. Ezzoueck reported having been detained in 
Kenya for about three weeks and then transferred to Somalia, where he was held for a few days 
before being transferred, via Nairobi, back to London. According to his testimony, he was 
interrogated by a Kenyan army major and Kenyan intelligence service officers, FBI officers and 
British security services officers, and repeatedly asked about his involvement with terrorist 
groups, including Al Qaida.307 Mr. Makhtal, an Ethiopian-born Canadian, was arrested on the 
border between Kenya and Somalia on 30 December 2006 by intelligence agents and held at a 
police detention centre. He was subsequently transferred by car to a prison cell in Gigiri police 
station in Nairobi. On 21 January 2007, the Kenyan authorities sent him to Mogadishu. On the 
following day, he was taken to Addis Ababa by an Ethiopian military plane. He was then held 
for approximately 18 months incommunicado in Mekalawi federal prison, often in solitary 
confinement and in poor conditions, then ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment by the High 
Court of Ethiopia.<b>308</b> 
</p>
<p>156. In a letter dated 23 May 2007, the Government of Ethiopia informed the relevant special 
procedures mandate holders that the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia had handed 
over to Ethiopia 41 individuals captured in the course of the conflict in Somalia; most of these 
detainees had been released. Only eight of the detainees remained in custody by order of the 
court. The Government also noted that &#8220;the allegation that there are more than seventy others in 
addition to those named in the communication is false, as are the allegations that the detainees 
are held incommunicado, and that they might be at risk of torture.&#8221;<b>309 </b>However, in September 
2008, Human Rights Watch published a report stating that at least 10 detainees were still in 
Ethiopian custody, and the whereabouts of others were unknown. <b>310

<p>157. The experts received information proving that a detainee in the CIA secret detention 
programme, Mohammed al-Asad, had been transferred by Tanzanian officials by plane to 
Djibouti on 27 December 2003.311 In Djibouti, Mr. al-Asad was detained for two weeks in secret 
detention, where he was interrogated by a white English-speaking woman and a male interpreter, 
mostly on his connections to the al-Haramain foundation. The woman identified herself as 
American. Mr. al-Asad&#8217;s own recollection is consistent with his having been held in Djibouti.

One of his guards told him that he was in Djibouti and there was a photograph of President 
Guelleh on the wall of the detention facility. After approximately two weeks, Mr. al-Asad was 
taken to an airport in Djibouti, where a team of individuals dressed entirely in black stripped 
him, inserted an object in his rectum, diapered and photographed him, and strapped him down in 
a plane. The detention site may have been in Camp Lemonier, which allegedly has been used on 
a short-term or transitory basis for several detainees being transferred to secret detention 
elsewhere.  
</p>
<p><b>8.  Uzbekistan  
</b></p>
<p>158. No confirmation has ever been provided by either the Government of the United States or 
that of Uzbekistan that detainees were rendered to proxy prisons in Uzbekistan. In May 2005, 
however, the<i> New York Times</i> spoke to &#8220;a half-dozen current and former intelligence officials 
working in Europe, the Middle East and the United States&#8221; who stated that the United States had 
sent terror suspects to Uzbekistan for detention and interrogation. A United States intelligence 
official estimated that the number of terrorism suspects sent by the United States to Tashkent 
was in the dozens. The <i>New York Times</i> also obtained flight logs, showing that at least seven 
flights were made to Uzbekistan from early 2002 to late 2003&#8221; by two planes associated with the 
CIA rendition programme (a Gulfstream jet and a Boeing 737), and noted that, on 21 September 
2003, both planes had arrived at Tashkent. According to the newspaper, the flight logs showed 
that &#8220;the Gulfstream had taken off from Baghdad, while the 737 had departed from the Czech 
Republic&#8221;.<b>312 </b>On 14 August 2009, BBC interviewed Ikrom Yakubov, an Uzbek intelligence 
officer who has been granted political asylum in the United Kingdom, who stated that the 
United States had rendered terrorist suspects for questioning to Uzbekistan, but added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t 
want to talk about it as there might be serious concerns for my life in the future to discuss 
renditions.&#8221;<b>313</b> On 22 August 2009, the story resurfaced once more, when <i>Der Spiegel</i> reported 
that, in an arrangement between the private security firm Blackwater and the CIA, Blackwater 
and its subsidiaries had been commissioned &#8220;to transport terror suspects from Guantanamo to 
interrogations at secret prison camps in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan&#8221;.<b>314 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Complicity in the practice of secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>159. After September 2006, the direct role of the CIA in secret detentions seemed to have 
shrunk significantly, with &#8220;current and former American Government officials&#8221; explaining in 
May 2009 to the <i>New York Times</i> that, in the last two years of the Bush administration, the 
Government of the United States had started to rely heavily on the foreign intelligence services

battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the newspaper, &#8220;in the past 10 months, &#8230; 
about a half-dozen mid-level financiers and logistics experts working with Al-Qaida have been 
captured and are being held by intelligence services in four Middle Eastern countries after the 
United States provided information that led to their arrests by local security services&#8221;.<b>315 </b>Instead 
of actively detaining persons in secret, the United States - and many other countries - became 
complicit in the practice of secret detention. For the purposes of the present study, the experts 
state that a country is complicit in the secret detention of a person in the following cases: 
</p>
<p> (a) When a State has asked another State to secretly detain a person (covering all cases 
mentioned in paras. 141-158 above);  
</p>
<p> (b) When a State knowingly takes advantage of the situation of secret detention by 
sending questions to the State detaining the person or by soliciting or receiving information from 
persons who are being kept in secret detention. This includes at least the following States:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in the cases of several 
individuals, including Binyam Mohamed,<b>316 </b>Salahuddin Amin, Zeeshan Siddiqui, 
Rangzieb Ahmed and Rashid Rauf.<b>317</b> In its submission for the present study, the British 
Government referred to ongoing and concluded judicial assessment of the cases318 and 
stressed the work of the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, as well as 
its policy of clear opposition to secret detention;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Germany, in the case of Muhammad Haydar Zammar, who was reportedly interrogated 
on at least one occasion, on 20 November 2002, by agents of German security agencies 
while he was secretly held in the Syrian Arab Republic.<b>319</b> The Government reported 
having been  
</p>
<p>informed about four cases of renditions or enforced disappearances concerning the 
Federal Republic of Germany: the cases of Khaled El-Masri, Murat Kurnaz, 
Muhammad Haydar Zammar and Abdel Halim Khafagy, which occurred between 
September 2001 and the end of 2005. However, the German authorities did not directly

<p><b>318 </b> According to the Government of the United Kingdom, the judge in Mr Ahmed&#8217;s case stated 
&#8220;I specifically reject the allegations that the British authorities were outsourcing torture&#8221;. The 
judge examined Mr. Amin&#8217;s allegations and found that there was no evidence to suggest that the 
British authorities had been complicit in his unlawful detention or ill-treatment in Pakistan.

<p>or indirectly participate in arresting these persons or in rendering them for 
imprisonment. In the cases of El- Masri and Khafagy, the German missions responsible 
for consular assistance had no knowledge of their imprisonment and were therefore 
unable to ensure that their rights were observed or guarantee consular protection; in the 
cases of Zammar and Kurnaz, the German authorities worked intensively to guarantee 
consular protection. However, they were denied access to the detainees and were 
thereby prevented from effectively exercising consular protection.<b>320 </b> 
</p>
<p>In a letter dated 9 December 2009, the German Federal Ministry of Justice further 
reported that it had become aware of the case of Mr. Kurnaz on 26 February 2002, when 
the Chief Federal Prosecutor informed the Ministry that it would not take over a 
preliminary investigation pending before the Prosecution of the Land of Bremen. The 
Office of the Chief Federal Prosecutor had received a report from the Federal Criminal 
Police Office on 31 January 2002 that, according to information by the Federal 
Intelligence Service, Mr. Kurnaz had been arrested by United States officials in 
Afghanistan or Pakistan. In the case of Mr. el-Masri, on 8 June 2004, the Federal 
Chancellery and the Federal Foreign Office received a letter from his lawyer that 
Mr. el-Masri had been abducted in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 
31 December 2003, presumably transferred to Afghanistan and kept there against his 
will until his return to Germany on 29 May 2004. The Federal Ministry of Justice was 
informed about these facts on 18 June 2004. The experts note, however, that according 
to the final report of a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, the Government became 
aware of the case of Mr. el-Masri on 31 May 2004, when the Ambassador of the 
United States informed the Federal Minister for the Interior of Germany;<b>321</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Canada, for providing intelligence to the Syrian Arab Republic in the cases of Maher 
Arar, Ahmad el-Maati, Abdullah Almaki and Muayyed Nureddin.<b>322 </b>In its submission 
for the present study, the Government denied that any of the named individuals was 
detained or seized by a State at the request of Canada. The experts welcome the fact that 
all the above-mentioned cases have been the subject of extensive independent inquiry 
processes within Canada and that, in the case of Mr. Arar, substantive reparations has 
been provided to the victims; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Australia, for providing intelligence to interrogators in the case of the secret detention of 
Mamdouh Habib. Mr Habib also alleges that an Australian official was present during at 
least one of his interrogation sessions in Egypt. The experts understand that Mr. Habib

kidnapping and subsequent transfer to Egypt. In its submission for the present study, the 
Government denies that any Australian officer, servant and/or agent was involved in 
any dealings with or mistreatment of Mr. Habib, and refers to ongoing litigation; 
</p>
<p>(c) When a State has actively participated in the arrest and/or transfer of a person when 
it knew, or ought to have known, that the person would disappear in a secret detention facility or 
otherwise be detained outside the legally regulated detention system. This includes at least the 
following States: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Italy, for its role in the abduction and rendition of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (also 
known as Abu Omar), an Egyptian kidnapped by CIA agents on a street in Milan in 
broad daylight on 17 February 2003. He was transferred from Milan to the NATO 
military base at Aviano by car, and then flown, via the NATO military base of<b> </b> Ramstein 
in Germany, to Egypt,<b>323 </b>where he was held for four years (including 14 months in 
secret detention) before being released. The European Parliament considered it<b> </b> &#8220;very 
likely, in view of the involvement of its secret services, that the Italian Government of 
the day was aware of the extraordinary rendition of Abu Omar from within its 
territory.&#8221;<b>324</b> Prosecutors opened an investigation and charged 26 United States citizens 
(mostly CIA agents) with abduction, as well as members of the Italian military secret 
services (SISMI) with complicity in the abduction, among them the head of SISMI.<b>325 
</b>The Italian Ministry of Justice, however, refused to forward the judiciary&#8217;s requests for 
extradition of the CIA agents to the Government of the United States; as a result, the 
United States citizens were tried in absentia. On 4 November 2009, the court found 23 
of them guilty. The court also convicted two SISMI agents and sentenced them to three 
years imprisonment for their involvement in the abduction.<b>326 </b>The then commander of 
SISMI and his deputy, however, were not convicted, the court having dismissed the 
cases against them on the grounds that the relevant evidence was covered by State 
secret.<b>327</b> In its submission for the present study, the Government of Italy notes that the 
case is continuing at the appeal level, which prevents it from drawing any conclusions 
prior to a definitive verdict

transferring them on three charter flights between 20 January and 10 February 2007 to 
Somalia. They were subsequently transferred to Ethiopia, where they were kept in secret 
detention. They were not provided with an opportunity to challenge their forcible 
physical removal at any stage (see also paras. 154-156 above)<b>328</b> 
</p>
<p>(d) A specific form of complicity in this context are these cases where a State holds a 
person shortly in secret detention before handing them over to another State where that person 
will be put in secret detention for a longer period. This includes at least the following countries: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for its role in the case of Khaled 
el-Masri<b>329</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Malawi, for allegedly holding Laid Saidi in secret detention for a week  
&#8226; The Gambia: during an interview with the experts, Bisher al-Rawi reported that, on 8 
</p>
<p>November 2002, he was arrested upon arrival at Banjul airport by the Gambian 
Intelligence Agency, then taken to an office and later to a house located in a Banjul 
residential place before he was handed over to the CIA and rendered to Afghanistan; 
</p>
<p>(e) When a State has failed to take measures to identify persons or airplanes passing 
through its airports or airspace after information of the CIA programme involving secret 
detention had already been revealed. The issue of rendition flights was, and still is, the subject of 
many separate investigations at the national or regional level.330 Therefore, the experts decided to 
refrain from going into the details of this issue.

<p><b>E.  Secret detention and the Obama administration  
</b></p>
<p>160. In its response to the questionnaire sent by the experts, the United States stated that: 
</p>
<p>The Obama Administration has adopted the following specific measures: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Instructed the CIA to close as expeditiously as possible any detention facilities that it 
currently operated as of January 22, 2009 and ordered that the CIA shall not operate any 
such detention facility in the future.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed as soon as practicable. 
&#8226; Required the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to be given notice and 
</p>
<p>timely access to any individual detained in any armed conflict in the custody or under 
the effective control of the United States Government, consistent with Department of 
Defense regulations and policies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered a comprehensive review of the lawful options available to the Federal 
Government with respect to detention of individuals captured or apprehended in 
connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reaffirmed that all persons in U.S. custody must be treated humanely as a matter of 
law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mandated that detention at Guantanamo conform to all applicable laws governing 
conditions of confinement, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, 
and directed a review of detention conditions at Guantanamo to ensure such 
compliance. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered a review of U.S. transfer policies to ensure that they do not result in the transfer 
of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the 
effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the 
United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control. 
The resulting Task Force on transfer practices recommended to the President in August 
that (1) the State Department be involved in evaluating all diplomatic assurances; (2) 
the Inspectors General of the Departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security 
prepare an annual report on all transfers relying on assurances; and (3) mechanisms for 
monitoring treatment in the receiving country be incorporated into assurances. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Announced the transfer of at least 7 detainees from military custody to U.S. criminal 
law enforcement proceedings, and transferred 25 detainees to date to third-countries for 
repatriation or resettlement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Worked with Congress to revise U.S. laws governing military commissions to enhance 
their procedural protections, including prohibiting introduction of evidence obtained as 
a result of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 87 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Expanded the review procedures for detainees held by the Department of Defense in 
Afghanistan in order to enhance the transparency and fairness of U.S. detention 
practices. Detainees are permitted an opportunity to challenge the evidence that is the 
basis for their detention, to call reasonably available witnesses, and to have the 
assistance of personal representatives who have access to all reasonably available 
relevant information (including classified information). Proceedings generally shall be 
open, including to representatives of the ICRC, and possibly to non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Established more tailored standards and rigorous procedures for evaluating assertions of 
the State secrets privilege, including establishing an internal accountability mechanism, 
ensuring that the privilege is never asserted to avoid embarrassment or conceal 
violations of law, and creating a referral mechanism to the Office of Inspector General 
where the privilege is asserted but there is credible evidence of a violation of law. These 
standards and procedures were established in order to strike a better balance between 
open government and the need to protect vital national security information. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Department of Justice initiated a preliminary criminal investigation into the 
interrogation of certain detainees. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; These measures cumulatively seek to reaffirm the importance of compliance with the 
rule of law in U.S. detention practices, to ensure U.S. adherence to its international legal 
obligations, and to promote accountability and transparency in this important area of 
national security policy. 
</p>
<p>161. The experts welcome the above commitments. They believe, however, that clarification is 
required as to whether detainees were held in CIA &#8220;black sites&#8221; in Iraq and Afghanistan or 
elsewhere when President Obama took office, and, if so, what happened to the detainees who 
were held at that time. Also, the experts are concerned that the executive order instructing the 
CIA &#8220;to close any detention facilities that it currently operates&#8221; does not extend to the facilities 
where the CIA detains individuals on &#8220;a short-term transitory basis&#8221;.<b>331 </b>The order also does not 
seem to extend to detention facilities operated by the Joint Special Operation Command. 
</p>
<p>162. The experts also welcome in particular the new policy implemented in August 2009, under 
which the military must notify ICRC of detainees&#8217; names and identification number within two 
weeks of capture.<b>332</b> Nevertheless, there is no legal justification for this two-week period of 
secret detention. According to article 70 of the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war are to

be documented, and their whereabouts and health conditions made available to family members 
and to the country of origin of the prisoner within one week. Article 106 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention (governing the treatment of civilians) establishes virtually identical procedures for 
the documentation and disclosure of information concerning civilian detainees. Furthermore, it is 
obvious that this unacknowledged detention for one week can only be applied to persons who 
have been captured on the battlefield in a situation of armed conflict. This is an important 
observation, as the experts noted with concern news reports quoting current Government 
officials saying that &#8220;the importance of Bagram as a holding site for terrorism suspects captured 
outside Afghanistan and Iraq has risen under the Obama administration, which barred the Central 
Intelligence Agency from using its secret prisons for long-term detention&#8221;.<b>333</b> 
</p>
<p>163. The situation at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility remains of great concern. In 
March 2009, United States district Court Judge John D. Bates ruled that the <i>habeas corpus</i> rights 
granted to the Guantanamo detainees by the Supreme Court in June 2008 extended to 
non-Afghan detainees who had been seized in other countries and rendered to Bagram because 
&#8220;the detainees themselves as well as the rationale for detention are essentially the same&#8221;, and 
because the review process established at the prison &#8220;falls well short of what the Supreme Court 
found inadequate at Guant&#225;namo&#8221;. The four petitioners were among the 94 prisoners that 
Assistant Attorney General Stephen G. Bradbury admitted were held in CIA custody between 
2001 and 2005. Judge Bates found that, in holding detainees at Bagram not as prisoners of war 
but as &#8220;unlawful enemy combatants&#8221;, the Bush administration had put in place a review process, 
the Unlawful Enemy Combatant Review Board, in which &#8220;detainees cannot even speak for 
themselves; they are only permitted to submit a written statement. But in submitting that 
statement, detainees do not know what evidence the United States relies upon to justify an 
&#8216;enemy combatant&#8217; designation - so they lack a meaningful opportunity to rebut that 
evidence&#8221;.<b>334</b> 
</p>
<p>164. The above-mentioned ruling has been appealed by the current United States administration, 
even though Judge Bates noted that habeas rights extend neither to Afghan detainees held at 
Bagram, nor to Afghans seized in other countries and rendered to Bagram. In its appeal against 
Judge Bates&#8217; ruling, the United States administration notified the court that it was introducing a 
new review process at Bagram, &#8220;modifying the procedures for reviewing the status of aliens held 
by the Department of Defense at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility&#8221;.335 However, the 
experts are concerned that the new review system fails to address the fact that detainees in an 
active war zone should be held according to the Geneva Conventions, screened close to the time 
and place of capture if there is any doubt about their status, and not be subjected to reviews at 
some point after their capture to determine whether they should continue to be held. The experts 
are also concerned that the system appears to aim specifically to prevent United States courts 
from having access to foreign detainees captured in other countries and rendered to Bagram.

While the experts welcome the fact that the names of 645 detainees at Bagram are now known, 
they urge the Government of the United States to provide information on the citizenship, length 
of detention and place of capture of all detainees currently held at Bagram Air Base.

<p><b>V. THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF SECRET DETENTION  
PRACTICES IN RELATION TO CONTEMPORARY  
REGIONAL OR DOMESTIC COUNTER-TERRORIST  
EFFORTS 
</b></p>
<p>165. On a global scale, secret detention in connection with counter-terrorist policies remains a 
serious problem, whether it is through the use of secret detention facilities similar to those 
described in the previous section; declarations of a state of emergency, which allow prolonged 
secret detention; or forms of &#8220;administrative detention&#8221;, which also allow prolonged secret 
detention.  
</p>
<p>166. The principal objective of this section is to illustrate the extent to which the use of secret 
detention in the context of the fight against terrorism has been a global practice. The cases and 
situations referred to are therefore not exhaustive but serve the purpose of substantiating the 
existence of secret detention in all regions of the world within the confines of the definition 
presented earlier. Nonetheless, the experts have also been made aware of practices of secret 
detention that are beyond the scope of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Asia 
</b></p>
<p>167. With regard to Asia, the experts gathered information about secret detention in China, 
India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where 
anti-terrorist rhetoric is invoked to justify detention. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  China 
</b></p>
<p>168. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and other special procedures mandate holders 
addressed several urgent communications to the Government of China, in particular with regard 
to cases of alleged secret detention of Tibetans accused of separatism and other State security 
offences, and of secret detention in the aftermath of unrest in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region 
in July 2009. 
</p>
<p>169.  Jamyang Gyatso,<b>336</b> a monk in Xiahe, in North Western Gansu province, was arrested by 
security officials on 8 January 2007 and detained at an undisclosed location.<b>337</b> The Government 
informed the special procedures mandate holders that the State security authorities had 
                                                 
<b>336 </b> He had reportedly encouraged local Tibetans to listen to foreign radio broadcasts and had 
worked on making copies of a book written by, Hortsang Jigme, a Tibetan poet living abroad. 
</p>

Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to

investigated him on suspicion of having conducted unlawful acts that endangered State security, 
and that he had confessed to having committed the offence of &#8220;incitement to separatism&#8221;. On 3 
February 2007, the Chinese security authorities ordered that he be placed under restricted 
freedom of movement, pending trial. Jamyang Kyi, a Tibetan writer and musician, was 
reportedly taken away from her office at the Qinghai Provincial Television Station in Xining 
City by plainclothes State security officers on 1 April 2008, and taken to an undisclosed location 
on 4 or 5 April 2008, where she was held incommunicado until her release on 21 April 2008.<b>338 
</b>According to the information provided by the Government, Mrs. Jamyang was not arrested but 
was placed in criminal detention and held at the Xining municipal detention facility. She was 
later released on humanitarian grounds.<b>339 </b>Washu Rangjung, an author of two books on Tibetan 
history and culture, singer and news presenter for a local television company in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region, was arrested at his home by Chinese military police officers on 11 
September 2008, and taken to an undisclosed location. According to the Government, he was 
issued a criminal detention order by the Sichuan judicial authorities on suspicion of having 
engaged in separatist acts and acts harmful to State security. After being assessed as having 
expressed genuine repentance, he was reprimanded and released on 20 September 2008.<b>340</b> 
</p>
<p>170. The experts also take note of reports of secret detention in the aftermath of unrest in the 
Xinjiang Autonomous Region in July 2009. A report by Human Rights Watch notes that &#8220;official 
figures suggest that the number of people detained by the security forces in connection with the 
protests has reached well over a thousand people&#8221;.<b>341 </b>Chinese police, the People&#8217;s Armed Police 
and the military reportedly conducted numerous large-scale sweep operations in two 
predominantly Uighur areas of Urumqi, Erdaoqiao and Saimachang, in the immediate aftermath 
of the uprising on 6 and 7 July. Similar operations continued on a smaller scale until at least 
mid-August.<b>342</b> The report also alleges that the majority of those detained were being held

incommunicado, and that, when family members attempted to inquire about their relatives, 
&#8220;police and other law enforcement agencies denied having knowledge of the arrests, or simply 
chased the families away.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>2.  India 
</b></p>
<p>171. Arbitrary detentions and disappearances have been a longstanding concern in India, 
particularly in the states in which the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958 applies. In its 
report of 2007 submitted to the Human Rights Council, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances noted that, as at the end of 2006, there were 325 outstanding cases 
of disappearances, and that most of the cases reported occurred between 1983 and 2004 in the 
context of ethnic and religious disturbances in the Punjab and Kashmir regions. It added that &#8220;the 
disappearances allegedly relate to wide powers granted to the security forces under emergency 
legislation&#8221;.<b>343 </b>During the review of India under the universal periodic review mechanism, 
numerous civil society organizations alleged that the &#8220;chronic use of anti-terrorist laws, 
preventive detention laws and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act of 1958 have created a 
situation where the normal methods of &#8216;investigation&#8217; have been replaced by disappearances, 
illegal detention, custodial torture.&#8221;<b>344 
</b></p>
<p>172. In the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001, India enacted new counter-terrorism 
legislation, including the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act of 2002.<b>345 </b>In 2005, the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion drew the Government&#8217;s attention to allegations that numerous 
Muslim men<b> </b>had been illegally detained since March 2003 in the Gayakwad Haveli Police 
Station in Ahmedabad. Although it was reported that many were subsequently charged, a large 
number of illegal detainees allegedly remained in custody. There were also reports of a &#8220;climate 
of fear&#8221; in the Muslim community in Gujarat, which meant that &#8220;most were too afraid to make 
official complaints about illegal detention or about torture and ill-treatment.&#8221;<b>346</b> The Government 
rejected these allegations.<b>347</b> 
</p>
<p>173. In July 2009, however, a leading Indian magazine, <i>The Week</i>, reported that there were at 
least 15, and perhaps as many as 40, secret detention sites in India, used to detain, interrogate 
and torture suspected terrorists. A former Government official reportedly confirmed the 
existence of the prisons, telling the magazine that they were not run directly by the Ministry of 
Home Affairs, but by security agencies, including the Research and Analysis Wing (the national

</p>
<p><b>345  </b>The Act, which was preceded by the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Ordinance in 2001, 
was repealed in October 2004. New counter-terrorism legislation was enacted by Parliament in 
2008.

foreign intelligence agency) and the Intelligence Bureau. An officer who had worked in one of 
the detention centres reportedly admitted that torture techniques were used, based loosely on 
those used in Guantanamo and elsewhere in the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; of the Government of the 
United States. The techniques included the use of loud and incessant music, sleep deprivation, 
keeping prisoners naked to degrade and humiliate them, and forcibly administering drugs 
through the rectum to break down their dignity further.<b>348 
</b></p>
<p>174. United Nations human rights mechanisms, which could carry out independent investigation 
of these allegations, have found it very difficult to engage with India. The Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention requested an invitation to carry out a country visit in 2004, and again in 
2005 and 2006. A request for an invitation to visit India by the Special Rapporteur on torture has 
been outstanding since 1993, despite several reminders. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions sought an invitation in 2000, and reiterated that request in 2005, 
2006 and 2008. None of these requests received a positive response. In 1997, India reported to 
the Human Rights Committee<b>349 </b>and signed the Convention against Torture. However, the 
Government of India has not reported to, nor been examined by the Committee since,<b>350</b> and has 
not ratified the Convention. As a result, United Nations human rights mechanisms have not been 
able to examine allegations of secret detention in India for over a decade. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>175. Reports from the Islamic Republic of Iran indicate a pattern of incommunicado detention 
of political prisoners in secret, or at least unofficial, detention facilities. In a case typical of this 
pattern, according to information brought to the attention of the Government in a special 
procedures urgent communication of 15 April 2008, Majid Pourabdollah was arrested on 
29 March 2008 in Tabriz; he was hospitalized three days after his arrest and transferred two days 
later from the hospital to an undisclosed location by the authorities. Two weeks later, his 
whereabouts were still not known.<b>351</b> In its response to the communication, sent more than a year 
later, the Government stated that Majid Pourabdollah was a member of an extremist Marxist 
group that pursued &#8220;the objective of disturbing the security of the country&#8221;. The Government

added that he had been brought before a court and had in the meantime been released on bail, 
and that he had not been tortured in detention. The allegations regarding his secret detention 
were not challenged. 
</p>
<p>176. In the period from 2000 to 2003, a parliamentary commission established under article 90 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran (which allows individuals to address rights 
complaints to Parliament) investigated the establishment of secret prisons by authorities other 
than the national prisons office. The Article 90 Parliamentary Commission found that a number 
of authorities had established such unofficial, often secret, places of detention: the Ministry of 
Information, the Army and Military Police Counter-Intelligence Service, the Law Enforcement 
and General Inspectorate Protection Service, the Pasdaran Counter-Intelligence Service and 
Military Police, the Bassidj and the Ministry of Defence Counter-Intelligence Service.<b>352</b> 
</p>
<p>177. In addition to the secret detention facilities run by the militias, intelligence services and 
other agencies, there are also concerns about sector 209 at Evin Prison on the outskirts of 
Teheran. It is considered a &#8220;prison within a prison&#8221;, where political prisoners in particular are 
held, often in prolonged, solitary and incommunicado confinement.<b>353 </b>When the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention visited Evin Prison in 2003, it was able to visually verify the existence of 
this &#8220;prison within a prison&#8221;, but its attempts to visit sector 209 were cut short by secret service 
agents.<b>354</b> 
</p>
<p>178. Following the presidential elections held on 12 June 2009, tens of thousands of opposition 
supporters took to the streets of Tehran and other cities throughout the country to call for the 
annulment of the election results. It has been alleged that, while protests were largely peaceful, 
violent clashes with security forces resulted in numerous deaths and detentions.<b>355</b> These 
allegations were transmitted to the Government by several mandate holders on different 
occasions.<b>356</b>

179. In this connection, on 10 July 2009, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning more than 100 
protesters arrested by public authorities in Tehran and other Iranian cities during the protests, or 
at their homes. The vast majority of those arrested were allegedly deprived of any contact with 
members of their family, and did not have access to legal counsel. <b>357 </b>On 14 October 2009, the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances sent a communication regarding 
many of the persons concerned by the above-mentioned joint urgent appeal, as well as other 
people whose fate and whereabouts were unknown.<b>358 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>180. The practice of secret detention by the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) during the conflict 
with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M) has been the object of in-depth 
documentation, both by Nepalese civil society and United Nations bodies. The Government has 
accepted visits by several special procedures mandate holders, in particular the Working Group 
on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances<b>359</b> and the Special Rapporteur on torture.<b>360 </b>The 
OHCHR Office in Nepal has published two reports documenting conflict-related disappearances 
in specific districts.<b>361</b> 
</p>
<p>181. In January 2005, the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances 
observed that the phenomenon of disappearance in Nepal was widespread, with both the Maoist 
insurgents and the Nepalese security forces as perpetrators.<b>362 </b>The practice of secret detention, 
however, related primarily to the Royal Nepalese Army, since the Maoists were reportedly likely 
to kill perceived opponents outright.<b>363 </b>A year later, the Special Rapporteur on torture reported

that he had received a large number of allegations relating to persons taken involuntarily by 
security forces and who were being held incommunicado at unknown locations.<b>364 
</b></p>
<p>182. In many of the cases attributed to the RNA, a clear pattern was documented. A person 
suspected of Maoist sympathies, or simply of having contact with the Maoists, was seized by a 
large group of known military personnel out on patrol. They were blindfolded and had their 
hands tied behind their back. The victim was put into a military vehicle and taken away. The 
security forces often appeared in plain clothes, so that no personal names or unit names were 
visible. In almost all cases, the victim was held incommunicado in army barracks, with no access 
to family or legal counsel, and subjected to physical abuse and torture.<b>365 </b>Two OHCHR reports, 
in 2006 and 2008, documented the treatment of detainees in two secret detention sites within 
RNA barracks, the Maharajgunj barracks in Kathmandu and Chisapani barracks in Bardiya 
district.<b>361 </b>The reports, based on interviews with former detainees, families of the disappeared 
and other witnesses, describe how all the detainees in Maharajgunj barracks were continuously 
blindfolded during their often months-long periods of detention by the RNA, subjected to 
deliberate and systematic torture during interrogation, including beating, electric shocks, 
submersion in water and, in some cases, sexual humiliation. In 2004, it was also applied to 
induce some detainees to renounce their CPN-M allegiance. Despite the general climate of fear 
and insecurity, many relatives of those arrested went to the RNA barracks to inquire after their 
family. They were denied access and told that their relatives had not been arrested by the RNA 
and were not held inside.

<p>183. Some families, assisted by non-governmental organizations, petitioned to the courts for the 
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. In some cases, the petitions were effective, where the authorities 
acknowledged detention; however when the RNA denied detention, the Supreme Court normally 
denied the petition.<b>366 </b>In a number of cases, the army flatly denied before the Supreme Court that 
a particular person was in detention, only to reverse that position later when forced to do so by 
revelations in the media, in political debate, and even in official documents issued by other 
branches of the public authority.<b>367 </b>The Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary 
Disappearances explained that one central difficulty in these <i>habeas corpus</i> cases was that under 
Nepalese law, Government officials could not be charged with perjury for failing to tell the truth 
in habeas corpus proceedings.<b>367</b> 
</p>
<p>184. In its report of January 2005, the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary 
Disappearances drew attention to the impact of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control 
and Punishment) Act of 2002 and the ordinance of the same name of 2004 on the security forces&#8217; 
instigation of secret detentions and disappearances, noting that the establishment by the act of

special powers to check terrorist and disruptive acts included preventive detention &#8220;upon 
appropriate grounds for believing that a person has to be stopped from doing anything that may 
cause a terrorist and disruptive act.&#8221; Although under the act preventive detention was limited to 
90 days, it was extended to up to one year under the ordinance, and lawyers and human rights 
activists argued that, since detentions could be ordered for a full year without any judicial 
scrutiny, and because in practice there was no effective civilian control over the issuance of the 
orders, the free reign of the security personnel to judge who was a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; was 
unquestionable.<b>368</b> 
</p>
<p>185. In June 2007, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued a ground-breaking ruling in response to 
petitions for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in dozens of cases. It ordered the Government to establish 
a commission of inquiry into disappearances complying with international standards, to enact a 
law to criminalize enforced disappearances, to prosecute those responsible for past 
disappearances and to compensate the families of victims.<b>369 </b> 
</p>
<p>186. In February 2008, however, the Special Rapporteur on torture noted that, while the 
systematic practice of holding political detainees incommunicado ended with the April 2006 
ceasefire, in 2007 OHCHR documented several cases of detainees accused of belonging to 
armed groups being held for short periods in unacknowledged, incommunicado detention, in the 
worst case for 11 days. <b>370</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>187. The full extent of secret detention in Pakistan is not yet known. In its report submitted to 
the Human Rights Council in 2008, the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary 
Disappearances referred to allegations that the Supreme Court was investigating some 600 cases 
of disappearances and that, while some of the cases reportedly concerned terrorism suspects, 
many involved political opponents of the Government. The Supreme Court, headed by Chief 
Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, publicly stated that it had overwhelming evidence that the 
intelligence agencies of Pakistan were detaining terror suspects and other opponents. The 
retroactive application of the Army Act would allegedly allow substantial impunity of those tried 
for having terror suspects disappear.<b>371</b> 
</p>
<p>188. The Working Group also took up the cases of Masood Janjua and Faisal Farz, two of those 
who had disappeared.<b>372</b> It was a newspaper report about these men that first prompted the 
Pakistani Supreme Court, in December 2005, to demand answers from the Government about the 
whereabouts of those who had disappeared. In August 2006, Masood Janjua&#8217;s wife, Amina

Masood Janjua, and the mother of Faisal Farz, Zainab Khatoon, founded the organization 
Defence of Human Rights<b>373 </b>and filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking information about 
16 people that the organization believed had been subjected to enforced disappearance. By July 
2008, the organization represented 563 people who had disappeared.<b>374</b> Special procedures have 
sent communications on a number of cases of alleged secret detention.<b>375</b> 
</p>
<p>189. In a report published in February 2009, the Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, 
Counter-terrorism and Human Rights reported that at a hearing in Pakistan:  
</p>
<p>Repeated reference was made to torture, prolonged arbitrary and incommunicado detention 
and disappearances allegedly committed by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). 
The Panel heard directly from family members of disappeared people, and the trauma that 
they are living through was all too apparent. It was claimed that persons are held in 
unacknowledged or secret detention, that individuals have been rendered to other States 
(often for financial gain), and that individuals have been interrogated by foreign 
intelligence personnel while in incommunicado detention. The Panel heard that the ISI is 
operating to a large extent beyond either civilian or judicial control.<b>376</b>  
</p>
<p>190. The authorities&#8217; resistance to investigations into those held in secret detention reached a 
low point on 3 November 2007, when President Musharraf suspended the Constitution, imposed 
a state of emergency, dismissed the entire Supreme Court and imprisoned the judges in their 
homes along with their families, although there was some improvement in 2008. In May, after 
the Minister for Law and Justice Farooq Naik promised that the Government would trace all of 
the people subjected to enforced disappearance, two committees were established for that 
purpose. In June, the Government declared that 43 disappeared people had been traced in 
Balochistan, and had either been released or were being held in official detention sites, even 
though, according to the Government&#8217;s own figures, 1,102 people had disappeared in 
Balochistan province alone.<b>377</b> 
</p>
<p>191. Following the election of Asif Ali Zardari as President on 6 September 2008, on 21 
November, the Minister for Human Rights Mumtaz Alam Gilani announced that a new law was 
being prepared to facilitate the recovery of disappeared people. He stated that his ministry had

567 documented cases of enforced disappearance. Four days later, on 25 November, the Senate 
Standing Committee on the Interior acknowledged that intelligence agencies maintained 
&#8220;countless hidden torture cells&#8221; across the country. Amnesty International stated that new cases 
of enforced disappearance continued to be reported in 2009.<b>377</b> According to an article published 
in the newspaper <i>Dawn</i> on 5 November 2009, the Islamabad Inspector General of Police Kaleem 
Imam, the Interior Secretary Qamar Zaman and the Rawalpindi Regional Police Officer Aslam 
Tareen had appeared before the Supreme Court and reported that cases of 416 missing persons 
had been pending before the apex court since September 2006. The newspaper indicated that: 
</p>
<p>Their report said the interior ministry was making hectic efforts to trace the missing 
persons and 241 people had been traced while 175 were still untraced. It said that complete 
particulars of missing persons were being collected with the help of Nadra and the lists had 
been sent to the provinces and law-enforcement agencies to enhance efforts to locate them. 
A special task force had also been constituted, the report added.<b>378</b> 
</p>
<p>192. In June 2008, the Asian Human Rights Commission identified 52 illegal detention centres 
in Pakistan, where, it stated, &#8220;missing persons are held for long periods of time in order to force 
them to confess their involvement in terrorist and sabotage activities.&#8221;<b>379</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>193. In its response to the request for relevant information from the four experts (see annex I), 
the Government of the Philippines drew attention to the Bill of Rights of the 1987 Constitution, 
enacted after the Revolution of 1986 brought an end to the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos.<b>380 
</b>The Bill explicitly bans &#8220;secret detention places, solitary, incommunicado, or other similar forms 
of detention&#8221;. The Government also pointed out that the Human Security Act of 2007, the recent 
counter-terrorism legislation, provides for stiffer penalties for those who violate its provisions 
regarding the arrest, detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects. The Government did not 
provide any information on cases in which these provisions might have been violated. 
</p>
<p>194. The Committee against Torture noted in its concluding observations on the most recent 
periodic report submitted by the Philippines under the Convention against Torture, in April 2009, 
that it was deeply concerned about the de facto practice of detention of suspects by the 
Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in detention centres, 
safe houses and military camps.<b>381</b> The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary

Disappearances noted in February 2009 that, in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines, 
since 2001, more than 70 people had allegedly been victims of enforced disappearance, a number 
of those previously disappeared had surfaced after being detained and tortured by military 
officers, and no perpetrators had been punished.<b>382</b> In its response to a questionnaire for the 
present study, the Government of the Philippines stated that facilities and practices of secret 
detention contravene the Constitution, which expressly prohibits secret, solitary and 
incommunicado detention and torture, and are not used. Specific laws provide penalties for those 
who violate requirements in relation to the arrest, interrogation and detention of those suspected 
of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>195. The experts interviewed one victim of secret detention, Raymond Manalo,<b>383 </b>suspected of 
supporting the insurgent New People&#8217;s Army (NPA), whose case sheds light on the broader 
situation. On 14 February 2006, Raymond and his brother Reynaldo were abducted from their 
farms in San Ildefonso, Bulacan, by AFP soldiers and men belonging to a militia established by 
the AFP to support its counter-terrorism efforts. The brothers were suspected of being supporters 
of the NPA. They were kept in unacknowledged detention in military facilities and safe houses 
run by the military for 18 months until they managed to escape from detention on 13 August 
2007. A decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines of 8 October 2008 in proceedings for 
the writ of <i>amparo</i> brought by Raymond Manalo describes what happened to him according to 
his own testimony, which the Supreme Court found highly credible in spite of denials by the 
AFP. Other persons suspected of being supporters of left-wing groups, including two female 
university students, were secretly detained with them.<b>384 </b>The detainees were tortured during 
interrogation to extort confessions regarding their links to the NPA. The female detainees were 
raped by soldiers.  
</p>
<p>196.  Throughout his detention, Raymond Manalo was not brought before any judicial authority 
and had no contact with a lawyer. His family only learned that he was still alive when he was 
brought before them on one occasion in an attempt to persuade his parents to drop a <i>habeas 
corpus</i> petition that they had filed on behalf of Raymond and his brother. In the <i>habeas corpus</i> 
proceedings, the AFP staunchly denied that they were holding the Manalo brothers. Other 
persons held together with the Manalo brothers remain disappeared.<b>385 </b>Raymond Manalo 
testified before the Supreme Court that he saw the killing and burning of one of his

co-detainees.<b>386</b> As Raymond Manalo narrated in his testimony, and as the Supreme Court of the 
Philippines found to be established, high-ranking military officers, including a general, were 
involved in his secret detention. Calls for their prosecution remain without results.<b>387 </b>Following 
their escape, Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo filed a petition for a writ of <i>amparo</i> (a remedy 
recently created by the Supreme Court of the Philippines to protect persons at risk of 
disappearance or extrajudicial execution), which was granted on 7 October 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>7.  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>197. United Nations human rights mechanisms and non-governmental organizations have 
expressed serious concerns with regard to abductions by police and military personnel, detention 
at undisclosed locations, and enforced disappearances. Concerning the latter phenomenon, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions stated in the report on his 
visit in December 2005 to Sri Lanka that he was very disturbed to receive reports that appeared 
to indicate a re-emergence of the pattern of enforced and involuntary disappearances that had so 
wracked Sri Lanka in the past.<b>388 </b>He specifically referred to complaints of Tamil youths being 
picked up by white vans, allegedly with the involvement of security forces. In its 2008 report, the 
Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances remarked that it remained gravely 
concerned at the increase in reported cases of enforced disappearances in the country.<b>389</b> Specific 
cases of Tamil men, possibly suspected of links to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
reportedly taken to undisclosed places of detention by security forces in a white van without a 
number plate and since then disappeared have been brought to the attention of the Government 
by special procedures and non-governmental organizations, without receiving a response.<b>390</b> The

<b>386  </b>Testimony reflected (and found credible) in the decision on the Supreme Court of 
8 October 2008. In a communication to five special procedures mandate holders of 16 July 2009, 
however, the Government stated that the &#8220;non-cooperation of the victims&#8217; families with the 
Philippines National Police impedes the process of uncovering the truth on said case&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>387</b> <b> </b>In the communication to five special procedures mandate holders of 16 July 2009, the 
Government argued that &#8220;the Philippine National Police cannot identify nor apprehend the 
perpetrators basing only on nebulous allegations without any substantial or corroborating 
evidence from witnesses. At this point, allegations pointing to the military behind the abduction, 
and the reported torture, sexual assaults &#8230; and burning to death &#8230; are without any basis.&#8221;

supported by the Government, was also reported to be responsible for abductions of LTTE 
representatives and civilians in the area around Trincomalee.<b>391</b> 
</p>
<p>198. In its concluding observations on Sri Lanka, the Human Rights Committee expressed its 
regret regarding impunity for abductions and secret detentions. The Committee stated that the 
majority of prosecutions initiated against police officers or members of the armed forces on 
charges of abduction and unlawful confinement, as well as on charges of torture, had been 
inconclusive owing to a lack of satisfactory evidence and the unavailability of witnesses, despite 
a number of acknowledged instances of abduction and/or unlawful confinement and/or torture, 
and only very few police or army officers had been found guilty and punished.<b>392 </b>The Committee 
also noted with concern reports that victims of human rights violations felt intimidated about 
bringing complaints or had been subjected to intimidation and/or threats, which discouraged 
them from pursuing appropriate avenues to obtain an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>199. While the conduct of the security forces in &#8220;white van&#8221; abduction cases is most likely 
unlawful and criminal also under the law of Sri Lanka, the Special Rapporteur on torture<b>393 </b>and 
the International Commission of Jurists have drawn attention to the far-reaching powers of arrest 
and detention that anti-terrorism laws and ordinances bestow upon the Sri Lankan security 
forces.<b>394</b> Under Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and Powers) Regulation No. 1 of 2005, 
persons &#8220;acting in any manner prejudicial to the national security or the maintenance of public 
order&#8221; may be arrested and held in detention for up to one year, without access to judicial review 
by an independent body. Persons may be similarly detained for up to 18 months under the 
Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1979 or indefinitely, pending trial. 
Persons can be held in irregular and unpublicized places of detention, outside of a regular police 
station, recognized detention centre, penal institution or prison. Detainees may be moved from 
place to place during interrogation and denied prompt access to a lawyer, family members or 
authority competent to challenge the legitimacy of detention.<b>395 </b>Section 15(A)(1) of the act, for 
instance, enables the Secretary to the Minister for Defence to order that persons held on remand 
should be &#8220;kept in the custody of any authority, in such place and subject to such conditions as 
may be determined by him&#8221;.<b>395</b> As a result of his visit to Sri Lanka in November 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture concluded that torture had become a routine practice in the context 
of counter-terrorism operations, both by the police and the armed forces.<b>396</b>

200. Responding to questions raised during the universal periodic review process in May 2008, 
the Attorney General of Sri Lanka stated that, notwithstanding the serious nature of the security 
situation prevailing in Sri Lanka resulting from a reign of terror unleashed by the most ruthless 
terrorist organization in the world, the LTTE, it was not the policy of the State to adopt and 
enforce extraordinary measures outside the framework of the law. He stressed that the 
Government steadfastly insisted that all agents of the State should necessarily carry out arrests, 
detentions and investigations, including interrogations, in accordance with the due process of the 
law. With regard to allegations of a pattern of disappearances, the Government was studying 
credible reports to identify the magnitude of the problem and the possible identities of 
perpetrators. The Attorney General assured the Human Rights Council that it was not the policy 
of the State to illegally and surreptitiously arrest persons and detain them in undisclosed 
locations.<b>397</b>  
</p>
<p>201. Since the Government announced its victory over the LTTE in May 2009, reports have 
drawn attention to the detention of more than 10,000 persons suspected of having been involved 
with the LTTE. Human Rights Watch reported that it documented several cases in which 
individuals had been taken into custody without regard for the protection provided under Sri 
Lankan law. In many cases, the authorities had not informed family members about the 
whereabouts of the detained, leaving them in secret, incommunicado detention or possible 
enforced disappearance.<b>398</b> ICRC was reportedly barred from the main detention camps for 
displaced persons.<b>398</b> Amnesty International expressed the same concern about an estimated 
10,000 to 12,000 individuals suspected of ties to the LTTE, who are or have been detained 
incommunicado in irregular detention facilities operated by the Sri Lankan security forces and 
affiliated paramilitary groups since May 2009.<b>399</b>

detention. In his report of 12 March 2003, Emmanuel Decaux, the OSCE Rapporteur, stated that 
&#8220;the fact that their relatives remain up to this time with no news from some prisoners in secret 
detention, as Mr. Nazarov or Mr. Shikhmuradov, nourishes rumours according to which these 
individuals - considered as too compromising for the regime - are said to have already died in 
prison&#8221;.<b>400</b> The case of Boris Shikhmuradov is currently under the consideration of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.<b>401</b> 
</p>
<p>204. On 7 October 2005, the Special Rapporteur on torture sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government of Turkmenistan concerning the situation of a number of individuals sentenced in 
December 2002 and January 2003 to prison terms ranging from five years to life for their alleged 
involvement in the above-mentioned assassination attempt.<b>402 </b>The Rapporteur noted that the 
prisoners continued to be held incommunicado, without access to families, lawyers or 
independent bodies, such as ICRC. On 23 September 2009, Amnesty International issued a 
&#8220;postcard&#8221; calling upon the President to shed light on the disappeared persons in Turkmenistan 
with reference to the group arrested after the alleged attack on the former President in late 
2002.<b>403</b>

at the numerous allegations of excessive use of force and ill-treatment by Uzbek military and 
security forces in the May 2005 events at Andijan, which resulted in, according to the State 
party, 187 deaths, and according to other sources, 700 or more, and in hundreds of others being 
detained thereafter. Notwithstanding the State party&#8217;s persistent response to all allegations that 
the measures taken were in fact appropriate, the Committee noted with concern the State party&#8217;s 
failure to conduct full and effective investigations into all claims of excessive force by officials. 
The Committee also expressed concern about the fact that the State party had limited and 
obstructed independent monitoring of human rights in the aftermath of the events, thus impairing 
the ability to make a reliable or credible assessment of the reported abuses, including 
ascertaining information on the whereabouts and reported torture or ill-treatment of persons 
detained and/or missing. The Committee also received credible reports that some persons who 
had sought refuge abroad and were returned to the country had been kept in detention in 
unknown places and possibly subjected to breaches of the Convention. In this direction, the 
Committee recommended that Uzbekistan provide information to family members on the

events.<b>404</b> 
</p>
<p>206. On 31 January 2006, Erkin Musaev, an Uzbek national and a local staff member of the 
United Nations Development Programme in Uzbekistan, was reportedly arrested by the Uzbek 
National Security Service (SNB); his family was not informed about his whereabouts for more 
than 10 days. During his detention, he was subjected to various forms of pressure, including 
threats by the interrogators, who forced him to sign a confession. On 13 June 2006, following a 
reportedly secret and flawed trial, Mr. Musaev was found guilty of high treason, disclosure of 
State secrets, abuse of office and negligence by a military court in Tashkent. The verdict 
indicated that the information he provided was utilized by unfriendly forces to organize the 
disturbances in Andijan. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared his detention 
arbitrary in its opinion No. 14/2008 of 9 May 2008.<b>405 </b>By notes verbales dated 
27 September 2007 and 25 April 2008, the Government of Uzbekistan provided the Working 
Group with information about the detention and trials of Mr. Musaev. On 9 March 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture sent an urgent appeal summarizing the case and expressing serious concern for 
Mr. Musaev&#8217;s physical and mental integrity following his alleged transfer to a different prison.<b>406 
</b>On 23 February 2009, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special Rapporteur on torture 
sent another urgent appeal to the Government of Uzbekistan. It was reported that, on 
26 July 2008, Mr. Musaev was threatened by two officers from the SNB that, if he or his family 
did not withdraw their petitions or continued to make complaints to international human rights 
mechanisms or to spread news about the above decision, they would face reprisals.<b>407</b>

<p>A considerable number of persons alleged that they had been held for some time, and in 
most cases ill-treated, in places which did not appear to be official detention facilities, 
before being transferred to a recognised law enforcement structure or released &#8230; As for 
places where persons may be unlawfully detained, a number of consistent allegations were 
received in respect of one or more places in the village of Tsentoroy, and of the &#8220;Vega 
base&#8221; located in the outskirts of Gudermes. Several allegations were also received of 
unlawful detentions in the Shali and Urus-Martan areas.<b>408 </b> 
</p>
<p>In its statement, the Committee indicated that the problem of what it called &#8220;unlawful detention&#8221; 
persisted in the Chechen Republic as well as other parts of the North Caucasian region. It 
described its visits to an unofficial place of detention in Tsentoroy, the Vega base and the 
Headquarters of the Vostok Battalion in Gudermes. Although no more detainees were held there, 
the Committee found clear signs that these places had been previously used for detention 
purposes. The Committee&#8217;s observations are confirmed by judgements made by the European 
Court of Human Rights, which has frequently established violations of the European Convention 
on Human Rights, some of which involved periods of secret detention.<b>409 </b>In October 2009, the 
Human Rights Committee expressed its concern about ongoing reports of torture and 
ill-treatment, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest, extrajudicial killing and secret detention in 
Chechnya and other parts of the North Caucasus committed by military, security services and 
other state agents, and that the authors of these violations appeared to enjoy widespread impunity 
owing to a systematic lack of effective investigation and prosecution. The Committee was 
particularly concerned that the number of disappearances and abduction cases in Chechnya had 
increased in the period 2008-2009.<b>410</b>

</p>
<p>210. In its submission to the Human Rights Committee at its ninety-seventh session, the 
Government of the Russian Federation also stated that criminal investigations had been opened 
into several cases of disappearances in the Chechen Republic. Some of these investigations were 
suspended owing to a failure to identify the person or person to be charged or the whereabouts of 
the accused. The authorities had also created a comprehensive programme on preventing 
kidnappings and disappearances.<b>411</b> 
</p>
<p>211. After receiving the Government&#8217;s replies to the questionnaire, the experts conducted 
interviews with several men who testified about secret detention in the Russian Federation. 
Owing to fear of repression against themselves or their families, and because of the climate of 
impunity,<b>412 </b>most people addressed did not want to be interviewed by the experts or to be 
identified. The experts agreed to preserve the confidentiality of the sources, as the interviewed 
persons feared that the divulgation of their identities could cause harm to the individuals 
involved. 
</p>
<p>212. In an interview conducted on 12 October 2009, X.Z., a Chechen who had been living in 
Dagestan, and was now living in exile, explained that he had been held in secret detention and 
tortured for five days in the summer of 2005, apparently in connection with a search for a 
wounded man who had been brought to his house by a friend. Blindfolded throughout his

</p>
<p><b>412</b>  On 29 December 2009, Nurdi Nukhazhiev, Ombudsman of Chechnya, reported that &#8220;close 
relatives of more than 5000 kidnapped and missing citizens are exasperated by the inaction over 
many years of the Military Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Military Investigative Department in 
addressing this problem&#8221;. See www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/12126/ and the original website 
of the Ombudsman (in Russian) at the address

detention, he knew very little about the building where the cell was located. The cell had a toilet, 
which was also the only source of drinking water for the detainee. For food, he occasionally 
received a piece of bread. He heard a man screaming close by, indicating that other persons were 
being detained and tortured in the same building, which had bare concrete floors (in the cell) and 
could not possibly have been a civilian dwelling&#8221;.<b>413</b> 
</p>
<p>213. In another interview conducted on 12 October 2009, X.X., another Chechen who had been 
living in Dagestan and now living in exile, explained that he had been subjected to harassment 
and short-term detention since 1991, when he participated in a demonstration against the war. 
This led to his name appearing on a &#8220;black list&#8221;, and he was detained whenever there was an 
incident, and was usually held for one or two days at a time and secretly (incommunicado and 
without any subsequent judicial procedure). In early 2004, after the deputy head of the local 
branch of the Federal Security Bureau (FSB) was killed, he was briefly detained, taken to a 
forest, made to dig his own grave and threatened and beaten, then released. He was then seized 
again in early March, and held in incommunicado detention for three days in a prison where 
torture was used to extract false confessions. He was then put on trial with all mention of his 
incommunicado detention erased from the record. With help from his family, he however 
managed to avoid conviction and to be released.<b>414</b> 
</p>
<p>214. In a third interview, X.Y. explained how he had been seized from his house in Dagestan in 
late 2007, then taken to a secret facility that he called a concentration camp &#8220;where people do not 
come back from&#8221;, in Gudermes district, Chechnya, run by the FSB, the foreign military 
intelligence service of the Russian armed forces (GRU) and the Anti-Terrorist Centre. He 
described being held in an old concrete building, recalled a terrible smell and walls covered in 
blood, and explained that he had been &#8220;severely tortured&#8221; for 10 days, which included receiving 
electric shocks, being beaten with iron bars, and being burned with a lighter. He also explained 
that he was never given food and received only one glass of water per day, and that he had 
witnessed a man beaten to death and whose organs were then removed. After 10 days, he was 
taken to a forest, where he narrowly escaped being extrajudicially executed. He also said that 
several other secret facilities, such as the one where he had been held, exist in Chechnya, and 
now also in Dagestan.<b>415</b>

<p><b>1.  Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>216. In its latest report on Algeria, dated 26 May 2008, the Committee against Torture 
expressed its concern that secret detention centres existed in Algeria, run by the Department of 
Information and Security (DRS). In this connection, the Committee made reference to reports of 
the existence of secret detention centres run by the Department in its military barracks in Antar, 
in the Hydra district of Algiers, which are outside the control of the courts.<b>416 </b>In its comments on 
the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee, Algeria &#8220;categorically refuted the 
allegations with regard to alleged places of detention that reportedly lie outside the reach of the 
law. In all the time that they have been promoting subversion and attacking republican 
institutions, the people making such allegations have never been able to put forward any 
documentary evidence.&#8221; Furthermore, the State Party affirmed that &#8220;it exercises its authority 
over all places of detention under its jurisdiction and that it has been granting permission for 
visits by independent national and international institutions for more than eight years.&#8221;<b>417</b> 
</p>
<p>217. In its response to a questionnaire about the present study (see annex I), the Government of 
Algeria stated that secret detention was not used by the police services of Algeria; the law 
precluded such practice. The methods for dealing with terrorism were within a strict legal 
framework, with investigations to be carried out within allowed time limits, and with magistrates 
being informed. In an emergency situation in the context of counter-terrorism threatening the 
public order, a presidential decree may be made of a state of emergency, notified to the 
United Nations, authorizing the Minister for the Interior to take measures of house arrest as 
administrative internment. It was in this context, controlled by presidential decree, that such rare 
and exceptional measures may be taken. This was believed to be an effective measure in the 
effort against terrorism. 
</p>
<p>218. In its briefing to the Committee against Torture, Amnesty International also referred to &#8220;a 
persistent pattern of secret detention and torture&#8221; by the DRS, noting that the barracks where 
detainees were held in secret detention were &#8220;situated in an area surrounded by forest, concealed 
from public view and not accessible to the public&#8221;.<b>418</b>  
</p>
<p>219. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has reported on two cases in Algeria in recent 
years, as described below. 
</p>
<p>220. M&#8217;hamed Benyamina, an Algerian national domiciled in France since 1997 and married to 
a French national since 1999, was arrested on 9 September 2005 at Oran airport in Algeria by 
plainclothes policemen. He was held for six months in a secret place of detention, and was 
released in March 2006 following a presidential amnesty decree concerning the implementation 
of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation of 27 February 2006. On 2 April 2006, he

was again arrested by plainclothes policemen from the DRS, and taken to DRS premises in 
Tiaret. Officers told his brother that he had been interrogated and released the following 
morning; in reality, he was transferred to Algiers, probably to other DRS premises, before being 
transferred again, on 5 April, to Serkadj prison in Algiers.<b>419</b> According to the Algerian 
authorities, Mr. Benyamina was charged with membership of a terrorist organization active in 
Algeria and abroad. On 7 March 2006, the indictment division of the Algiers court issued a 
decision terminating criminal proceedings against Mr. Benyamina and ordering his release. 
Mr. Benyamina, who had been implicated in extremely serious acts of terrorism, could not 
however benefit from the termination of criminal proceedings but only from a commutation or 
remission of the sentence after the verdict. After bringing the case before the indictment division, 
the Procurator-General once again placed Mr. Benyamina in detention. 
</p>
<p>221. Mohamed Rahmouni disappeared on 18 July 2007, and was transferred to a military prison 
in Blida after six months of secret detention, allegedly at one of the secret centres run by the 
DRS. According to a communication received from the Government on 2 January 2008, 
Mr. Rahmouni was questioned by the military judicial police about his membership of a terrorist 
organization, and then released and assigned to a residence by a decision of the Minister for the 
Interior and the local community on 6 August 2007. He was reportedly found at Blida Military 
Prison (50 km from Algiers) on 26 January 2008.<b>420 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>222. In Egypt, a state of emergency has been in force continuously since 1958, with the 
exception of a short period from May 1980 until the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat in 
October 1981. In May 2008, it was extended for another two-year period, even though State 
officials, including President Mubarak, had repeatedly said that they would not seek to renew the 
state of emergency beyond its expiration on 31 May 2008.<b>421</b> 
</p>
<p>223. In his report on his mission to Egypt in April 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism 
referred to an emergency law framework primarily used to countering terrorism in the country. 
In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the use of exceptional powers in the prevention and 
investigation of terrorist crimes reflected a worrying trend in which this phenomenon was 
perceived as an emergency triggering exceptional powers, rather than a serious crime subject to 
normal penal procedures. He also expressed, inter alia, concern about relying on exceptional 
powers in relation to arrest and detention of terrorist suspects that were then inserted into the 
ordinary penal framework of an anti-terrorism law, the practice of administrative detention 
without trial in violation of international norms and the use of unofficial detention facilities, the

heightened risk of torture for terrorist suspects, and the lack of investigation and 
accountability.<b>422</b> 
</p>
<p>224. On 2 September 2009, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture sent an urgent communication to the Government of Egypt 
regarding the alleged enforced disappearance of Mohamed Fahim Hussein, Khaled Adel 
Hussein, Ahmed Adel Hussein, Mohamed Salah Abdel Fattah, Mohamed Hussein Ahmed 
Hussein, Adel Gharieb Ahmed, Ibrahim Mohamed Taha, Sameh Mohamed Taha, Ahmed Saad 
El Awadi, Ahmed Ezzat Ali, Samir Abdel Hamid el Metwalli, Ahmed El Sayed Nasef, Ahmed 
Farhan Sayed Ahmed, Ahmed El Sayed Mahmoud el Mansi, Mohamed Khamis El Sayed 
Ibrahim and Yasser Abdel Qader Abd El Fattah Bisar. According to the information received, 
State Security Intelligence agents are believed to have abducted these 16 persons for having 
allegedly belonged to the &#8220;Zeitoun terror cell&#8221;, accused of Islamist extremism and of preparing 
terrorist attacks. It was also reported that, even though the Government publicly recognized the 
detention of these persons, it did not disclose their place of detention. Mr. El Sayed Mahmoud 
el-Mansi saw his lawyer by chance in the State Security Prosecution at which time he said that, 
following his abduction, he had been blindfolded, stripped naked, tied to an iron bed without a 
mattress and deprived of sleep. He indicated receiving electroshocks to his private parts, nipples 
and ears. Further information received indicates that Mr. Fahim Hussein and Mr. Farhan Sayed 
Ahmed were brought before the Prosecutor on 23 August 2009. It was reported that, during the 
hearing, they stated that they had been tortured. It was also alleged that, after the hearing, they 
were once again taken to an unknown location and that neither the Attorney General nor the 
Chief Prosecutor knew where they were being held. These cases are all still under the 
consideration of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.<b>423</b> 
</p>
<p>225. The experts held an interview with Azhar Khan, a British national who was reportedly held 
in secret detention in Cairo for about five days in July 2008.<b>424 </b>During the interview, Mr. Khan 
reported that, in 2004, he had been arrested for being related to people accused of committing 
terrorist acts, but that he had been later released without charge. Moreover, he reported that, in 
2008, he decided to go to Egypt with a friend, where they arrived on 9 July 2008. Upon arrival at 
the airport, Mr. Khan was detained, but his friend was not. Mr. Khan was then taken to a room 
located before passport control, where he stayed until the following night, when he was taken 
handcuffed, hooded and at gunpoint to a place which he described as an old prison located at 
about 20 minutes from the airport. Upon arrival, he was put in stress positions and had short 
electroshocks applied to his ribs and back. Later, he was taken to a room where two people were 
waiting, one who spoke English, the other Arabic. There were also two other people taking 
notes. The English speaker asked questions related only to the United Kingdom, including about 
his arrest in 2004. He was also asked about his personal life in the United Kingdom, including 
his religion and the mosque he attended. He was interrogated a second time and asked the same

officials. During his detention, he was held handcuffed and hooded. The fifth day, he was 
transferred to a police station, where an official of the British Consulate informed him that he 
was going back to London the following day. Upon arrival in London, he was not formally 
interrogated but asked by British Security officials whether he was well. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>226. With regard to secret detention practiced by the Government of Iraq, the United Nations 
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) referred to &#8220;unofficial detention&#8221; by Iraqi authorities, 
notably the Ministry of the Interior, in several of its reports.<b>425</b> The al-Jadiriya facility is 
mentioned repeatedly in this connection.<b>426</b> In 2006, drawing attention to the lack of effective 
investigations after its discovery, UNAMI noted that:  
</p>
<p>One year after the discovery of the illegal detention centre of al-Jadiriya&#8217;s bunker in 
Baghdad, on 13 November 2005, where 168 detainees were unlawfully detained and 
abused, the United Nations and international NGOs &#8230; continue to request that the 
Government of Iraq publish the findings of the investigation on this illegal detention. It 
may be recalled that a Joint-Inspection Committee was established after the discovery of 
the al-Jadiryia&#8217;s bunker in November 2005, in order to establish the general conditions of 
detention. The existence of the bunker was revealed after a raid of the Ministry of 
Interior&#8217;s bunker by MNF I/Iraqi forces. The Iraqi Government should start a judicial 
investigation into human rights violations in al-Jadiriya. The failure to publish the 
al-Jadiriya report, as well as other investigations carried out by the Government regarding 
conditions of detention in the country, remains a matter of serious concern and affects 
Iraq&#8217;s commitment to establish a new system based on the respect of human rights and the 
rule of law.&#8221;<b>427 </b> 
</p>
<p>Another unofficial place of detention under the Ministry of the Interior was the so-called 
&#8220;site 4&#8221;. According to UNAMI: 
</p>
<p>On 30 May [2006], a joint inspection led by the Deputy Prime Minister and MNF-I, in a 
prison known as &#8220;Site 4,&#8221; revealed the existence of 1,431 detainees with systematic 
evidence of physical and psychological abuse. Related to alleged abuses committed at 
&#8220;Site 4,&#8221; a probe by 3 separate investigative committees was set up. After two and a half 
months, the probe concluded that 57 employees, including high-ranking officers, of the

against them were allegedly issued, but no arrests have reportedly yet taken place.&#8221;<b>428</b> 
</p>
<p>227. In relation to Kurdistan province, UNAMI noted in 2006 that despite concrete 
acknowledgement by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of the arrest of individuals by 
intelligence and security forces and their detention at unofficial detention facilities, there 
appeared to be little impetus by the authorities to effectively address this pervasive and serious 
human rights concern. There had been little official denial of the existence and sometimes 
location of secret and illegal detention cells in Suleimaniya and Erbil, which were often no more 
than rooms in private houses and Government buildings. UNAMI reiterated in 2007 that: 
</p>
<p>The practice of administrative detention of persons held in the custody of the Asayish 
(security) forces in the Kurdistan region, the majority having been arrested on suspicion of 
involvement in acts of terrorism and other serious crimes. Many are said by officials to be 
members or supporters of proscribed Islamist groups. Hundreds of detainees have been 
held for prolonged periods, some for several years, without referral to an investigative 
judge or charges brought against them. In some cases, detainees were arrested without 
judicial warrant and all are routinely denied the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of 
their detention. UNAMI also continues to receive allegations of the torture or ill-treatment 
of detainees in Asayish detention facilities. &#8230; On 28 January and again on 27 February 
[2007], families of detainees arrested by Asayish forces demonstrated before the Kurdistan 
National Assembly in Erbil, demanding information on the whereabouts of detained 
relatives and the reasons for their arrest...<b>429 </b> 
</p>
<p>In 2009, UNAMI further reported that: 
</p>
<p>The KRG 2006 Anti-Terrorism Law, which forms the legal basis for many arrests, has 
been extended into mid-2010. &#8230;UNAMI/HRO continues to document serious violations 
of the rights of suspects and those deprived of their liberties by the KRG authorities. These 
include claims of beatings during interrogation, torture by electric shocks, forced 
confessions, secret detention facilities, and a lack of medical attention. Abuse is often 
committed by masked men or while detainees are blindfolded.<b>430</b>  
</p>
<p>228. The experts took up the case of a group of individuals arrested and held in secret detention 
for prolonged periods in the spring of 2009 in connection with accusations against Mr. al-Dainy,

a former member of Parliament.<b>431</b> According to the allegations received, several former 
collaborators of Mr. al-Dainy were arrested in February 2009 and held in secret detention at a 
number of different locations. In particular, they were detained in a prison in the Green Zone run 
by the Baghdad Brigade. Their families were not notified of their whereabouts for several 
months. The current location of 11 persons is still not known. While held at the Baghdad Brigade 
prison, most of them were subjected to severe ill-treatment, including beating with cables, 
suspension from the ceiling by either the feet or hands for up to two days at a time, or 
electroshocks. Some had black bags put over their heads and were suffocated for several minutes 
until their bodies became blue several times in a row. Also, some had plastic sticks introduced 
into their rectum. They were also threatened with the rape of members of their families. They 
were forced to sign and fingerprint pre-prepared confessions. As a result of the ill-treatment, 
several of them had visible injuries on several parts of their bodies. Many lost a considerable 
amount of weight.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Israel 
</b></p>
<p>229. In its report of May 2009, the Committee against Torture quoted an official figure 
of 530 Palestinians held in administrative detention in Israel (while noting that it was &#8220;as many 
as 700&#8221; according to non-governmental sources). The Committee also highlighted a disturbing 
piece of legislation related to holding detainees as &#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221;, explaining that 
Unlawful Combatants Law No. 5762-2002, as amended in August 2008, allowed for the 
detention of non-Israeli citizens falling into the category of &#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221;, described as 
&#8220;combatants who are believed to have taken part in hostile activity against Israel, directly or 
indirectly&#8221;, for a period of up to 14 days without any judicial review. Detention orders under this 
law could be renewed indefinitely; evidence was made available neither to the detainee nor to the 
person&#8217;s lawyer and, although the detainees had the right to petition the Supreme Court, the 
charges against them were also reportedly kept secret. According to the State party, 12 persons 
were currently being detained under the law.<b>432</b> 
</p>
<p>230. The Committee also mentioned the alleged secret detention facility no. 1391, noting with 
concern that, although the Government claimed that it had not been used since 2006 to detain or 
interrogate security suspects, the Supreme Court had rejected several petitions urging an 
examination of the facility. The Committee reminded the Government of Israel that it should 
ensure that no one was detained in any secret detention facility under its control in the future, as 
a secret detention centre was per se a breach of the Convention.<b>433</b> The Committee went further 
by calling on the Government to &#8220;investigate and disclose the existence of any other such facility 
and the authority under which it has been established&#8221;.

<p><b>5.  Jordan 
</b></p>
<p>231. Although the involvement of Jordan in the CIA proxy detention programme seems to have 
come to an end in 2005,<b>434</b> secret detention in a domestic context remains a problem. This is 
above and beyond the sweeping powers of the Law on Crime Prevention Act of 1954, which 
&#8220;empowers provincial governors to authorize the detention without charge or trial of anyone 
suspected of committing a crime or &#8216;deemed to be a danger to society&#8217;. Such detention orders 
can be imposed for one year and are renewable.&#8221;<b>435 </b>Pursuant to the act, authorities may 
arbitrarily detain and isolate individuals at will under the guise of administrative detention.<b>436</b> In 
its 2009 report, Amnesty International explained that 12,178 men and 81 women (according to 
figures gathered in 2007) were held without charge or trial under this provision.<b>437</b> 
</p>
<p>232. In 2007, for example, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reported on the case of 
Issam Mohamed Tahar Al Barqaoui Al Uteibi, a writer and theologian known in Jordan and in 
the Arab world who had been repeatedly accused of &#8220;promoting and glorifying terrorism&#8221; by the 
security services. He was detained for the first time from 1994 to 1999, and arrested on 
28 November 2002, with 11 other people, on charges of &#8220;conspiracy to commit terrorist acts&#8221; as 
a result of public statements that he made through the media. Tried by the State Security Court, 
he was acquitted on 27 December 2004. He was not released, however, but detained again for six 
months, from 27 December 2004 to 28 June 2005, at a secret detention facility (which later 
turned out to be the Headquarters of the General Intelligence Directorate, the Jordanian 
intelligence service), where he alleges that he was tortured. He was interviewed after his release 
by Al-Jazeera on 4 July 2005, when he condemned the military occupation of Iraq. Following the 
interview, he was again secretly detained on 5 July 2005.<b>438</b> He was finally released 
on 12 March 2008.<b>439</b>  
</p>
<p><b>6.  Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
</b></p>
<p>233. In a visit to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in May 2009, representatives of Amnesty 
International noted that the Internal Security Agency (ISA) appeared to have unchecked powers 
in practice to arrest, detain and interrogate individuals suspected of dissent against the political

system or deemed to present a security threat, to hold them incommunicado for prolonged 
periods and deny them access to lawyers, in breach even of the limited safeguards set out in the 
country&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure.<b>440 </b>In addition, Human Rights Watch recently reported on 
continuing practices of incommunicado and secret detention in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.<b>441</b> 
</p>
<p>234. In 2007, the Human Rights Committee adopted its final views in <i>Edriss El Hassy v. Libya</i> 
(communication No. 1422/2005). The Committee held that the alleged incommunicado detention 
of the author&#8217;s brother, from around 25 March to 20 May 1995, and again from 24 August 1995 
&#8220;to the present time&#8221; constituted a violation of articles 7 and 9 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights.<b>442</b> With respect to article 6 of the Covenant, the Committee held that, 
as the author had not explicitly requested the Committee to conclude that his brother was dead, it 
was not for it to formulate a finding on article 6. 
</p>
<p>235. In 2005, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances received the case 
of Hatem Al Fathi Al Marghani, who was<b> </b>reportedly held in secret detention by the Libyan 
Security Services from December 2004 to March 2005. During that period, he was not informed 
of any charges against him nor brought before a judge. He was allegedly detained for having 
publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrest and condemnation to execution of his 
brother on the grounds of endangering State security.<b>443</b>  
</p>
<p>236. In 2007, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reported on the case of Mohamed 
Hassan Aboussedra, a medical doctor who was arrested by agents of the Internal Security 
Services in Al-Bayda on 19 January 1989. The agents had no formal arrest warrant and no 
charges were laid against him. His four brothers were also secretly detained for three years until 
information was made available that they were detained at Abu Salim prison. On 9 June 2005, 
Mr. Aboussedra, who was also held at Abu Salim, was moved to an unknown location by agents 
of the Internal Security Services, in spite of a judicial order for his release. After being sentenced 
to a prison term of 10 years in 2004, the Appellate Court ordered his release on account of the 
years that he had already spent in prison, from 1989 until 2005. Mr. Aboussedra was not 
released, however; he was kept in detention and transferred to an unknown location. He has been

</p>
<p>237. On 13 October 2009, the experts conducted an interview with Aissa Hamoudi, an 
Algerian/Swiss national, who was held incommunicado for three months in a prison in the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya without knowing where he was detained. On 18 November 2007, while 
on a business trip to the country, Mr. Hamoudi was arrested in Tripoli by policemen conducting 
a simple identity check. After a day spent in police custody, he was handed over to the interior 
services, who took him to a prison where he was held for three months in a cell with four other 
men, and interrogated every week, or every other week, on numerous topics. He was asked 
detailed information about his family, and general questions on his political views, his 
relationship to Switzerland and other countries. In the last month of his detention, he was left in a 
cell without a bathroom or water, and had to ask permission for anything he required. In this 
period, he was not interrogated, but was beaten once when he tried to go on a hunger strike. He 
was then transferred to the &#8220;passports prison&#8221;, run by the Exterior Services, which housed 
around 4,000 detainees, mainly foreigners, waiting to be sent back to their respective countries, 
where he was held for 10 days in terrible sanitary conditions, but was never interrogated. He 
witnessed other detainees being tortured, but was not tortured himself. It was here that a 
representative of the Consulate of Algeria found him, and took steps to initiate his release. He 
was never charged with anything, and for his entire stay under arrest he was held totally 
incommunicado. His family did not know where he was, and although he was kept in known 
places, he was secretly detained.<b>445</b> 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p>238. Saudi Arabia has a legal limit of six months of detention before trial, but in reality the 
domestic intelligence agency - the General Directorate for Investigations, or Mahabith, run by 
the Ministry of the Interior - functions without effective judicial oversight, running its own 
prisons, which are used to hold both political prisoners and those regarded as being involved in 
terrorism, and ignoring court orders to release detainees held for longer than the legal limit. In 
July 2007, the Minister for the Interior admitted that 9,000 &#8220;security suspects&#8221; had been detained 
between 2003 and 2007, and that 3,106 of them were still being held.<b>446</b> 
</p>
<p>239. In recent years, United Nations bodies have focused on several cases in Saudi Arabia, 
including the ones set out below.

Abdulaziz al-Khuraiji, Moussa al-Garni, Abdulrahman Sadeq Khan, Al-Sharif Seif Al-Dine 
Shahine and, allegedly, Mohammed Hasan al-Qurashi - were arrested on 2 February 2007 by 
agents of the Intelligence Services (<i>Mabahith</i>) in Jeddah and Medina and had been held in 
incommunicado detention at an unknown location ever since. The arrest of these men, who 
comprise doctors, academics, businessmen, a lawyer and a retired judge, and are all 
long-standing advocates of political and social reforms, was ordered by the Ministry of the 
Interior on the basis of allegations of financing terrorism and illegal activities. At the time of the 
report, the Government had not refuted the fact that the men had already been held in secret 
detention for 156 days, and had denied visits, access to a lawyer and the opportunity to question 
the legality of their detention.<b>447</b> 
</p>
<p>241. The experts conducted an interview with Hassna Ali Ahmed al-Zahrani, the wife of Saud 
Mukhtar al-Hashimi, a doctor and an advocate for civil and political liberties who, at the time, 
had been held for two years and nine months, including many months of incommunicado 
detention. Mrs. al-Zahrani explained that, on the night of 2 February 2007, her husband went out 
with friends (including a university professor and a judge) to attend a meeting, but never 
returned. She learned of his arrest when the Minister for the Interior made a public statement 
regarding arrests after a raid, and spoke to her husband by telephone after 10 days, when he was 
held in an annex to a prison run by the Public Investigations Unit (PIU). He was then held 
incommunicado in a PIU prison for five months until she was allowed to meet him, when he told 
her that he was being held in solitary confinement, and that he was also being interrogated, 
sometimes at night. Despite being allowed visits from his wife, Mr. al-Hashimi has never been 
formally charged, has not been allowed access to a lawyer and has not been brought before a 
judge. The reasons given for his arrest and detention vary, and they include allegations that he 
has been advocating reform, fund-raising or simply that he is a &#8220;suspect&#8221;.<b>448</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>8.  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>242. When considering the third periodic report of the Syrian Arab Republic, the Human Rights 
Committee noted with concern the state of emergency that has been in force in the country since 
1963, which provides for many derogations in law or practice from the rights guaranteed under 
articles 9, 14, 19 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, without any 
convincing explanations being given as to the relevance of these derogations to the conflict with 
Israel and the necessity for these derogations to meet the exigencies of the situation claimed to 
have been created by the conflict. The Committee also noted that the State party had not fulfilled 
its obligation to notify other States parties of the derogations it has made and of the reasons for 
these derogations, as required by article 4 (3) of the Covenant. As a consequence, the Committee 
recommended that State parties should ensure firstly that the measures it had taken, in law and 
practice, to derogate from Covenant rights were strictly required by the exigencies of the 
situation; secondly, that the rights provided for in article 4 (2) of the Covenant were made 
non-derogable in law and practice; and thirdly, that States parties were duly informed, as

required by article 4 (3) of the Covenant, of the provisions from which it had derogated and the 
reasons therefore, and of the termination of any particular derogation.<b>449</b>  
</p>
<p>243. The Human Rights Committee also expressed its concern at continuing reports of torture 
and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, practices that it found to be facilitated 
by the resort to prolonged incommunicado detention, especially in cases of concern to the 
Supreme State Security Court, and by the security or intelligence services. As a consequence, the 
Committee recommended that the State party should take firm measures to stop the use of 
incommunicado detention and eradicate all forms of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment by law enforcement officials, and should ensure prompt, thorough and 
impartial investigations by an independent mechanism into all allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment, prosecute and punish perpetrators, and provide effective remedies and 
rehabilitation to the victims.<b>450</b> 
</p>
<p>244. The experts note a recent report of Human Rights Watch in which concern is expressed at 
the current situation of the Kurdish community in the Syrian Arab Republic. The organization 
affirmed that, inter alia, the Emergency Law had been used to detain a number of leading 
Kurdish political activists without arrest warrants, and that 30 former Kurdish detainees, who 
were interviewed for the report, had been held incommunicado at the security branches for 
interrogations by security forces and that some of them had allegedly been subjected to torture 
and other forms of ill-treatment, including sleep deprivation and stress positions. Furthermore, it 
is ascertained that these people were only able to inform their relatives of their whereabouts after 
being transferred to ordinary prisons. According to the report, this practice has not only been 
used against Kurdish activists, but also against all political and human rights activists.<b>451</b> 
</p>
<p>245. In 2009, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances transmitted eight 
cases concerning members of the Kurdish community of Kamishli who had been allegedly 
abducted in 2008 and whose whereabouts remain unknown.<b>452 </b> 
</p>
<p>246. In the context of the present study, the experts conducted an interview with Maryam Kallis, 
who was held in secret detention in Damascus from 15 March to 7 June 2009.<b>453</b> According to 
her report, Ms. Kallis was held in the basement of a building located in a private area in 
Baab-Tooma, Damascus, which, she assumed, could have been run by the <i>Mukhabarat</i>, the 
Syrian intelligence services. During this period, Ms. Kallis was taken blindfolded eight to ten

was being held and that, when her husband tried to find out where she was, British authorities 
had said that they could not disclose the place of detention for two reasons: they had an 
agreement with the Syrian Arab Republic not to disclose this place and, if they did, Ms. Kallis&#8217; 
sister could go there and put Ms. Kallis&#8217; life at risk.  
</p>
<p><b>9.  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>247. In 2008, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reported on the case of Abdeljalil 
al-Hattar, who was arrested at dawn on 14 December 2007 by political security officers at a 
mosque in Sana&#8217;a, then handcuffed and taken to an unknown location. For two months, he was 
held incommunicado in cells belonging to the political police. When his family was allowed to 
visit him, they learned that he had not been brought before a magistrate to be formally charged 
with any crime, and had not been given access to a lawyer. In its response to the Working Group 
on 19 November 2008, the Government of Yemen confirmed the arrest of Mr. al-Hattar, citing 
terrorist activity, but claimed that he had never disappeared and that he would be subject to legal 
proceedings.<b>454</b> 
</p>
<p>248. The experts interviewed Mr. al-Hattar, who explained that he had been held in 
incommunicado detention for two months and had been unlawfully detained for a total of 
14 months. Asked whether this arrangement of denying visits for the first couple of months was 
a method regularly adopted by the authorities for detainees, he stated that it varied from person 
to person, but that weekly visits were the usual arrangement for detainees. He was not aware 
whether the detention centre had ever been visited by ICRC.  
</p>
<p>249. Mr. al-Hattar explained that the reason that had been given for his arrest was that he had 
&#8220;hosted a wanted person&#8221; who, in fact, &#8220;was brought to his home by an acquaintance, but not 
known to him personally&#8221;. He stated that it was common local practice to host travellers, but that 
it was two days after he had hosted this person that he was arrested. He also explained that he 
understood that his release had been the result of an agreement reached between the Government 
of Yemen and Al-Qaida, whereby a group of detainees would be released if Al-Qaida ceased its 
attacks. It was his understanding that it was up to the political security unit to select which 
detainees would be released under this arrangement; the unit selected persons such as himself 
who had not been charged and who had been unfairly detained. He added that many young 
people have been unfairly detained in Yemen.<b>455 </b> 
</p>
<p>250. The experts also spoke to another Yemeni subjected to secret detention. A.S. was seized on 
15 August 2007 from his home in Sana&#8217;a, and held in incommunicado detention for two months 
in an official prison belonging to the Political Security Body - Intelligence Unit, the political

security prison in Sana&#8217;a. During that time, no one knew his whereabouts and he did not have 
any access to the outside world, including any access to a doctor, lawyer or ICRC. His family 
was not able to visit him until two months after his arrest. He was apparently seized because of a 
call made from his mobile phone by a relative, and was held for another seven months after the 
initial period of incommunicado detention. He was released on 27 May 2008. In the report on his 
interview, it was noted that, when he asked on the day of his release why he had been detained, 
he was simply told that many innocent people were detained, and he could consider himself to be 
one such person.<b>456</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Sub-Saharan Africa 
</b></p>
<p>251. In sub-Saharan Africa, the experts gathered information about the secret detention of 
political opponents in the Gambia, the Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where anti-terrorist 
rhetoric has been invoked. The information collected by the experts also shows the widespread 
use of secret detention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and several long-standing and 
unresolved cases of secret detention in Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>252. In its report of April 2006, the Committee against Torture expressed concern that officials 
were still depriving people of their liberty arbitrarily, especially in secret places of detention. The 
Committee took note of the outlawing of unlawful places of detention that were beyond the 
control of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, such as prison cells run by the security services and the 
Special Presidential Security Group, where people had been subjected to torture. Nevertheless, it 
remained concerned that officials of the State party were still depriving people of their liberty 
arbitrarily, especially in secret places of detention.<b>457</b> 
</p>
<p>253. The Agence nationale des renseignements (ANR) and the Republican Guard remain widely 
reported to severely restrict the safeguards to which detainees are entitled under international 
law, while at the same time barring any independent monitoring (including by the judiciary), so 
that detention is effectively secret. Detainees are commonly denied the right to be brought before 
a judge within the 48-hour time period stipulated by the national Constitution, which has led to a 
proliferation of detainees who are detained solely on the basis of the <i>Proc&#232;s-verbal de saisie des 
pr&#233;venus</i>, a document issued by the Prosecutor General stipulating that detainees should be 
informed of their rights and of the charges imputed to them. In relation to ANR facilities, judicial 
authorities are barred from carrying out inspections, in clear contravention of the laws of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. This state of affairs is compounded by the constant refusal 
by ANR agents to allow the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office access to their facilities 
in several parts of the country, particularly Kinshasa, South Kivu, Bas-Congo, North Kivu and 
Oriental Province, despite the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and the existence of a directive by President Joseph Kabila dated 5 July 
2005 ordering all security forces, intelligence services and judicial authorities to provide

unhindered access to Office staff. Likewise, access to detention facilities operated by the 
Republican Guard continued to be denied to judicial authorities and civil society organizations, 
as well as to Office staff. <b>458</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Equatorial Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>254. In its report on a mission to Equatorial Guinea in July 2007, the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention explained that it was particularly concerned by the practice of secret 
detention, because it had received information about the kidnapping by Government agents of 
nationals of Equatorial Guinea, taken from neighbouring countries to Malabo and held in secret 
detention there. In some cases, the authorities had not acknowledged that the persons in question 
were held in detention, which meant that, technically, they were considered to be missing.<b>459</b> 
</p>
<p>255. During its mission, the Working Group interviewed four people - Carmelo Ncogo Mitigo, 
Jes&#250;s Mich&#225; Mich&#225;, Juan Bestue Santander and Juan Mar&#237;a Itutu M&#233;ndez - who were detained in 
secret for 18 months before being transferred to Bata. The Working Group also reported that, 
during their secret detention, the people had worn handcuffs and leg irons, the marks of which 
the Working Group was able to observe directly.<b>460 </b>The people were part of a group of five exiles 
arrested in Libreville on 3 June 2004 by members of the Gabonese security forces for their 
alleged participation in the incidents that took place on the island of Corisco in 2004. Ten days 
after they were apprehended, they were handed over to security officials of Equatorial Guinea 
and transported in secret to Malabo. No formal extradition proceedings were observed. For one 
and a half years they were held incommunicado and underwent torture. 
</p>
<p>256. In 2006, the four were accused of rebellion, but had not been put on trial by the time of the 
Working Group&#8217;s mission. Their lawyer explained that he had difficulties meeting with them 
since he only saw them on the day that they were formally charged.  
</p>
<p>257. The Working Group also reported that it had been unable to interview four other 
individuals - Juan Ondo Abaga, Felipe Esono Ntutumu, Florencio Ela Bibang and Antimo Edu 
Nchama - who, according to a letter they had sent to the Working Group, were kept in a separate 
wing of the prison at Black Beach. The Working Group added that, according to the complaints 
received, the four individuals had been transferred to Equatorial Guinea in a military aircraft and 
imprisoned in Black Beach. They had official refugee status in the countries where they were 
living (Benin and Nigeria). They were kidnapped and subsequently detained without the benefit 
of any legal proceedings.<b>461</b> In 2008, the Working Group added that the four had continued to be

detained in secret locations until their trial, when they were charged with having posed a threat to 
State security, rebellion and participation in a coup d&#8217;etat on 8 October 2004.<b>462</b> 
</p>
<p>258. The allegations of the secret detention of three of the individuals - Florencio Ela Bibang, 
Antimo Edu Nchama and Felipe Esono Ntutumu - were confirmed to the Special Rapporteur on 
torture during his country visit in November 2008. He mentioned several reports indicating that 
Equatoguinean officials had been involved in, or had themselves committed, kidnapping abroad 
before transferring the individuals to Equatorial Guinea and holding them in secret and/or 
incommunicado detention, noting that this had allegedly been the case of three people still being 
held in secret detention, probably in Black Beach prison, whom the Special Rapporteur was not 
able to meet because he was unable to gain access to the part of the prison where they were 
reportedly held. A number of other cases of prolonged secret detention, most often of persons 
accused of political crimes, were also brought to his attention. The Special Rapporteur 
interviewed one individual who had been arrested in Cameroon, where he used to live as a 
refugee some months prior to the visit. He had then been handed over to soldiers of the 
Equatoguinean Presidential Guard, who took him to Malabo. He was detained incommunicado in 
solitary confinement, handcuffed and in leg irons. The restraints were removed shortly before the 
Special Rapporteur arrived.<b>463</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p>259. In a report in 2004 by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the case 
of 11 former Eritrean Government officials was discussed, and also examined by the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention. The 11 in question - Petros Solomon, Ogbe Abraha, Haile 
Woldetensae, Mahmud Ahmed Sheriffo, Berhane Ghebre Eghzabiher, Astier Feshation, Saleh 
Kekya, Hamid Himid, Estifanos Seyoum, Germano Nati and Beraki Ghebre Selassie - were 
arrested in Asmara on 18 and 19 September 2001, after they had been openly critical of the 
policies of the Government. They were part of a senior group of 15 officials of the ruling 
People&#8217;s Front for Democracy and Justice, which, in May 2001, had written an open letter to 
ruling party members, criticizing the Government for acting in an &#8220;illegal and unconstitutional&#8221; 
manner.<b>464</b> 
</p>
<p>260. The Government subsequently claimed that the 11 individuals had been detained &#8220;because 
of crimes against the nations&#8217; security and sovereignty&#8221;, but refused to release any other 
information about them - either where they were being held, or how they were being treated. In

the report, it was noted that their whereabouts was &#8220;currently unknown&#8221;, although it was 
suggested that they &#8220;may be held in some management building between the capital Asmara and 
the port of Massawa&#8221;.<b>465</b> 
</p>
<p>261. In submitting a claim of <i>habeas corpus</i> to the Minister for Justice, the complainants acting 
on behalf of the 11 asked the Eritrean authorities to reveal where the 11 detainees were being 
held, to either charge them and bring them to court or promptly release them, to guarantee that 
none of them would be ill-treated and that they had immediate access to lawyers of their choice, 
their families and adequate medical care. The Commission reported that &#8220;the Complainants 
allege that no reaction has been received from the Eritrean authorities&#8221;.<b>466</b> 
</p>
<p>262. In its opinion No. 3/2002, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention noted that the 11 
were detained in isolation for nine months, in one or more secret locations, where they had no 
contact whatsoever with lawyers or their families.<b>467 </b>By 2003, the African Commission noted 
that they had then been held in secret detention for more than 18 months, and that the only 
response from the Government regarding their whereabouts had been a letter from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs on 20 May 2002, stating that they &#8220;had their quarters in appropriate 
Government facilities, had not been ill-treated, have had continued access to medical services 
and that the Government was making every effort to bring them before an appropriate court of 
law as early as possible&#8221;.<b>468</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Gambia 
</b></p>
<p>263. In its submission to the Human Rights Council for the review of the Gambia under the 
universal periodic review mechanism, Amnesty International demonstrated that, since the failed 
coup attempt of March 2006, alleged opponents of the regime, including journalists, opposition 
politicians and their supporters, were routinely unlawfully detained in official places of 
detention, such as the Mile II State Central Prison, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) 
headquarters and police detention centres. Other official places of detention include 
Banjulinding, a police training centre, and Jeshwang and Janjanbureh prisons in the interior of 
the country. Others were held in secret detention centres, allegedly including Fort Buling and 
other military barracks, secret quarters in police stations such as in Bundung, police stations in 
remote areas such as Sara Ngai and Fatoto, and warehouses, such as in Kanilai. Special units 
within the NIA, as well as the President&#8217;s personal protection officers and members of the army

and the police, were alleged to have tortured or ill-treated detainees. Torture and other 
ill-treatment were used to obtain information, as punishment and to extract confessions to use as 
evidence in court.<b>469</b> 
</p>
<p>264. Yahya Bajinka, a brother of former presidential bodyguard Major Khalipha Bajinka, who 
was accused of being involved in the March 2006 coup plot, was arrested in April 2007 and held 
for over a year in secret detention. He is known to have been tortured, and was denied medical 
attention in an attempt to keep his detention secret in the maximum security wing of Mile II State 
Central Prison.<b>470</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>265. Detention of political dissidents, persons suspected of involvement in the activities of rebel 
groups, and human rights defenders by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) 
has long given rise to well-documented human rights concerns. In 2007, the Human Rights 
Committee voiced its concern at the many reports from non-governmental sources of &#8220;ghost 
houses&#8221; and clandestine detention centres&#8221; in the Sudan.<b>471</b> In a report on the human rights 
situation in Darfur submitted to the Council by seven special procedures mandates holders in 
September 2007, it was noted that the Government had provided no information with regard to 
the closure of all unofficial places of detention, and that there seemed to be persistent ambiguity 
over persons detained under national security laws and the extent to which places of detention 
were known outside the NISS.<b>472</b> 
</p>
<p>266. The tenth periodic report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan of November 2008 contained a detailed study of NISS 
detention practices, including secret detention, based on three years of monitoring by 
United Nations human rights officers and interviews with many released NISS detainees.<b>473</b> In 
June 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan reported that, in 
northern Sudan, the NISS continued to systematically use arbitrary arrest and detention against

political dissidents. Detainees were often held for several months without charge or access to a 
lawyer or their families. The locations in which NISS detainees were held sometimes remained 
unknown.<b>474</b> 
</p>
<p>267. Of particular concern for the purposes of the present study are the cases of the men 
detained in the aftermath of the attack on Omdurman in May 2008 by rebels belonging to the 
Darfurian Justice and Equality Movement. Following the attack, Government security forces 
rounded up hundreds of Darfurians in the capital, the majority of them civilians. In August 2008, 
it was reported that hundreds of these individuals were still held in undisclosed places of 
detention and denied all contact with the outside world. 
</p>
<p>268. The experts interviewed one of the above-mentioned individuals, X.W., who explained 
that, after being seized at his place of work, he was taken to the NISS Political Bureau of 
Security Services in Bahri, Khartoum, near the Shandi bus terminal, where he was held in 
incommunicado detention for nearly two months. Interrogated and tortured for five days, he was 
then moved from a corridor, where those being interrogated were held, to a large hall where 
about 200 detainees were held and where the lights were constantly on. Moved to Kober prison 
in July 2008, he continued to be held in incommunicado detention. X.W. was released in 
September 2008.<b>475</b> 
</p>
<p>269. While X.W. was at no stage brought before a judge or charged with any offence, many 
others were brought before special anti-terrorism courts, which imposed death sentences in more 
than 100 cases. In two communications to the Government of the Sudan, five special procedures 
mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to reliable reports, according to which:  
</p>
<p>Following their apprehension, the defendants were held without access to the outside world 
for over one month and were not given access to lawyers until after the trial proceedings 
opened. Observers at the trials noticed that the defendants looked tired and appeared to be 
in pain. The defendants complained that they had been subjected to torture or ill-treatment, 
but the court did not investigate these allegations and refused to grant requests by the 
defendants&#8217; lawyers for independent medical examinations. In reaching their verdicts, the 
courts relied as evidence primarily on confessions by the defendants, which the defendants 
said they were forced to make under torture and ill-treatment and which they retracted in 
court. The court made reference to the Sudanese Evidence Act, which permits the 
admission to judicial proceedings of statements obtained by unlawful means.<b>476</b>

270. No reply to these communications was received from the Government. At the time of 
writing, the National Assembly was considering a new national security bill, which would 
confirm the sweeping powers of the NISS, including detention without judicial control for up to 
30 days. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>271. In 2004, when the Human Rights Committee addressed claims that &#8220;safe houses&#8221; were 
being used by the Government of Uganda as places of unacknowledged detention, where persons 
had been subjected to torture by military personnel, the Committee expressed its concern that 
State agents continued arbitrarily to deprive persons of their liberty, including in 
unacknowledged places of detention, in particular in northern Uganda. It was also concerned 
about the widespread practice of torture and ill-treatment of persons detained by the military as 
well as by other law enforcement officials.<b>477</b> 
</p>
<p>272. In 2005, the Committee against Torture followed up on the report of the Human Rights 
Committee, stating that it had taken note of the explanation provided by the delegation about the 
outlawing of &#8220;ungazetted&#8221; or unauthorized places of detention or &#8220;safe houses&#8221;, where people 
had been subjected to torture by military personnel. Nevertheless, it remains concerned about the 
widespread practice of torture and ill-treatment of persons detained by the military and other law 
enforcement officials.<b>478</b> 
</p>
<p>273. The Committee recommended that the Government of Uganda abolish the use of 
ungazetted or unauthorized places of detention or &#8220;safe houses&#8221;, and immediately provide 
information about all places of detention.<b>478 
</b></p>
<p>274. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her report on the work of 
her Office in Uganda, stated that, immediately prior to the elections, in early February 2006, 
violent incidents were reported, with several people injured or killed in various locations. 
Opposition politicians, supporters and media personnel were subjected to harassment, arbitrary 
arrests and detentions by security operatives, including from the Chieftaincy of Military 
Intelligence and the Violent Crimes Crack Unit, and some elements of the Army. People arrested 
on charges of treason claimed to have been tortured, or suffered other forms of ill-treatment in 
ungazetted safe houses.<b>479</b> It was also noted in the report that in June 2006, a spokesperson for 
the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Force publicly recognized the existence of ungazetted safe houses, 
arguing their necessity for the purpose of protecting witnesses (protective custody).<b>480</b> 
</p>
<p>275. Nevertheless, in April 2009, Human Rights Watch issued a report in which it indicated 
that, between 2006 and 2008, at least 106 people had been held in a secret detention centre in

Kololo, an upmarket suburb of Kampala where many embassies and ambassadors&#8217; residences are 
located, and where the use of torture was commonplace. The report was based on a detailed 
analysis of the activities of the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force (JATT), established in 1999 
primarily to deal with the threat posed by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel 
group based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, as Human Rights Watch 
explained, under the cover of its mandate to deal with terrorism, &#8220;individuals allegedly linked to 
other groups, such as Al-Qaida, have also suffered at the hands of JATT&#8221;.<b>481</b> 
</p>
<p>276. Moreover, although the Rwandan newspaper the<i> New Times </i>reported on 19 July 2006 that 
Kyanjo Hussein, the shadow Minister for Internal Affairs had told a meeting of the 
Parliamentary Committee of Internal Affairs and Defence in July 2006 that JATT was holding 
30 Rwandan and Congolese detainees,<b>482 </b>and former detainees also told Human Rights Watch 
about non-Ugandans held in Kololo for long periods of time, and explained that &#8220;they saw 
foreigners, such as Somalis, Rwandans, Eritreans and Congolese, in the JATT compound&#8221;, it 
appears that the majority of cases involved terrorism - and, specifically, fears of terrorist 
activities organized by Muslims, who make up 12 per cent of the population of Uganda. Human 
Rights Watch noted that, &#8220;of the 106 named individuals detained by JATT documented by 
Human Rights Watch, all but two were Muslim&#8221;.<b>483</b>  
</p>
<p>277. Of the foreigners held specifically in connection with terrorism, the most prominent 
examples are two South Africans citizens, Mufti Hussain Bhayat and Haroon Saley, who were 
arrested at Entebbe Airport on 18 August 2008 and taken to Kololo. Although the men&#8217;s capture 
received significant news coverage in Uganda and South Africa, they were held in Kololo for 11 
days without charge, and were only freed - and deported - when their lawyer secured a <i>habeas 
corpus</i> hearing. Relating his experience afterwards, Mr. Bhayat stated that &#8220;questions were read 
from a roll of fax paper from an unknown source&#8221;, which suggests that JATT was also working 
with the intelligence services of other countries.<b>483</b>

resulting in &#8220;at least 180 deaths, and at least 9,000 people injured from torture, beatings and 
other violations perpetrated mainly by security forces, war veterans and supporters of the 
Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU-PF)&#8221;,<b>484</b> the Government also seized at least 24

incommunicado detention for up to seven months, and then put them on trial for acts of sabotage, 
banditry and terrorism against the Government, which was a clear manipulation of 
terrorist-related rhetoric for political ends.  
</p>
<p>279. Those seized included Broderick Takawira, Pascal Gonzo and Jestina Mukoko, the director 
of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) and a well-known human rights campaigner, whose case 
was considered by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.<b>485 </b>From 
January to September 2008, ZPP catalogued 20,143 crimes committed by those working for the 
Government, including 202 murders, 463 abductions, 41 rapes, 411 cases of torture and 3,942 
assaults.<b>486 </b>Ms. Mukoko was taken from her home by armed men at daybreak on 3 December 
2008, and later testified that she was held in secret locations, where she was tortured in an 
attempt to extract a false confession. She said that her captors made her kneel on gravel and 
repeatedly beat her on the soles of her feet with rubber truncheons during interrogations.<b>487 </b> 
</p>
<p>280. Other people seized included Chris Dhlamini, an aide to the leader of the opposition and 
Prime Minister in waiting, Morgan Tsvangirai, who was seized from his home on 
25 November 2008. Mr. Dhlamini stated that he was detained in Goromonzi Prison Complex 
until 22 December 2008, but was moved, at various times, to undisclosed locations, where he 
was &#8220;subjected to extreme forms of torture to extract false information and confessions&#8221;. He 
recalled being &#8220;suspended from a considerable height&#8221; and beaten all over his body with what 
felt like a tin full of stones. Describing another incident, he explained, &#8220;I was lifted up and my 
head was submerged in the sink and held there for long periods by someone, in a mock 
drowning, which is another severe form of torture (waterboarding) to which I was subjected 
during my unlawful abduction and detention. This mock drowning went on an on, until I felt that 
I was on the verge of dying.&#8221;<b>488</b>

around 23 December 2008, after being handed over by the men who abducted them, who were 
reportedly members of the security forces. They were then held in police detention, and were 
charged in May 2009. Jestina Mukoko and eight others were cleared of the terrorism charges 
against them by the Zimbabwean Supreme Court on 28 September 2009. In a blow to 
Ms. Mukoko&#8217;s abductors, the court ruled that &#8220;the State, through its agents, violated the 
applicant&#8217;s constitutional rights protected under the constitution of Zimbabwe to an extent 
entitling the applicant to a permanent stay of criminal prosecution associated with the above 
violations&#8221;.<b>489</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>282. <b>International law clearly prohibits secret detention, which violates a number of 
human rights and humanitarian law norms that may not be derogated from under any 
circumstances. If secret detention constitutes enforced disappearances and is widely or 
systematically practiced, it may even amount to a crime against humanity. However, in 
spite of these unequivocal norms, secret detention continues to be used in the name of 
countering terrorism around the world. The evidence gathered by the four experts for the 
present study clearly shows that many States, referring to concerns relating to national 
security - often perceived or presented as unprecedented emergencies or threats - resort to 
secret detention.  
</b></p>
<p>283. <b>Resorting to secret detention effectively means taking detainees outside the legal 
framework and rendering the safeguards contained in international instruments, most 
importantly <i>habeas corpus</i>, meaningless. The most disturbing consequence of secret 
detention is, as many of the experts&#8217; interlocutors pointed out, the complete arbitrariness of 
the situation, together with the uncertainty about the duration of the secret detention and 
the feeling that there is no way the individual can regain control of his or her life.  
</b></p>
<p>284. <b>A comparison of past and more recent practices of secret detention brings to the fore 
many common features, despite considerable variations in political and social contexts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Emergency contexts 
</b></p>
<p>285. <b>States of emergency, international wars and the fight against terrorism - often framed 
in vaguely defined legal provisions - constitute an &#8220;enabling environment&#8221; for secret 
detention. As in the past, extraordinary powers are today conferred on authorities, 
including armed forces, law enforcement bodies and/or intelligence agencies, under states 
of emergency or global war paradigms either without or with very restricted control 
mechanisms by parliaments or judicial bodies. This thus renders many, or even all, of the 
safeguards contained in criminal law and required by international human rights law

<b>ineffective. In some States, protracted states of emergency and broadly defined conflicts 
against vaguely conceived enemies have tended to turn exceptional, temporary rules into 
the norm.  
</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Intelligence agencies 
</b></p>
<p>286. <b>In many contexts, intelligence agencies operate in a legal vacuum with no law, or no 
publicly available law, governing their actions. Although intelligence bodies are not 
authorized by legislation to detain persons, they do so many times, sometimes for 
prolonged periods. In such situations, there are either no oversight and accountability 
mechanisms at all, or they are severely restricted, with limited powers, and hence 
ineffective.  
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  International cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>287. <b>From operation Condor in South America through to the global CIA network, secret 
detention has relied on systems of trans-border (regional or global) cooperation. This 
means that, in many instances, foreign security forces may operate freely in the territory of 
other States. It also leads to the mutual exchange of intelligence information between 
States, followed by its use for the purpose of detaining or trying the person before 
tribunals, the proceedings of which do not comply with international norms, often with 
reference to State secrets, making it impossible to verify how the information was 
obtained.</b>490<b> A crucial element in international cooperation, be it in the methods of 
operation Condor of the 1970s or the current policies of &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221;, is the 
transfer of alleged terrorists to other countries, where they may face a substantial risk of 
being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in 
contravention of the principle of non-refoulement. Worse, in some cases, persons have been 
rendered to other countries precisely to circumvent the prohibition of torture and &#8220;rough&#8221; 
treatment. Practices such as &#8220;hosting&#8221; secret detention sites or providing proxy detention 
have, however, been supplemented by numerous other facets of complicity, including 
authorizing the landing of airplanes for refuelling, short-term deprivation of liberty before 
handing over the &#8220;suspect&#8221;, the covering up of kidnappings, and so on. With very few 
exceptions, too little has been done to investigate allegations of complicity.  
</b></p>
<p>288. <b>While the experts welcome the cooperation extended by a number of States, including 
through the responses submitted by 44 of them to the questionnaire, they express their 
regret that, although States have the obligation to investigate secret detention, many did 
not send responses, and a majority of those received did not contain sufficient information. 
A lack of access to States&#8217; territories also meant that a number of interviews had to be 
conducted by telephone or Skype, with those interviewed fearing being monitored.

</p>
<p><b>4.  Torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment  
</b></p>
<p>289. <b>Secret detention as such may constitute torture or ill-treatment for the direct victims 
as well as for their families. As many of the interviews and cases included in the present 
study illustrate, however, the very purpose of secret detention is to facilitate and, 
ultimately, cover up torture and inhuman and degrading treatment used either to obtain 
information or to silence people. While in some cases elaborate rules have been put in place 
to authorize &#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques that violate international standards of human rights 
and humanitarian law, most of the time secret detention has been used as a kind of defence 
shield to avoid scrutiny and control, as well as to make it impossible to learn about 
treatment and conditions during detention.  
</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Impact on other human rights and freedoms  
</b></p>
<p>290. <b>The generalized fear of secret detention and its corollaries, such as torture and 
ill-treatment, tends to effectively result in limiting the exercise of a large number of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of 
association. This fear often goes hand in hand with the intimidation of witnesses, victims 
and their families. Moreover, independent judiciaries and secret detention can hardly 
coexist; several examples identified by the experts indicated that the broader use of secret 
detention tends to lead to attempts to either influence or, worse, silence judges who take up 
cases of secret detention.  
</b></p>
<p><b>6.  Witness protection and reparation  
</b></p>
<p>291. <b>The experts are extremely concerned that many victims of secret detention from 
countries around the world indicated that they feared reprisals personally or against their 
families if they cooperated with the study and/or allowed their names to be used. The 
injustice done by secretly detaining somebody is prolonged and replicated all too 
frequently once the victims are released, because the State concerned may try to avoid any 
disclosure about the fact that secret detention is practiced on its territory. In almost no 
recent cases has there been any judicial investigation into allegations of secret detention, 
and practically no one has been brought to justice. Although many victims feel that secret 
detention has &#8220;stolen&#8221; years of their lives (the experts learned about one anonymous case of 
30 years) and left an indelible mark, often in terms of loss of their jobs and frequently their 
health, they have almost never received any rehabilitation or compensation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>292. <b>On the basis of the above conclusions, the experts put forward the recommendations 
set out below. In practice, concrete measures will need to be taken, depending on the 
specific context: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Secret detention should be explicitly prohibited, along with all other forms of 
unofficial detention. Detention records should be kept, including in times of armed conflict 
as required by the Geneva Conventions, including with regard to the number of detainees, 
their nationality and the legal basis on which they are being held, whether as prisoners of 
war or civilian internees. Internal inspections and independent mechanisms should have </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/42* 
page 132 
 
<b>timely access to all places where persons are deprived of their liberty for monitoring 
purposes at all times. In times of armed conflict, the location of all detention facilities 
should be disclosed to the International Committee of the Red Cross; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Safeguards for persons deprived of their liberty should be fully respected. No 
undue restrictions on these safeguards under counter-terrorism or emergency legislation 
are permissible. In particular, effective <i>habeas corpus</i> reviews by independent judicial 
bodies are central to ensuring respect for the right to personal liberty. Therefore, domestic 
legislative frameworks should not allow for any exceptions from <i>habeas corpus</i>, operating 
independently from the detaining authority and from the place and form of deprivation of 
liberty. The study has shown that judicial bodies play a crucial role in protecting people 
against secret detention. The law should foresee penalties for officials who refuse to disclose 
relevant information during <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) All steps necessary to ensure that the immediate families of those detained are 
informed of their relatives&#8217; capture, location, legal status and condition of health should be 
taken in a timely manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Any action by intelligence services should be governed by law, which in turn 
should be in conformity with international norms. To ensure accountability in intelligence 
cooperation, truly independent intelligence review and oversight mechanisms should be 
established and enhanced. Such mechanisms should have access to any information, 
including sensitive information. They should be mandated to undertake reviews and 
investigate upon their initiative, and to make reports public:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Institutions strictly independent of those that have been allegedly involved in 
secret detention should investigate promptly any allegations of secret detention and 
&#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221;. Those individuals who are found to have participated in 
secretly detaining persons and any unlawful acts perpetrated during such detention, 
including their superiors if they ordered, encouraged or consented to secret detentions, 
should be prosecuted without delay and, where found guilty, given sentences 
commensurate with the gravity of the acts perpetrated;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The status of all pending investigations into allegations of ill-treatment and 
torture of detainees and detainee deaths in custody must be made public. No evidence or 
information that has been obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
may be used in any proceedings;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Transfers or the facilitation of transfers from one State to the custody of 
authorities of another State must be carried out under judicial supervision and in line with 
international standards. The principle of non-refoulement of persons to countries where 
they would be at risk of torture or other inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment must be 
honoured;  </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/13/42* 
  page 133 
 
</p>
<p><b>(h) Victims of secret detention should be provided with judicial remedies and 
reparation in accordance with relevant international norms.</b>491 <b>These international 
standards recognize the right of victims to adequate, effective and prompt reparation, 
which should be proportionate to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered. As 
families of disappeared persons have been recognized as victims under international law, 
they should also benefit from rehabilitation and compensation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should ratify and implement the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Given that the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture requires the setting-up of monitoring systems covering all situations of 
deprivation of liberty, adhering to this international instrument adds a layer of protection. 
States should ratify the Optional Protocol and create independent national preventive 
mechanisms that are in compliance with the Paris Principles (Principles relating to the 
status of national institutions), and ratify the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Other regional systems may wish to replicate 
the system put in place by the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of 
Persons;</b>492<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Governments have an obligation to protect their citizens abroad and provide 
consular protection to ensure that foreign States comply with their obligations under 
international law, including international human rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Under international human rights law, States have the obligation to provide 
witness protection. Doing so is indeed a precondition for effectively combating secret 
detention.

</p>
<p>2.  Algeria &#8226; No instances of secret detention or facilities for secret 
detention as a means to counter terrorism. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Places of custody exist within the levels of the national 
security service, the police service and the Department of 
Intelligence and Security. The sites are controlled by 
personnel who hold the rank of an officer within the criminal 
investigation department, and who will be subject to legal 
responsibility for disciplinary and penal sanctions, in the 
event they act outside of, or in violation of, legal procedures.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; All sites of police custody are placed under the control of the 
public prosecutor (civil or military) which carries out regular 
and unannounced inspections.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The penitentiaries are placed under the authority of relevant 
personnel of the Ministry of Justice, who will be held 
personally liable at a disciplinary and penal level in the event 
of violation of the governing rules of detention applicable to 
both accused and convicted detainees. Such establishments 
are controlled by magistrates and the heads of the 
administration of penitentiaries.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Noted that, pursuant to an accord signed with the Ministry of 
Justice, the ICRC has visited penitentiaries since 1999; and 
since 2003 has been allowed unannounced visits to places of 
police custody. Also, the penitentiary establishments are 
accessible to civil society; regular visits are carried out by the 
national commission for promotion of human rights, by 
NGOs, UNDP and UNICEF.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There are various codes which comprise a legal framework 
for sites of police custody and penitentiaries, and the Penal 
Code provides for sanctions for persons who violate the laws, </p>

<p>such as illegal or arbitrary detention or ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No involvement or collaboration in secret detention on the 
territory of another State. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Secret detention is not used by the police services of Algeria. 
The law precludes such practice. The methods for dealing 
with terrorism are within a strict legal framework, with 
investigations to be carried out within allowed time limits, 
and with magistrates being informed. In an emergency 
situation in the context of counter-terrorism which threatens 
the public order, a presidential decree may be made of a State 
of Emergency, notified to the UN, authorizing the Minister of 
Interior to take measures of house arrest as administrative 
internment. It is in this context, controlled by presidential 
decree, that such rare and exceptional measures may be taken. 
This is believed to be an effective measure in the efforts 
against terrorism.  
</p>
<p>3.  Armenia &#8226; No instances of secret detention in the penitentiary system

</p>
<p>&#8226; Recalled the position it took as Presidency of the Council of 
the European Union from the beginning of 2006 in 
emphasizing the absolute necessity for adhering to all existing 
standards of human rights law and international humanitarian 
law in the context of the fight against terrorism.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 21November, 2005, the Secretary General of the Council 
of Europe initiated an inquiry directed at all CoE member 
States where member States were asked how their internal 
law ensured the effective implementation of the ECHR on 
four issues relevant to secret detention in countering 
terrorism. Austria furnished a comprehensive answer to this 
inquiry in February, 2006. </p>

<b> Country Response  
</b></p>
<p>5.  Bahrain &#8226; No instances of secret detention under Bahraini law to 
counter terrorism. The criminal procedure code, in 
accordance with the Constitution, sets out requirements which 
preclude the lawfulness of secret detention. Anti-terrorism 
legislation regulates procedures for the investigation and 
arrest of persons accused or suspected of involvement in 
terrorism. Further, Bahraini law guarantees the rights of 
persons who are arrested or remanded in custody, including 
the right to communicate with family members and lawyers 
prior to detention.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No involvement or collaboration in secret detention on the 
territory of another State. Noted that Bahrain has signed 
numerous international counter-terrorism agreements and 
extradition agreements, which involve procedures which are 
applied in conformity with the Constitution and domestic law. 
Bahrain has signed extradition treaties with Egypt and ratified 
an agreement between the States of Gulf Cooperation Council 
concerning the transfer of persons sentenced to deprivation of 
liberty.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Any alternatives to secret detention must be consistent with 
the UN conventions which have been ratified by Bahrain.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No history of secret detention practices. However, Bahrain 
has fully co-operated with respect to counter-terrorism 
efforts, including having signed numerous international 
covenants on counter-terrorism. Co-operation must be carried 
out within the framework of international conventions.  
</p>
<p>6.  Bangladesh &#8226; No instances of secret detention in the penitentiary system as 
a means to counter terrorism. Constitutional law and the 
criminal procedure set out requirements which preclude 
lawfulness of secret detention.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No involvement or collaboration in secret detention on the 
territory of another State. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Suggests surveillance and advance intelligence as an 
alternative to secret detention as a means of countering 
terrorism.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No comment on past experiences with secret detention, as it is 
unlawful in Bangladesh.

</p>
<p>&#8226; Secret detention is not an effective means of countering

</p><p>11.  Chad &#8226; The Constitution of Chad guarantees the protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the protection of life and liberty, and against 
torture and degrading treatment. Referred to Chad&#8217;s 
ratification of various international instruments relating to 
counter-terrorism. The Chad Penal Code also punishes 
terrorist acts.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No instances of secret detention, nor do secret detention

Detention per se is clearly regulated within Croatian 
legislative framework, including the sanctions for any 
possible misuse and/or illegal detention  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No further comments or on past experiences with secret 
detention. Serious infringements of human rights, as well as a 
one dimensional approach to countering terrorism in past 
years, have only helped terrorist propaganda. Therefore, 
Croatia stresses the need for counterterrorism compliance 
with international law.

counter terrorism. Finland has consistently emphasized the 
need to respect human rights while countering terrorism.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A reference has once been made to the landing of a cargo 
aircraft on 16 May 2003. Permission had been granted 
because it had been designated by the US declaration as an 
aircraft used for the carriage of cargo.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Finnish legislation contains provisions which control acts of 
foreign agencies, and affords safeguards against 
unacknowledged deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Sentences Enforcement Decree prohibits detention in a 
penal institution without a written order, and the identity of 
the prisoners is always verified; this applies to both Finnish 
nationals and foreigners.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No person suspected of involvement in terrorism have been 
placed in Finnish prisons or transported on the order of the 
Prison Service in Finland; nor is there any information that 
any official or person acting officially has been involved in 
the unacknowledged deprivation of liberty or the transport of 
persons so deprived.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No instances of experiences where secret detentions have 
been an effective or acceptable measure in countering

reported that the German Federal Ministry of Justice became 
aware of this case on 26 February 2002, when the Chief 
Federal Prosecutor informed the Ministry that it would not 
take over a preliminary investigation pending before the 
Prosecution of the Land of Bremen. Germany also indicated 
that the Office of the Chief Federal Prosecutor had received a 
report from the Federal Criminal Police Office on 31 January 
2002, that, according to information by the Federal 
Intelligence Service, Mr. Murat Kurnaz had been arrested by 
United States officials in Afghanistan or Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Germany also referred to the case of Mr. Khaled El-Masri. It 
reported that, on 8 June 2004, the Federal Chancellery and the 
Federal Foreign Office received a letter from his lawyer 
indicating that Mr. El-Masri had been abducted in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 31 December 2003, 
presumably transferred to Afghanistan and kept there against 
his will until his return to Germany on 29 May 2004. It also

<p>19.  Italy &#8226; Italy&#8217;s legal system is designed to ensure the effective 
framework of guarantees protective of human rights; after 
9/11 Italy adopted urgent measures to combat terrorism, 
updating anti-terrorist legislation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Italy referred to the case of Hassam Osama Mustafa Nasr 
(Abu Omar) with regard to whom a judicial investigation had 
been initiated, involving the committal of 26 people for trial 
who had served at the Italian Intelligence and Military 
Service. The trial is ongoing. Under Act No. 124, the Services 
were suppressed, while their tasks were placed under the 
responsibly of the President of the Council of Ministers, as 
the National Authority for the Security. It is envisaged that a 
legal excuse available to personnel would be that the 
activities are considered critical for pursuing institutional 
objectives. State secrecy has also be redefined by limiting its 
application, particularly to be in line with certain values 
(integrity; protection of constitutional institutions; protection 
of the independence of the state; protection of the military 
defense). The Criminal Procedure Code has also been 
reformulated to provide for a privilege for civil servants to 
plead state secrets to avoid having to testify in relevant cases. 
However, there is scope for the Judicial Authority to apply to 
the Constitutional Court to examine documents covered by 
state secrecy.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Secret detention is not considered to be an effective tool to 
counter terrorism.

detention in the penitentiary system as a means to counter 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under the laws in force, suspects are detained pursuant to a 
warrant issued by the competent judicial authorities, which 
oversee all stages of investigations. No suspects have been 
held in &#8220;incommunicado&#8221; detention.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; No one, acting in cooperation with any foreign ally, has 
participated in, or facilitated the incommunicado detention in 
Lebanon of any person suspected of engaging in terrorist 
activities.  
</p>

international levels.

<p>23.  Liechtenstein &#8226; No instances of, or involvement in, secret detention as a 
means to counter terrorism, either actively or passively. 
Unlawful detention is a crime which is prosecuted, and if a 
suspicion of unlawful secret detention by a domestic or 
foreign authority or service in Liechtenstein were to have 
arisen, the Office of the Public Prosecutor would be required 
to immediately initiate a judicial investigation into an offense 
of deprivation of liberty, as there no lawful exception which 
is applicable to the secret services which would otherwise 
limit the Prosecutor&#8217;s obligation to prosecute.

</p>
<p>&#8226; Promotion and protection of human rights constitutes one of 
the priority areas in Liechtenstein&#8217;s foreign policy, and it

</p>
<p>&#8226; The Constitution guarantees the protection of the right to 
liberty, entitling all persons who have been detained with the 
right to inform his/her relatives/friend and the right to a visit. 
As to measures to combat terrorism - the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act 2002 does not provide for &#8220;secret detention&#8221; 
but does allow for &#8220;incommunicado detention&#8221; for up to 36 
hours with access only to a Police Officer of a certain rank.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is believed that as a counter-terrorism measure, the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002 falls within the 
International Human Rights framework.  
</p>
<p>25.  Mexico &#8226; No instances of secret detention in the penitentiary system. 
Even within the context of military detentions, there is a

about potential arrest or secret detention of those suspected of 
terrorism, nor about any such imprisonment and/or arrest 
resulting in death or violence.

<p>&#8226; No facilitation of secret detention.  
&#8226; As to counter-terrorism measures, a number of laws have 
</p>
<p>been passed which sanction the criminal act of terrorism and 
provide for identification of such perpetrators and establish 
institutional bodies responsible for detection, investigation 
and decision making in cases of suspected terrorist acts.

and the European Convention.  
</p>
<p>28.  Paraguay &#8226; No information on any instances of secret detention. All 
arrests should be carried out within the legal framework.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Paraguay does not have any specific anti-terrorism laws, so 
that all crimes are dealt with in accordance with the Penal 
code. There is a draft law currently being considered in 
relation to anti-terrorism measures.

<p>&#8226; No, secret detention is not an effective measure in countering 
terrorism. There has been no case in which such secret 
detention has been effective. Peru emphasizes its compliance 
with all international obligations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is legislation allowing police to arrest persons who are 
caught in the act of committing a crime. They are informed of 
the reason for the arrest, presumed innocent, have a right to 
physical integrity, and right to lawyer and doctor, and to 
communicate with family and friends. There are also 
requirements which arise in cases where police carry out an 
arrest pursuant to an arrest warrant: to inform the person of 
the reasons for the arrest; to inform the magistrate, the reason 
of detention and which authority had ordered the arrest; report 
the arrest to the magistrate who needs to put the detainee 
before the judge who issued the arrest warrant; and to inform 
the detainee of their rights.  
</p>
<p>30.  Philippines &#8226; Facilities and practices of secret detention; such practices 
contravene the Constitution which expressly prohibits secret, 
solitary and incommunicado detention and torture, and are not 
used. Specific laws provide penalties for those who violate 
requirements in relation to the arrest, interrogation and 
detention of those suspected of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>31.  Poland &#8226; On 11 March 2008, the district Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has 
instituted proceedings on the alleged existence of secret CIA 
prisons in Poland. This was referred to the Appellate 
Prosecutor Office on 1 April 2009. The prosecutors are 
gathering evidence which is considered secret or classified.

<p>&#8226; Singapore&#8217;s approach to detection and rehabilitation of 
terrorists, used effectively, with two-thirds of terrorists

</p>
<p>&#8226; A legislative framework defining the mandate and powers of 
the intelligence agencies, ensuring accountability.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the Internal Security Act provides for powers of preventative

&#8226; The Government is not aware of any cases of individuals 
</p>
<p>having been secretly detained in facilities on UK territory. In 
February 2008, the US informed the UK government 
(contrary to previous assurances otherwise) that it had used 
the UK Overseas Territory of Diego Garcia to refuel rendition 
flights. The US has given assurances that there have been no 
other such incidents since September 2001, and have assured 
the UK that there would be no rendition through UK territory 
without express permission, which would only be granted if 
satisfied that it would accord with UK law and international 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Intelligence and Security Committee is charged with 
oversight of the policy of the intelligence and security 
agencies. It has produced reports on the ways in which the 
agencies seek to ensure that they do not contribute to the 
detention of individuals outside of a legal framework. In one </p>

<b> Country Response  
</b></p>
<p>of the reports, the agencies refer to the fact that the US is 
clearly holding some Al-Qaida members indention, but the 
details and location have not been disclosed to the UK, 
although the intelligence gathered from interrogation of such 
detainees has been used by the UK agencies.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; By mid-2003 suspicions arose regarding the operation of 
black sites, so the UK agencies sought Ministerial approval 
and assurances from foreign liaison agencies if there was a 
risk of rendition operations arising from their operations. 
After April 2004 (Abu Ghraib revelations), in view of the 
known risk of mistreatment in operations which may result in 
US custody of detainees, the UK agencies sought assurances 
of humane treatment in any operation which may involve 
rendition/US custody.

</p>
<p>&#8226; The Obama Administration has adopted the following 
specific measures: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Instructed the CIA to close as expeditiously as possible any 
detention facilities that it currently operated as of 22 January 
2009 and ordered that the CIA shall not operate any such 
detention facility in the future.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed 
as soon as practicable. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Required the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) to be given notice and timely access to any individual 
detained in any armed conflict in the custody or under the 
effective control of the United States Government, consistent 
with Department of Defense regulations and policies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered a comprehensive review of the lawful options 
available to the Federal Government with respect to detention 
of individuals captured or apprehended in connection with 
armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reaffirmed that all persons in U.S. custody must be treated 
humanely as a matter of law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mandated that detention at Guantanamo conform to all 
applicable laws governing conditions of confinement, </p>

<p>including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, and 
directed a review of detention conditions at Guantanamo to 
ensure such compliance. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ordered a review of United States transfer policies to ensure 
that they do not result in the transfer of individuals to other 
nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with 
the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments 
or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane 
treatment of individuals in its custody or control. The 
resulting Task Force on transfer practices recommended to 
the President in August that (1) the State Department be 
involved in evaluating all diplomatic assurances; (2) the 
Inspectors General of the Departments of State, Defense, and 
Homeland Security prepare an annual report on all transfers 
relying on assurances; and (3) mechanisms for monitoring 
treatment in the receiving country be incorporated into 
assurances. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Announced the transfer of at least seven detainees from 
military custody to U.S. criminal law enforcement 
proceedings, and transferred 25 detainees to date to third 
countries for repatriation or resettlement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Worked with Congress to revise U.S. laws governing military 
commissions to enhance their procedural protections, 
including prohibiting introduction of evidence obtained as a 
result of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Expanded the review procedures for detainees held by the 
Department of Defense in Afghanistan in order to enhance the 
transparency and fairness of U.S. detention practices. 
Detainees are permitted an opportunity to challenge the 
evidence that is the basis for their detention, to call 
reasonably available witnesses, and to have the assistance of 
personal representatives who have access to all reasonably 
available relevant information (including classified 
information). Proceedings generally shall be open, including 
to representatives of the ICRC, and possibly to 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Established more tailored standards and rigorous procedures 
for evaluating assertions of the State secrets privilege, 
including establishing an internal accountability mechanism, 
ensuring that the privilege is never asserted to avoid 
embarrassment or conceal violations of law, and creating a </p>

<p>referral mechanism to the Office of Inspector General where 
the privilege is asserted but there is credible evidence of a 
violation of law. These standards and procedures were 
established in order to strike a better balance between open 
government and the need to protect vital national security 
information. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Department of Justice initiated a preliminary criminal 
investigation into the interrogation of certain detainees. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government indicated that these measures cumulatively 
seek to reaffirm the importance of compliance with the rule of 
law in U.S. detention practices, to ensure U.S. adherence to 
its international legal obligations, and to promote 
accountability and transparency in this important area of 
national security policy.&#8221; The Government also noted that 
some of the specific information requested in the 
questionnaire implicates national security issues and that, 
although considerable amounts of information have been 
declassified, certain information will not be released for valid 
security reasons, subject to extensive oversight to ensure 
compliance with the law.

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p>In August 2009, the experts corresponded with 19 countries across all geographic regions 
of the world with a request to conduct an official visit to the countries concerned in order to 
conduct private interviews with persons believed to have been formerly held in secret detention. 
As one of the essential objectives of the joint study is to better understand - and ultimately 
redress - the plight of the victims, the experts wanted to engage directly with relevant sources. 
The experts wish to thank the Government of Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland for extending an invitation to visit. Visits to these two States were 
undertaken between September and November 2009 for the purpose of conducting interviews. 
The experts were unfortunately unable to visit other States due to the fact that invitations were 
either not extended or they were advised that a visit for such a purpose could not be arranged by 
the concerned State. In an effort to get direct information from persons who reportedly had been 
secretly detained, the experts did conduct a number of interviews by telephone and/or 
interviewed legal counsel or family members as some of these persons are still in detention or 
hospitalized and unable to communicate directly. In total, the experts conducted 30 interviews 
with individuals from various nationalities and regions around the world. This Annex contains 
24 case summaries of interviews conducted. Six interviews were excluded as they were 
determined either not to be within the scope of this study or the information provided was not 
sufficiently detailed and precise to be included.

<b>Conditions and treatment  
</b>Upon his arrest in Mogadishu, he was beaten by four men, resulting in broken fingers and 
teeth. Afterwards, he was forcibly taken to a hospital, then blindfolded and taken to the airport, 
where he was flown to Nairobi.  
In Nairobi, he was held in a room with no bed and tiny windows. He was interrogated by the 
police and taken to the hospital. There, he was visited by officers who identified themselves as 
belonging to the FBI. After eight days in Nairobi, he was taken to an airport with the same 
CIA agents who had taken him from Mogadishu. They tied his hands and legs, blindfolded 
him, and beat him on his ears. He was flown to Bosaso, Somalia, where he was taken to a 
boarding house and forced to sit on the floor, surrounded by four armed soldiers. 
The following day, he was flown to Djibouti. On the flight, he was blindfolded, his feet were 
shackled and he was chained to the floor of the plane. He was not allowed to sleep, and he was 
hit on his ears every time he started to sleep. He was kept in a building at the airport. Some 
people held them while another man cut his clothes off and raped him. Afterwards, he was put 
in a diaper, hooded, cuffed, shackled and put on another plane to Kabul, Afghanistan. Upon 
landing, he was taken to the Prison of Darkness. At the prison, he heard strange voices in 
several languages, including Kiswahili and Somali, saying things such as &#8220;there is no God, no 
God, no God.&#8221; He was taken to an interrogation room, where his entire body was shaved by 
the interrogators in an aggressive and humiliating manner. He was kept in a stress position, 
chained to a wall, in a tiny, dark room in solitary confinement. Freezing water was poured on 
him; he was often forcibly naked, beaten and raped with foreign objects. He was kept in 
solitary confinement for two months, in complete darkness and with very loud music playing 
constantly. The interrogators would hang him from the ceiling in the &#8220;strapado&#8221; position, so 
that only his toes touched the floor. The guards were Afghans. He was fed only every two 
days, and was given pills on a regular basis. He was approached by some people carrying 
ICRC badges who asked for his personal information, including his mother&#8217;s address, but he 
refused to give them the information since he believed they were CIA agents. 
Around September 2004, he was taken to the &#8220;Salt pit&#8221;, an underground prison run by the FBI. 
There was constant light, and the Afghan guards would sometimes urinate on the detainees&#8217; 
food. He had no contact with his family, and he was visited several times by two FBI agents. 
After 14 months, FBI officers came to the prison, took his photograph, shackled him with 
fiberglass cuffs and blindfolded him. He was taken by helicopter and upon arrival in Bagram, 
he was chained and handcuffed, and his eyes were covered with glasses. He was also made to 
stand in a box and the rules were extremely strict. After bathing in the open, he was 
blindfolded and taken to an interrogation room. The interrogators were US officials. After he 
refused to answer their answers, he was slapped by one of the interrogators and dragged down 
the staircase to a wooden cage, where he was forced to stay for approximately one week. He 
was then transferred to another cage, where his blindfold was finally removed. He was first 
able to see other detainees, but the cages were later sealed so that the detainees could not see 
any other people. He was constantly harassed by the soldiers guarding the prison and bright 
lights were constantly kept on. The common practice was for the guards to use teargas on all 
detainees if one of them caused a problem. Mr. Abdallah suffered from acute headaches but 
was not taken to see a psychiatrist, like other detainees. During his detention in Bagram, he did 
not have contact with his family. Women and children, as young as twelve were also detained 
there. 
In November 2008, he was flown to Dar es Salaam and held for interrogation overnight.

<b>Date of release 
</b>November 2008. 
<b>Additional information 
</b>After three years in detention, he sent a letter to his mother via the ICRC. Starting at the end of 
2006, he was visited by the ICRC three or four times. 
After his release, Mr. Abdallah has only been able to eat fruit, as solid food makes him vomit. 
He experiences pain in his back, jaw and teeth. He constantly feels dizzy and confused during 
the day and has nightmares at night.

<b>Conditions and treatment  
</b>In Banjul, he was first allowed to be free inside the safe houses. He was later placed in a 
wooden cage. 
On the flight to Afghanistan, he was blindfolded, hooded, handcuffed and his feet were 
shackled. At the &#8220;Dark Prison&#8221;, an old detention center, there was no light or heating. The 
guards all wore hoods and never spoke. On the first day, he was placed in a dark cell and the 
handcuffs and hood were eventually removed. He was kept in that cell, which measured 
approximately 5 x 9 feet for three weeks. It had a steel door, a bucket, an old piece of carpet 
and a rusty steel bar. He was kept in the cold and had to wear diapers. Loud music was played 
continuously. The only light he saw was the torches carried by the guards when they gave him 
food, which was on average less than once per day. He was kept incommunicado and was not 
interrogated during this time. 
On around 22 December, two American and two Afghan guards went into his cell, chained his 
hands behind his back and hooded him. He was taken away on a helicopter to Bagram, 
Afghanistan. He was held at an old factory, which was used as a secret detention facility. He 
spent the first three days and several weeks after in isolation. At Bagram, he was subjected to 
sleep deprivation for up to three days and threats. He was subjected to almost daily, long 
interrogations, and he was always handcuffed, hooded and shackled. 
He was transferred to Guantanamo Bay through a rendition flight on 7 February 2003. During 
the trip, which lasted 24 hours, he was handcuffed, had goggles covering his eyes and his feet </p>

<b>Conditions and treatment  
</b>From the USA to Jordan - He was put on a private plane and chained and shackled. He arrived 
in Jordan blindfolded and said he was repeatedly hit on the back of his head by Jordanian 
guards.  
In transit from Jordan to the Syrian Arab Republic - He was blindfolded and &#8220;bundled&#8221; into a 
van and driven fast over bad roads. From time-to-time he was struck by one of the guards.  
In Far Falestin detention centre, the Syrian Arab Republic - He was kept in a tiny cell, roughly 
seven feet high by six feet long by three feet wide. The cell contained only two thin blankets 
and a &#8220;humidity isolator&#8221; as well as two bottles, &#8220;one for water and one for urine&#8221;. There was 
an opening in the middle of the ceiling, roughly one foot by two feet. There was no light in the 
cell at all, except what filtered through from the opening in the ceiling. He recalled two or 
three times when cats urinated through that opening. The cell was damp and very cold in 
winter and stifling in summer. He was known to guards only by his cell number: two. The first 
and official recognition of his detention occurred about three weeks after his deportation to 
Syria (end of October 2002) with a consular visit by Canadian authorities. He received 
approximately half a dozen consular visits while in detention but was not allowed to receive 
visits from anyone other than consular officials.  
Treatment during interrogations at Far Falestin detention centre -  
On 8 October 2002, Mr. Arar was taken for questioning from around 8:00 pm to midnight. He 
was questioned by a man named &#8220;George&#8221;, who Mr. Arar later discovered was George 
Salloum, the head of interrogation at Far Falestin. There was no physical violence during this 
interrogation, but there were ominous threats. If he was slow to answer, &#8220;George&#8221; said that he 
would use &#8220;the chair&#8221; which Mr. Arar did not understand, but assumed to be a form of torture. 
On 9 October 2002, he was called up for interrogation which lasted roughly 10 hours. When 
&#8220;George&#8221; arrived, he immediately started hitting him. The chair on which Mr. Arar was sitting 
was taken away, so that he was now on the floor. Mr. Arar interpreted it as a form of 
humiliation - lowering the status of the detainee in respect of the interrogators. &#8220;George&#8221; 
brought with him into the room a black cable, which might have been a shredded electrical 
cable. It was about two feet long. It was probably made of rubber, but was not hollow. 
Mr. Arar says that as soon as he saw the cable he started to cry. George told Mr. Arar to open 
his right hand. George then raised the cable high and brought it down hard. He stood up and 
started jumping, but was forced back down and the process was repeated with his left hand. 
Again Mr. Arar jumped up. No question had yet been asked. From then on, Mr. Arar was 
forced to stand near the door, and the questions began. The constant theme was &#8220;you are a 
liar&#8221;. He was given breaks and put in another room where he could hear other people 
screaming. Sometimes he was blindfolded and left to stand in the hallway for an hour or more 
listening to the screams of women being beaten and the cries of the babies that some of the 
women had with them in the detention centre. When he was brought back into the 
interrogation room, he would be beaten about the upper body and asked more questions. 
Mostly, he was asked about his relations with various people. On 11 October 2002, this was 
the most intensive interrogation as he was questioned for sixteen to eighteen hours, with great 
physical and psychological abuse. Mr. Arar was beaten with the black cable on numerous 
occasions<b> </b>throughout the day, and threatened with electric shocks, &#8220;the chair&#8221; and &#8220;the tire&#8221;. 
The pattern was for Mr. Arar to receive three or four lashes with the cable, then to be 
questioned, and then for the beating to begin again. After a while, he became so weak that he 
was disoriented. Mr. Arar remembers wetting himself twice during this questioning. He had to 
wear the same clothes for the next two and a half months. He was humiliated. After these three </p>

days of beatings the interrogation became less intense physically. There was much less use of 
the cables, and more punching and hitting. By the 16 or 17 October, the beatings diminished 
but the threats intensified, so that the psychological pressure was extreme. The &#8220;chair&#8221; was 
also invoked to scare him. At the end of each interrogation session an interrogator would say 
&#8220;tomorrow will be tough&#8221; or &#8220;tomorrow will be worse for you&#8221;. Mr. Arar found it almost 
impossible to sleep for more than two or three hours a night.  
Sednaya Prison - He said conditions were &#8220;like heaven&#8221; compared to those in Far Falestin.  
<b>Judicial proceedings 
</b>In the Syrian Arab Republic - on the day prior to his release, over a year after his initial 
detention, he was taken before a Supreme State Security Court. He was never tried or 
convicted of any offence. Canadian officials were not notified of this court date and no lawyer 
was present. He was not sure what took place this day, if it was an actual trial, no one ever 
advised him of the charges against him and he was not convicted of any offence.<b> 
</b>In Canada - On 28 January 2004, the Government of Canada announced that a Public 
Commission of Inquiry would be established to examine the actions of Canadian officials, 
including the detention and deportation of Mr. Arar in the countries concerned, namely in 
relation to the United States of America, Jordan and Syria. The Commissioner&#8217;s report was 
released on 18 September 2006.** The Commission found that the treatment and conditions of 
Mr. Arar in Far Falestin detention centre in Syria constituted torture as understood in 
international law. Upon the conclusion of the Inquiry Mr. Arar received an official apology 
from the Prime Minister of Canada and 10.5 millions dollars (Cdn) in compensation in 
addition to one million Cdn dollars to cover the costs of his legal fees. 
<b>Date of release 
</b>On 5 October 2003, Mr. Arar was released from custody after signing a &#8220;confession&#8221; given to 
him in court by a Syrian prosecutor. He returned to Canada on 6 October 2003.  
<b>Additional Information 
</b>Mr. Arar experiences serious psychological effects from his detention and torture in Syria. 
Since his release, Mr. Arar has a deep sense of isolation from the Muslim community. Since 
returning to Canada, he has had difficulty finding a job, despite having a degree in computer 
engineering and a Masters in telecommunications. This has had a devastating effect upon both 
his psychological state and economically. Mr. Arar&#8217;s relationships with members of his 
immediate family have been significantly impaired. He feels guilty about how he now relates 
to his own family. He often feels emotionally distant and preoccupied with his own concerns.<b>

to 4000 prisoners, many foreigners) of the Exterior Services for ten days.  
<b>Conditions and treatment  
</b>At the prison of the Interior Services he was interrogated while blindfolded on a weekly or 
fortnightly basis. During the last month at the Interior Services&#8217; prison, he was left in a cell 
without bathroom or water. He was beaten once when he tried to undertake a hunger strike. In 
the &#8220;Passports Prison&#8221; he experienced terrible sanitary conditions. He witnessed the torture of 
other detainees but was not interrogated nor tortured himself. 
<b>Judicial Proceedings 
</b>He was never formally charged with any offence. 
<b>Date of release 
</b>End of February 2008.  
<b>Additional Information 
</b>The Libyan authorities never acknowledged his detention nor provided any information about 
him. His family repeatedly contacted Swiss and Algerian Departments of Foreign Affairs to 
try and locate him. His family also sent letters to President Bouteflika of Algeria asking the 
Government to intervene. A representative of the Consulate of Algeria in Tripoli did visit the 
prison to clarify the number of Algerian nationals held in the prison and when this official 
learned of his detention he initiated steps which may have led to his subsequent release.

was guarded by officers in civilian clothes and monitored by video cameras. The 
interrogations took place in a separate area. 
While waiting for his interrogation, he was put in stress positions while short electroshocks 
were inflicted on his ribs and back. During the first two interrogations, an English 
speaking-interrogator asked questions relating to the United Kingdom, including his previous 
arrest and his personal life. He was held in this prison for five days, handcuffed and hooded. 
He could hear other people being tortured, but could not communicate with anyone. On the

Airbase) 
<b>Conditions and treatment during secret detention  
</b>- Jakarta, Indonesia: Detained one day at a police station. 
- Transfer to Cairo, Egypt, (with stopover for refueling at Diego Garcia Island): Mr. Madni 
was placed into an open coffin-shaped box covered with a plastic sheet, hooded, handcuffed, 
and bound with plastic and shackled so tightly that he could not move. During the stopover at 
Diego Garcia, he was unshackled, un-cuffed and allowed to urinate in a bottle, but never left 
the plane. Moreover, he was photographed by people who boarded the plane only for a short 
time. 
- Cairo, Egypt: Mr. Madni was detained at an Egyptian Intelligence office in an underground 
cell which was completely dark and smaller than a &#8220;grave&#8221;. Upon arrival at the building, he 
was examined by a doctor but not treated from the bleeding on his nose, ears, mouth and in his 
urine. During this period, he was interrogated three times, around 15 hours on each occasion, 
by Egyptian officers (there were also other men at the interrogations - allegedly American 
military officers - who did not speak and passed notes with questions to the Egyptians) about, 
<i>inter alia</i>, his links with Osama Bin Laden and terrorist attacks. Moreover, he was subjected to 
ill-treatment: he received electroshocks to his head and knees, he was given drinks with drugs, 
and he was denied medicine for the bleeding. On several occasions he was hung from metal 
hooks and beaten. Before being transferred, he was forced to sign a statement saying that he 
had not been subjected to torture. 
- Transfer to Bagram Airbase, Afghanistan (with stopover in another country, most probably 
Uzbekistan): his mouth was taped and he was shackled in a fetal position. During the flight, 
American soldiers applied electroshocks and beat him. 
- Bagram Airbase, Afghanistan: During this period, he was kept around six months in isolation 
and subjected to torture. At first he was hidden from the ICRC. However, after around one 
month, ICRC representatives came across him by chance and only then his family learned 
where he was being held.  
- Guantanamo Bay: During six months, he was subjected to a regime of sleep deprivation and 
frequently moved from one cell to another, which was called the &#8220;frequent flyer program.&#8221; He 
was interrogated several times by several people, including Americans, British and 
Indonesians. He was questioned about links with Al-Qaida and whether he knew of any plans 
for future terrorist acts. Mr. Madni was further told that, if he cooperated, he would be given 
medical assistance. 
<b>Judicial proceedings: 
</b>He was brought before the United States of America Combatant Status Review Tribunal. 
<b>Date of release 
</b>On 31 August 2008, he was taken to a plane where he remained shackled and not allowed to 
visit the bathroom. After several hours, the plane landed and he was transferred to another </p>

<b>Judicial proceedings 
</b>He was initially brought before a military tribunal which declared him an unlawful combatant. 
He had no access to counsel during this time. Formal charges were filed after July 2008. On 
22 January 2009, his case was transferred to a civilian court. He was tried before the High

monitored the trial and reported procedural irregularities that amounted to an unfair trial. 
Mr. Makhtal was unable to meet regularly with his lawyer and prohibited from meeting in 
private. He and his lawyer were not sufficiently advised about the charges as the case was 
partially disclosed at the last minute. His lawyer was not permitted to cross-examine 
prosecution&#8217;s witnesses or call any in his client&#8217;s defence. On 27 July 2009, Mr. Makhtal was

<p>He escaped from the last place of detention. 
<b>Conditions and treatment  
</b>Interrogation: During the initial stages of his secret detention he was repeatedly interrogated 
about his alleged affiliation with the NPA by military personnel, including senior officers (he 
has identified some of them by name in the domestic judicial proceedings, see below). He was 
tortured during his interrogations. 
Torture: He says he was regularly subjected to torture and other ill-treatment by his captors in 
several of the places of secret detention he was held at. He described that he was hit in all parts 
of his body. For instance, he was beaten in the buttocks and in the back with wood. He was 
beaten with metal chains and with a handgun butt, leaving him a still visible scar on his left 
eye brow. Water was poured into his nose to give him a sense of drowning. His back was 
burned with a searing hot metal can. His own urine was poured into his mouth and nose. He 
was doused with gasoline and threatened that he will be burnt alive. Both of his forearms were 
hammered with a metal hammer twice in one week, leaving him for a long time incapable of 
the menial work he was required to do for his captors. In Fort Magsaysay he received medical 
treatment for the injuries caused by torture. He cannot tell whether those treating him were 
military or civilian medics, as they did not introduce themselves and bore no name tags. The 
Supreme Court of the Philippines has found these torture allegations to be credible (see 
below). 
He also witnessed the torture of his brother Reynaldo, secretly detained together with him, and 
was told by a female co-detainee of the torture and rape she underwent at the hands of the 
soldiers. 
Food: During some parts of the secret detention, for instance in Fort Magsaysay, he was fed 
only at night, usually with left-over and rotten food.  
Forced work: He and other persons secretly detained with him were forced to carry out work 
for their military captors, such as raising live-stock, washing and cooking. 
<b>Judicial proceedings 
</b>No judicial proceedings were initiated by the authorities against him. During his secret 
detention, the parents of Raymond Manalo initiated <i>habeas corpus </i>proceedings before the 
Supreme Court of the Philippines. The AFP denied that Raymond Manalo was in their 
custody. In June 2006, AFP personnel took Raymond Manalo to his parents&#8217; home during one 
night to dissuade them from pursuing the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings. Before that meeting, a 
senior military commander, Maj.Gen. Jovito Palparan, told him that he and his brother 
Reynaldo would be kept alive if their family stopped taking part in the <i>habeas corpus</i> 
proceedings, stopped talking to human rights groups, particularly Karapatan, and stopped 
taking part in rallies. If the family failed to comply with these instructions, he and Reynaldo 
Manalo could be killed any time. 
In its decision of 7 October 2008 (see below), the Supreme Court of the Philippines states that 
&#8220; [a]part from the failure of the military elements to provide protection to respondents by </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/42* 
page 178 
 
themselves perpetrating the abduction, detention, and torture, they also miserably failed in 
conducting an effective investigation of the respondents&#8217; abduction&#8221; when a habeas corpus 
petition was filed on behalf of Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo. 
<b>Date of release 
</b>On 13 August 2007, Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo escaped from detention. Following their 
escape, they petitioned the judiciary seeking a writ of <i>amparo </i>ordering the AFP to desist from 
further attempts against their liberty and security, as well as ordering disclosure of certain 
information, such as the current whereabouts of some of the military officers involved in their 
abduction and detention and details of the drugs administered to them while in detention. The 
Court of Appeals accepted the facts as presented by petitioners, rejecting all the denials of the 
AFP, and granted the writ as requested. In its decision of 7 October 2008, the Supreme Court 
upheld the Court of Appeals decision against the challenge brought by the Government and the 
AFP. The Manalo case is the first case in which the writ of amparo, a remedy recently created 
by the Supreme Court of the Philippines to protect persons at risk of disappearance or 
extrajudicial execution, was granted.  
Raymond Manalo stated that he was not interested in monetary compensation, as money could 
not compensate him for what he had gone through. The reparation he seeks is that those most 
responsible for his suffering be prosecuted and punished. He specifically identified some of 
the military officers allegedly responsible, both at the command level and among those 
materially in charge of his capture and much of his detention. According to the information 
available, no investigation or prosecution of the military personnel identified by Raymond 
Manalo is taking place. 
<b>Additional information 
</b>With regard to the credibility of Raymond Manalo&#8217;s testimony, in its decision of 7 October 
2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines states: &#8220;After careful perusal of the evidence 
presented, we affirm the findings of the Court of Appeals that respondents [Raymond and 
Reynaldo Manalo] were abducted from their houses in Sito Muzon, Brgy. Buhol na Mangga, 
San Ildefonso, Bulacan on February 14, 2006 and were continuously detained until they 
escaped on August 13, 2007. The abduction, detention, torture, and escape of the respondents 
were narrated by respondent Raymond Manalo in a clear and convincing manner.&#8221; 
The Supreme Court specifically upheld the following factual findings of the Court of Appeals:  
&#8220;&#8230; the abduction was perpetrated by armed men who were sufficiently identified by 
[Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo] to be military personnel and CAFGU auxiliaries.&#8221; 
&#8220;&#8230; the reason for the abduction was the suspicion that [Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo] were 
either members or sympathizers of the NPA&#8221;. 
&#8220;Gen. Palparan&#8217;s participation in the abduction was also established.&#8221; 
Of great importance to the link between secret detention and other human rights violations, the 
Supreme Court stresses the threat to the life of Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo resulting from 
their secret detention: &#8220;It should be stressed that they are now free from captivity not because 
they were released by virtue of a lawful order or voluntarily freed by their abductors [but 
because they managed to escape]. It ought to be recalled that towards the end of their ordeal, 
sometime in June 2007 when respondents [Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo] were detained in 
a camp in Limay, Bataan, respondents&#8217; captors even told them that they were still deciding 
whether they should be executed. [&#8230;] The possibility of respondents being executed stared 
them in the eye while they were in detention.&#8221; The Supreme Court further stresses that other 
persons secretly detained together with the Manalo brothers remain disappeared.<b> </b></p>
