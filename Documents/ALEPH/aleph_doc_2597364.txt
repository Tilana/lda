ZENOSENSE, INC.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1.           Nature of operations
Zenosense, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on
August 11, 2008, for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. In May 2013,
the Company terminated its mineral development business.
On November 22, 2013, the Company filed a certificate of amendment with the State of Nevada
and (1) changed its name from “Braeden Valley Mines, Inc.” to “Zenosense, Inc.” and  (2) effected
an increase in the Company’s authorized shares from 50,000,000 to 500,000,000, with par value
of $0.001 per share.
Effective December 4, 2013, the Company entered into a development and exclusive license
agreement (“License Agreement”) whereby the Company will provide a third party with capital for
the development of the sensory   technology for a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus /
Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA/SA”) detection device and other improvements and variations to
the products (the “Sgenia Products”) to be used in the hospital and health care environments, in
exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting
products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis.
The License Agreement was modified in April 2014 and July 2014 to extend it to cancer sensory
products and to modify and extend the development schedule and change the research funding
budget to accommodate a lung cancer product as well as the MRSA/SA product.
On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of a
Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“MML SSA”) with a third party medical detection
device developer (“Partner”) utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd (“MML”), a UK
Limited company of which the Company owns a 40% interest awarded on July 1, 2016, in
exchange for its participation and funding to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively
during a Phase 2 development of the Partner’s MIDS universal immunoassay detection
technology platform  (“MIDS”). MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual
Property (“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the
event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party.
 
The MIDS technology will incorporate what we believe to be a novel microfluidic strip design,
magnetic nanoparticle manipulation and a unique double detection technique using bespoke
‘Hall Effect’ sensors and a bespoke optical sensor which, when combined, will increase
significantly the sensitivity and accuracy of the result.  
 
The MIDS technology platform has the potential to be adapted to a vast array of POC
immunoassay tests, taking them to a whole new level of accuracy, cost, ease of use and speed of
testing: A multi-capability POC device with laboratory gold standard accuracy for testing for
conditions such as Chlamydia, prostate, colorectal and other cancers, stroke tests, sports anti-
doping tests, Drugs of Abuse, insulin tests, H. Pylori, Inflammatory & Autoimmune disease,
Influenza, Legionella, Osteoporosis, Endocrine tests, Respiratory Virus, pneumonia, Blood
infections, Streptococcus, Meningitis, Rheumatism, Hepatitis, HIV, Viral tests, and many more.
 
2.           Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Zenosense, Inc. have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the
Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with
the SEC on May 20, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of
operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31,
2015, as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted.

ZENOSENSE, INC.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
3.           Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet
its obligations and continue its operations for 12 months.  Realization values may be
substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give
effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets
and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  At June 30, 2016,
the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had accumulated losses of $1,385,778
since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of
which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future
profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses as it executes its business plan and
does not expect to attain profitability in the near future. Since its inception, the Company has
funded operations through short-term borrowings, advances, and equity investments in order to
meet its strategic objectives. The Company's future operations are dependent upon external
funding and its ability to execute its business plan, realize sales and control
expenses.  Management believes that sufficient funding will be available from additional
borrowings and private placements to meet its business objectives including anticipated cash
needs for working capital, for the next fiscal year.  However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain sufficient funds to continue the development of its business
operation, or if obtained, upon terms favorable to the Company.
 
4.           Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform with
the current year presentation.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term,
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less. The Company has not
experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between their financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax
bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.
Loss per common share
Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock,
common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period.
 
Subsequent events
The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after June 30, 2016, up through
the date these financial statements were issued and no subsequent events occurred that
required disclosure in the accompanying financial statements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
 
The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a
material impact on its financial statements.

5.           Loans Payable
On November 2, 2015, four promissory notes previously owed to several third parties (the “Prior
Notes”) were assigned to a new party (the “Investor”) in one note for a total of $110,000 in
principal plus accrued interest of $3,647. The new note bears interest of 5% and is due on
demand.  At May 16, 2016, the Company had accrued interest of $5,744 in connection with the
promissory note.
On March 29, 2016, the Investor gave notice that it demanded repayment of all principal amounts
and accrued interest outstanding, due within 90 days of the demand notice.
On May 16, 2016 the Investor exchanged the Prior Notes and accrued interest in the amount of
$115,744 for new convertible notes.
6.           Convertible Debt
On April 20, 2016 the Investor agreed to a further loan of $40,000 and the Company issued a
convertible note in a principal amount of $40,000 (the “April 2016 Note”).  The April 2016 Note
bears a 5% interest per annum and is due on April 19, 2018.  The April 2016 Note may be
prepaid at any time within 90 days of the Issue Date.  Starting from September 20, 2016, the April
2016 Note can be convertible into shares of common stock (the “Conversion”) of the Company, at
the discretion of the holder, at a price of $0.007 per share subject to a blocker provision that limits
the amount issued at any time to 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The
Company has initially reserved 5,714,286 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
Conversion.
On May 17, 2016, the Investor agreed to exchange the Prior Notes (see note 5) for two new
convertible notes (the “May 2016 Notes”) under two separate Securities Exchange Agreements
which closed on May 17, 2016.  One note for the principal amount of $53,197 and the other for
the principal amount of $62,547 for a combined aggregate principal amount of $115,744.  The
May 2016 Notes bear a 5% interest per annum and are due on May 16, 2018. The May 2016
Notes may be prepaid at any time within 90 days of issuance. The May 2016 Notes can be
convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the discretion of the holder, at a price
of $0.007 per share subject to a blocker provision that limits the amount issued at any time to
4.99% percent of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The Company has initially reserved
16,534,857 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the Conversion.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had accrued interest of $1,087 in connection with the new notes.
The convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value
of $155,744 for the three notes. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the
market price of Zenosense’s common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of
$0.007. The discount is being amortized through interest expense using the straight line method
over the term of the notes. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company
recorded amortization of $1,087 on debt discount.
7.           Common Stock
On June 6, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with
an accredited investor (the “ Investor ”).  The transaction closed on June 8, 2016 (the “Closing”).
Under the terms of the SPA; the Investor purchased 9,589,512 shares of the Company’s common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock ”), for a purchase price of $150,000 and a
commitment by the Investor to provide unsecured convertible loans (the “ Commitment Loans ”) in
an aggregate amount of $640,000. The Commitment Loans will be made in four individual
amounts (individually the “Conversion Amount ” and collectively the “ Conversion Amounts ”). On
or before September 20, 2016, the Investor will lend the Company a Conversion Amount of
$180,000. On or before November 20, 2016, the Investor will lend the Company a Conversion
Amount of $170,000. On or before January 20, 2016, the Investor will lend the Company a
Conversion Amount of $170,000. On or before March 20, 2017, the Investor will lend the
Company a Conversion Amount of $120,000. The Commitment Loans shall bear an interest rate
of 10% per annum based on a 360 day year and are due 4 years from each respective issuance
date (the “Maturity Date”). The Company may, at any time prior to the Maturity Date, prepay any
unconverted amount of each respective Commitment Loan in full or in part. The Investor may, at
any time prior to the Maturity Date of each respective Commitment Loan, convert any or all of the
Conversion Amounts into Common Stock at the lower of either (a) $0.07 per share (subject to
adjustment), or (b) a 15% discount to the 10 day VWAP provided that any such conversion is not
at a price of less than $0.035 per share (subject to adjustment). In either scenario the total
number of shares of Common Stock issued on conversion may not cause the total beneficial
ownership by the Investor and its affiliates to exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock. On the Maturity Date of each respective Commitment Loan any outstanding
amount shall automatically and mandatorily convert into Common Stock at a price of $0.07 per
share (subject to adjustment).

8.           Commitments
In December 4, 2013, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Sgenia Industrial
S.L. and its subsidiaries, Sgenia Soluciones S.L and ZENON Biosystem S.L (collectively,
“Sgenia”) for the development of the Sgenia Products, to be based on the Sgenia sensory
technology.  Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company will have a worldwide exclusive
license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a
royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The Company entered into three amendments
(the “Amendments”) to the License Agreement to modify and extend the Sgenia Products to
include a lung cancer product and change the product development schedule and the research
funding budget to accommodate the additional lung cancer product as well as the continuation of
the development of the MRSA product.
 
Additionally, the development stage objectives and milestones were modified to reflect the
current state of development of each of the Sgenia Products. Under the License Agreement, the
Company is funding the development of the Sgenia Products pursuant to a research and
development plan proposed by Sgenia and accepted by the Company. The funding will be
provided on an advance basis, per month, based on agreed development stages. In return, the
Company will have the exclusive right to manufacture, formulate, package, market and sell the
Sgenia Products world-wide, for 40 years, subject to a limitation on the inclusion of Spain in the
territory. All intellectual property developed by Sgenia at any time during the term related to
manufacturing, formulating and/or packaging process shall be shared ownership and licensed
to  the Company on a royalty-free basis.
Sgenia will also supply to the Company, at a negotiated price based on quantity, all of the
requirements for the integrated circuits on microchips that are necessary for the operation of the
Sgenia Products. Sgenia and the Company will also work together to research and develop the
Sgenia Products and establish written plans and reviewing committees for the management of
the overall development project and commercialization of the Sgenia Products.
The Company’s funding of the MRSA product development was limited to an initial approved
budget of $1,256,438, of which $526,846 was advanced by the Company.  As a result of the
Amendment of July 2014, at the date of this report, the revised and approved budget is
approximately $1,142,143, of which $769,787 has been advanced (including the amount
advanced under the prior budget) as of June 30, 2016. The Company is currently committed to
advancing approximately EUR656,000 (approximately $727,000), for research and development
under the revised and approved budget, and subject to Sgenia meeting certain milestones. Some
of the milestones have not been met as of June 30, 2016.  The aggregate of the advances paid
by the Company are recorded as research and development expenses. The budget may be
changed by mutual agreement from time to time.
 
In addition to providing the development funding, the Company will also pay royalties for
completed sales of the Sgenia Products, payable 60 days after each fiscal quarter of the
Company (the “Royalties”). The Royalties will be 20% of net sales, which is calculated based on
gross sales of the device and the installation and training for the Sgenia Products, less various
expenses, including manufacturing, components acquired from Sgenia, commissions, refunds
and discounts and sales taxes. If the Sgenia Products are sold by Sgenia in Spain for original
use in Spain, then the Royalties on those sales will be reduced. The Company also has the right
to sublicense to other parties throughout the world, except in Spain if and when, if at all, Sgenia
seeks to act as the distributor in that territory.
The Company has the option to fund the development of future proposed products based on the
Sgenia intellectual property, and if funded the Company will obtain the right to manufacture,
market and sell the resulting devices.
On June 20, 2016 the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of the MML SSA
with the Partner utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MML, a UK Limited company under which the
Company will own a 40% interest. MML is developing the Partner’s MIDS universal
immunoassay detection technology with an initial focus on a novel POC Cardiac Device with the
aim of developing a hand held device to support high sensitivity tests of various cardiac
biomarkers to definitively identify or discount AMI, with accuracy equal or better than gold
standard laboratory tests, within minutes.
The Company’s funding of MML is limited to an initial aggregate payment of £450,500
(approximately $580,000) for Phase 1 of which £92,857.14 ($130,000) has already been paid. In
addition, The Company may be required to provide the Contingency to be available after March
31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $58,000) to be paid by the
Company within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML.
9.           Related Party Transactions
On December 5, 2013, the Company entered into a one-year service agreement with Mr. Carlos
Jose Gil, through his consulting firm, Ksego Engineering S.L., under which the Company obtains
his services as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  The agreement is now on a month-
to-month basis. Mr. Gil receives a base salary and additional compensation equal to 10% of the
net sales generated from the License Agreement.   During the six months ended June 30, 2016,
the Company recorded $30,553 of general and administrative expenses related to amounts
paid/owed to Ksego Engineering S.L. for services rendered by Mr. Gil. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company owes Mr. Gil $70,572.  No additional compensation based on net sales has been
earned to date.
10.         Subsequent Events
 
After the close of the stock market on August 3, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-7 reverse
split of its common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by the Company’s board of
directors. As a result, all common stock share amounts included in this filing have been
retroactively adjusted by a factor of seven, and all common stock per share amounts have been
increased by a factor of seven, with the exception of our common stock par value.
 
On August12, 2016, the Company amended Mr. Carlos Jose Gil’s service agreement to include
additional compensation equal to 10% of the revenue received by Zenosense, Inc. from MML as
a result of any future commercialization of the MIDS project.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This section of this quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect
our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project
and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not
place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.
 
As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “Zenosense” mean
Zenosense, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.  We have no subsidiaries.
 
General Overview
 
Zenosense, Inc. was incorporated on August 11, 2008 in the State of Nevada. In December
2013, we filed an amendment to our charter to change our name from “Braeden Valley Mines,
Inc.” to “Zenosense, Inc.” and to increase the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock
from 50,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares par value of $0.001.
The original purpose of the company was to acquire and to develop mineral properties and to
engage in the exploration for gold and other mineral properties.  On May 15, 2013, our mining
lease expired and we lost our right to explore the mining property.  We then became a shell
company, as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until
December 4, 2013, when we entered into the transaction with Sgenia described below.
In the summer of 2013, we started to look for other business opportunities.  We became
interested in sensory technology devices for use in hospitals and health care
environments.  During the latter part of the year, we began to negotiate a license agreement with
the developers of such technology (the “Sgenia Technology”), and in December 2013, we
entered into a Development and Exclusive License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with
Sgenia Industrial, S.L. (“Sgenia”) and its subsidiaries Sgenia Soluciones, S.L. (“Sgenia
Subsidiary”) and ZENON Biosystem, S.L. (“Zenon”), all of which were formed under the laws of
Spain. The products currently being developed under the License Agreement include one to be
used in the detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus aureus
(“MRSA/SA”) in the healthcare environment and another to be used to detect lung cancer in
patients.  Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will provide Zenon with capital for the
development of the devices that utilizes the Sgenia Technology (the “Sgenia Products”), in
exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, formulate, market and sell the
resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing
basis.  The License Agreement gives us additional rights to improvements and developments to
the Sgenia Products and future products using the Sgenia Technology. In June 2016, we were
presented the opportunity of involvement in a joint venture complementary to our current medical
device development business plan and we entered into the MML SSA as a joint venture to
develop the MIDS technology.
On June 20, 2016, we entered into a joint venture by way of a Subscription and Shareholders’
Agreement (“MML SSA”) with a third party medical detection device developer (“Partner”) utilizing
a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd (“MML”), a UK Limited company of which we own a
40% interest awarded on July 1, 2016, in exchange for its participation and funding to support
MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner’s MIDS
universal immunoassay detection technology platform  (“MIDS”). MML will have the right, under
license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property (“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS
IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third
party.
The MML SSA provides for a series of payments (“Phase 1 Payments”) in an aggregate amount
of £450,500 (approximately $580,000 based on the current rate of exchange). The Partner made
a Phase 1 Payment to MML, of $130,000 (the “First Payment”), which was converted to £92,857,
Subsequent Phase 1 Payments are expected to be received as follows; (a) on or before
September 20, 2016, a payment £106,093, (b) on or before November 20, 2016, a payment of
£100,640; (c) on or before January 20, 2017 a payment of £100,640; and (d) on or before March
20, 2017 a payment of £50,320.
 
The MML SSA also provides for a contingency funding (the “Contingency”) to be available after
March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $58,000) to be paid by
us within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML.
 
The MML SSA contains various provisions to govern the funding obligations of ours: if any Phase
1 Payment is not made within 14 days of it falling due (“Default”), our shareholding in MML may
be reduced to zero unless otherwise agreed with the Partner; if no Contingency is drawn during
Phase 1 the Partner will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit after tax right in MML (“Override”)
which will increase to a 15% Override if we decline to fund Stage 2; if we decline to fund Phase 2
and any Contingency has been drawn, the Partner will be awarded a 15% Override decreased
by 0.5% for each £7,500 tranche of Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any Override will
convert on a ratio of 1% Override to 1% of ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML.
To fund our obligations under the License Agreement and MML SSA, to date we have sold
shares of common stock on a private placement basis and converted funds advanced to the
Company into common shares of the Company.

Plan of Operation
 
Our business plan is to develop devices to be used at the POC in hospitals and other medical
care centers to detect AMI, MRSA/SA and the signs of lung cancer, and where necessary, to fund
the medical trials of those medical devices.  Up to June 20, 2016 our principal activity since
December 2013 has been funding the development of the Sgenia Products. Since then, our
primary focus is the funding and co development of the MIDS technology platform to develop a
hand held device to be used at the POC for the early detection of low levels of certain cardiac
biomarkers using high sensitivity cardiac assays for the diagnosis of AMI. To date we have not
been successful in securing funding for continued development of the Sgenia license and
research. At June 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $284,160.Our current cash assets
are not sufficient to cover our current and expected expenses, including the funding obligation
under the License Agreement and the SSA, and therefore, we will need to obtain further
financing, without which we will not be able to execute our business plan.
In light of our current inability to fund our operations and fund the Sgenia license and the fact that
the Sgenia research is delayed, we reviewed with Sgenia the development schedule and
funding requirements for the initial products and requirements to develop the cancer sensory
devices, and have agreed in principle to an alternative development schedule which would result
in the lengthening of the developmental schedule for these products and an increase of the
budget requirements. The schedule and funding will be finalized once we have obtained
sufficient funding, for which we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain. We
have been attempting to secure the necessary funding to continue either the existing
development schedule and corresponding budget or the alternative development schedule.
Assuming that we are able  to obtain operational funding, in addition to any funding necessary to
maintain our status as a public company, subject to regular review and additional assessment of
requirements, currently we anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the twelve
(12) month period following funding in connection with the development of the Sgenia Products
and the MIDS technology: (1) we will have to fund our obligations under the terms of the MML
SSA in an amount of up to £402,643,(2) we will have to fund the future development expenses of
Sgenia in the approximate amount of 656,000 euros, (3) payment of compensation to our officers,
employees, and consultants of approximately $100,000, (4) legal, audit and reporting expenses
of approximately $50,000, and (5) general working capital.  Additional unknown expenses may
arise from time to time, which we cannot currently identify or determine a possible expense.  We
will need additional funding to cover our anticipated expenses mentioned above, and for future
development and implementation of our business plan.
On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of a
Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“SSA”) with a third party medical detection device
developer (“Partner”) utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd (“MML”), a UK Limited
company of which the Company owns a 40% interest awarded on July 1, 2016, in exchange for
its participation and funding to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase
2 development of the Partner’s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology
platform  (“MIDS”). MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property
(“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML
concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party.
 
The SSA provides for a series of payments (“Phase 1 Payments”) in an aggregate amount of
£450,500 (approximately $650,000 based on the current rate of exchange). The Partner made a
Phase 1 Payment to MML, of $130,000 (the “First Payment”), which was converted to £92,857,
Subsequent Phase 1 Payments are expected to be received as follows; (a) on or before
September 20, 2016, a payment £106,093, (b) on or before November 20, 2016, a payment of
£100,640; (c) on or before January 20, 2017 a payment of £100,640; and (d) on or before March
20, 2017 a payment of £50,320.
 
The SSA also provides for a contingency funding (the “Contingency”) to be available after March
31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $64,000) to be paid by the
Company within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML.
 
The parties to the SSA envisage a second phase of development (“Phase 2”) to follow Phase 1.
This is expected to be over a similar timeframe and at a similar cost. MML may independently
obtain funding for Phase 2 at MML’s option, or invite the Company to fund.
The SSA contains various provisions to govern the funding obligations of the Company: if any
Phase 1 Payment is not made within 14 days of it falling due (“Default”), the Company’s
shareholding in MML may be reduced to zero unless otherwise agreed with the Partner; if no
Contingency is drawn during Phase 1 the Partner will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit after
tax right in MML (“Override”) which will increase to a 15% Override if the Company declines to
fund Stage 2; if the Company declines to fund Phase 2 and any Contingency has been drawn,
the Partner will be awarded a 15% Override decreased by 0.5% for each £7,500 tranche of
Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any Override will convert on a ratio of 1% Override to
1% of ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML.
 
At no time prior to a sale will the Company’s ownership interest in MML’s shares be less than
30% unless the Company is in Default. Provided that each Phase 1 Payment is made within 14
days of falling due the Company also has additional control rights over MML including
representation on the board of directors, rights over the appointment and employment of senior
management persons, indebtedness, major transactions, budget approval rights, accounting
practices and general operational management supervisory rights.
 
As a condition of the SSA, MML has entered into Supply of Services Agreements under which it
receives the services of key personnel related to the MIDS development.
Demand is increasing for Point of Care (“POC”) tests that can detect very low concentrations of a
target analyte and to quantify the result.  Current lateral flow based immunoassays can detect
analyte at high levels of concentration.  However, at low concentration levels, the assay system
requires amplification either of the signal or the target, which will typically increase the
complexity and the costs of the testing device.  Consequently, current POC tests remain largely
unreliable for targets that require quantification.
 
5
We believe there to be an opportunity to develop a universal immunoassay based POC testing
system which:
●
Is capable of detecting biomarkers at a nanoparticle level, providing fully quantitative
measurement of results i.e. giving a numerical value for each biomarker detected and not
just an indication on whether a specified biomarker is actually present,
Is capable of multiplexing i.e. performing multiple types of test from the same sample,
● 
●  Provides full connectivity and networking for collection, storage and transfer of data and
results,
●  Displays test results in minutes (less than 8 minutes for a panel of up to 3 tests),
●  Requires a finger prick sample size for a single test,
●  Utilizes a handheld reader and single disposable cartridge designed to be operated by a
minimally trained person, requiring modest manual operation, other than for sample
collection,
●  Contains all necessary reagents and where all steps are automated into an integrated
encompassing pre-treatment, analyte specific reaction, signal production, signal reaction
and final result: from sample to result in one step,
●  Can be adapted to perform different immunoassays for testing in areas such as infectious
diseases, drugs of abuse or oncology, especially where rapid diagnosis is critical, and
●  Has a simple system design, requiring minimal direct input costs and inline manufacturing
processes to keep unit costs as low as possible.
The MML plan is to develop the MIDS platform initially for the cardiac marker POC testing market,
these markers being measured to evaluate heart function.  Cardiac markers are used in the
diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary
syndrome.  The detection of these markers is used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction
(“AMI”) and its severity, typically troponin (cTnI or cTnT), myoglobin and Creatine kinase MB
isoenzyme (CK-MB).
Standard procedure for chest pain patients is an immediate ECG, complemented by blood tests
for the cardiac markers Troponin I or T, to diagnose AMI. However, the sensitivity of an ECG is
recognized as only around 55%-75% accurate. And these standard Troponin tests provide only
guidance; as troponin levels rise over time and are difficult to detect during the early stages. The
solution is the detection of very low levels of cardiac markers (Troponin I and T) using high
sensitivity cardiac Troponin assays (biomarker detection/measurement process). Gold standard
laboratory analyzers currently required to run these tests can give up to a 99.6% Negative
Predictive Value (the probability of no AMI): two thirds of suspect patients might be “ruled out”
and safely discharged early. However, laboratory analyzers are located centrally, extremely
expensive and slow to turnaround results (typically 60 minutes).
MML intends to develop its unique technology platform into a hand-held device for use
anywhere, designed to equal or exceed gold standard laboratory levels of accuracy. MML
believes it can develop a cardiac device (“MIDS Cardiac”) with a number of key features; a)
deliver definitive results at the POC within minutes with a single Troponin I or T test within 3
minutes and three panel test (additional cardiac biomarkers) within 8 minutes, b) accuracy equal
or superior to gold standard laboratory high sensitivity assays, c) patient friendly requiring a
market leading 5 microliter finger prick blood sample per tested analyte, d) automated operation
suitable for use by minimally trained personnel and, e) at a fraction of the cost of laboratory
analyzers and results not requiring interpretation from specialized medical personnel.
The global market for cardiac biomarker diagnostic tests is projected to reach $7.2 billion by
2018, of which $1.16 billion is expected to be served by POC devices. The POC market is in its
infancy; existing POC hand held devices not accurate or reliable enough to definitively exclude
AMI. MML’s ultimate goal is to match or exceed current gold standard” high-sensitivity cardiac
assays, currently carried out on relatively slow, hugely expensive laboratory analyzers. One
multinational diagnostic company claiming the highest levels of accuracy on the market for a
POC cardiac marker device, in reality achieves a mere 65% sensitivity. This poor sensitivity
comes nowhere near what MML believes the MIDS Cardiac can achieve. Despite the
shortcomings of  POC cardiac devices currently on the market, 100’s of millions of dollars per
year are generated from device and strip sales which only aid the diagnosis of AMI in conjunction
with ECG and clinical symptoms. Should the development of MIDS Cardiac be successful we
believe the device will deliver unparalleled levels of accuracy, reliability, ease of use and cost
savings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our total assets were $137,170 and $5,156,
respectively, and our total current liabilities were $318,063 and $261,301 respectively.  As of
June 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $179,806.  Our financial statements report a
net loss of $46,733 and $74,748 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
 
We have had recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent
upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital
as needed.  Our financial statements reflect that there is a going concern qualification.
Currently, we have only limited cash and similar assets, which do not allow us to continue with
the funding obligations of the license with Sgenia or our obligations under the MML SSA.  The
License Agreement has not been declared in default. Further funding of the development project
is not yet due as Sgenia has not completed the current stage of development terms.
As noted in our financial statements, in March 2016, we received notice of default on the Prior
Notes. On May 17, 2016, we exchanged the Prior Notes for the May 2016 Notes (as defined in
the financial statements).
Additionally, we received $40,000 as a further cash investment from the Investor on April 26,
2016, which was subscribed for after the Investor declared the default.The Company issued the
April 2016 Note (as defined in the financial statements) in a principal amount of $40,000.00 to the
Investor. The April 2016 Note and the May 2016 Notes contain standard anti-dilution provisions
and other customary representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of
the parties.  Additionally, the Investor has the right of first refusal in any future equity financing
and impose restrictions on the Company’s ability to make distributions to its shareholder,
repurchase shares of Common Stock, incur certain liabilities or sell assets.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company is permitted to raise additional capital relating to the Development and
Exclusive License Agreement, effective December 4, 2013, as amended.  The April 2016 Note
and the May 2016 Notes also include customary event of default provisions and impose
penalties on the Company in certain default events.
On June 6, 2016, we received a cash investment of $150,000 from an accredited investor in
exchange for the issuance of 9,589,512 of common stock. The use of proceeds required the
funds to be applied to participating in the MML project and for general working capital. The
investor is required to provide additional loans in an aggregate amount of $640,000 to be applied
to the Company’s ongoing obligations under the SSA and for general working capital.

and Zenon have not completed the preconditions for the next phase of funding.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, cash used in operations of $33,794, mainly due to our corporate
obligations and SEC reporting.
We used cash in investing activities of $130,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016, due
to the joint venture agreement with MIDS Medical Ltd.
We received $40,000 of cash proceeds from a loan during the three months ended June 30,
2016.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we received $30,000 of cash proceeds from
two loans.

Based on our current operating plan, we will not generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our
expenses for at least the next twelve (12) months.  In addition, we do not have sufficient cash and
cash equivalents to execute our operations for at least the next twelve (12) months.  We will need
to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the next twelve (12) months.  We expect
to raise the capital necessary to fund our company through advances or a private placement and
public offering of our common stock.  Additional financing, whether through public or private
equity or debt financing, arrangements with stockholders or other sources to fund operations,
may not be available, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us.
Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital.  If
we issue additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of our existing
stockholders would be reduced.  New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. Debt incurred by us would be senior to
equity in the ability of debt holders to make claims on our assets. The terms of any debt issued
could impose restrictions on our operations.  If adequate funds are not available to satisfy either
short or long-term capital requirements, our operations and liquidity could be materially adversely
affected and we could be forced to cease operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably
likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 4                                CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Under the supervision and the participation of our management, consists of our principal
executive officer (who is also our principal financial officer), we conducted an evaluation as of
June 30, 2016, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer,
who is also our principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of June 30, 2016, because (1) the Company lacks a functioning audit
committee and there is a lack of independent directors on the board of directors, resulting in
ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and
procedures;
(2) the Company has inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3)
the Company has ineffective controls over its period end financial disclosure and reporting
processes. The Company operations are also ineffective due to the lack of operating funding.
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 
 
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
