INTERIM STATEMENT
for the six months ended 30th June 2016
Griffin Mining Limited ("Griffin" or "the Company") has today released its results for the six months ended 30th
June 2016.
Highlights:
·     Revenues of $20.8 million (2015: $35.2 million)
·     Operating loss of $1.8 million (2015: profit $6.4 million)
·     Loss before tax of $4.1 million (2015: profit $3.7 million)
·     Loss after tax of $4.1 million (2015: Profit $2.2 million)
Financial and Trading:
Revenues and profits were severely impacted by the suspension of mining until 22nd January following a
fatality at Griffin's Caijiaying mine in October 2015 and disruption caused by the Chinese new year holidays in
February resulting in a lack of ore and low grade ore to process in the first quarter of 2016.  Revenues were
further impacted by relatively low commodity prices in the first quarter of 2016.  The second quarter has seen
an increase in the amount of ore mined and consequentially processed which together with rising commodity
prices has led to a return to profitability.
With 13.5% less ore hauled to surface, throughput of 365,337 tonnes of ore in the six months to 30th June 2016
at the Caijiaying Mine was down 12.8% on that achieved of 418,950 tonnes in the six months to 30th June
2015. With surface stockpiles drawn down with lower grades, metal in concentrate production in the period
was:
·     13,420 tonnes of zinc (2015: 20,081 tonnes);
·     705 tonnes of lead (2015: 962 tonnes);
·     120,953 ounces of silver (2015: 193,098 ounces); and
·     3,553 ounces of gold (2015: 6,274 ounces).
Zinc revenues before royalties and resource taxes in the six months to 30th June 2016 were $15,798,000
(2015 $26,288,000) with less zinc metal in concentrate sold and the average price received after smelter
charges of $1,190 per tonne down 13% on that received in 2015 of $1,368.  Lead and precious metals
revenues were $6,372,000 (2015: $10,799,000) with less metal in concentrate sold.
Cost of sales in the six months to 30th June 2016 was down 16.4% on the same period in 2015 reflecting the
suspension in mining and haulage and consequent reduction in throughput. Costs were further reduced by a
7.5% fall in the value of the Renminbi in the period compared to the same period in 2015.
With improved mining, haulage and processing rates in the second quarter, unit costs were down on the same
period in 2015 with; costs per tonne of ore mined down 27.7%; costs per tonne of ore hauled down 20.3%; and
costs per tonne of ore processed down 6.1%.  With the fall in the value of the Renminbi and less expenditure
on local community projects, operating (administration) costs were $5,454,000 down 34% from that incurred in
the six months to 30th June 2015 of $8,124,000.
Profits before tax were impacted by: foreign exchange losses of $190,000 (2015: $24,000) arising from a
weaker Renminbi against the US dollar in the period; interest payable on Chinese bank loans of $1,938,000
(2015: $2,480,000); finance lease interest of $307,000 (2015: $392,000); interest receivable of $80,000 (2015:
$106,000); and other income of $81,000 (2015: $36,000).
In view of the losses incurred no provision for taxation has been made (2015: $1,442,000).
Basic and diluted losses per share were 2.29 cents (2015: earnings 1.24 cents).  At 30th June 2016,
attributable net assets per share amounted to 75 cents (2015: 82 cents).
Funds continue to be repatriated from China to cover central costs whilst leaving sufficient working capital
within Hua Ao for the further development of the Caijiaying mine. During the period $5,620,000 was expended
on mine development and plant upgrade work.
Administrative state issues in China outside the Company's control continue to delay the grant of a new mining
licence over the unmined Zone III deeps, Zone II and adjacent areas at Caijiaying.  Development of the mine at
Zone III continues.
In line with previous years' practice and the Company's policy of determining annual dividends at the time of
the Company's full year results, no interim dividend has been declared by the Board of Griffin.
Chairman's Statement
Chairman Mladen Ninkov commented, "The interim results, although by their very nature disappointing, need
to be understood in the context of the short and long term consequences of the 5 month shutdown caused by
the death of a contractor at Caijiaying in late 2015.  The cessation of operations not only ceased mining,
processing, production, revenues and profits, but also prevented underground clean-up activities and vital
capital development to be undertaken in the down period.  The effects of the shutdown were being felt, both
operationally and financially, until June of this year.  Barring any further extraneous events, the second half of
2016 is expected to return to normality and, with higher commodity prices, the Company is confident of a very
acceptable second half year period.  Needless to say, the Company continues to progress the Mining Licence
application and remains hopeful of a successful conclusion to this matter."

Notes to the Interim Statement
1.     These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
accounting policies adopted in the last annual financial statements for the year to 31 December 2015.
2.     Copies of this interim report are being sent to all registered shareholders.  Additional copies are available
from the Company's London office, 60 St James's Street, London, SW1A 1LE.
3.     The summary accounts set out above do not constitute statutory accounts as defined by Section 84 of the
Bermuda Companies Act 1981 or Section 434 of the UK Companies Act 2006.  The condensed consolidated
statement of financial position at 31 December 2015 and the condensed consolidated income statement,
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated statement of changes
in equity and the condensed consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended have been extracted
from the Group's 2015 statutory financial statements upon which the auditors' opinion is unqualified.
4.     The summary accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.  As at 30th June 2016, Hebei Hua
Ao (a subsidiary of the Company) had bank loans outstanding of $61,666,000 (30th June 2015 $67,064,000). 
Having previously rolled over each of the bank facilities Hebei Hua Ao expects to roll over the existing facilities
for a further 12 months.  Having considered the cash resources, banking facilities and forecasts for the
remainder of the Hebei Hua Ao joint venture term, the directors do not expect any going concern issues to
arise.
5.     The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. The calculation of
diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share on the assumed conversion of all dilutive
options and other dilutive potential ordinary shares. Reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average
number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
