          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Three month period 
                          ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 
 
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles for the interim financial information with the 
instructions to Form 10-QSB and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they 
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally 
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion 
of the Company's management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal 
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 
 
We translate all assets and liabilities using period-end exchange rates. We 
translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the 
period. We record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other 
comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders' equity. We recognize 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of 
operations, including unrealized gains and losses on short-term inter-company 
obligations using period-end exchange rates. We recognize unrealized gains and 
losses on long-term inter-company obligations within accumulate other
comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders' equity. 
 
We recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in 
currency rates between the U.S. dollar (the functional reporting currency) and 
the Canadian dollar (currencies of our subsidiaries), as well as their effect on 
the dollar denominated inter-company obligations between us and our foreign 
subsidiaries. All inter-company balances are revolving in nature and we do not 
deem them to be long-term balances. For the three months ended March 31, 2009 
and 2008, we recognized foreign currency gain of $20,669 and $47,313, 
respectively. 
 
For further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto 
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 
31, 2008. 
 
The Company's fiscal year-end is December 31. 
 
NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
This summary of significant accounting policies of Industrial Minerals, Inc. is 
presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. The 
financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management, 
which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting 
policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
------------------------------------ 
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS) NO.157, "Fair Value 
Measurements". SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for 
measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 
 
SFAS 157 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins 
after November 15, 2007. As such, the Company was required to adopt these 
provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. Adoption 
of SFAS 157 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial 
statements. 
 
In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 159, "The Fair Value 
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of 
FASB Statement NO. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many 
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified 
election dates. This Statement applies to all entities, including not-for-profit 
organizations. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first 
fiscal year that begins after November 14, 2007. As such, the Company was 
required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2008. Adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material effect on the 
Company's financial statements. 
 
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share 
-------------------------------- 
Loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of 
shares was calculated by taking the number of shares outstanding and weighting 
them by the amount of time that they were outstanding. Basic and diluted loss 
per share are the same, as inclusion of common stock equivalents would be 
anti-dilutive. 
 
Going Concern 
------------- 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of 
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has suffered material 
recurring losses from operations since inception. At March 31, 2009, the Company 
had a negative working capital of $ 869,453, recurring losses, and an 
accumulated deficit of $ 9,867,486 and negative cash flow from operations. These 
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Continuation of the Company is dependent on achieving sufficiently profitable 
operations and possibly obtaining additional financing. Management has and is 
continuing to raise additional capital from various sources. The Company's 
website contains all news releases in the past year as well as detailed 
descriptions and analysis of the Company's mineral property. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital as 
and when it is required. 
 
The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the 
recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be 
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average 
assumptions used for option granted during the nine months ended September 30,

Note 6 - ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION 
 
SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (ARO) addresses 
financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of 
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No 
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the 
period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by 
increasing the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. 
 
In March 2005, the FASB issued interpretation 47, "Accounting for Conditional 
Assets Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). This interpretation clarifies the term 
conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No 143. Conditional 
asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform as asset 
retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are 
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the 
entity. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair 
value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the 
liability can be reasonably estimated. In conjunction with FIN 47, an ARO 
liability of $230,000 has been recorded and the capitalized costs are included 
in "Property and Equipment".

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION 
 
Overview 
-------- 
 
     Industrial Minerals, Inc. ("the Company"), a Delaware Corporation, was 
incorporated on November 6, 1996 under the name Winchester Mining Corp. The name 
of the Company was subsequently changed to PNW Capital, Inc. on May 16, 2000. 
 
     The Company is a successor registrant pursuant to Section 12(g)3 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by virtue of a statutory merger of the Parent, 
Winchester Mining Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Hi-Plains Energy Corp., a Wyoming corporation, with Winchester 
Mining Corporation being the survivor. There was no change to the issued and 
outstanding shares of Winchester Mining Corporation, and all shares of Hi-Plains 
Energy Corp. were retired by virtue of the merger. 
 
     On May 15, 2000, Winchester Mining Corp. completed a Share Purchase 
Agreement with shareholders of Hi-Plains Energy Corp. in which Winchester Mining 
Corp., a Delaware Corporation, acquired all 780,000 shares outstanding of the 
Registrant for the purposes of accomplishing a Merger of Hi-Plains Energy Corp. 
and Winchester Mining Corp. The Merger was completed on May 15, 2000. 
 
     In fall of 2000 the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding 
stock of PB&J Inc., a newly formed Colorado Corporation upon issuance of 
47,460,000 shares of common stock to the principals of PB&J, who became the 
management and Directors of PNWC. 
 
     On December 14, 2001, the shareholders adopted a reverse split of the then
issued and outstanding shares on a 100 for one basis, except that no shareholder 
shall be reduced to less than 50 shares. The effective date of the reverse split 
was January 7, 2002. 
 
                                       10 
<PAGE> 
     On January 31, 2002, PNW Capital, Inc. ("PNW" or the "Company"), entered 
into a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire Industrial Minerals 
Incorporated ("IMI"), a private Nevada Corporation, owner of certain mineral 
leases located in the Townships of Head, Clara and Maria in the County of 
Renfrew and the Province of Ontario, Canada. The Agreement for Share Exchange 
was executed January 31, 2002 and approved by the Board of Directors on January 
31, 2002. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, PNW exchanged a total of 
31,511,700 shares of its common stock for 91% of the issued and outstanding 
shares of IMI. As a result of the transaction, IMI became a wholly owned 
subsidiary of PNW and changed its company name to Industrial Minerals, Inc. 
 
     On June 13, 2003, the directors approved a resolution to forward split the 
common shares of the Company on a two shares for one basis, and a majority of 
the shareholders consented in writing to the forward split. This resulted in the 
issuance of an additional 36,031,948 shares of common stock. 
 
     The Ministry of Environment of the Province of Ontario has requested a 
storm water management plan from the Company. The Company has retained Knight 
Piesold to author this plan and that this plan will be submitted to the Ministry 
of Environment when completed. 
 
     In August 2004, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, Industrial 
Minerals Canada, Inc. received notice from the Ministry of Northern Development 
and Mines for the Province of Ontario that the Bissett Creek Graphite Project 
Certified Closure Plan as per Subsection 141(3)(a) of the Mining Act for the 
Province of Ontario is now considered filed. 
 
     In March, 2007, a significant management change occurred when three of the 
existing board members resigned and two new directors were appointed. Mr. 
William Thomson was appointed a director and Chairman of the Board, and Mr. 
William Booth was appointed a director. They joined Mr. Robert Dinning C.A. who 
continued as CFO, secretary, and a director of the Company. 
 
     On April 3, 2007, Mr. Dick van Wyck was appointed interim President and 
CEO. Mr. van Wyck is a practicing lawyer with over 20 years of business and 
commercial law, mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property matters, and 
was formerly in-house counsel with the Department of Justice, as well as with 
two large Corporations. Mr. van Wyck resigned July 9, 2007 and provides legal 
opinions from time to time when requested. 
 
     On July 9, 2007, Mr. David Wodar was appointed President and CEO. Mr. Wodar 
is a private business consultant and an Economics graduate from University of 
Western Ontario. Mr. Wodar operated his own Consulting business, Vantage Point 
Capital for the past 11 years, specializing in Marketing and Communications for 
private and public entities. Mr. Wodar resigned his position with the Company on 
June 12, 2008. 
 
     In June 2007, Mr. Paul Hynek was appointed to the Advisory Board. Mr.Hynek 
has an extensive background in large scale mining projects and was formerly with 
Inco. Mr. Hynek was joined on the advisory board by David Michaud, as Senior 
Metallurgical Advisor. 
 
     Mr. Michaud, who holds a degree in Mining Engineering, has more than 15 
years of experience in mine and mill design, including operations in Canada and 
South America. Mr. Michaud resigned from the advisory board on February 18,2008. 
 
 
                                       11 
<PAGE> 
     The former Chairman and Director, Mr. William Thomson resigned as Chairman 
and a Director of the Company, effective June 20, 2008. 
 
     On June 23, 2008, Mr. Chris Crupi C.A. and Mr. Gregory Bowes, MBA joined 
the Board of Directors. Mr. Robert Dinning C.A. continued as a director and was 
reappointed CFO of the Company and also appointed President and CEO effective 
June 23, 2008. 
 
     On July 9, 2008, Mr. William Booth resigned as a director of the Company.
<PAGE> 
     The Company signed a contract with Geostat International Inc on May 22, 
2007 regarding the preparation of a technical report NI-43101 on the Bissett 
Creek Project. The Geostat work program included a site visit and independent 
certification of resources, estimation of resources and classification of 
resources, certification and validation of the database, verification and 
validation of the interpretation of ore zones, and an assessment of the mill and 
processing procedures, the market, the Capex, and related operating costs. The 
process included the drilling of an additional 6 holes for just under 300 meters 
in order to assist in verification of previously obtained data. The specific 
drill targets have been determined by Geostat following their review of the 
original drill target data prepared by Kilborn Engineering. These samples have 
been analyzed for verification and validation of the graphite ore zones. The 
report was finalized and on December 27, 2007. 
 
     As previously outlined, the Company has a 100% undivided interest in the 
mineral lease. The property consists of 28 claims covering 1,400 acres (566 
hectares) plus 900 acres (364 hectares) which are contiguous to its mine 
property. In July, 2007, the Company completed the staking of an additional 950 
acres (384 hectares), for a total area available for development of 
approximately 3,250 acres (1,315 hectares). The Bissett Creek mine site is 
located in Maria Township, about 180 miles (300 km) north-northeast of Toronto 
Ontario and about 8 miles (14 km) south of Highway 17 in Northern Ontario 
Canada. 
 
     , The Company has continued 
work at the mine site, including various meetings with Knight-Piesold 
(environmental consulting firm) to review and update environmental monitoring 
requirements under the Mine Closure Plan (MCP), initial meetings with the area 
First Nations communities (Algonquin)including an inter-ministerial meeting to 
work towards a Memorandum of understanding between the Company, Government 
agencies, and First Nations leaders, general site cleaning, building repairs. 
 
     The Company is delaying its plans to install a one (1) metric ton per hour 
pilot plant at the mine site while it explores different options available, 
including financial options, regarding the production of product samples for 
prospective customers. 
 
     The Company has also completed a comprehensive program of metallurgical 
testing to identify the key liberation and classification characteristics of the 
ore body. This review included a general review of existing dry process at 
Bissett Creek and existing processes used elsewhere for the liberation and 
extraction of graphite. The dry process has many shortcomings which would 
require a complete re-engineering and rebuild at great risk to stakeholders 
whereas the froth flotation system is used extensively elsewhere in the world 
and is proven. The Company selected Process Research Ortech (Mississauga 
Ontario) and Actlabs (of Ancaster Ontario) as its processing and assaying 
entities. Both were approved by Geostat and they provided the necessary data for 
the completion of the NI 43101 that was been prepared by Geostat. The positive 
preliminary assessment was completed and filed with Sedar on December 27, 2007. 
 
                                       12 
<PAGE> 
     Effective August 1, 2007, the Company moved into new corporate 
headquarters, located at 2904 South Sheridan Way, Suite 100, Oakville Ontario, 
Canada, L6J 7L7. It previously occupied premises in Toronto, Ontario, on a 
month-to-month basis. On September 22, 2008, the Company moved its headquarters 
to 346 Waverley Street, Ottawa Ontario, Canada, K2P 0W5. 
 
     On October 27, 2008, the Company engaged RBC Capital Markets, a division of 
the Royal Bank of Canada, as financial advisor with respect to strategic options 
facing the company. The engagement is for a term of 12 months with success fee 
based compensation for completion of a transaction. 
 
The Company continues to explore alternate financing options which the Company 
acknowledges must be finalized prior to implementation of a pilot plant program. 
The Company is also exploring a work program at the site including a possible 
drilling program, should it succeed in resolving its funding requirements. 
 
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 
For the three month period ending March 31, 2009, the Company incurred a loss of
$ $136,572 compared to a loss of $524,347 for the three months ending March 31, 
2008. The Company had no revenues for the three months ending March 31, 2009. 
The Company continues as an Exploration Stage Company and will not have revenues 
until a proposed feasibility study is completed, a determination is made as to 
the method of production, and the Company acquires the necessary equipment to 
commence production. 
 
During the three month period ending March 31, 2009, the Company did not 
complete any private placements. The Company did receive an additional deposit 
of $29,471 regarding the sale of surplus Equipment at the mine site. This 
transaction should be completed by June 30, 2009. 
 
For the three months ending March 31, 2009, expenses amounted to $157,241 
compared to $571,660 for the Three months ending March 31, 2008. Professional 
fees were $19,550 compared to $86,892 for the three months ended March 31, 2008 
Professional expenses in the previous year were higher 
 mainly because of increased legal fees related to proposed financings, and 
statutory filings related to financings. 
 
Management fees and salaries were $74,797 for the three months ended March 
31, 2009 compared to $299,435 for the three months ending March 31, 3008. 
Current fees include a charge of $44,805 for stock compensation expense re 
options previously authorized. In the three months ending March 31, 2008, 
management fees of $299,435 included stock compensation expense of $94,403. As 
at March 31, 2009, there is a balance of $179,081 in stock compensation expense 
remaining to be written off. 
 
Management fees have significantly been reducted as a result of a reduction in 
personnel as compared to the previous year. General exploration expenses in the 
three months ending March 31, 2009 were only $166 vs. $40,806 for the three 
month period ending March 31, 2008 
 
There was significant work undertaken the previous year at the site whereas no 
work has been undertaken this year as the Company continues to explore its 
financing options for further development work at Bissett Creek. General and 
administrative expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2009 amount to 
$15,650 compared to $80,927 in the three months ended March 31, 2008. Expenses 
for general and administrative will continue to be tightly monitored pending 
completion of additional financing and implementation of the next phase of the 
development program. 
 
At March 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding options in the amount of 
 7,799,999 shares of which 6,799,999 were exercisable at March 31, 2009. The 
remaining 1,000,000 are not vested yet as of March 31, 2009. 
 
                                       13 
<PAGE> 
The original option plan adopted in 2007 and the Company issued 22,950,000 in 
options. Subsequent resignations and terminations resulted in cancellation of 
15,150,001 options for a present balance outstanding of 7,799,999. When an 
employee/consultant/director resigns or is terminated, only shares vested at 
time of departure remain with the individual as an option and these all have a 
time period when they must be exercised. 
 
On September 23, 2008, the Company moved its headquarters to 346 Waverley St. 
Ottawa Ontario, Canada K2P 0W5. 
 
The Company currently has no full time employees and it contracts with four 
consultants for engineering, technical and administrative support and financial 
services. 
 
The Company will continue the use of outside professional consultants as it 
continues its mineralogical assessment and its development of a detailed 
mineralogy study. 
 
On November 7, 2008, the Company announced the appointment of Mr. George Hawley 
as Technical Advisor to the Board of Directors and to assist both the Board of 
Directors and RBC Dominion Capital Markets regarding their current financial 
advisory services mandate. Mr. Hawley has nearly 40 years of experience in the 
processing of industrial minerals including mica, graphite, and silica, all of 
which are specific to the Bissett Creek property. He has conducted projects for 
government agencies, mining companies in the USA, Europe, Japan, Australia, 
Africa and Canada and has published over 50 papers on technical and marketing 
topics pertaining to industrial minerals products. As it is uncertain when 
revenue will be generated, expenses will need to be financed by continued
outside financial support. The Company has completed several private placements 
this year as indicated earlier and intends to seek additional equity financing 
and/or loans from shareholders and other interested parties in order to finance 
its operations. While the Company feels it can obtain the necessary financing 
there is no assurance that such investments, loans, or other financial 
assistance will be forthcoming. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company incurred a loss of 
136,572 vs. a loss of $524,347 for the three months ended March 31, 2008. , 
 While the Company has been successful in arranging necessary private placement 
financing over the years, the Company cautions that until it has completed its 
feasibility study and Baseline Mineralogical Assessment, there is no assurance 
that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the property, and that 
further exploration may be required before a final evaluation as to any economic 
and legal feasibility is determined. The Company received its NI 43101 report 
December 27, 2007 and it was filed with regulatory authorities at that time.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
At March 31, 2009, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $3,856 compared 
to $307 at December 31, 2008. The Company completed several private placements 
in the year ending December 31, 2009 resulting in 
$475,200 being raised. In the three months ending March 31, 2009, the Company 
has not completed any private placements but did receive an additional deposit 
of $26,202 regarding the proposed sale of surplus equipment. 
 
 
 
The Company has a long-term deposit of $230,000 with the Ministry of Finance for 
the Province of Ontario. During the year ending December 31, 2004 a Mine 
Development and Closure Plan was filed with, and accepted by, the Ministry of 
Northern Development and Mines, in accordance with the MINING ACT, R.S.O. 1990, 
Ontario Regulation 240/00, including the standards, procedures and requirements 
of the Mining Code of Ontario. The Company's deposit in the amount of $230,000 
is a financial guarantee to the Province of Ontario ensuring that there are 
enough funds on hand to affect a proper closure of the Bissett Creek Graphite 
property. 
 
The Company has accounts payable of $268,398 at March 31, 2009 vs. $288,629 at 
March 31, 2008 and $270,150 at December 31, 2008. Accrued interest payable of 
$72,358 is outstanding at March 31, 2009 . This pertains to accruals on loans 
payable of $413,192 currently due. Negotiations are continuing regarding 
settlement of this debt. 
 
 
The Company has current loans payable of $413,192 at March 31, 2009. 
This includes a loan for $90,795 with interest at 7%, loan of $161,000 with 
interest at 10%, a loan of $87,340 with interest at 10% and loans totaling 
$74,056 with no interest and no specific terms of repayment. Discussions are 
proceeding regarding ultimate settlement of these debts of $74,056 as they are 
with former officers/directors of the Company who continue to assist the Company 
in its efforts to obtain additional financing. 
 
 
Loans due beyond one year in the amount of $326,234 are unsecured, with no 
specific terms of repayment. 
 
The Company intends to obtain additional financing either by way of private 
placements, loans, or a combination of both from shareholders and other 
interested parties to retire outstanding debt, and finance its operations over 
the next twelve months. While the Company intends to procure these private 
placements and/or loans, there is no assurance that the Company will be 
successful in its attempt to obtain said funding. 
 
It is the Company's opinion that the intrinsic value of the Bissett Creek 
property deposit lies in the large 1 to 6 mm (18 mesh to 1/4") Graphite and Mica 
flakes. There is not presently any data available as to the specific 
size-by-size weight distribution of graphite and mica in the ore. Graphite flake 
values vary widely based on its size, but due to the fundamental lack of size 
and chemical data, it is not possible at this stage to assign a clear specific 
value to the rock. 
 
                                       15

Going Concern Consideration 
--------------------------- 
 
As the independent certified public accountants have indicated in their report 
on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, and as shown 
in the financial statements, the Company has experienced significant operating 
losses that have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $9,473,396 at September 
30, 2008. These conditions raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue 
as a going concern. 
 
The ability of the Company to achieve its operating goals and thus positive cash 
flows from operations is dependent upon the future market price of graphite, 
future capital raising efforts, and the ability to achieve future operating 
efficiencies. Management's plans will require additional financing, and 
completion of final feasibility report. While the Company has been successful in 
these capital-raising endeavors in the past, there can be no assurance that its 
future efforts, and anticipated operating improvements will be successful. 
Depending on the level of exploration activity, the Company does not have 
adequate capital to continue its contemplated business plan through December 31, 
2009, The Company is presently investigating all of the alternatives identified 
above to meet its short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes that it can 
arrange a transaction or transactions to meet its short-term liquidity needs, 
however there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be concluded 
or that if concluded they will be on terms favorable to the Company. 
 
Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this 
item 
 
Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act 
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive 
Officer / Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions 
regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure 
controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-14(c). In designing and evaluating the 
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and 
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only 
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management 
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit 
relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
On or about September 30, 2008, the end of the period of this report, the 
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the 
participation of the Company's management, including the Company's President / 
Chief Financial Officer, and a Board Member, of the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the 
foregoing, the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that 
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls or in other 
factors that could affect the internal controls subsequent to the date the 
Company completed its evaluation.
