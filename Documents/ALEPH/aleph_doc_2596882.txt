Commentary on results
General
The Appendix 4D results and the accompanying condensed consolidated interim final financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are 
presented in United States dollars.
Current period: Six months ended 30 June 2016; Previous corresponding period: Six months ended 30 June 2015.
Key Operating/Financial Data
  Net  production  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  was  85  MMcf  of  gas  and  3,451  barrels  of  oil/condensate 
(equivalent to 105 MMcfe). This was  52% lower than the  previous corresponding period  production of  218 MMcfe 
due to the shut-in of both the Adeline Sugar Factory No.4 and Williams No. 2 wells for an extended period of time. 
Refer to the “Review of Operations” section in the Directors Report on page 5 for further details.
  Net  oil  and  gas  revenues  (after  royalties)  for  the  current  period  of  US$0.33  million  were  49%  lower  than  that
achieved in the previous corresponding period of US$0.65 million, mainly attributable to lower production volumes.
  The consolidated entity reported negative EBITDAX US$4.1 million for the current period (previous corresponding 
period: EBITDAX of US$1.1 million), reflecting the lower oil and gas revenue base coupled with additional operating 
and GG&A costs associated with the acquisition of the An Nagyah Oilfield in Yemen.
  The consolidated entity incurred a net loss after tax for the current period of US$5.1 million (previous corresponding
period: net loss after tax of US3.7 million) due to the aforementioned operating factors.
Key Performance Indicators
  Petsec  Energy  realised  an  average  net  gas  equivalent  sales  price  of  US$3.14/Mcfe  for  the  current  period,  6% 
higher  than  the  US$2.97/Mcfe  achieved  for  the  previous  corresponding  period,  reflecting  a  higher  proportion  of 
liquids  production  in  the  current  period.  The  consolidated  entity  received  an  average  sales  of  price  US$2.32/Mcf 
and US$38.66/bbl for its natural gas and oil/condensation production, respectively. This  compares to US$2.79/Mcf 
and US$53.83/bbl for its natural gas and oil/condensation production in the previous corresponding period.
  Current  period  unit  operating  costs  of  US$43.95/Mcfe  (previous  corresponding  period  of  US$10.51/Mcfe)  and 
negative EBITDAX of US$39.19/Mcfe (previous corresponding period: US$5.06/Mcfe) reflected the combined effect 
of lower production volumes and increased operating costs relating to Petsec Energy’s expansion in MENA.
  Unit DD&A expense was US$1.14/Mcfe for the current period (previous corresponding period: US$0.83/Mcfe).
Other Financial Data
  Acquisition,  exploration  and  development  expenditures  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  of  US$3.9  million 
comprised  acquisition  cost  and  working  capital  adjustments  of  the  Damis  (Block  S-1)  interest  in  Yemen  and 
development costs associated with the Main Pass 270 #3 BP 1 well (Hummer Project).
Dividend
Petsec Energy Ltd does not propose the payment of a dividend in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2016.
Net Tangible Asset Backing
The  consolidated  entity’s  net  tangible  asset  backing  per  ordinary  security  for  the  current  period  was  US$0.05  (previous 
corresponding period: US$0.12).

2.  Operating results 
The consolidated entity incurred a net loss after tax for the six months ended 30 June 2016 of US$5.1 million (previous 
corresponding period: net loss after tax of US$3.7 million) largely due to a lower oil and gas revenue base in combination 
with increased operating and GG&A costs associated with the acquisition of the An Nagyah Oilfield in Yemen.
Net oil and gas revenues of US$0.33 million were generated for the current period, from production of 105 MMcfe at an 
average natural gas equivalent sales price of US$3.14/Mcfe. This was 49% lower than the US$0.65 million in net oil and gas 
revenues achieved in the previous corresponding period, mainly due to the impact of lower production volumes.
Net production for the six months ended 30 June 2016 fell 52% to 105 MMcfe (previous corresponding period: 218 MMcfe) 
due to the shut-in of both the Adeline Sugar Factory No.4 and Williams No. 2 wells for extended periods of time during the 
course of the first half of the year. Refer to the “Review of Operations” section in the Directors Report on page 5 for further 
details.
The average gas equivalent sales price realised for the current period of US$3.14/Mcfe was 6% higher than the 
US$2.97/Mcfe achieved for the previous corresponding period, reflecting a higher proportion of liquids production in the 
current period. The consolidated entity received an average sales price of US$2.32/Mcf and US$38.66/bbl for its natural gas 
and oil/condensation production, respectively. This compares to an average sales price of US$2.79/Mcf and US$53.83/bbl 
for its natural gas and oil/condensation production in the previous corresponding period.
Lease operating expense of US$1.4 million (previous corresponding period: US$0.3 million) and geological, geophysical and 
administrative (“GG&A”) expense of US$3.2 million (previous corresponding period: US$2.0 million) were higher as a result 
of the increased activities and business expansion in the MENA region – Dubai/Yemen.
The consolidated entity recorded negative earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, depletion and amortisation, 
and exploration expense (“EBITDAX”) of US$4.1 million for the current period (previous corresponding period: negative 
EBITDAX of US$1.1 million).
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation (”DD&A”) expense was US$0.1 million in the current period (previous 
corresponding period: US$0.2 million).
3.  Financial position
At  30  June 2016,  the  Company’s  cash  deposits  of  US$9.2  million  was  US$3.6  million  or 28%  lower  than  the  31  December 
2015 cash balance of US$12.8 million. The cash deposits which are predominantly held in US dollars include secured deposits 
of US$3.7 million primarily held in an escrow account to secure operator bonds  that are on issue to the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management (“BOEM”).
Subsequent  to  30  June  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  a  US$15  million  Secured  Unlisted  Convertible  Note  Facility 
Agreement to provide flexibility for its ongoing funding requirements to progress its development projects in the USA and 
MENA. Further details are provided in Note 5 – Events subsequent to balance date.

Directors’ Report (continued)  
For the six months ended 30 June 2016
4.  Review of operations
Petsec  Energy  Ltd  (the  “Company”)  is  an  independent  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  company  listed  on  the 
Australian  Stock  Exchange  (ASX  Ticker:  PSA)  and  traded  over  the  counter  in  the  USA  in  the  form  of  American  Depositary 
Receipts  (OTC  ADR  Ticker:  PSJEY).  The  Company  has  operations  in  the  shallow  waters  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  onshore 
Louisiana, USA, and in the Republic of Yemen.
USA
Production 
The Company produced 85 MMcf of gas and 3,451 barrels of oil/condensate (equivalent to 105 MMcfe) for the six months to 
30 June 2016, predominantly from the Williams No.2 Alt. well in the Mystic Bayou Field, onshore Louisiana USA.
Adeline Sugar Factory No. 4 Well – Jeanerette Field 
Petsec: 12.5% working interest (9.2% net revenue interest)
The Adeline Sugar Factory (“ASF”) No. 4 well located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana was drilled and brought into production in 
June 2014. The well was shut-in in mid-November 2015 due to high water production and a restriction in the tubing due to 
salt build-up. The well has produced on an intermittent basis since that time, and it’s the operator’s intention to continue as 
is for the near-term.
Williams Alt No.2 well – Mystic Bayou Field 
Petsec: 25% working interest (18.5% net revenue interest)
The Williams No.2 Alt. well was shut-in on 10 February 2016 due to a leak in the tubing at a depth below the producing 
reservoir. The operator completed a work-over of the well and returned it to production on 26 May 2016 at a gross rate of 
approximately 5.2 MMcfpd and 240 bcpd. The well had averaged gross daily production rates of approximately 7.5 MMcfpd 
and 300 bcpd prior to being shut-in.
Acquisitions
Main Pass Block 274 – Hummer Project 
Petsec: 12.5% working interest (10.24% net revenue interest)
On 5 May 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) awarded the Main Pass Block 274 lease to Castex 
Offshore, Inc. (“Castex”), the operator of the Hummer Project. Castex was the high bidder with a gross bid of US$675,576 
(US$84,447 net to Petsec).
The block falls within an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) for the Hummer Project participants, and as a result the Company had 
the right, which it has exercised, to participate for its 12.5% working interest (“W.I.”) in the lease.
Main Pass Block 274 was previously leased by Petsec in March 2010 as part of the Hummer Exploration Prospect, which was 
identified on 3D seismic as extending across portions of Main Pass Blocks 270, 273 and 274. The Main Pass Block 270 #3 
Hummer discovery well (Petsec 12.5% W.I.) was drilled in late 2015 and is currently under development with the fabrication 
and installation of a platform jacket.  The Main Pass Block 274 lease had already expired prior to the discovery well being 
drilled.
Development
Main Pass Block 270 #3 BP 1 well – Hummer Prospect 
Petsec: 12.5% working interest (10.24% net revenue interest)
The  Main  Pass  Block  270  #3  BP  1  well  was  drilled  during  the  second  half  of  2015  on  the  highly  anticipated  Hummer 
exploration prospect, offshore Gulf of Mexico (federal waters), USA in approximately 215 feet of water.  
The  well  encountered  the  Miocene  age  sand  objectives  as  anticipated  and  was  mud-line  suspended  at  14,300  feet  TVD/ 
14,342 feet MD for future completion and production testing after the fabrication and installation of a platform jacket.
The fabrication and installation of the jacket, tie-back, well completion, and testing are anticipated to be completed during 
the second half of 2016. The estimated net cost for the fabrication and installation of the platform jacket is approximately 
US$1.1 million. Net cost for completion and testing of the well are anticipated to be approximately US$0.9 million.

Directors’ Report (continued)  
For the six months ended 30 June 2016
4.  Review of operations (continued)
Development (continued)
Following completion and testing of the well, the deck, facilities and pipelines will be fabricated and installed. Initial 
production on the project is anticipated during the second quarter of 2017.
MENA
During the first half of the year, the Company expanded its capabilities and activities in the MENA regions in order to pursue 
its objective of acquiring onshore leases with oil reserves, both developed/producing and undeveloped, that hold significant 
development, exploitation and exploration potential.
In February 2016, the Company announced the appointments of Mr. Murray Hawkes and Mr. John Rees as Chief Operating 
Officer and VP Technical, respectively, of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Petsec Energy (Middle Eastern) Limited. 
Mr. Hawkes also took on the role of Yemen General Manager, focussing on reactivating field activities in Yemen, including 
the re-start of production from the newly acquired An Nagyah Oilfield in Damis (Block S-1). Mr. Hawkes and Mr. Rees both 
have significant managerial experience overseeing the delivery of major oil and gas projects, and extensive contacts in the 
MENA region which will enhance the Company’s capabilities and expansion of activities in the region.
In  the  second  half  of  2016,  the  activities  for  the  Company  in  MENA  are  focussed  on  preparations  for  the  re-start  of 
production from the recently acquired An Nagyah Oilfield with the aim of ensuring that the Company is ready for production 
once the political situation allows.
The  political  situation  in  Yemen  continues  to  evolve  and  is  progressing  towards  a  resolution  of  the  conflict.  The 
internationally  recognised  Government  continues  to  prepare  for  the  re-start  of  crude  exports  from  Yemen  facilities.  It  is 
anticipated that Yemen oil production is likely to recommence by the fourth quarter of 2016.
Damis (Block S-1) Production Licence, Republic of Yemen  
Petsec: 100% working interest (82.5% participating interest)
The Company announced on 5 February 2016 a further significant expansion of its oil and gas interests in Yemen with the 
acquisition of entities holding a 100% working interest (82.5% participating interest) and operational control of the Damis 
(Block S-1) Production Licence.
Damis  (Block  S-1)  is  located  approximately  80  kilometres  to  the  southwest  of  Block  7  and  holds  five  sizeable  oil  and  gas 
discoveries – the developed and productive (until suspended in 2014), An Nagyah Oilfield, and a further four undeveloped oil 
and gas fields – Osaylan, An Naeem, Wadi Bayhan, and Harmel.
The four undeveloped fields hold substantial oil and gas resources, in excess of 34 million barrels of oil and 550 Bcf of gas 1 
which will be a source of future growth of reserves and production for the Company.
The  block  contains  significant  existing  infrastructure,  including  surface  facilities  with  a  capacity  to  process  up  to  20,000 
barrels of oil per day (bopd) and an 80,000 bopd pipeline, which joins the 300,000 BOPD Marib export pipeline to the Ras Isa 
terminal on the Red Sea Coast.
The An Nagyah Oilfield was shut-in at the end of February 2014 following the declaration of Force Majeure by the previous 
operator due to the political issues in Yemen and the resulting inability to ship oil for the An Nagyah oilfield from the export 
pipeline terminus on the west coast of Yemen. The field was producing at a rate of over 5,600 bopd prior to its being shut-in.
It  is  Petsec’s  intention  to  restart  production  as  early  as  the  political  situation  allows.  The  production  facility  has  been 
maintained  during  the  shut-in  period  and  preparations  are  underway  for  the  re-start  of  production  with  the  initiation  of 
maintenance  on  access  roads  within  the  facility,  with  a  view  to  the  delivery  of  crude  either  by  pipeline  or  trucking  or  a 
combination of both.

Directors’ Report (continued) 
For the six months ended 30 June 2016
4.  Review of operations (continued) 
Block 7, Al Barqa Permit, Republic of Yemen  
Petsec: 35% working interest (29.75% participating interest)
Block  7  is  an  onshore  exploration  permit  covering  an  area  of  5,000  square  kilometres  (1,235,527  acres)  located 
approximately 340 kilometres east of Sana’a, the capital of Yemen.
Petsec currently holds a non-operating 35% working interest (29.75% participating interest) in the Block 7 Joint Venture and 
has an agreement with Oil Search Limited (ASX: OSH) to acquire its 40% working interest (34% participating interest) in the 
block. The Company now expects to conclude the acquisition of the Oil Search interest in Block 7 towards the end of 2016 
following the announcement of a peace agreement. The acquisition which involves acquiring all the shares of its subsidiary, 
Oil  Search  (ROY)  Limited,  will  increase  Petsec  Energy’s  overall  working  interest  in  the  block  to  75%  (63.75%  participating 
interest). On completion of the transaction Petsec Energy will assume operatorship of the block.
The Company’s first objective in this block is to bring the two suspended discovery wells of the Al Meashar Oilfield (target 
resource of 11 MMbbl 1) into production. In 2011, short-term testing of the wells delivered flow rates ranging from 200 to 
1,000  bopd.  Analysis  of  this  data  suggests  cleanup  of  the  reservoir  is  likely  to  result  in  stabilised  production  rates  over  a 
longer production period.
Well engineering and cost estimates of the re-entry programme for both wells on the Al Meashar Oilfield are complete and 
will be followed by a tendering process for equipment and services.

5.  Events subsequent to balance date 
Subsequent to 30 June 2016, the Group entered into a Secured Convertible Note Facility under which US$5 million (Tranche 
1) can be drawn down on or before 31 December 2016. Under the facility additional draw downs in two tranches of US$5 
million each are available to the Group to facilitate the restart of production of the An Nagyah Oilfield on the Damis (Block S-
1) Production Licence, and the expansion of its MENA production asset portfolio. These additional funds are subject to an 
improvement  in  the  operating  conditions  in  the  Republic  of  Yemen  that  permits  the  production  of  oil  and  gas  at  certain 
rates. If however, the operating conditions in Yemen do not materialise, the Group has committed to alternative additional 
funding to meet its expected expenditures. 
Other than any matter disclosed, there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of 
this  report  any  item,  transaction  or  event  of  a  material  and  unusual  nature  likely,  in  the  opinion  of  the  directors  of  the 
Company,  to  affect  significantly  the  operations  of  the  consolidated  entity,  the  results  of  those  operations,  or  the  state  of 
affairs of the consolidated entity, in future years.

Condensed notes to the consolidated interim financial statements 
For the six months ended 30 June 2016
1.  Reporting entity
Petsec  Energy  Ltd  (the  “Company”)  is  a  company  domiciled  in  Australia.  These  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial 
statements (“interim financial statements”) as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “consolidated entity”).
The  consolidated  annual financial  report  of  the  consolidated  entity  for  the year  ended  31 December  2015  is available  upon 
request from the Company’s registered office at Level 13, 1 Alfred St, Sydney NSW 2000 or at http://www.petsec.com.au.
The  interim  financial  statements  are  presented  in  United  States  dollars  which  is  the  consolidated  entity’s  choice  of 
presentation currency.
2.   Basis of accounting
These interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the 
International  Accounting  Standards  Board.  They  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  required  for  a  complete  set  of  IFRS 
financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant 
to  an  understanding  of  the  changes  in  the  consolidated  entity’s  financial  position  and  performance  since  the  last  annual 
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
These interim financial statements were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on 25 August 2016.
The  consolidated  entity  is  of  a  kind  referred  to  in  ASIC  Corporations  (Rounding  in  Financial/Directors’  Reports)  Instrument 
2016/191 dated 24 March 2016 and in accordance with the Class Order, amounts in the financial report have been rounded off 
to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.
3.
Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied by the consolidated entity in this consolidated interim financial report are the same as those 
applied by the consolidated entity in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4.  Use of judgements and estimates
In  preparing  these  interim  financial  statements,  management  has  made  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the consolidated entity’s accounting policies and the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
Measurement of fair values
A  number  of  the  consolidated  entity’s  accounting  policies  and  disclosures  require  the  determination  of  fair  value,  for  both 
financial  and  non-financial  assets  and  liabilities.  Fair  values  have  been  determined  for  measurement  and/or  disclosure 
purposes based on the following methods. The consolidated entity has applied fair value methodologies which approximate 
the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market 
participants at the measurement date.
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific 
to that asset or liability.
PETSEC ENERGY LTD
14
Condensed notes to the consolidated interim financial statements (continued) 
For the six months ended 30 June 2016
5.  Dry hole expense
The estimated recoverable amount of oil and gas assets is based on discounted cash flow projections which are based on a 
range of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change. Key assumptions include the ultimate prices realised on the 
sale  of  oil  and  gas  and  the  reserves  ultimately  recovered.  A  sustained  deterioration  in  prices  or  reduction  in  reserves  may 
result in further future asset impairments.
During the current period, the consolidated entity recognised total dry hole expense of US$46,000, mainly in association with 
the prior year’s U.S. exploration programme.
In the previous corresponding period, the consolidated entity recognised total dry hole expense of US$2,316,000 primarily in 
relation to the Ruth R. Bravanec, et al #1 well and the Holcombe #1 well drilled on the West Crab Lake and English Bayou Deep 
prospects, respectively.
6.
Income tax expense
Under Australian Accounting Standards, the consolidated entity is required to assess at each reporting period, the extent to 
which  deferred  tax  assets  in  respect  of  the  carry-forward  of  unused  tax  losses  and  temporary  differences  qualify  for 
recognition on the balance sheet based on current facts and circumstances, including projected future taxable profits.
Historically,  no  deferred  tax  assets  have  been  recognised  in  relation  to  the  consolidated  entity’s  operations  as  they  do  not 
qualify  for  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  until  such  time  that  it  is  probable  that  future  taxable  profits  will  be  available 
against which unused tax losses and temporary differences in the relevant tax jurisdictions can be utilised.
No tax expense/(benefit) was recognised for the current period (previous corresponding period: Nil).
7.   Earnings per share
The Company has only one type of security, being ordinary shares, included in the basic earnings per share calculation.
There are no outstanding options under the Employee Option Plan.
During  the  current  period, no  options  were  granted  or  forfeited,  and  no  options  were  exercised  and  converted  to  ordinary 
shares.
Basic earnings/(loss) per share
The calculation of basic earnings/(loss) per share at 30 June 2016 was based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
of  US$5,140,000  (Six  months  to  30  June  2015:  Loss  of  US$3,693,000)  and  a  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares 
outstanding  during  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  of  234,301,190  (Six  months  ended  30  June  2015:  231,244,503), 
calculated as follows:
Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders
Loss for the period
Weighted average number of shares (basic)

The shares were issued to the Trustee of the ESP on behalf of the key management personnel and under the terms of the ESP 
at  a  price  of  A$0.20  per  share,  being  the  minimum  issue  price  under  the  terms  of  the  ESP.  The  funds  for  the  shares  was 
provided to the key management personnel by the Company through an interest free limited recourse loan under the terms of 
the loan scheme under the ESP, which provides that if the borrower defaults on the loan the Company shall accept the shares

Share-based payments (continued)
The expected volatility is based on historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the shares 
and options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
Shares and options are granted under a service condition and minimum share price hurdles. Such conditions are not taken into 
account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received, however, are considered in assumptions about the 
number of shares and options that are expected to become exercisable.

12.  Legal matters and contingencies
The  consolidated  entity  is  a  defendant  from  time  to  time  in  legal  proceedings.  Where  appropriate  the  consolidated 
entity takes legal advice. The consolidated entity does not consider that the outcome of any other current proceedings 
is likely to have a material effect on its operations or financial position.
The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other 
substances  and  materials  produced  or  used  in  connection  with  oil  and  natural  gas  operations  were  subject  to 
regulation under U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and 
environment. To date, expenditure related to complying with these laws and for remediation of existing environmental 
contamination has not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the consolidated entity.
The Company’s U.S. subsidiary, Petsec Energy Inc. (“PEI”) is required to provide bonding or security for the benefit of 
U.S.  regulatory  authorities  in  relation  to  its  obligations  to  pay  lease  rentals  and  royalties,  the  plugging  and 
abandonment  of  oil  and  natural  gas  wells,  and  the  removal  of  related  facilities.  As  of  30  June  2016,  PEI  was 
contingently  liable  for  US$3,601,000  of  surety  and  supplemental  bonds  (December  2015:  US$3,601,000)  issued 
through  a  surety  company  to  secure  those  obligations.  At  balance  date,  US$3,601,000  of  these  bonds  were 
collateralised by cash (December 2015: US$3,601,000).
13.  Related Parties
Arrangements with related parties continue to be in place. For details on these arrangements refer to the 2015 Annual 
Report.
14.  Dividends
No  interim  dividend  is  to  be  paid  on  the  ordinary  shares  (previous  corresponding  period:  Nil).  No  dividend  or 
distribution plans are currently in operation.
15.  Subsequent Events
Subsequent  to  30  June  2016,  the  Group  entered  into  a  Secured  Convertible  Note  Facility  under  which  US$5  million 
(Tranche  1)  can  be  drawn  down  on  or  before  31  December  2016.  Under  the  facility  additional  draw  downs  in  two 
tranches of US$5 million each are available to the group to facilitate the restart of production of the An Nagyah Oilfield 
on  the  Damis  (Block  S-1)  Production  Licence,  and  the  expansion  of  its  MENA  production  asset  portfolio.  These 
additional funds are subject to an improvement in the operating conditions in the Republic of Yemen that permits the 
production of oil and gas at certain rates. If however, the operating conditions in Yemen do not materialise, the Group 
has committed to alternative additional funding to meet its expected expenditures.

Independent auditor’s review report to the members of Petsec Energy Ltd 
Report on the financial report 
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial report of Petsec Energy Ltd (“the 
Company”), which comprises the consolidated interim balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, 
consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, consolidated interim statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated interim statement of cash flows for the interim period ended 
on that date, notes 1 to 15 comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information and the directors’ declaration of the Group comprising the company and 
the entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or from time to time during the interim period.  
Directors’ responsibility for the interim financial report  
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the interim financial report 
that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of the interim financial report that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
Auditor’s responsibility   
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial report based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 
2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order 
to state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter 
that makes us believe that the interim financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations 
Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 
2016 and its performance for the interim period ended on that date; and complying with 
Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations 
Regulations 2001. As auditor of Petsec Energy Ltd, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with 
the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report. 
A review of an interim financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Independence 
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.

network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG

Conclusion  
 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes 
 
us believe that the interim financial report of Petsec Energy Ltd is not in accordance with the 
 
Corporations Act 2001, including:
