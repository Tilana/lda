Quarterly Report
June 2016
Altech secures another quality cornerstone 
investor
During  the  quarter  the  Company  secured  another  quality 
cornerstone investor, MAA Group Berhad (MAAG). MAAG is a 
Malaysian  publicly  listed  insurance,  investment,  credit  and 
finance  group  with  total  assets  of  RM1.45  billion  and  annual 
turnover of RM484 million. MAAG has agreed to subscribe to $1 
million  of  Altech  shares,  subject  to  the  approval  of  Altech 
shareholders.  Altech  had  previously  agreed  with  MAAG  for 
participation in the March 2016 share placement, however its 
participation was subject to the completion by MAAG of internal 
governance requirements and due diligence processes, which 
have now been satisfied.
A total of 11,627,907 shares will be issued to MAAG at $0.086 per 
share, which was the March 2016 share placement price. The 
issue  of  the  shares  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  Altech 
shareholders because Tunku Ya'acob bin Tunku Tan Sri Abdullah 
(a non-executive director of Altech) is the executive chairman and 
a majority shareholder of MAAG. 
Upon approval of the share issue, MAAG will hold approximately 
6%  of  the  issued  shares  of  Altech.  Melewar  International 
Investment  Company  Limited,  a  company  also  controlled  by 
Tunku Ya'acob bin Tunku Tan Sri Abdullah, will hold approximately 
9% of the Company. 
The share issue to MAAG will bring the total amount raised by 
the  Company  during  the  quarter  to  approximately  $5  million 
(including  $2  million  from  the  sale  of  an  exploration  licence 
E70/3923). All funds raised will be applied towards finalising the 
detailed  design  of  Altech's  proposed  Malaysia  high  purity 
alumina (HPA) plant, finalising debt funding for the HPA project, 
and for general working capital purposes. 
Altech managing director, Mr Iggy Tan said, “We are very excited 
to have a cornerstone investor with the pedigree of MAAG join our 
share register. Altech continues to be most appreciative of the 
support for the Company and its HPA project by Tunku Ya'acob bin 
Tunku Tan Sri Abdullah and his associated companies”, Mr Tan 
concluded.

Altech presents at the 3rd International 
Sapphire Industry Technology Expo
During the quarter the Company attended the 3rd International 
Sapphire  Industry  Technology  Exhibition  (Sapphire  Expo)  in 
Shenzhen, China. The Sapphire Expo is an annual trade show 
held  over  three  days  (22-24  June  2016),  which  attracts 
hundreds  of  sapphire  industry  participants  from  around  the 
world.  Participants 
included  sapphire  glass  and  wafer 
manufacturers, sapphire substrate producers, high purity alumina 
suppliers,  and  importantly,  representatives  from  the  LED 
lighting  and 
lithium-ion  battery  manufacturing  sectors. 
Altech's attendance  and  presentation  at  the  Sapphire  Expo 
was  an  opportunity  to  showcase  the  advanced  stage  of  its 
Malaysian  high  purity  alumina 
(HPA)  project,  and  build 
international  brand  awareness  for  Altech's  proposed  HPA 
product  – 
to  synthetic  sapphire 
production.  As  previously announced,  Altech  executed  a  10-
year  off-take  sales arrangement with Mitsubishi Corporation's 
Australian  subsidiary,  Mitsubishi  Australia  Ltd  (Mitsubishi)  for 
100%  of  HPA  production  from  its  proposed  Malaysian  HPA 
plant.  The  current  forecast  demand  growth  profile  for  HPA 
indicates  that  near  term  future  demand  is  well  in  excess  of 
current and known planned supply capacity increases.

HPA demand driven by lithium-ion batteries
Following its announcement regarding the strong interest shown 
in  the  Company  as  an  emerging  high  purity  alumina  (HPA) 
producer  during  the  12th  China  International  Battery  Fair,  the 
Company announced its 10-year forecast of global demand for 
HPA used in the lithium-ion battery manufacturing sector.
Altech  estimated  that  demand  for  HPA  from  lithium-ion  battery 
manufacturers will grow significantly over the next decade from 
forecast  usage  of  ~1,000tpa  in  2016  to  ~15,000tpa  in  2025; 
representing  an  annual  year-on-year  demand  growth  of 
approximately  30%  per  year.  In  order  to  meet  this  demand, 
additional  HPA  production  capacity  equivalent  to  four  (4)  of 
Altech's proposed  HPA  plant  would  need  to  be  constructed 
and  commissioned during the forecast period, as illustrated in 
Figure 3 below.
Figure 3. Global separator high purity alumina demand forecast
Altech generates interest at International 
Battery Fair
During the quarter the Company generated strong interest as an 
emerging high purity alumina (HPA) producer at the 12th China 
International Battery Fair (CIBF) in Shenzhen, China (May 24-26, 
2016). The CIBF is held every two years and is a significant event 
for the lithium-ion battery industry. There is a growing application 
for HPA in lithium-ion batteries, where it is used as a coating on the 
ceramic  separator  sheets  that  divide  the  cathode  and  anode 
electrodes within the battery. The lithium-ion battery separator 
sheet membrane acts as a critical safety barrier inside the battery. 
HPA-coated  separators  withstand  unusually  high  temperature 
incursions, increase battery separator shrinkage temperatures, 
reduce  flammability  during  thermal  runaways  and  thus  make 
lithium-ion  batteries  much  safer.  HPA-coated  separators  also 
increase  battery  discharge  rates,  lower  self-discharge,  and 
lengthen battery life cycles. Based on discussions with various 
lithium-ion battery separator sheet manufacturers at the CIBF, 
electric  vehicle  manufacturers  are  demanding  lithium-ion 
batteries  with  99.99%  (4N)  HPA-coated  separators.  These 
manufacturers are reporting usage of between 40-120g of HPA 
per  battery  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  According  to  CIBF  delegate 
sources, 99.99% (4N) HPA is currently being supplied to Chinese 
lithium-ion battery separator sheet manufacturers at RMB180 to 
RMB200/kg (US$27 to US$30/kg). This supports the long-term 
price assumption for HPA used in Altech's bankable feasibility 
study (BFS), which  is a conservative estimate of US$23/kg. The 
particle size of the HPA product for lithium-ion battery separator 
sheets is required to be ultra-fine, less than 2 microns, which 
Altech's proposed HPA plant in Malaysia is designed to achieve.

Altech sells EL for $2 million cash
Altech  executed  an  agreement  with  Dana  Shipping  and 
Trading S.A. (Dana) for the sale of its exploration licence (EL) 
E70/3923 (excluding  mining 
lease  M70/1334,  owned  by 
Altech)  at  Meckering  for  two  million  dollars.  Having  already 
received  a  non-refundable  cash  deposit  of  $250,000,  the 
balance  of  $1.75m  was  paid  upon 
the  grant  of  Altech's 
M70/1334,  which  occurred during the quarter. 
The  EL  is  surplus  to  Altech's  feedstock  requirements  for 
its  proposed  HPA  plant.  Feedstock  for  the  plant  will  be 
sourced 
an 
11Mt  Indicated  Mineral  Resource,  representing  in  excess  of 
250  years of supply  for  the  HPA  plant. Altech  continues  to 
hold 
tenements  E70/4852,  4856  and  4857  (pending)  at 
Meckering. 
Execution  of  the  agreement  also  settled  the  dispute  with 
Dana  over  the  Company's  termination  of  the  Kaolin  Mining 
Rights Deed (refer ASX announcement dated 29 March 2016 for 
details).

Meckering mining lease granted
Altech's  mining 
its  Meckering 
kaolin  deposit  was  granted  by  the  Department  of  Mines  and 
Petroleum (DMP)  on  19  May  2016.  The  grant  of  M70/1334 
allows  the Company  to  progress  to  the  next  stage  of  mine 
development,  which  is  the  submission  of  a  mining  proposal 
and a mine closure plan. 
Altech  managing  director  Mr  Iggy  Tan  said, “The  Company 
is delighted with the grant of the Meckering mining lease. 
"Altech can now  progress  to  the  next  stage  in  preparation 
for  mine development,  the  submission  of  what  will  be  a 
relatively straightforward mining proposal and mine closure plan.
“Upon  approval  of  these  items,  the  site  at  Meckering  will  be 
ready  for  the  development  of  the  campaign  mining  and 
container loading  operation  to  supply  feedstock  for  Altech's 
proposed Malaysian HPA plant. 
This marks another significant milestone in the  advancement 
of  the  Company's  HPA  project”,  Mr  Tan concluded.

Altech updates kaolin resource for Meckering 
mining lease
Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced an updated 
Indicated Mineral Resource of 11 million tonnes (Mt) of kaolin at 
82.7%  ISO  brightness  for  its  Meckering  deposit,  which  sits 
within its 100%-owned mining lease (ML) M70/1334. The  ML, 
which  was  granted  on  19  May  2016  is  estimated  to contain 
sufficient  kaolin  mineral  resources  for  over  250  years  of 
feedstock supply for the Company's proposed high purity alumina 
(HPA) plant at Johor, Malaysia. The updated Mineral Resource for 
M70/1334 allows the Company to finalise the mine development, 
which includes the submission of a mining proposal and a mine 
closure  plan. The  estimation  of  a  mineral  reserve  is  currently 
being finalised following grade control drilling that commenced on 
1  April  2016.  At  Meckering,  Altech  is  planning  to  mine 
approximately 120,000 tonnes of kaolin once every three years in 
short two-month mining campaigns. The resultant raw kaolin ore 
will  be  stockpiled,  then  containerised  into  standard  shipping 
containers at the rate of around 40,000tpa (770t per week) and 
transported to Johor, Malaysia via the port of Fremantle, Western 
Australia for processing into HPA at the Company's proposed 
plant.
Altech managing director Mr Iggy Tan said, “The Company is 
delighted with the updated resource statement for our recently 
granted  ML.  Altech  can  now  progress  to  the  next  stage  in 
preparation for mine development, the submission of what will be 
a  relatively  straightforward  mining  proposal  and  mine  closure 
plan. Upon approval of these items, the site at Meckering will be 
ready for the development of the campaign mining and container 
loading  operation  to  supply  feedstock  for  Altech's  proposed 
Malaysian HPA plant. This marks another significant milestone in 
the  advancement  of  the  Company's  HPA  project”,  Mr  Tan 
concluded.

placement
Altech raises $10 million in oversubscribed 
share placement
Subsequent to quarter end the Company welcomed a number 
of  institutional investors onto its share register as a result of a 
AU$10  million 
(the 
Placement). Placement  shares  will  be  issued  at  14  cents  per 
share,  which  represents  a  14%  discount  to  the  price  of  the 
Company's  shares  at  the  close  of  trade  on  the  Australian 
Securities Exchange (ASX) on 21 July 2016.
Funds raised from the Placement will be applied to finalising the 
detailed  design  of  the  Company's  proposed  Malaysian  high 
purity  alumina  (HPA)  plant,  completion  of  independent  due 
diligence associated with finalising debt financing, closure of debt 
financing and for general working capital purposes.
Approximately 71.4 million new shares will be issued under the 
Placement in two tranches. An initial tranche of approximately 
39.2 million shares, in accordance with the Company's residual 
placement capacity under ASX Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.1A, will 
be settled on 3 August 2016. A second tranche for the balance 
of the shares  will  be  subject  to  shareholder  approval  at  a 
general  meeting  of  the  Company  to  be  convened  in  mid-
September 2016.
The  Company 
investment 
institutions  predominantly  from Australia,  New  Zealand,  Hong 
Kong and Asia have participated in the Placement and now join 
the  Company's  share  register.  The  Company  will  continue  to 
focus  on  building  institutional  support  for  its  HPA  project 
in  preparation  for  a  project  finance  equity  raising  that  will  be 
required once debt funding arrangements have been finalised.
Altech managing director, Mr Iggy Tan said, “The Company is 
extremely pleased with the quality and calibre of institutions that 
have joined our share register as part of the Placement. Most of 
the participants were surprised as to how advanced the Company 
is  with  its  HPA  project,  with  the  bankable  feasibility  study 
completed, off-take in place and the advanced nature of debt 
funding, all of which has transferred directly into demand for the 
Placement, which was subsequently heavily oversubscribed.
“Institutional  investor  representation  on  the  Company's  share 
register  has  increased  from  around  9%  to  closer  to  23% 
following the Placement, with plans to grow it over time”, Mr Tan 
concluded.

Perth stockbroking firm DJ Carmichael Pty Ltd and Empire Capital 
Partners with offices in Hong Kong and Perth were the respective 
lead and co-manager of the Placement. As the Company has 
already  conducted  a  share  purchase  plan  (SPP)  during  the 
proceeding 12-months (March 2016), the Company is unable to 
offer an SPP to existing shareholders as part of this capital raising 
(ASIC regulation of not more than $15,000 per shareholder via 
an SPP each 12 month period).
Breakaway Research Report
Altech featured in a research report titled “Excellent Progress 
on  the  Finance  and  Offtake  Front”  by  Breakaway  Research, 
which  was  released  during  the  quarter  and  is  available  for 
viewing  and  download  from  the  Company's  website.  In  the 
report, Breakaway provide  an  updated  indicative  valuation  of 
Altech,  with  a  risked Company  valuation  of  between  $40.5m 
and  $137.8m,  with  a midpoint of $89.1m, which is an increase 
of around 100% from its August  2015  valuation.  The  valuation 
equates  to  an  undiluted share price range of $0.23 to $0.78 
per share, with a midpoint of $0.50/share.
Altech participation at the AMEC
The  Company  exhibited  at  the  Association  of  Mining  and 
Exploration  Companies  (AMEC)  Convention,  which  was  held

Notes

The	  quarterly	  report	  provides	  a	  basis	  for	  informing	  the	  market	  how	  the	  entity’s	  
activities	  have	  been	  financed	  for	  the	  past	  quarter	  and	  the	  effect	  on	  its	  cash	  
position.	  	  An	  entity	  wanting	  to	  disclose	  additional	  information	  is	  encouraged	  to	  
do	  so,	  in	  a	  note	  or	  notes	  attached	  to	  this	  report.

agreement	  and	  there	  are	  conditions	  precedent	  which	  will	  change	  its	  percentage	  
interest	  in	  a	  mining	  tenement	  or	  petroleum	  tenement,	  it	  should	  disclose	  the	  
change	  of	  percentage	  interest	  and	  conditions	  precedent	  in	  the	  list	  required	  for	  
items	  6.1	  and	  6.2.
