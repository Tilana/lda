<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  26/24  Situation of human rights in Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other relevant international 
human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>resolution 91 and decisions 250/2002 and 275/2003 of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>its resolution 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>its resolutions 20/20 of 6 July 2012 and 23/21 of 14 June 2013, 
<i>Emphasizing </i>that everyone has the right to take part in the government of his or her 
</p>
<p>country, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and expressing grave concern 
that national elections in Eritrea have not been held since 1993, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating its deep concern </i>at the ongoing reports of grave violations of human 
rights by the Eritrean authorities against their own population and fellow citizens, including 
violation of civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights, and the 
alarming number of civilians fleeing Eritrea as a result of those violations, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with grave concern </i>the continued use by the Government of Eritrea of 
arbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado detention and in life-threatening 
conditions, of persons for suspected of evasion of national service, attempting to flee the 
country or having a family member who has fled, inability to produce identity documents, 
being a journalist, exercising the right to freedom of religion, being perceived as critical of 
the Government, and of those who return to the country, as well as those detained in the 
aftermath of the takeover on 21 January 2013 of the building housing the Ministry of 
Information, 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing grave concern </i>at the widespread use of indefinite conscription into 
national service, a system that constitutes forced labour, and the reported forced 
conscription of children under the age of 18 into military service, and regretting that the 
fear and experience of a lengthy national service causes large numbers of Eritreans to leave 
the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern also </i>at reports that the Government of Eritrea is also 
forcing persons to participate in its citizen militia, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his or her 
own, and to return to his or her country, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the participation of Eritrea in the second cycle of the universal periodic 
review, while regretting the lack of implementation by Eritrea of the recommendations 
made at its first review, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also </i>the efforts of Eritrea to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and 
to promote gender equality and progress on reducing and eliminating female genital 
mutilation, while stressing that sustainable social changes are linked with the establishment 
of a conducive political and legal environment,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the obligations of Eritrea under the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing continued concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Eritrea to 
cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea, including 
its refusal to allow the Special Rapporteur to visit the country, 
</p>
