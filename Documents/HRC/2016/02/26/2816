</p>

<p><i>Welcoming further</i> the Declaration of the Global African Diaspora Summit, held in 
Sandton, Johannesburg, on 25 May 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing the importance</i> of a consistent global effort to correct ongoing distortion of 
the facts around the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and 
economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices, 
which in turn generate more poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that the current economic and financial crisis and its 
consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the rise of 
extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated identity-related issues, 
and that in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, members of minorities, migrants, 
refugees and asylum seekers are still the main scapegoat of extremist political parties that 
have a xenophobic and racist agenda and that sometimes incite racial discrimination and 
violence against them, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining the importance</i> of removing legal obstacles and eliminating 
discriminatory practices that hamper some specific groups of individuals from fully 
participating in the public and political life of the countries they live in, including legal and 
practical obstacles such as discriminatory regulations regarding voter registration, the lack 
of identification documents, administrative and financial barriers, and discrimination in 
access to citizenship, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed </i>by the use of the Internet and social media by extremist groups and 
individuals to disseminate racist ideas and propagate racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the Internet and social media can also be a useful tool for 
preventing the spread of racist ideologies by extremist political parties, groups and 
movements, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the use of print, audiovisual and electronic media, including the Internet, 
and any other means to incite acts of national, racial or religious violence, xenophobia or 
related intolerance and discrimination against any religion, as well as the targeting of 
religious symbols and venerated persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that despite the immense potential of sport in promoting 
tolerance, racism in sport is still a serious problem, 
</p>
<p><i>Appreciating </i>the contributions of the Durban follow-up mechanisms to the tenth 
anniversary commemorations, as well as the contributions of non-governmental 
organizations, which were broad-based, regionally balanced and consistent with the 
objectives of the commemoration, </p>
<p>1.<i> Welcomes</i> the efforts made by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in its 
constructive work aimed at the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference and the 
political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate 
the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, including by 
increasing efforts to complement the work of other Durban follow-up mechanisms with a 
view to achieving better coordination and synergy with other human rights mechanisms, 
thereby avoiding duplication of initiatives; </p>

xenophobia and related intolerance is a primary responsibility of States and, in this regard, 
recommends that States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)  Develop and implement national plans of action to combat racism and racial 
discrimination, and to promote diversity, equality, equity, social justice, equality of 
opportunity and the participation of all; These plans should aim at creating conditions for 
all to participate effectively in decision-making and realize civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights in all spheres of life on the basis of non-discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)  Consider linking their development programmes and priorities for the 
improvement of the socioeconomic conditions of individuals and groups experiencing 
racial discrimination, social exclusion and marginalization, and that these linkages should 
be reflected in, inter alia, States&#8217; reports for the universal periodic review mechanism of the 
Human Rights Council;

racial hierarchies and superiority;

programmes aimed at promoting equality and preventing and eliminating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;

<p>(<i>e</i>) Introduce into domestic criminal law a provision to the effect that the 
commission of an offence with racist or xenophobic motivation or aim constitutes an 
aggravating circumstance attracting heavier penalties and, in this connection, urges States 
to ensure that those responsible for crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation are 
prosecuted and adequately sanctioned, and that prompt, thorough and impartial

conflict; 
</p>

non-recurrence; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the setting up of projects at the national level by civil society 
groups with the support of public authorities, including the creation of a social network-
based platform targeting young people and aiming specifically at countering right-wing 
extremism and fostering a democratic culture; 
</p>

<p>8. <i>Encourages</i> States to use the opportunities provided by new technologies, 
including the Internet, to counter the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or 
hatred; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Deplores</i> the use of print, audiovisual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and any other means to incite acts of national, racial or religious violence, 
xenophobia or related intolerance and discrimination against any religion, as well as the 
targeting of religious symbols and venerated persons; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls</i> <i>on</i> States to strengthen measures to prevent racist and xenophobic 
incidents in major sporting events, including by individuals or groups of individuals linked 
to extremist movements and groups; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Urges</i> States, in cooperation with intergovernmental organizations, the 
International Olympic Committee and international and regional sports federations, to 
intensify the fight against racism in sport by, among other things, educating the youth of the 
world through sport practised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, 
which requires human understanding, tolerance, fair play and solidarity; 
</p>
<p>12.<i> Welcomes</i> <i>and acknowledges</i> the importance and significance of the work of 
the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent in examining the current 
situation and conditions and the extent of racism against Africans and people of African 
descent and, in that regard, takes note with appreciation of the report of the Working 
Group,<footnote name="3">A/HRC/21/60.  </footnote> and endorses the draft Programme of Action for the Decade for People of African
