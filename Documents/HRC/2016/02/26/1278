<p><b>  26/26  Promotion and protection of the human rights of peasants and

</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, </p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and all other 
relevant human rights instruments, </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010, 16/27 of 25 
March 2011 and 19/7 of 22 March 2012 on the right to food, and in particular Council 
resolution 21/19 of 27 September 2012 on the promotion and protection of the human rights 
of peasants and other people working in rural areas, </p>
<p><i>Determined</i> to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the imperative need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 
2015 in order to contribute to making the right to development a reality for everyone, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 66/222 of 22 December 2011, in which the 
Assembly declared 2014 the International Year of Family Farming, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> that hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, 
and that in the rural population it is those who produce food who suffer disproportionately, 
and alarmed that 75 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, particularly 
in developing countries, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, as 
well as subsistence farmers, and that they are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, 
malnutrition, discrimination and exploitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that livelihoods in rural areas are disproportionately affected by 
poverty, climate change and lack of access to land, water, development and scientific 
progress,
