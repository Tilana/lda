SUMMING UP

1.      
Ladies and Gentleman Assessors. We have come to the final stage of this trial. You were listening to all witnesses, State Counsel and the accused. Now it is my duty to give the summing up to you. In the summing up I will be directing you on matters of law, which you must accept and act upon. Regarding the facts of the case, I do not wish to give an opinion, but if I give so you may accept or reject. You are not bound as in matters of law. In brief you have to accept my direction on law and you can judge independently when it comes to facts of the case. Because you are the judge of facts.

2.      
Both Counsel for State and the accused made their submissions. That is their duty. The prosecutor to submit how she proved the case and the accused to say that the case is not proved. You are not bound by their submission. You are the representative of this society in this trial. After assessing all evidence you must decide whether this accused is guilty or not guilty to the offence he is charged.

3.      
After, all these submissions you will be asked to retire for your verdict. Your verdict should be either guilty or not guilty. You will not be asked to give reasons for your decision. Your opinion can be unanimous or divided. It will be preferable if it is unanimous but the decision has to be your own decision. Your opinions are not binding on me but it will be persuasive. I will give them the greatest weight when I deliver my judgment.

4.      
In criminal cases the standard of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law, that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in the case. The burden remains throughout the trial and it never shifts. There is no obligation upon the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our system of criminal justice, an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. This is a golden rule.

5.      
The standard proof in a criminal case is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means that you must be satisfied so that you feel sure of guilt of the accused person before you express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused you must express an opinion that he is not guilty. You may only express an opinion that he is guilty, if you are satisfied of that you are sure that he committed the offence alleged.

6.      
As I informed you in my opening address, your decision must base exclusively upon the evidence which you have heard in the Court, and upon nothing else. You must absolutely disregard anything you might have heard about this case outside of this court room. It is important that you must decide the fact without prejudice or sympathy to either accused or the State. One of my duties is to find the facts based on the evidence, and to apply the law to those facts, without fear, favour or ill will.

7.      
I wish to address you especially on certain incidents happened during the trial. Please do not give your attention to those incidents, those are not the evidence in this trial. You are advised to consider only the admissible evidence and decide whether the prosecution proved the charge of Murder. I request you to disregard certain conduct of the accused during the trial while considering the evidence against him.

8.      
The accused Ashwin Chand stand charged for the offence of Murder.

9.      
The offence of murder has three elements which prosecution must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt. They are:

(i)     
That the accused did an unlawful act.
(ii)    
That this unlawful act caused the death of the victim.
(iii)   
That the accused acted with malice aforethought.

10.     
I will explain these three elements to you in simple language. Unlawful act means something done by a person that is against law. If I give you an example, you attack a person with knife or similar to that without legal justification.

11.     
The second element of the offence of murder is that the said unlawful act caused the death of the victim. The prosecutor should prove a death of a person and then the death was caused by the accused by an unlawful act. The law requires a link between the unlawful act and death. In other words, the victim had died of the injury caused by the accused. Usually the unlawful act causes an injury which is the sole cause of death. But it is sufficient if it is an operating or substantive cause of death.

12.     
The 3rd element that must be proved for the crime of murder is that the person who caused the death of another by an unlawful act did so with "malice aforethought". This is a legal term which describes a particular intention or state of mind.

13.     
English Lexicon says malice aforethought means "with intention of committing a crime.(especially murder or grievous harm)

14.     
It is an intention to cause death or grievous harm to the victim or knowledge that death or grievous harm would probably be caused.

15.     
Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally committed an unlawful act which resulted in the death of the victim.

16.     
In this case the prosecution did not provide any witness who had seen the incident. Even the accused did not admit that he committed the offence. I may simply summarize the evidence briefly. The belt of the accused was found on the neck of the deceased. The accused also admits that he was there at the scene of crime but he denies the involvement in murder, further he says it was done by one Pravin Kumar. State Counsel called Pravin Kumar and led the evidence to the fact that he was at Lautoka with two others at the relevant time. Others also confirmed that he was with them. In this case deceased and the accused are not strangers. All of them are known and related to each other. 

17.     
Briefly saying there are evidence to say that the accused was at the scene of crime and his waist belt had been used as a tool apart from the knife. But there is no direct evidence that the accused committed the act of murder.

18.     
The accused totally denies the incident but when cross-examining the witness Pravin Kumar he said that he was there and the act was done by Pravin Kumar.

19.     
This is a case where you don't find an eye witness but the prosecution depends on circumstantial evidence. It is like a jigsaw puzzle. A single piece will not give you a whole picture but if you put all together you may see a picture. Prosecution submitted that she had arranged all the pieces and invite you to see a full picture. But the accused says that he is not in the picture. It is up to you to arrange all the evidence before you and come to a conclusion whether there is evidence against the accused for murder or not.

20.     
In this trial the accused completely denies his involvement in the act of murder. Further there is no evidence before the court to 

discuss about other mitigating circumstances such as grave and sudden provocation, sudden fight, self defence, knowledge, etc thus I will not discuss and address about those defences to you.

21.     
Now I will briefly summarize the evidence of the witnesses who gave evidence in court.

When the Doctor explaining the possibility of causing these injury he said the 1st injury could be possible by a punch and the 2nd injury could be possible by a blunt object.

When the State Counsel questioned the Doctor explained that if it is caused by stepping on the fingers with boots it could have caused related injuries on the skin around and could have caused unbearable pain. Since the accused was not with such pain and could be more possible with the paper clip.

40.     
The 18th witness called was Police Officer Wasu Dewan Nair. He was the witnessing officer at the charging session.

42.     
With these 19 witnesses, Prosecutor closed the case for the Prosecution. Since there is no application made by the accused defence called and the accused was explained of his Rights. The accused exercised his Rights and elected to remain silent.

43.

44.     
I have explained you the law and legal principles. Further I have summarized the evidence as I see. It doesn't mean that you have to consider only my summary. You have to consider the entire evidence of all witnesses and come to your own conclusion.

You must find the accused guilty as charged. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt, and you are not sure of it. You must find the accused not guilty as charged.
