<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an 
official visit to the Republic of Korea from 29 May to 7 June 2013, at the invitation of the 
Government. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders 
in the Republic of Korea in the light of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter, &#8220;the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders). An examination of the legal framework in the country, institutional policies 
and mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights were of particular 
importance to this assessment. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister, Chung Hong-
won, the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice-Minister of Justice. She also met 
with officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Employment and Labour; Trade, 
Industry and Energy; National Defence; the Republic of Korea Navy; and the National 
Police Agency. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur met with members of the Legislative and 
Judiciary Committee and the Environment and Labour Committee within Parliament, as 
well as with the Supreme Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Supreme Court. She also had 
meetings with representatives of the Korea Communications Commission and the Korea 
Communications Standards Commission, and the Seoul Metropolitan Government, 
including one of the Human Rights Ombudspersons. The Special Rapporteur also met with 
the Chairperson, one of the Commissioners and a team from the National Human Rights 
Commission of Korea (NHRCK).  
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the Korean Electric Power 
Corporation (KEPCO) and the Hyundai Motor Company. She approached various other 
private companies for meetings but did not receive any other responses to her invitation. 
After the visit, she sent letters to these companies inviting them to submit information 
regarding general allegations and obtained a response from Samsung Electronics.  
</p>
<p>4. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Seoul, Ulsan, Miryang, Jeju Island 
and Gwangju and met with the Mayors of Miryang and Gwangju, as well as with the 
Gwangju regional office of NHRCK. She also met with the Head of the United Nations 
Development Programme in the country, representatives of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees and members of the diplomatic corps. The Special 
Rapporteur also had meetings with a wide range of defenders and activists.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Korea for 
extending an invitation to her and for its excellent cooperation throughout the visit. She 
would like to thank everyone who took the time to meet with her and shared their valuable 
experiences and insights, as well as those who helped organize the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. This is the first visit of the mandate holder to the Republic of Korea, a country that 
has gone through significant and rapid changes over the past decades. The country has 
achieved impressive rates of economic growth and, at the same time, has established a 
democratic foundation after a long period of authoritarianism.  
</p>
<p>7. The Republic of Korea was proclaimed in August 1948 after the end of the Second 
World War, and peace agreements left the country divided from the Democratic Republic 
of Korea by drawing a line along the 38th parallel in the Korean peninsula. The country 
received United Nations-backed support after it was invaded by the latter two years later. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>The Korean War ended in 1953 without a peace agreement, leaving the Republic of Korea 
technically at war with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea for more than fifty 
years. 
</p>
<p>8. After a long period of authoritarian regimes, the country went through a 
democratization process in the late 1980s. At this time, the political situation was marked 
by significant, large-scale and occasionally violent pro-democracy protests that opposed the 
country&#8217;s long-standing authoritarian rule. As a result of these protests, the authoritarian 
establishment saw its position weakened, and this was seized on by opposition leaders 
demanding democratic reforms. In June 1987, the ruling party&#8217;s presidential candidate 
proposed a far-reaching democratization plan that accepted all the opposition&#8217;s key 
demands. The Constitution was put to a popular referendum, where it was approved, and 
was formally adopted on 29 October 1987.  
</p>
<p>9. Since then, the Republic of Korea has been a key player in the region. It is a member 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and of the Group of 20 
(G-20). However, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the strained relations with the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have played an important role in shaping the legal, 
political and institutional framework of the country. The Cheonan incident in 2010 and the 
nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in early 2013 are 
examples of the latest tensions between the two neighbours.  
</p>
<p><b> III.  Legal and institutional framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Republic of Korea has a well-established legal, institutional and administrative 
framework and is a party to seven of the international human rights treaties and 
conventions. Article 6 of the Constitution provides for the incorporation of treaties and 
rules of international law. However, the following treaties have yet to be ratified: the 
International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance; the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty; the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure; and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>11. Mindful of the fact that the ratification of international human rights treaties may 
require certain degree of harmonization of the domestic legal framework, the Special 
Rapporteur encouraged the Government during her visit to ratify the United Nations treaties 
to which it is not yet a party, in particular the International Convention on the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>12. The Republic of Korea is currently a member of the Council and was reviewed 
under the universal periodic review in October 2012. During the review, 70 
recommendations were made, of which the Government accepted 42. The remaining 28 
recommendations were not rejected, but the Government took note of them. Relevant 
recommendations which were not accepted included those encouraging the Government to 
ratify the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families; to establish mechanisms specifically to monitor the use of force by security </p>

</b></p>
<p>forces against peaceful protesters; and to amend or more clearly define provisions in the 
National Security Act.1 
</p>
<p>13. In March 2008, the Republic of Korea extended an open invitation to the Council&#8217;s 
special procedures. The country has received the visit of the Special Rapporteurs on the 
human rights of migrants (2006, A/HRC/4/24/Add.2) and on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (1995, E/CN.4/1996/39/Add.1, and 2010, 
A/HRC/17/27/Add.2 and Corr.1). The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
implement the recommendations of the special procedures and use them to strengthen the 
legal, policy and administrative framework.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National level 
</b></p>
<p>14. In this section, the Special Rapporteur provides observations on domestic legislation 
deemed to have an impact on the situation of human rights defenders in the Republic of 
Korea.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Constitution is a product of the country&#8217;s democratization process in the late 
1980s and based on six basic principles: the people&#8217;s sovereignty; the separation of powers; 
the pursuit of peaceful and democratic unification of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea and the Republic of Korea; the pursuit of international peace and cooperation; the 
rule of law; and the State&#8217;s responsibility to promote the welfare of its citizens.2 
</p>
<p>16. The Constitution provides for basic freedoms, including but not limited to: freedom 
of speech and the press, and of assembly and association (art. 21, para. 1); equality of all 
citizens before the law (art. 11, para. 1); the right to liberty of the person (art. 12, para. 1); 
the right to be free from torture (art. 12, para. 2); and freedom of religion (art. 20).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Laws related to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>17. Freedom of expression is explicitly enshrined in article 21 of the Constitution, which 
does not allow any licensing or censorship of speech and the press. However, the Special 
Rapporteur points to serious challenges when it comes to guaranteeing the right in practice 
and recalls some of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression when he visited the country in 2010. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Laws regarding defamation  
</i>18. The Special Rapporteur was concerned at the existence of an important limitation to 
freedom of expression contained in article 21, paragraph 4, of the Constitution, which states 
that: &#8220;Neither speech nor the press shall violate the honour or rights of other persons nor 
undermine public morals or social ethics. Should speech or the press violate the honour or 
rights of other persons, claims may be made for the damage resulting therefrom.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>19. According to this, defamation is a criminal offence, which carries heavy fines and 
prison sentences, and it is also provided for in the Civil Act, which establishes non-criminal 
sanctions to redress any damage to an individual&#8217;s reputation or name.

</p>
<p>20. Chapter 33 of the Criminal Act provides for inter alia a prison sentence of up to five 
years if the person alleged &#8220;false facts&#8221; (art. 307). There is a clause which stipulates that, if 
the alleged facts are true and solely for the public interest, the act shall not be punishable 
(art. 310). Defamation through printed materials whereby facts are alleged with the intent to 
defame another individual can result in a prison sentence of up to three years or a fine of up 
to 7 million won (approx. 6,250 United States dollars) or, if the alleged fact is false, 
imprisonment of up to seven years, suspension of qualifications for up to 10 years or a 
maximum fine of 15 million won (approx. 13,450 US$) (art. 309, para. 2).  
</p><p>21. The Special Rapporteur recalls the observations and recommendations made by 
Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
(A/HRC/17/27/Add.2, paras. 21&#8211;28, and Corr.1) and calls for the removal of defamation as 
an offence from the Criminal Act. She is of the view that criminalization of defamation has 
a chilling effect and leads to self-censorship by human rights defenders, which amounts to a 
considerable constraint of the space in which to exercise the fundamental right to freedom 
of expression &#8212; a key right to claim other rights. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Freedom of expression online 
</i>22. The situation of freedom of expression online is particularly pertinent in the 
Republic of Korea given its consistent rankings as one of the countries with the greatest 
number of Internet users, estimated in 2012 at some 84 per cent of the population.3 The 
country has a vibrant and multifaceted spectrum of bloggers, online journalists and others 
who post information on the Internet, some of whom work on human rights-related issues. 
However, as with traditional media outlets, the Special Rapporteur notes that tensions 
continue with regard to the censoring and control of content, and prosecution of those who 
publish materials online on sensitive topics or express dissenting views.  
</p>
<p>23. There are two main laws that relate specifically to the regulation of freedom of 
expression online, the Framework Act on Telecommunications, which aims to &#8220;promote 
public welfare through the effective management of telecommunications and promotion of 
their development&#8221; (art. 1); and the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication 
Network Utilization and Information Protection (&#8220;Network Act&#8221;), which aims to ensure that 
&#8220;information and communications networks are used in a sounder and safer way&#8221; (art. 1).   
</p><p>24. Regarding defamation online, in 2001 a new provision was introduced into the 
Network Act (art. 70) to complement article 309 of the Criminal Act. This provision 
stipulates that a person who defames another by disclosing a fact to the public via the 
Internet is punishable by imprisonment, with or without prison labour, for up to three years 
or by a fine of up to 20 million won (approx. 18,000 US$). If the disclosed fact is proved to 
be false, the punishment is imprisonment with prison labour for up to seven years, 
suspension of qualification of up to ten years, or a fine of up to 50 million won (45,000 
US$). Under article 310 of the Criminal Act, if the published information is true and in the 
public interest, its publisher will not be punished. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about reports indicating that 
defamation suits are filed even when statements are true and made in the public interest. 
Such legal actions are reportedly used to target those who express dissenting views and 
criticism of public authorities, including human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>26. The Network Act also contains various provisions regarding the regulation of online 
content that allow the alleged victim of defamation to request the deletion of the

<p>information or publish a rebuttable statement and, upon this request, the service providers 
to block access to content and take temporary discretionary measures. This matter was 
extensively dealt with by the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression (A/HRC/17/27/Add.2, paras. 38&#8211;42, and Corr.1), who made recommendations 
that the Special Rapporteur would like to underline. She is worried that these provisions 
could encourage self-censorship among defenders and contribute to an excessively cautious 
attitude on the part of online service providers. In this connection, she would like to recall 
some of the relevant provisions contained in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, 
namely articles 6 and 8, which deal with access to information and the right to discuss and 
advocate new human rights ideas. 
</p>
<p>27. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur raised concerns about the control of online 
expression and dissemination of information of public interest by defenders, particularly 
through the work of the Korea Communications Commission and Korea Communications 
Standards Commission, which are bodies operating under the Government. She met with 
the two institutions and expressed her concern that vaguely defined concepts, such as 
&#8220;harming the public interest&#8221; or &#8220;false communication&#8221;, are being used by a Government-
controlled body to block Internet content and unduly restrict the exercise of a fundamental 
right and the use of a key tool, both of which are essential in the work of human rights 
defenders.4 The Special Rapporteur was discouraged by the fact that both institutions 
appeared unwilling to consider her observations in this regard during her meeting with 
them, and did not cooperate during the dialogue as was expected. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) The National Security Act 
</i>28. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was concerned about certain aspects of the 
National Security Act which, despite the fact that it has been amended on several occasions, 
still appears seriously problematic for the exercise of freedom of expression and the work 
of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>29. Article 37, paragraph 2, of the Constitution establishes that: &#8220;The freedoms and 
rights of citizens may be restricted by law only when necessary for national security, the 
maintenance of law and order, or for public welfare. Even when such restriction is imposed, 
no essential aspect of the freedom or right shall be violated.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>30. The purpose of the Act, as stated in article 1, paragraph 1, thereof, is &#8220;to secure the 
security of the State and the subsistence and freedom of nationals, by regulating any 
anticipated activities compromising the safety of the State&#8221;. Following an amendment 
passed by the National Assembly in 1991, a second paragraph was added to the article, 
stating explicitly that it &#8220;shall not be permitted to construe extensively this Act, or to 
restrict unreasonably the fundamental human rights of citizens guaranteed by the 
Constitution&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. The term &#8220;anti-government organizations&#8221; is defined by article 2, paragraph 1, of the 
Act as &#8220;a domestic or foreign organization or group which uses fraudulently the title of the 
Government or aims at a rebellion against the State, and which is provided with a command 
and leadership system&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. In the enforcement of the Act, article 7 has proved to be one of the most problematic 
clauses for human rights defenders. It punishes praise, incitement, propaganda, etc., by 
&#8220;anti-government organizations&#8221; with knowledge of the fact that &#8220;it may endanger the 
existence and security of the State or the democratic fundamental order&#8221; with a prison 
sentence of up to seven years. The vague language of article 7 in respect of &#8220;anti-

 See also A/HRC/17/27/Add.2, paras. 31&#8211;32, 47, and Corr.1.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>government organizations&#8221; has led to the conviction of human rights defenders in 
connection with their work. The Human Rights Committee expressed concern about 
prosecutions pursued under this article and restrictions placed on the freedom of expression. 
The Committee recommended that the State to ensure the compatibility of article 7 of the 
Act, and sentences imposed thereunder, with the requirements of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, in particular article 19 (CCPR/C/KOR/CO/3, para. 18).  
</p><p>33. The extent to which the Act has been used to bring charges against human rights 
defenders and others has varied over recent decades, notably according to the particular 
administration in power. According to testimonies and reports received, during the period 
2008&#8211;2012, the use of the Act appears to have increased, thereby counteracting a previous 
trend that had seen a general decline in charges based on the Act. The context of escalating 
tensions between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
during this period should, however, be noted, in particular the incident in 2010 when a 
warship, the Cheonan, was sunk after being hit by a torpedo believed to be fired by the 
latter&#8217;s navy, causing the death of the 46 sailors onboard. 
</p>
<p>34. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received testimonies and reports that the 
Act has been used against defenders who have expressed criticism of Government policies 
and been labelled as &#8220;anti-government organizations&#8221;. They were considered a threat to the 
State and social order.  
</p>
<p>35. In connection with the warship incident, non-governmental human rights 
organization People&#8217;s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD) submitted a report to 
the permanent delegations of the member States of the Security Council on 11 June 2010, 
and questioned the results of the official investigation into the sinking of the naval vessel 
Cheonan that had concluded the vessel had been sunk by a torpedo fired by the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea navy. After PSPD had sent its report, several high-ranking 
Government officials made comments suggesting PSPD was hindering government efforts 
to seek action against the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea through the Security 
Council. These comments are believed to have led to verbal and physical attacks targeting 
PSPD by members of the public, including threatening phone calls and the throwing of gas 
canisters and eggs at its building. An official investigation was later opened against PSPD 
on suspicions that it had violated the Act by assisting the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, defamed members of the official investigation committee by spreading false 
information, and hindered government diplomatic efforts.  
</p>
<p>36. This case was the subject of a joint allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur 
and the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 1 July 
</p><p>2010. On 15 September 2010, the Government responded, denying that PSPD was being 
investigated for its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms, stating that the 
investigation was still in its preliminary stages and that the Prosecution Office had 
responded to a complaint launched by a different organization (A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, paras. 
2009&#8211;2016). PSPD was eventually acquitted of charges spreading false information, 
obstruction of business and violation of the Act.  
</p>
<p>37. Mindful of the fact that national security is a real concern for the authorities and a 
valid ground for restrictions to certain public freedoms, during her visit the Special 
Rapporteur underlined that constructive criticism and scrutiny of public policies is essential 
in any democratic society, and should therefore be welcomed and guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall Council resolution 22/6, which calls on 
States to ensure that measures to preserve national security should be in compliance with 
their obligations under international law and should not hinder the work and safety of 
human rights defenders (para. 10). In this connection, she welcomed the assurances 
provided by the judiciary during her visit that the application of the Act is restricted only to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>cases of clear threats to national security. While this is encouraging, the Special Rapporteur 
remains concerned at the number of defenders charged under the Act.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Laws related to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>39. The fundamental right to freedom of peaceful assembly is guaranteed in the 
Constitution (art. 21), which explicitly prohibits any licensing of assemblies. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was worried to learn that the notification system guaranteed by the 
Constitution seems to have turned into a de facto regime of authorization by the police for 
peaceful assemblies organized by defenders, whereby public officials can impose a ban on 
planned demonstrations if they think the event might pose a threat to public peace and 
order. This practice contravenes article 21 of the Constitution and is contrary to the spirit of 
article 5 (a) of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to highlight the report on best practices by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and association, in which he recommends that the right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly be facilitated and protected by the State and not be subject to 
any regime of authorization, but at the most prior notification, which should not be 
burdensome (A/HRC/20/27, paras. 89&#8211;90; see also A/HRC/13/22/Add.1, paras. 1836&#8211;
1844).  
</p><p>40. The Assembly and Demonstrations Act (2007) contains provisions that impose 
serious limitations on the organization of peaceful gatherings and carry heavy penalties if 
not complied with. Problematic provisions include articles 6, paragraph 1; 8 and 12. Article 
6, paragraph 1, requires any person wishing to hold an outdoor assembly or demonstration 
to submit a report of the planned event to the local police station with details of the event. 
Article 8 provides that the police may ban the assembly or demonstration if it considers the 
event to constitute a threat to public peace and order. A violation of the ban is punishable 
by a maximum two years&#8217; imprisonment or a fine. Moreover, article 12 of the Act 
establishes that a demonstration can be banned or restricted if it disturbs traffic order 
(known as &#8220;obstruction of traffic&#8221;). The Act allows recourse through complaints or 
litigation as an appeal against the notice of ban from the police.  
</p>
<p>41. In addition, the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly has been restricted by the 
frequent use of article 314 of the Criminal Act on obstruction of business against protestors. 
Prosecutions under this provision are often accompanied by heavy claims for damages and 
seizures of property.  
</p>
<p>42. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about various instances and 
situations where the fundamental right to peaceful assembly has been unduly restricted, 
including some instances where the police resorted to excessive use of force when handling 
protests. These affected people participating in peaceful candlelight vigils who were 
arrested; those opposing forced evictions who were violently dispersed; defenders and local 
residents protesting against large-scale development projects, who were treated violently 
and arrested; and foreign defenders wanting to join rallies in the Republic of Korea, who 
were denied entry into the country or deported.  
</p>
<p>43. The Yongsan incident is an emblematic case where six people, including a police 
officer, died as a result of a fire during a violent raid by the police to forcibly evict tenants 
from a building in January 2009. The incident was the subject of a communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteur and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention (A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, paras. 2003&#8211;2008). The situations in Miryang and 
Gangjeong village (Jeju Island) were also brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur, and she visited both locations. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur received information and witnessed herself what seems to 
be a common practice by the police of parking a line of police buses just in front of rallies </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>and protests in major cities. Mindful that these buses are used for mobilizing police units to 
oversee the demonstration, she notes this practice has the effect of &#8220;blocking&#8221; or hiding the 
demonstrations from the view of passers-by and can intimidate those who participate in the 
rally or march. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline that the authorities should 
ensure the effective exercise of the right to peaceful assembly by meeting their positive 
obligation to protect and facilitate it within &#8220;sight and sound&#8221; of its object and target 
audience (A/HRC/20/27, para. 40). In addition to being an area for circulation, the use of 
urban space in a democratic society should allow for effective participation (ibid., para. 41). 
Assemblies can be a source of disruption of daily routines but authorities should try to 
balance the competing needs of the different users of public space rather than restricting the 
rights of those participating in public demonstrations.5 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Laws related to freedom of association and labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>45. Freedom of association is enshrined in the Constitution (art. 21); however, article 33 
places certain limitations to the right to form trade unions and engage in collective 
bargaining where public officials are concerned given the nature of their positions. Its core 
provision on the matter, article 33, paragraph 2, reads: &#8220;Only those public officials who are 
designated by law have the right to association, collective bargaining, and collective 
action.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>46. The Republic of Korea has been a member of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) since 1991 but has not yet ratified two of its fundamental conventions relating to 
freedom of association, the Conventions Nos. 87 (1948) concerning Freedom of 
Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and 98 (1951) concerning the 
Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively.  
</p>
<p>47. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern about what seem to be 
undue restrictions on and stigmatization of those trying to legitimately associate, participate 
in trade unions and exercise collective bargaining, all of which are basic human rights as 
well as key instruments to claim other rights.  
</p>
<p>48. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Adjustment Act (art. 5), sets out that &#8220;all 
workers have the right to freely form or join labour unions&#8221;, with the Labour Standards Act 
defining a worker as &#8220;a person who offers work to a business or workplace to earn wages, 
regardless of [the] kinds of jobs he/she is engaged in&#8221; (art. 14). Public officials and teachers 
have been granted the right to form trade unions through special laws.6 However, their right 
to associate is restricted for particular categories of public officials, such as senior officials, 
and there are limitations to their membership and their exercise of the right to freedom of 
expression (see section below for more details).  
</p><p>49. The right to strike seems to be unduly restricted due to an overly narrow definition 
and interpretation of &#8220;labour dispute&#8221;, which often makes strikes on issues falling under 
&#8220;managerial rights&#8221;, such as layoffs and factory closures or relocations, illegal. Moreover, 
the Special Rapporteur received testimonies and information indicating that the right to 
strike is frequently criminalized through the use of provisions in the Criminal Act, such as 
&#8220;obstruction of business&#8221;. Prosecutions under these provisions are often accompanied by 
heavy claims for damages by companies and provisional seizures of property. This has 
seriously affected defenders working on environmental rights as well as trade unionists, as 
indicated in the corresponding sections below.

</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that authorities are trying to 
mainstream human rights into the institutional and policy framework. There is a National 
Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (2012&#8211;2016) and a National 
Human Rights Policy Council under the Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>51. During most of her meetings with public officials, legislators and the judiciary, the 
Special Rapporteur was pleased to ascertain a good level of awareness of human rights 
issues and international standards, as well as genuine interest in her mandate and her visit. 
She also took note of the continuous efforts to train State officials and security forces on 
human rights issues. She encouraged the Government to raise awareness about the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and ensure that the recommendations of special 
procedures are implemented and disseminated among public officials.  
</p>
<p>52. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur learnt about the existence of the Students&#8217; 
Human Rights Ordinance in Seoul, which she considers an interesting example of citizen&#8217;s 
initiatives at the local level to promote and protect human rights and a good practice to be 
replicated elsewhere. The Special Rapporteur visited Gwangju, which is a &#8220;human rights 
city&#8221; with its own Human Rights Charter and indicators, and, in her opinion, a very good 
example of human rights promotion and protection at the local level.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea  
</b></p>
<p>53. NHRCK was established in 2001 as a body independent from the Government and 
was accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Human 
Rights Institutions in 2004. The NHRCK mandate is broad, as it receives individual 
complaints, carries out human rights education programmes and issues policy 
recommendations which are, nevertheless, not binding.  
</p>
<p>54. NHRCK is composed of 11 Commissioners, which include the Chairperson, 3 
Standing Commissioners and 7 Non-standing Commissioners. Of these, four are elected by 
the National Assembly, four are nominated by the President and three are nominated by the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and subsequently approved by the President. 
</p>
<p>55. NHRCK has played a key role in the consolidation of democracy in the Republic of 
Korea and the establishment of a solid human rights institutional framework. It has largely 
enjoyed the Government&#8217;s cooperation and often publishes opinions on human rights-
related issues, some of which have been instrumental in the defence of public rights and 
freedoms.  
</p>
<p>56. Nonetheless, the institution has in recent years received criticism from civil society 
with regard to its independence from the Government, which is at times perceived to be 
compromised.  
</p>
<p>57. During the reaccreditation process of NHRCK in 2008, a number of issues of 
concern were raised, including its lack of functional autonomy from the Government under 
the National Fiscal Act. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation of the International 
Coordinating Council also raised concerns about the appointment process of its Chairperson 
and Commissioners, which is based on nominations from the President, the National 
Assembly or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and which does not allow for formal 
public consultation and participation of civil society. The Sub-Committee stressed the need 
for NHRCK to have more autonomy to appoint its own staff and urged it to consider 
issuing public statements and reports through the media in a timely manner to address 
urgent human rights violations. In addition, concerns have been raised in response to a 
reduction of NHRCK human resources by 21 per cent in 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur met with the NHRCK Chairperson, one of the 
Commissioners and large representation of its staff. During the meeting, she was pleased to 
learn that the institution had a dedicated focal point for defenders and encouraged it to 
publicize this. NHRCK has conducted relevant investigations into allegations of human 
rights violations, such as on the Yongsan incident, the Jeju naval-base construction and the 
Cheonan incident. The Commission has also been active in raising awareness and 
conducting public education campaigns about human rights and the Special Rapporteur was 
able to assess that during her visit to Gwangju and her meeting with the regional office of 
NHRCK.  
</p>
<p>59. However, according to information received during the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur, NHRCK has lost the confidence of certain national stakeholders in recent 
years, including some groups of defenders. Reports and allegations received by the Special 
Rapporteur made reference to undue dismissal and overruling of complaints by defenders, 
excessive delays of decisions regarding complaints, and a tendency to disregard defenders&#8217; 
demands.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned about an unfortunate incident 
faced by a group of disability-rights defenders. In December 2010, disability-rights 
defenders and persons with disabilities staged a peaceful sit-in in the Commission&#8217;s 
premises demanding the resignation of the Chairperson and the improvement of three 
disability laws. It is alleged that, during the sit-in, the electric power and heating was 
suspended, and the entry of food and access of the defenders&#8217; assistants was restricted. As a 
result of the extreme weather and low temperatures, one of the persons taking part in the 
protest caught pneumonia and died two weeks later.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur was deeply disturbed to hear about this incident and took 
note of the assurances provided by the NHRCK Chairperson that the power cut that 
occurred during the protest was due to routine operations by the management of the 
building. She also considers that the fact that the sit-in took place shows that relations 
between NHRCK and certain groups of defenders have been exceptionally tense at times. 
In her view, the sit-in should have been facilitated, including through the provisions of 
basic conditions, in order for the protesters to express their concerns about a public 
institution. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur believes that in order for NHRCK to regain the confidence 
of human rights defenders and the public in general, it must be able to work independently 
and professionally with members and staff who can exercise integrity and impartiality. In 
particular, NHRCK must be attentive to the situation and concerns of the different groups 
of defenders and act as mediator between public authorities or private actors and groups of 
defenders in a timely manner when needed.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b>63. Defenders are generally able to carry out their work in the Republic of Korea 
without hindrance and civil society is well organized and very vocal regarding human rights 
issues. However, during her visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that the environment in 
which defenders operate is quite polarized and not always sufficiently conducive to the 
defence and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This seems to stem 
from the lack of trust between defenders and authorities, and from important shortcomings 
in the legal framework, as indicated above. For effective dialogue to take place, both sides 
need to engage constructively, exercise diplomacy and patience to communicate their 
positions and listen to the arguments of the other side.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur met with a broad range of representatives of civil society 
and learned about the situation of particular groups of defenders and activists, some of them 
at the community level, which are facing important challenges when carrying out their 
work or exercising certain basic rights. Within the limits of the present report, the Special 
Rapporteur is only able to elaborate on the situation of selected groups of defenders and 
only briefly outlines the challenges faced by other groups.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Journalists and media workers  
</b></p>
<p>65. Free and independent media is an indicator of a healthy and open democracy as it 
encourages constructive criticism, critical thinking and thorough analysis of public affairs, 
often regarding the exercise of basic rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>66. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur received credible testimonies and 
allegations of harassment, intimidation and illegal surveillance of journalists who work on 
human rights-related issues, report on public interest information, handle corruption cases 
of Government officials or publically criticize the Government. Some of the cases were 
raised by the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression during 
his visit in 2010 (A/HRC/17/27/Add.2 and Corr.1). 
</p><p>67. Journalists have been unfairly dismissed or disciplined when they have gone on 
strike to protest against unfair practices within broadcasting companies, and the cases of 
YTN and MBC are emblematic in this respect. Some of them have faced lawsuits for 
defamation which carry excessively high damage claims.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern that these actions that unduly 
restrict the exercise of a fundamental right and stigmatize the work of media and 
journalists, which play a key role in the defence and promotion of human rights. She would 
like to reiterate observations and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, which she considers very pertinent and still 
applicable, in particular those regarding defamation and the exercise of freedom of opinion 
and expression on the Internet (A/HRC/17/27/Add.2, paras. 21&#8211;48, 89&#8211;94, and Corr.1).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Trade unionists and labour rights activists 
</b></p>
<p>69. As mentioned before, there are important limitations to the exercise of labour rights 
in the Republic of Korea whereby the right to collective bargaining and to strike as 
legitimate means to claim economic and social rights are seriously curtailed. Article 3 of 
the Trade Union and Labour Relations Adjustment Act stipulates that damages against a 
trade union or workers cannot be claimed when they originate from collective bargaining or 
industrial actions.  
</p>
<p>70. However, in addition to the narrow definition of &#8220;labour disputes&#8221; contained in that 
Act (art. 2, para. 5), already mentioned in the section above, the Special Rapporteur learned 
during her visit that strikes are often declared illegal by a court of law due to a restrictive 
interpretation of such rights. Strikes against redundancies, the movement of plants, and 
outsourcing (which are classified as &#8220;management rights&#8221;) are often deemed illegal despite 
their impact on working conditions and on economic and social rights. In this context, the 
practice of filing compensation lawsuits claiming exorbitant amounts for &#8220;obstruction of 
business&#8221; against unions and union members has become widespread. This practice is of 
particular concern for the Special Rapporteur since it not only criminalizes the activities of 
trade unions and their members, but also stigmatizes their work and discourages others 
from joining them in claiming labour rights.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>71. The case of the protests of workers and labour rights defenders against massive 
layoffs at Hanjin Heavy Industries (Hope Bus) since 2011 is emblematic. According to 
testimonies and reports received, workers and others participating in the different rallies 
have faced excessive use of force by the police, including the use of tear gas and water 
cannons; summons and arrests, including of those monitoring the demonstrations; and 
heavy penalties for obstruction of traffic.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also received testimonies and allegations that the system to 
report trade unions&#8217; establishment has been misused on various occasions and hence turned 
into a de facto approval system which could breach the principle of trade union autonomy. 
The cases of the unions formed by government employees (Korean Government Employees 
Union) and teachers (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union) are illustrative cases 
in this respect. Both these unions have been trying to obtain legal status for several years 
without success, mainly due to the fact that their membership includes dismissed workers. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that, on 2 August 2013, the Ministry of Labour 
rejected the fourth establishment report presented by the Korean Teachers and Education 
Workers Union.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the situation of irregular or 
subcontracted workers, who, according to testimonies received, lack effective legal 
protection and suffer retaliation because of union activities in the form of unfair dismissal 
and intimidation. The case of the two workers from the Hyundai Motor Company in Ulsan, 
who have been sitting-in on a high voltage electric pylon for over six months protesting 
against the precarious situation of in-house subcontracted workers, illustrates the climate of 
tension and distrust that prevails in some industries. The two workers were also demanding 
that the company implements the decision of the Supreme Court delivered in 2012. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the one of these two labour rights defenders should be considered 
as a full-time employee given that he worked for more than two consecutive years for the 
company. Following her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that, on 8 August 2013, 
both workers descended from the tower due to health reasons. The Special Rapporteur met 
with both sides engaged in this dispute and believes that appropriate mediation mechanisms 
need to be put in place to encourage dialogue and conflict resolution between labour and 
management.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur also received serious allegations of the involvement of 
private consulting firms specialized in labour relations in oppressing trade unions. The 
Environment and Labour Committee of the National Assembly held a hearing about the 
matter in 2012, which revealed that certain consulting firms have played a significant role 
in intimidating trade unions by claiming damages for labour disputes and obtaining an order 
for provisional seizures of property. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about these 
reports and urges the Government to ensure that such practices are not tolerated, and 
prompt and impartial investigations are conducted into allegations received and perpetrators 
are held accountable.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Environmental rights defenders  
</b></p>
<p>75. Defenders and community residents protesting against large-scale development 
projects are also facing important challenges in South Korea. The Special Rapporteur 
visited local communities in Miryang and Jeju Island who are opposing development 
projects.  
</p><p>76. In the case of Miryang, local residents are opposing the building of a 756kV power-
transmission tower in connection with the construction of the Gori nuclear power plant. The 
conflict has been going on for eight years and the Special Rapporteur received testimonies 
of acts of intimidation, harassment and physical violence against protestors allegedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>perpetrated by workers and private security firms hired by the Korean Electric Power 
Corporation (KEPCO). Over the years, this has resulted in the self-immolation of a 74-year-
old resident in protest over the situation and in serious incidents of physical attacks against 
residents and protestors, reportedly including a sexual assault against a monk.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur met with both KEPCO representatives and local residents 
during her visit. Most of the residents pointed to a lack of consultation and effective 
participation in the project as the main source of their grievances. They also claim their 
right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to live in a safe, clean 
and healthy environment.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the attitude of the KEPCO 
representatives, who acknowledged basic flaws in the project before 2009, mostly in 
connection with their engagement with local residents and the availability of information 
about their activities. She welcomed a recent decision of the company to drop damage 
claims for &#8220;obstruction of business&#8221; against some residents and their efforts to educate their 
personnel and subcontractors on how to handle protests. However, she was informed that, 
in August 2013, KEPCO filed an injunction against village residents and one of the local 
committees opposing the project for disruption of the construction. She has also received 
information indicating that, on 30 September 2013, KEPCO had resumed the construction 
of the power tower without due consultation with the villagers. She encourages dialogue 
and welcomes the mediation initiated by the National Assembly in June 2013. In her view, 
NHRCK should also be seized of the situation in Miryang.  
</p>
<p>79. In Jeju Island, the Special Rapporteur was acquainted with the situation of groups of 
defenders and local residents who, since 2007, have been opposing the construction of a 
naval base both because of its impact on the environment of the area and the project&#8217;s 
military element. She received the testimonies of residents and local and foreign defenders 
who were intimidated and harassed by the police and workers of the naval base.  
</p>
<p>80. According to the information received, residents and defenders opposing the 
construction of the naval base often face charges of &#8220;obstruction of business&#8221; and are the 
subject of exorbitant damage claims and temporary seizures of property through civil suits. 
Reports indicate that around 210 defenders are currently awaiting trial with charges of 
&#8220;obstruction of business&#8221;. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur learned that foreign defenders 
coming to support them from abroad have been deported or denied entry in the country by 
way of the application of article 11, paragraph 3, of the Immigration Control Act.  
</p>
<p>81. The situation in Gangjeong Village (Jeju Island) was the subject of a communication 
sent by the Special Rapporteur jointly with two other United Nations experts in May 2012. 
In the letter, the experts expressed their concern at allegations received indicating acts of 
intimidation, harassment and ill-treatment of peaceful protestors opposing the construction 
of the naval base, including the deportation of two foreign activists. In the Government&#8217;s 
response dated 2 January 2013, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that NHRCK 
had received complaints and had initiated various investigations and made 
recommendations concerning police action in handling demonstrators. She still believes 
that training of the police deployed in the area on basic human rights standards, such as the 
Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, remains necessary.  
</p>
<p>82. Mindful of the fact the Jeju naval base is an important national project with national 
security and economic development dimensions, the Special Rapporteur urges all parties 
involved to make the necessary efforts to open and maintain dialogue. The authorities must 
facilitate this process by setting up a mediation mechanism if necessary. In this connection, 
the Special Rapporteur encourages NHRCK to remain seized of the situation.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1

<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> D. Defenders working for the rights of migrants  
</b></p>
<p>83. Documented and undocumented migrant workers in the Republic of Korea face 
important challenges, including discrimination, unpaid wages, difficulties in accessing 
social welfare and harassment. Defenders working on these issues include migrant workers 
themselves who have tried to associate to effectively claim their rights, including labour 
rights. However, this has not been possible, as the request of the Migrants&#8217; Trade Union 
(MTU) to be officially recognized as a labour union has not been successful so far.  
</p><p>84. MTU has been operating since 2005. In 2007, the Seoul High Court ruled that MTU 
be recognized as a legal union. Following an appeal by the Ministry of Labour of the 
decision of the High Court, the case has been with the Supreme Court, which has yet to 
make a decision, since 2007. This has left MTU without legal status for the past eight years. 
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that, as a consequence, migrant 
workers are denied the rights to collective bargaining and to strike. Hence, the work of 
those advocating for their rights becomes particularly challenging. She trusts that the 
judicial authorities will deliver their ruling regarding MTU in the near future. 
85. The cases of various leaders of MTU have been raised by the Special Rapporteur in 
different communications to the Government since 2008. Cases have included the arrest 
and deportation in 2009 of MTU members who were active in favour of labour rights of 
migrants and the denial of entry and deportation in 2012 of the former President of Seoul-
Gyeonggi-Incheon MTU (A/HRC/22/47/Add.4, paras. 342&#8211;345, and A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, 
paras. 1981&#8211;1992). She is grateful for the Government&#8217;s replies.  
86. The Special Rapporteur would like to urge the authorities to safeguard the 
fundamental right to freedom of association and collective bargaining of all migrant 
workers, regardless of their status. In this connection, she would like to underline the 
recommendations made by various United Nations treaty bodies7 requesting the State party 
to ensure that migrants are not subjected to discrimination or exploitation of any sort and 
that they are able to enjoy their right to organize without undue restrictions. She would also 
like to recall the recommendation by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association 
requesting the Government to prioritize social dialogue as a means to find a negotiated 
solution to the situation of these workers.8  
</p>
<p><b> E. Students&#8217; rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>87. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also learned about the work of brave young 
students who struggle to advocate for the rights of fellow students in a context of strict 
school rules and regulations and strong social pressure to have a successful career. While 
recognizing the value of competition and certain discipline in school system, she expressed 
concern that some of the practices in schools could amount to violations of basic rights, 
particularly the use of corporal punishment or undue restrictions to the rights to freedom of 
expression and peaceful assembly by retaliating against student leaders. Various United 
Nations bodies have raised these issues, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child (see CRC/C/15/Add.197 and CRC/C/KOR/CO/3-4).

 Document GB.317/INS/8, 367th Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association, case No. 2620, 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, paras. 532&#8211;559. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1

<p>88. The Special Rapporteur received testimonies and credible allegations of young 
activists who have dared to publicly denounce such practices and have faced important 
challenges, including disciplinary actions, coercive dropouts, expulsion, fines, 
discrimination, verbal abuse and ostracism. Many of these young activists finish by giving 
up their advocacy work for fear of disadvantages and punishments. Reports of violations 
are often made anonymously and students live in fear of retaliation.  
</p>
<p>89. She also met with young students advocating for student rights to be enshrined in the 
existing legal framework. Their efforts have made possible the issuance of Student Human 
Rights Ordinances at the local government level, which provide for the appointment of 
student rights commissions and officers who can investigate and provide remedy in cases of 
violations. These ordinances have been enacted in Gyeonggi-do and Gwangju in 2010 and 
in Seoul in 2012.  
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Ministry of Education had expressed 
opposition to such initiatives through local government ordinances claiming that they can 
infringe upon schools&#8217; autonomy and teachers&#8217; authority. In this connection, on 26 January 
2012, the Ministry of Education filed an injunction to suspend the effect of the Seoul 
Student Human Rights Ordinance and initiated litigation to nullify it mostly based on flaws 
in the promulgations process, potential conflict with existing legislation and possible 
infringement of school autonomy.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall recommendations made by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, whereby it has urged the authorities to consider 
amending legislation to ensure that children have the right to express their views freely, to 
facilitate their participation in all matters in decision-making process and in political 
activities both within and outside schools and to ensure that they fully enjoy their right to 
freedom of association and expression (CRC/C/KOR/CO/3-4, para. 41). She hopes that the 
legal proceedings around the Seoul Students&#8217; Human Rights Ordinance will be resolved in 
the best interest of the full exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Whistle-blowers 
</b></p>
<p>92. Whistle-blowers are protected through the Act on Prevention of Corruption and the 
Establishment and Management of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission 
enacted in 2008 and is mostly focused on those who report corruption in the public sector. 
In 2011, the Act on the Protection of Public Interest Whistle-blowers was enacted and 
explicitly applies to anyone who reports a violation in the public interest, including those 
who disclose information in the private sector.  
</p>
<p>93. Within this framework, the confidentiality, physical protection and position of those 
who report on public interest information is guaranteed. If the disclosure of information 
reveals a crime committed by those reporting, there is a mitigation-of-culpability clause 
which can lead to a reduction in the punishment or disciplinary action against them. The 
existing legal framework also provides for financial incentives or rewards if the information 
disclosed results in the recovery or increase of revenue, whereby those who report can 
receive up to 20 per cent of the amount recovered.9 In addition, public interest whistle-
blowers who face damages in connection to medical treatment, litigation expenses and 
losses in wages can receive financial compensation. The above-mentioned Act allows the 
launch of enquiries into claims of retaliation against those who report corruption offences 
and there is a telephone hotline to receive reports.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur considers that the existing legal framework is, overall, 
conducive to the disclosure of public interest information, including information relevant to 
the effective exercise and protection of human rights. She believes that some of the 
provisions and services could be considered as a good practice to be replicated elsewhere, 
such as the mitigation of culpability provision and the availability of a hotline for those 
reporting.  
</p>
<p>95. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur received reports that whistle-blowers still face 
disciplinary actions, punitive dismissals, lawsuits and large damage claims when reporting 
information of public interest. She received information indicating that those who report to 
the press, to non-governmental organizations or on the Internet are not protected under the 
existing framework. In this connection, she would like to underline that reporting through 
external channels should be allowed in order to encourage and facilitate the disclosure of 
information of public interest.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Defenders working for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people 
</b></p>
<p>96. Those working for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face 
discrimination, stigmatization and undue restrictions to their right to express themselves 
freely. The case of the Mapo Residents Rainbow Alliance, which applied to put up a banner 
in the Mapo-Gu neighbourhood of Seoul and found its request rejected due to the fact that it 
contained words such as &#8220;lesbian&#8221;, &#8220;gay&#8221;, &#8220;bisexual&#8221; and &#8220;transgender&#8221;, is relevant in this 
respect. It is reported that the relevant Mapo-Gu Office asked the organization to revise the 
content of the banner for fear that such words would be harmful to adolescents and 
uncomfortable for older people. The Special Rapporteur considers the Mapo banner 
incident as a violation of the right to freedom of expression and an act of discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. She is pleased to note that, after her 
visit, NHRCK issued an opinion on the case along the same lines.  
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Anti-Discrimination Bill, being 
discussed at the time of her visit, does not cover all grounds for discrimination, notably 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. While welcoming the 
legislative initiative, she is concerned about the narrow base of such important legislation 
and trusts that the relevant authorities will take the necessary action to ensure that the 
human rights obligations of the Republic of Korea will be upheld as this law is adopted.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Other defenders facing challenges  
</b></p>
<p>98. Other groups of defenders with which the Special Rapporteur met also face 
challenges when carrying out their work, including defenders working for the rights of 
persons with disabilities and on housing rights.  
</p>
<p>99. Disability rights defenders face important challenges when trying to exercise their 
right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly claiming the elimination of 
discrimination, including in access to work, education and social welfare. They often face 
physical violence by law enforcement officials and heavy fines when rallying for the 
respect and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>100. Those defenders working on economic, social and cultural rights, including housing 
rights as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, also face important 
challenges, including excessive use of force by the police when opposing forced evictions 
and violence by private security firms. Some are violently arrested and injured, and face 
heavy penalties. In connection to the Yongsan incident, two housing rights defenders who </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>were involved were severely injured and spent four years in hospital. To date, they are 
receiving psychotherapy due to the trauma and the legal proceedings against them.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that, overall, human rights defenders in the 
Republic of Korea are able to operate freely but in an environment which is not 
always sufficiently conducive. Significant challenges originate in connection with the 
existing legal framework governing the exercise of basic freedoms, such as the rights 
to freedoms of opinion and expression, of peaceful assembly and of association. 
Legislation pertaining to national security, and the difficult geopolitical situation in 
the Korean peninsula, can also have a restrictive impact on the environment in which 
defenders operate.  
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to warn against the use of legislation to 
regulate, undermine or obstruct the work of defenders. She would like to refer to 
article 2, paragraph 2, of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders that calls upon 
States to adopt legislative, administrative and other steps to ensure that the rights and 
freedoms enshrined in the Declaration are effectively guaranteed.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the continuous efforts on the part of the 
authorities to mainstream human rights into the legal and administrative framework. 
She believes that more can be done to raise awareness about the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders and to implement recommendations made by special 
procedures.  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the important role played by the National 
Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK) in the consolidation of democracy 
and the respect and promotion of human rights in the country. She is concerned that 
certain groups of defenders have lost trust in that institution. She urges NHRCK to do 
its utmost to regain the confidence of human rights defenders and be a strong, 
independent institution capable of credible and impartial scrutiny of the State&#8217;s 
human rights obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes that defenders operate in a rather polarized 
environment and believes that more effort is required, both from the authorities and 
the communities of defenders, to engage in genuine and constructive dialogue.  
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
recommendations in a spirit of engaging in a constructive dialogue with the 
authorities and other stakeholders involved.
