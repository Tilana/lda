</p>
<p>the obligation to ensure the protection of civilians in armed conflict, and deploring the

<p>that began in 1967, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the non-cooperation by Israel with the independent commission of

</p>

</p>
<p><i>Regretting</i> the lack of implementation of the recommendations contained in the

<p><i>Alarmed</i> that long-standing systemic impunity for international law violations has 
</p>
<p>allowed for the recurrence of grave violations without consequence, and stressing the need 
</p>

</p>
<p>international human rights law in order to end impunity, ensure justice, deter further 
</p>
<p>violations, protect civilians and promote peace,

</p>
<p>information on alleged perpetrators of violations of international law;

<p>through appropriate fair and independent domestic or international criminal justice </p>


<p>mechanisms, and to ensure the right of all victims to an effective remedy, including full
