Interim Results

RNS Number : 8714G
Stratex International PLC
11 August 2016
Stratex International Plc
("Stratex", the "Company" or the "Group")
Interim Results
For the six-month period ended 30 June 2016
Stratex International Plc, the AIM-quoted exploration and development company focused on gold and base metals in
West Africa and Turkey, where it holds a 45%-interest in Altıntepe, a producing gold mine, announces its unaudited
interim results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2016.
Operational Highlights:
·    Altıntepe - production at the Altıntepe Gold Mine ("Altıntepe" or the "Mine") in Turkey is on track to meet the
minimum annual production target of 30,000 oz Au this year - 19,467 oz Au produced during H1-16;
·    Muratdere - dilution to 14.87% interest in the Muratdere Cu-Au porphyry project in Turkey following the decision not
to contribute to the Group's pro rata share of project development costs on the basis of low copper prices;
·   Dalafin - low-cost exploration programme, comprising mapping, soil sampling, and outcrop and lag sampling,
completed at Dalafin gold project in Senegal. Further zones of mineralisation identified, including a 750m extension of
the Faré South prospect soil anomaly;
·   Thani Stratex Resources - US$1.25 million and US$2 million raised to fund drilling in Djibouti (commenced Q2) and
exploration in Egypt, respectively. Stratex interest diluted to 30.4% as a result of the raisings and an issue of shares to
employees;
·    Goldstone - £1 million raised for development of Homase-Akrokerri gold project in Ghana (including c.2,000m
reverse circulation drilling programme) following appointment of Stratex Director Emma Priestley as Goldstone CEO.
Stratex interest remains unchanged at 33.45%.
Financial Overview:
·    The Group's operating loss for the first six months is £1,185,819 and compares to an operating loss for the same
period last year of £1,182,009. The pre-tax loss of £1,984,573 compares to a pre-tax loss for the same period last year
of £1,388,082;
·    The increase in the pre-tax loss during the period arises due to the reduction in the Company's interest in its
associated companies, Thani Stratex Resources Limited and Muratdere Madencilik, resulting in accounting losses in
the period of £832,472 and £319,414 respectively. Additionally, the Company has withdrawn from the management of
Tembo Gold Corporation and Dr Bob Foster has resigned from its board of directors. As a result, the investment in
Tembo no longer meets the requirements for equity accounting and a net loss of £1,069,267 has been recognised;
·   The above losses have been partially offset by the Company's share of profits from production at the Altıntepe Mine
which amount to £1.6 million;
·   The Company continues to keep a tight control on costs and the net cash used in operating activities during the
period was £802,260 compared to £1,670,921 in the same period last year;
·    The cash balance for the Group as at 30 June 2016 was £2,728,190 (30 June 2015: £2,533,278).
Chairman's Statement
Looking back at the first half of 2016 it would appear that the fortunes of smaller exploration and mining companies
have at last bottomed.  The gold price has improved significantly and the outlook for base metals is looking more
positive, although many commodities' prices remain relatively weak. The shares of juniors, including Stratex, have
strengthened and equity funding has recommenced on improved terms.
Stratex's operating loss for the period, at £1.18 million, was similar to 2015 although the accounting treatment of
associated companies contributed to an increased pre-tax loss of £1.98 million against £1.39 million last year; our
interest in Thani Stratex Resources was diluted by a third party equity funding and Muratdere Madencilik and Tembo
Gold Corporation ceased to be treated as associates for accounting purposes.  The consolidated cash balance at 30
June 2016 was £2.73 million (£2.53 million at 30 June 2015).
On the exploration front, further zones of mineralisation were identified at 85% owned Dalafin in Senegal, following
additional mapping, soil sampling, outcrop and lag sampling principally at Faré South. The best means of furthering
the project are under consideration, including further exploration and the involvement of a joint-venture partner.
At the Muratdere Cu-Au porphyry project in Turkey, Stratex's interest has been diluted to 14.87% following a decision
not to contribute pro rata to further project development costs, on the basis of low copper prices. The Company will
continue to assess the supply-demand scenario for copper and may consider supporting future work should it believe
that the demand for copper, and hence the price, justifies its participation.
Thani Stratex Resources has successfully raised significant joint-venture funding for drilling in Djibouti and, as a result
of the fundraisings and an issue of shares to employees during the period, Stratex's interest has now been diluted to
30.4%.  A diamond drilling programme has commenced and the results are awaited.  Funds are also in place,
following an equity issue, to commence exploration in Egypt.
No work was possible at 33.45% owned Goldstone's Homase-Akrokerri project in Ghana in the first 6 months of the
year.  Following the resignation of former CEO Jurie Wessels, Stratex Director Emma Priestly took the role of interim
CEO and has now been formally appointed to the board of Goldstone as CEO.  Since the period end, Goldstone has
raised £1 million.  Stratex maintained its holding through a combination of converting a loan issued by Stratex to
Goldstone of US$250,000 and subscribing for additional ordinary shares in Goldstone at a cost of £143,637. With the
appointment of Emma, I considered it appropriate to step down, handing over to independent director Neil Gardyne as
Chairman.  Goldstone plans to drill the encouraging geochemical anomalies delineated in early 2015, which could
deliver a near surface extension to the oxide part of the existing resource.  We remain optimistic towards Goldstone's
future as there are many other opportunities, principally in Ghana, for a well-managed, well-funded junior.
Operations at the 45% owned Altintepe Gold Mine in Turkey are progressing well.  Some additional capital was
required to treat clay-rich plant feed more effectively, but with 19,467 oz of gold being produced in the first half of this
year, the project is well on track to meet the 30,000 oz annual minimum target.  Project revenues in the first half of
2016 were US$32.7 million. However, with the exception of agreed loan repayments of US$4.2 million to our partners
Bahar Madencılık, and US$190,000 to Stratex, no funds have yet been distributed.
The board of Altıntepe Madencilik is currently considering the longer-term future of the Mine and the optimum means to
provide for, or fund, future capital expenditure, including a provision for ultimate closure and restoration, which was
always to be financed out of cash flow.  Once the longer term planning of the Mine has been fully evaluated and
costed, to allow an estimate of distributable cash flow, distribution of net cash can be initiated on the accelerated
payback basis of 80% to Bahar and 20% to Stratex until Bahar's pre-production costs are repaid. Thereafter, net cash
distributions will be made 55% to Bahar and 45% to Stratex.
I look forward to updating you on developments at Altintepe, Dalafin, Muratdere, Thani Stratex and Goldstone in due
course.

Notes to the unaudited financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, which have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union.
2. Financial Information
The interim financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the
Companies Act 2006.  It has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and
measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in preparing the interim financial information are
consistent with those that have been adopted in the Group's 2015 audited financial statements. Statutory financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were approved by the Board of Directors on 8 March 2016 and
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.
Risks and uncertainties
The key risks that could affect the Group's short and medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks
have not substantially changed from those set out in the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements, a
copy of which is available on the Company's website:  www.stratexinternational.com. The Group's key financial risks
are the availability of adequate funding and foreign exchange movements.
Accounting Policies
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 4 of the Group's 2015
Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly
during the interim period. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the measurement of certain investments at fair value.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
New and amended standards adopted by the Group:
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1
January 2016 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The financial information for the 6 months ended 30 June 2016 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2015 has not been
audited.
The business is not subject to seasonal variations. No dividends have been paid in the period (2015: £nil).
3. Operating Segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with internal reports provided to the Board and are
used by the Directors to make strategic decisions. The management structure reflects these segments. The Group's
exploration operations and investments are based in three geographical areas, namely Turkey, East Africa and West
Africa. The Group's head office is located in the UK and provides corporate and support services to the Group and
researches new areas of exploration opportunities.
The allocation of profits, losses, assets and liabilities by operating segment is as follows:

a)   The Company's shareholding interest in Muratdere Madencilk Sanayi ve Ticaret AS was reduced from 30% to
14.87% as a result of not participating in the share placing of 22 February 2016. The Company's investment no longer
meets the requirements for equity accounting. A fair market value of £429,826 equal to the original cost of the
investment has been attributed to the remaining investment. The resulting net loss is £319,414.
b)   Dr Bob Foster, the CEO of Stratex, resigned from the board of the Tembo Gold Corporation on 5 May 2016 and
Stratex is no longer involved in the management of the company. As the investment no longer meets the requirements
for equity accounting a fair market value of £381,492 has been attributed to its 12.8% investment based on the market
price of the Tembo shares at the time of the change in accounting treatment. The resulting net loss is £1,069,267.
c)  During the period Thani Stratex Resources Limited has undertaken share placings in which the Company has not
participated, and has issued shares to employees. As a result the Company's shareholding interest has reduced from
40% to 30.4%. This has given rise to a net loss of £832,472. The Group's investment in Thani Stratex Resources
Limited continues to meet the requirements for equity accounting as an associate company.
6.  Related party transactions
Directors of the Company received total remuneration of £242,046 for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (six months
ended 30 June 2015 - £254,439).
7.  Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company of £1,875,835
for the period ended 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: 1,232,594) and the weighted average number of shares in issue of
467,311,276 in the periods ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015. There is no difference between the basic and
diluted earnings per share.
8.  Events after the reporting period
On 28 July 2016 Goldstone Resources Limited raised additional funding by means of a share placing. The Company
maintained its 33.45% shareholding interest in Goldstone through a combination of converting the loan of US$250,000
due from Goldstone and subscribing for additional ordinary shares in Goldstone Resources Limited at a cash cost of
£143,637.
