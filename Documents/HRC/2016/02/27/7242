<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 27/24, requested the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a study on best 
</p>
<p>practices, experiences and challenges and ways to overcome them with regard to the 
</p>
<p>promotion, protection and implementation of the right to participate in public affairs in the 
</p>
<p>context of the existing human rights law, with a view to identifying possible elements of 
</p>
<p>principles guiding the implementation of that right, in consultation with States, relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, the treaty bodies, the special 
</p>
<p>procedures, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders. Notes verbales were sent to all relevant stakeholders on 16 January 
</p>
<p>2015 and 66 responses were received. The contributions from stakeholders are available on 
</p>
<p>the OHCHR website.1 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to the request made by the Council, the present study identifies challenges 
</p>
<p>to political and public participation, presents ways to overcome those challenges and 
</p>
<p>provides examples of experiences and best practices in that regard. It also draws 
</p>
<p>conclusions from the contributions received from stakeholders, as well as from information 
</p>
<p>from other sources, with a view to identifying elements guiding the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to participate in public affairs. 
</p>
<p>3. The study, in particular sections II and III, should be read in conjunction with the 
</p>
<p>report on factors that impede equal political participation and steps to overcome those 
</p>
<p>challenges (A/HRC/27/29), which thoroughly examines the human rights framework and 
</p>
<p>the jurisprudence of United Nations human rights mechanisms in relation to participation in 
</p>
<p>political and public affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights framework relating to equal participation 
in political and public affairs 
</b></p>
<p>4. Participation is a hallmark of democracy. It entails timely consultation so as to 
</p>
<p>legitimize the exercise of State power. As articulated in article 25 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the right to participation encompasses the rights of 
</p>
<p>the individual to vote and to be elected; to take part in the conduct of public affairs; and to 
</p>
<p>have access to public service. Other international human rights treaties contain similar 
</p>
<p>provisions, which complement the Covenant.2  
</p>
<p>5. In its interpretation of the obligations of States under article 25 of the Covenant, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee requires that positive measures be adopted to ensure the full, 
</p>
<p>effective and equal enjoyment of participatory rights, including through inclusive, 
</p>
<p>meaningful and non-discriminatory processes and mechanisms.3 States also should 
</p>
<p>guarantee full and effective access to justice and redress mechanisms to people who have 
</p>
<p>been unduly deprived of their right to participate in political and public affairs.4

<p> 3 A/HRC/27/29, para. 12 and Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 25 (1996) on the right 
</p>
<p>to participate in public affairs, voting rights and the right to equal access to public service, paras. 12, 
</p>
<p>26 and 27. See also A/HRC/27/51, para. 61 and A/HRC/23/36, para. 24.

<p>6. The Human Rights Committee&#8217;s  general comment No. 25 on article 25 of the 
</p>
<p>Covenant, as well as jurisprudence adopted by the Committee and other treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>provide guidance on the measures that States should take to implement the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in political and public affairs. In recent years, there has been a progressive 
</p>
<p>evolution of international human rights law and jurisprudence regarding the scope of this 
</p>
<p>right, which has led many stakeholders to call for a revision of general comment No. 25.5 
</p>
<p>7. Free and fair elections constitute an imperative means of giving voice to the will of 
</p>
<p>the people. Article 25 (b) of the Covenant recognizes the right of every citizen to vote and 
</p>
<p>to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage, 
</p>
<p>thereby underlining the importance of inclusivity and equality. The Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee has clarified the essential elements of this right. Notably, it requires that States 
</p>
<p>parties, in fulfilling their obligations under article 25 (b) of the Covenant, take positive 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure the full, effective and equal enjoyment of electoral rights, without 
</p>
<p>discrimination, as well as the freedoms of expression, information, assembly and 
</p>
<p>association. Those are essential conditions for the effective exercise of the right to vote and 
</p>
<p>must be fully protected.6  
</p>
<p>8. Wide-reaching restrictions or deprivations of electoral rights may not be compatible 
</p>
<p>with guarantees of equality and non-discrimination under international law.7 The Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee notes that the right to vote may be subject only to reasonable restrictions, 
</p>
<p>such as setting a minimum age limit to vote. The Committee also notes that any restrictions 
</p>
<p>on the right to stand for election must be justifiable on objective and reasonable criteria.8 In 
</p>
<p>that regard, it states that any abusive or discriminatory interference with the registration of 
</p>
<p>voters or candidates for public office and other elements of the electoral process should be 
</p>
<p>prohibited by criminal law and that effective access to justice and appropriate remedies 
</p>
<p>should be guaranteed for people who have been deprived of their political rights.9 
</p>
<p>9. International human rights instruments and mechanisms acknowledge the right of all 
</p>
<p>people to be fully involved in and to effectively influence public decision-making processes 
</p>
<p>that affect them. To ensure full and effective participation in political and public affairs on 
</p>
<p>an equal basis, participatory mechanisms and processes must conform to certain principles. 
</p>
<p>First of all, participatory mechanisms should be established by law10 and all stakeholders 
</p>
<p>must have access to information in a timely and transparent manner, which implies that 
</p>
<p>State authorities must make every effort to ensure easy, prompt, effective and practical 
</p>
<p>access to information of interest to the public.11 Participation mechanisms and processes 
</p>
<p>should be sufficiently resourced, non-discriminatory, inclusive and designed so that 
</p>
<p>concerned groups, even the most marginalized, have the opportunity to voice their opinions.

<p>10. Public participation rights encompass the right to be consulted at each phase of 
</p>
<p>legislative drafting and policymaking; to voice opinions and criticism; and to submit 
</p>
<p>proposals aimed at improving the functioning and inclusivity of all State bodies.12   
</p>
<p>11. Participation requires a long-term and genuine commitment to engage in processes 
</p>
<p>of intensive dialogue regarding the development of policies, programmes and measures in 
</p>
<p>all relevant contexts.13 The Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to 
</p>
<p>Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in 
</p>
<p>Environmental Matters is a good example of the recognition of the right to participation. It 
</p>
<p>links environmental rights with human rights, in particular the right to participation, and is 
</p>
<p>based on three pillars &#8211; access to information, public participation in decision-making and 
</p>
<p>access to justice in environmental matters.14 
</p>
<p>12. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also 
</p>
<p>recognizes the right and the opportunity of citizens to have access, on general terms of 
</p>
<p>equality, to public service. To ensure equal access, the criteria and processes for 
</p>
<p>appointment, promotion, suspension and dismissal must be objective and reasonable. 
</p>
<p>Affirmative measures may be taken in appropriate cases to ensure that there is equal access 
</p>
<p>to public service for all citizens.15 
</p>
<p>13. Participation in political and public affairs underpins the realization of all human 
</p>
<p>rights and is inextricably linked to them. It cannot be considered in a vacuum without 
</p>
<p>taking into consideration structural issues such as poverty or literacy levels. States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>contribution to this study confirm that the respect and full exercise of the rights to freedoms 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and the rights to information, 
</p>
<p>education and access to justice, are prerequisites to an enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>participation in the conduct of political and public affairs.16 Closing the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; is 
</p>
<p>also essential to give full effect to the right to participate in political and public affairs, 
</p>
<p>notably to allow disadvantaged groups to obtain information and express their grievances 
</p>
<p>by using new communications technologies.17 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the right to participate in political and public 
affairs 
</b></p>
<p>14. Restrictions to the right to participate in political and public affairs, while 
</p>
<p>permissible, must be objective, reasonable, non-discriminatory and provided for by law.18 
</p>
<p>As with other political rights, such as freedoms of assembly and association, opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, any restrictions must be necessary and proportionate. The &#8220;essence&#8221; of the right

<p>should never be affected.19 Several international human rights mechanisms have 
</p>
<p>emphasized that limitations should remain the exception rather than the rule.20 
</p>
<p>15. Limiting political participation on the grounds of intellectual or psychosocial 
</p>
<p>impairment and the imposition of linguistic requirements for candidates for public office or 
</p>
<p>the automatic disenfranchisement of detainees, convicted felons or people under 
</p>
<p>guardianship have been found by human rights mechanisms to constitute unreasonable and 
</p>
<p>discriminatory restrictions on the exercise of political and public participation rights.21 
</p>
<p><b> A. General challenges to participation in political and public affairs 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Shrinking of the democratic space 
</b></p>
<p>16. Lack of political will or deliberate strategies to monopolize decision-making by 
</p>
<p>those in power are among the main challenges to the realization of participation rights. In 
</p>
<p>many instances, laws are enacted and applied arbitrarily to deny participation and 
</p>
<p>intimidation and persecution are employed to pressure individuals to decide in a particular 
</p>
<p>way.22 In many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending 
</p>
<p>human rights face threats, harassment and insecurity, including when advocating for the 
</p>
<p>right to participate in political and public affairs. The absence of free, pluralistic and 
</p>
<p>independent media also jeopardizes the realization of participation in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs, since the media can be crucial in making citizens aware of their rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The shrinking of the democratic space has also been considered by human rights 
</p>
<p>experts as threatening the full enjoyment of civil and political rights and resulting in 
</p>
<p>ordinary people&#8217;s lives being changed without their input and against their will.23 Some 
</p>
<p>States impose not only legal but also practical barriers to participation, notably by 
</p>
<p>restricting the Internet and the flow of information online through increasingly 
</p>
<p>sophisticated means. Mass surveillance, the interception of digital communications and the 
</p>
<p>collection of personal data is another chilling factor on public participation, especially when 
</p>
<p>those measures target political dissidents.24 
</p>
<p><b>  General decline in traditional forms of political participation 
</b></p>
<p>18. It has been noted by some organizations that voter turnout at general elections in 
</p>
<p>established democracies has declined steadily over a number of decades in the population 
</p>
<p>as a whole,25 with youth absenteeism being the highest.26 Many States are also experiencing 
</p>
<p>declining levels of membership in political parties and interest groups. Election results do

<p>not always correspond to the wishes of the electorate and political parties around the world 
</p>
<p>have struggled to effectively address economic and other issues of primary interest, leaving 
</p>
<p>individuals feeling disillusioned with what they see as increasingly empty campaign 
</p>
<p>slogans.27 This lack of trust in political parties, owing notably to democratic shortcomings 
</p>
<p>in their internal structures, has negatively translated into a lower level of public trust in 
</p>
<p>State institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Structural inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>19. Some individuals or groups are often denied the opportunity to participate in the 
</p>
<p>conduct of public affairs because of socioeconomic inequalities. Individuals and groups 
</p>
<p>concerned are confronted with a vicious circle: the greater the inequality, the less the 
</p>
<p>participation; the less the participation, the greater the inequality. This perpetuates the 
</p>
<p>privilege of the elite who may be the only ones able to influence formal and informal 
</p>
<p>processes directly.28 
</p>
<p>20. Lack of decision-making power is a universal and basic characteristic of 
</p>
<p>underrepresented and marginalized groups. Their right to participate in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs is hampered by multiple compounding obstacles. Discrimination and stigma, poverty 
</p>
<p>and mistrust of authorities all limit the possibilities and incentives for individuals belonging 
</p>
<p>to such groups to participate fully in society and make them particularly vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>corruption or co-option.29 
</p>
<p>21. While the general right to participate in political and public affairs is a prerequisite 
</p>
<p>of democracy, it is not, in itself, sufficient. Processes need to be put in place to ensure that 
</p>
<p>all segments of society are able to influence agenda-setting and decision-making. Pro forma 
</p>
<p>participatory processes only reinforce existing power structures and the feeling of 
</p>
<p>exclusion.30 
</p>
<p>22. In some cases, private corporations and lobby groups take precedence over other 
</p>
<p>less-resourced and less-organized voices. The Independent Expert on the promotion of a 
</p>
<p>democratic and equitable international order recently denounced secret negotiations of free 
</p>
<p>trade and investment agreements as being a threat to human rights since they exclude key 
</p>
<p>stakeholder groups from the process. He warned that the reality of economic, political and 
</p>
<p>military imbalance leads to pressures on the weak that have little choice but to bend to 
</p>
<p>various forms of coercion threats, sanctions or carrot-and-stick practices.31 
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges affecting women and specific groups 
</b></p>
<p>23. Various social groups face specific challenges and discrimination. Intersecting and 
</p>
<p>compound forms of discrimination have an especially devastating effect on the right to 
</p>
<p>participate in political and public affairs. Roma women, for example, have been denied 
</p>
<p>access to political and public participation rights on the grounds of their minority status, 
</p>
<p>citizenship and gender. People living in poverty experience discrimination, not only on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of poverty itself, but also due to membership in other disadvantaged groups, such 
</p>
<p>as indigenous peoples, non-nationals or people living with HIV/AIDS.

<p><b>  Women 
</b></p>
<p>24. In its general recommendation No. 23 (1997) on political and public life, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women identified a number of 
</p>
<p>barriers to the equal participation of women in political and public life, including traditional 
</p>
<p>cultural values and religious beliefs, absence of social services, violence against women, 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s economic dependence on men, negative societal attitudes towards women and 
</p>
<p>harmful gender stereotyping. The Committee further noted that women were excluded from 
</p>
<p>top-ranking positions in Government, the civil service, public administration, the judiciary 
</p>
<p>and justice systems. As of 1 May 2015, the average proportion of women in parliaments 
</p>
<p>worldwide was a mere 22.1 per cent.32 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice identified other obstacles to women&#8217;s participation in political and public affairs, 
</p>
<p>such as unwillingness of political parties to place women in realistic positions on their 
</p>
<p>candidates lists; the fact that women tend to have fewer resources than men for election 
</p>
<p>campaigns; attacks, threats and sexual harassment against women candidates; and non-
</p>
<p>recognition of the right of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>women who are outspoken as leaders, community workers and politicians often face 
</p>
<p>harassment and stigmatization, as they are perceived as undermining traditional family 
</p>
<p>values.33 Furthermore, women human rights defenders are exposed to gender-specific 
</p>
<p>threats and violence, including gender-based verbal abuse, sexual abuse or rape, 
</p>
<p>intimidation and murder.34 
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>26. In its advice No. 2 (2011) on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in 
</p>
<p>decision-making (see A/HRC/18/42, annex), the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples notes that indigenous peoples are among the most excluded, 
</p>
<p>marginalized and disadvantaged social groups in the world. Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples has had a negative impact on their ability to freely determine the 
</p>
<p>direction that their own communities should take as well as their ability to have control 
</p>
<p>over natural resources and to participate in decision-making with regard to matters that 
</p>
<p>affect their human rights, including legislation.  
</p>
<p>27. In her 2014 annual report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples identified several obstacles that affect the ability of indigenous peoples to fully 
</p>
<p>enjoy their right to participate in political and public affairs, including the failure or 
</p>
<p>reluctance of governments to recognize indigenous peoples; challenges in the development 
</p>
<p>of practical implementation measures; ongoing negative attitudes towards indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples on the part of broader societies in which they live; and social and economic 
</p>
<p>conditions preventing the full exercise of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights.35 
</p>
<p><b>  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
</p>
<p>and Linguistic Minorities affirms the right of minorities to participate effectively in 
</p>
<p>cultural, religious, social, economic and public life.36 Yet, such persons remain 
</p>
<p>underrepresented in the political and public processes and governing institutions in most 
</p>

<p>countries. They are either actively or intentionally restricted from participation or there is a 
</p>
<p>lack of political will to dismantle structural barriers to their full participation.37 
</p>
<p>29. Institutional discrimination can lead to multiple disfranchisements. For example, in 
</p>
<p>many countries there is evidence of overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice 
</p>
<p>system. Coupled with restrictions on the right of prisoners to vote, this has a 
</p>
<p>disproportionate impact on the realization of the right of minority groups to participate in 
</p>
<p>political and public affairs.38 In many cases, minorities also face systemic discrimination in 
</p>
<p>access to civil registration and identity documentation, which further impedes the 
</p>
<p>realization of their right to participate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>30. Some persons with disabilities are unable to participate fully in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs owing to their legal status, lack of access to information and prejudicial attitudes. In 
</p>
<p>its general comment No. 1 (2014) on equal recognition before the law (art. 12), the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, noted that restrictions to legal 
</p>
<p>capacity have been used to exclude persons with disabilities from political participation, 
</p>
<p>especially the right to vote. Some States have an automatic or quasi-automatic exclusion 
</p>
<p>provision in their legislation, denying the right to political participation for all people under 
</p>
<p>a protective measure, regardless of their actual level of functional ability.39 
</p>
<p>31. Furthermore, even when there are no legal obstacles to participation of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, such participation is often hampered by an inhospitable environment and 
</p>
<p>practical restrictions, such as inaccessible polling stations, lack of information, campaign 
</p>
<p>material in accessible formats and a general high level of prejudice.40 
</p>
<p><b>  Other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>32. Non-citizens, including migrants, refugees and stateless persons seldom have a voice 
</p>
<p>in the public and political affairs of their country of residence. The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the human rights of migrants noted that groups of migrant origin were frequently 
</p>
<p>underrepresented in the political process even when most of their members were nationals, 
</p>
<p>and that effective citizenship depends on structural opportunities for participation and 
</p>
<p>widespread disposition to use them.41 
</p>
<p>33. Discriminatory requirements or overly restrictive conditions for obtaining 
</p>
<p>citizenship often impede effective participation. In many States, citizenship is unduly 
</p>
<p>denied to minorities, long-term residents, foreign family members of citizens, stateless 
</p>
<p>persons and other groups. Non-citizens, migrants, and refugees are also frequently denied 
</p>
<p>participation in the public and political affairs of their countries of origin, which  creates a 
</p>
<p>double disfranchisement.42 
</p>
<p>34. Homeless persons and internally displaced persons live on the margins of society 
</p>
<p>and often face discrimination and lack of access to information. In addition, administrative 
</p>

<p>restrictions, such as proof of residence or identity documents requirements, are likely to 
</p>
<p>prevent them from exercising their right to vote.43 
</p>
<p>35. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals around the world face 
</p>
<p>multiple obstacles to assert their right to participate in the conduct of public affairs 
</p>
<p>including as a result of discrimination, stigma, violence, legal sanctions and arbitrary 
</p>
<p>restrictions on their freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly on the basis 
</p>
<p>of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.44 In addition, since identity 
</p>
<p>documents are a pre-requisite to effective enjoyment of many human rights, including 
</p>
<p>electoral rights, transgender persons who are unable to obtain identity documentation that 
</p>
<p>reflects their preferred gender are de facto disfranchised.45 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Best practices and experiences with respect to the right to 
participate in political and public affairs 
</b></p>
<p>36. This section compiles best practices and experiences as reported by States, as well as 
</p>
<p>from other sources, on different forms of political and public participation. Public 
</p>
<p>participation processes have a number of benefits, including improved quality of policy and 
</p>
<p>legislative decisions that are reflective of real needs and enriched with firsthand experience 
</p>
<p>and expertise; enhanced potential for their successful implementation; and ultimately, 
</p>
<p>increased public trust in State institutions.46 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to vote and to be elected 
</b></p>
<p>37. The features of electoral systems, including candidate lists, district size and 
</p>
<p>threshold levels, can have a major impact on inclusiveness and on the number of persons 
</p>
<p>from underrepresented groups elected to office.47 Ghana reported that its Representation of 
</p>
<p>the Peoples Law provided for dividing the country into smaller political units to facilitate 
</p>
<p>public participation. In an effort to facilitate voting for all individuals concerned, many 
</p>
<p>States have adopted alternative ways of voting, such as mobile polling stations, postal 
</p>
<p>voting, and advance voting. Australia deploys remote mobile polling teams across the 
</p>
<p>country &#8212; by road, air and sea &#8212; so that people in remote areas, including indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities, can vote. Poland created separate electoral districts at hospitals, social 
</p>
<p>welfare facilities, detention facilities and students&#8217; halls of residence. 
</p>
<p>38. Electronic voting, if accessible and when guaranteeing the secrecy of the ballot, may 
</p>
<p>also contribute to breaking down the barriers hindering political participation, notably of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, and to increasing turnout. In Estonia, all voters can vote 
</p>
<p>electronically in any election from their homes or another location anywhere in the world. 
</p>
<p>The electronic voting website also provides support for persons with visual impairments. 
</p>
<p>39. Many States have adopted quotas for underrepresented groups to attenuate 
</p>
<p>conditions that perpetuate substantive inequalities. In recent years, gender quotas have been 
</p>
<p>introduced in countries where women historically had limited participation in politics, as in 
</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Jordan. Quotas work best when accompanied by sanctions if they are not 
</p>
<p>respected and when they are closely monitored by independent bodies, including national 
</p>
<p>electoral bodies and human rights institutions.48 Once elected, it is crucial that individuals 
</p>
<p>belonging to marginalized groups have equal opportunity to exercise power and authority.49 
</p>
<p>This can be partly achieved through training in political debate and negotiation techniques 
</p>
<p>and confidence-building measures.50 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation in the conduct of public affairs  
</b></p>
<p>40. Full and effective participation in political and public affairs is best ensured when it 
</p>
<p>rests on a solid legal basis. Hungary, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria have adopted laws 
</p>
<p>on public participation, which require government officials to consult those affected and to 
</p>
<p>take their views into consideration when making decisions. The Finnish Constitution states 
</p>
<p>that public institutions must promote all possibilities for individuals to participate in social 
</p>
<p>matters and to influence the decisions that affect them. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, 
</p>
<p>the 1994 Law of Popular Participation has enabled several initiatives emanating from the 
</p>
<p>communities to translate into municipal public policies.51 
</p>
<p>41. Exercise of the right to participation further depends on transparency and on access 
</p>
<p>to complete information. Information that is free of charge, relevant, up-to-date, 
</p>
<p>understandable and made available well in advance of any participatory process enables 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities to make informed choices.52 Poland has adopted several laws 
</p>
<p>obliging State institutions to publish all draft laws and regulations that are being considered 
</p>
<p>by the Government.53 In Greece, every municipality has the obligation to have an official 
</p>
<p>website on which all decisions issued by the municipal organs are posted. In the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) 
</p>
<p>entitles any person to make a request for information to a public authority, which has to 
</p>
<p>convey the information no later than 12 days following the date of receipt of the request.54 
</p>
<p>In some States, including Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland and France, access to the Internet is 
</p>
<p>recognized as a right.55 The right to information is best guaranteed when it is made 
</p>
<p>available in a manner accessible to the most disadvantaged, taking into account the 
</p>
<p>constraints they suffer, including illiteracy, language barriers and the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>Argentina, indigenous peoples have dedicated radio and television stations, which 
</p>
<p>broadcast information in their languages.  
</p>
<p>42. Several States have put in place consultative mechanisms which involve 
</p>
<p>organizations of underrepresented groups in the development of legislation and policies. 
</p>
<p>Georgia indicated that it also sought international expertise in that regard. Norway created a 
</p>
<p>contact committee for immigrants and the authorities, which advises the Government on the 
</p>
<p>views of persons with an immigrant background with regard to State policy. Bulgaria 
</p>
<p>established an agency for persons with disabilities, which participates in the drafting of 
</p>
<p>regulatory acts that affect them. The Czech Government has a number of advisory bodies 
</p>
<p>(relating, for instance, to Roma, national minorities, gender equality and elderly people)

<p>that bring together representatives of public administration, local governments, the non-
</p>
<p>governmental sector and academia. In Estonia, ministries must include representatives of 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations in the preparation of decisions, draft laws and development 
</p>
<p>plans. Croatia recently used a highly participatory consultation process to develop a 
</p>
<p>strategy for the creation of an enabling environment for civil society, and included key 
</p>
<p>stakeholders from the earliest stages of the consultations so that interested groups could 
</p>
<p>submit comments and proposals. Various methods of inclusion were used, from facilitated 
</p>
<p>meetings and working groups to electronic consultations and surveys.56 
</p>
<p>43. Participation shows best results when meaningful decisions, including those on 
</p>
<p>resource allocation, are tabled for consideration and discussion. The Constitution of the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic foresees an approbatory referendum for future constitutional 
</p>
<p>amendments that concern fundamental rights. In Germany, some federal states have 
</p>
<p>engaged in a broad and inclusive process to ensure that citizens participate in public sector 
</p>
<p>reform, while several cities have introduced participatory budgeting. Poland reported that it 
</p>
<p>had introduced participatory budgeting at the municipal level. Residents are invited to vote 
</p>
<p>on projects and those which receive the highest number of votes are selected. In Greece, 
</p>
<p>municipalities and regions may establish committees composed of civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives, which are then consulted by local government before it draws up the 
</p>
<p>budget and social policy measures. 
</p>
<p>44. Participation mechanisms are most effective when they are premised on 
</p>
<p>empowerment and aimed at building the capacity, social capital, confidence, rights 
</p>
<p>awareness and knowledge of individuals.57 This includes strengthening skills and capacity 
</p>
<p>of the public and of officials, and devoting resources to long-term, sustainable participatory 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. Several States, such as Estonia, have adopted manuals for public institutions 
</p>
<p>to initiate or strengthen participatory practices in the preparation of draft laws, policies and 
</p>
<p>development plans.  
</p>
<p>45. It is equally important that the right to participation be enforceable by law and that 
</p>
<p>the denial of participation be open to challenge through the courts at low cost. The Austrian 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman Board guarantees legal assistance for all individuals, free of charge and by 
</p>
<p>phone, e-mail or through the electronic complaint form on the institution&#8217;s website. The 
</p>
<p>Czech Republic offers a system of free or low-cost legal assistance to victims of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and other human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to equal access to public service 
</b></p>
<p>46. Several States reported treating all persons in an equal manner based on the principle 
</p>
<p>of open competition for entering public service. However, open competition alone, in 
</p>
<p>situations of deep-rooted structural inequality, may in fact constitute discrimination. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination stated that to treat in an 
</p>
<p>equal manner persons or groups whose situations are objectively different will constitute 
</p>
<p>discrimination in effect, as will the unequal treatment of persons whose situations are 
</p>
<p>objectively the same.58

<p>47. Australia stated that public service agencies were required to establish diversity 
</p>
<p>programmes, including affirmative measures, to ensure that the diversity of the Australian 
</p>
<p>community was reflected in strategies designed to attract, recruit and retain employees. The 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea uses a separate recruitment process for some underrepresented groups, 
</p>
<p>while Poland indicated that if a recruitment process resulted in the shortlisting of a person 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, she or he would be considered first. Paraguay and Turkey established, by 
</p>
<p>law, a minimum quota of 5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, for the recruitment of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities to public service positions. Uruguay has established a public 
</p>
<p>employment programme with specific quotas for persons of African descent, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and transgender persons. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Other forms of political and public participation 
</b></p>
<p>48. A number of States reported on citizens&#8217; initiatives which, when supported by a 
</p>
<p>certain number of signatories, can become legislative proposals to national or municipal 
</p>
<p>institutions. Finland reported that the initiative on legislation on same-sex marriage was 
</p>
<p>most successful, and was subsequently approved by Parliament in 2014. Ireland established 
</p>
<p>a parliamentary online petitions system, which enables members of the public to take their 
</p>
<p>policy concerns directly to Parliament and influence the parliamentary agenda. Some 
</p>
<p>States, such as Poland, Switzerland, the United States of America and the Bolivarian 
</p>
<p>Republic of Venezuela, provide for recall elections, whereby a predefined minimum 
</p>
<p>number of voters can trigger a referendum to remove an elected official from office before 
</p>
<p>the end of his or her term. 
</p>
<p>49. In recent years, States have used information and communication technologies to 
</p>
<p>promote more efficient service delivery and allow greater public access to information. In 
</p>
<p>2014, for the first time, all 193 Member States of the United Nations had national websites, 
</p>
<p>which significantly increased transparency and access to information. The United Nations 
</p>
<p>E-Government Survey 2014 ranked the Republic of Korea, Australia and Singapore as the 
</p>
<p>countries with the most transparent and efficient e-Governments.  
</p>
<p>50. The rise of information and communication technologies has also affected the ways 
</p>
<p>in which citizens perceive political participation and democracy.59 Online campaigns and 
</p>
<p>protests organized through the Internet have provided new avenues for political 
</p>
<p>mobilization. In Sierra Leone, election observers use mobile phones and the Internet to 
</p>
<p>report irregularities during elections. Social media have often been cited as having played 
</p>
<p>an important role during the 2011 uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East.60  
</p>
<p><b> E. Best practices relating to women and specific groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women 
</b></p>
<p>51. States shared best practices on the integration of women in public decision-making. 
</p>
<p>Bahrain established the Supreme Council for Women, which expresses views and makes 
</p>
<p>decisions on issues relating to the status of women and implements programmes for the 
</p>
<p>political empowerment of women. Mozambique involved women&#8217;s groups in the revision 
</p>
<p>of its land policy framework, which contributed to the inclusion of important legal 
</p>
<p>provisions to uphold gender equality.61 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 59 See contribution from OSCE-ODIHR, p. 9. 
</p>
<p> 60 A/HRC/27/33, para. 23; and A/HRC/17/27, para. 2. 
</p>
<p> 61 See contribution from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, p. 2. </p>


<p>52. Several States reported that they encouraged political parties to adopt effective 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure that women are placed in top positions on candidates lists in order to 
</p>
<p>increase their chances of being fully represented in senior positions in party structures. 
</p>
<p>Other States have established temporary special measures, envisaged by article 4 (1) of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, such as 
</p>
<p>quotas, which require political parties to include a certain percentage of women in their 
</p>
<p>candidates lists. Legislation in Albania provides for the representation of at least 30 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the underrepresented sex in all government and political bodies, including all decision-
</p>
<p>making positions in public administration, the judiciary, the police force, peacekeeping 
</p>
<p>missions and senior political and electoral processes. The Electoral Code of Panama 
</p>
<p>requires that nomination lists of political parties presented for primaries and internal 
</p>
<p>elections include at least 50 per cent women. Contributions also signaled the importance of 
</p>
<p>including issues relating to women in election campaigns and platforms and to appoint 
</p>
<p>women to senior decision-making roles in the executive, legislative and judiciary.  
</p>
<p>53. A number of States indicated that they had codified gender parity in electoral lists, 
</p>
<p>notably through a &#8220;zipper&#8221; requirement for alternating women and men candidates on party 
</p>
<p>lists.62 Some States, such as Tunisia, issue sanctions when parties do not comply with the 
</p>
<p>legal measures aimed at ensuring gender equality, such as removing the party&#8217;s electoral 
</p>
<p>list from the ballot. 
</p>
<p>54. Public funding can also be an incentive to further gender equality, for example, 
</p>
<p>where allocation of public funds to political parties is made contingent on compliance with 
</p>
<p>requirements for women&#8217;s participation. In Georgia, political parties with at least 30 per 
</p>
<p>cent women on their candidates lists receive a 30 per cent higher financial assistance than 
</p>
<p>other parties. The Moldovan Parliament approved in the first reading a draft law on 
</p>
<p>financing of political parties and election campaigns, which makes funding contingent on 
</p>
<p>the number of women who obtain elective mandates. In Ireland, political parties that do not 
</p>
<p>select at least 30 per cent women candidates for the general election face losing half of their 
</p>
<p>State funding. In Honduras, 10 per cent of the public funding allocated to each political 
</p>
<p>party is to be used exclusively for the training and advancement of women in politics.  
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>55. Indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate in the conduct of public affairs should be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed in good faith and through the representatives that they have chosen in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their own procedures.63 Norway reached an agreement on consultation 
</p>
<p>procedures between the Central Government and the S&#225;mediggi (Sami Parliament). The 
</p>
<p>State authorities shall, as early as possible, inform S&#225;mediggi about relevant initiatives that 
</p>
<p>may directly affect the Sami, including on issues such as language, religion, preservation of 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage, education, land ownership and land-use fisheries, mineral exploration, 
</p>
<p>extraction activities, biodiversity and nature conservation. Argentina established the  
</p>
<p>Indigenous Participation Council to ensure the participation of indigenous peoples in all 
</p>
<p>matters affecting their rights.64 
</p>
<p>56. In applying International Labour Organization Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1989 (No. 169) in their judgements, several national and regional tribunals 
</p>
<p>have found that the non-participation by indigenous groups in consultation or decision-

<p>making processes violated their rights and, as such, a broad set of measures have been 
</p>
<p>judicially ordered, from invalidation of approval for Government projects, especially in the 
</p>
<p>mining, forestry and energy sectors, to remedies for those affected.65 In March 2010, the 
</p>
<p>Ecuadorian Constitutional Court declared that mining exploitation in the territories of 
</p>
<p>indigenous, afro-Ecuadorean and Montubian communities, peoples and nations, must 
</p>
<p>always be subjected  to prior consultations with the relevant communities, as provided for 
</p>
<p>in the Constitution. In September 2014, a federal judge of the United States of America 
</p>
<p>ordered the state of Alaska to translate information on early voting and initiatives relating 
</p>
<p>to the November 2014 ballot into Yup'ik dialects for Alaska indigenous voters with limited 
</p>
<p>English.66 
</p>
<p><b>  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>57. States ensure participation of minorities by different means. In addition to electoral 
</p>
<p>systems based on proportional representation, measures such as seats reserved for 
</p>
<p>minorities in elected bodies and favorable delimitation of the constituencies contribute to 
</p>
<p>supporting the political participation of minorities.67 Kazakhstan reported that it made 
</p>
<p>electoral materials accessible to linguistic minorities by translating them into the minority 
</p>
<p>languages. 
</p>
<p>58. Some States reported that minorities benefited from lower thresholds to enter elected 
</p>
<p>bodies. In Slovenia, the electoral law provides for a separate election for a Roma 
</p>
<p>representative in municipalities that have a significant Roma population if, during the 
</p>
<p>general local elections, no Roma representative succeeded in securing enough votes to be 
</p>
<p>elected. Additional measures include the devolution of certain powers to minorities by 
</p>
<p>means of a federal or autonomous arrangement; establishment of an informal council of 
</p>
<p>minority representatives or a statutory body, which is consulted by the executive on matters 
</p>
<p>of concern to the minority.68 
</p>
<p>59. Once representatives of minorities have obtained a seat in Parliament, their position 
</p>
<p>may be further reinforced by certain measures. In particular, they may be given special 
</p>
<p>procedural rights with regard to questions pertaining to minority issues, which may range 
</p>
<p>from the right to initiate new legislation to vetoing bills on minority issues.69 In Belgium, 
</p>
<p>the Assembly and the Senate are divided into language groups for certain issues, which then 
</p>
<p>have to be decided upon by a majority in each group and an overall majority of two thirds 
</p>
<p>of votes.70 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>60. Some States, such as Ecuador, reported that they conducted information campaigns 
</p>
<p>and awareness-raising initiatives to promote the participation of persons with disabilities in 
</p>
<p>political and public life. Many States have also adopted a wide range of legislative, policy 
</p>
<p>and practical measures to remove existing physical barriers and improve the accessibility of 
</p>
<p>voting stations. Belarus indicated that blind persons are provided with information 
</p>
<p>materials about candidates in Braille and that the ballot papers have Braille stencils and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>voters with poor vision are provided with magnifying lenses. Those measures enable voters 
</p>
<p>with visual impairments to vote independently. States also provided information on the 
</p>
<p>measures adopted to allow persons with disabilities to be accompanied by a person of their 
</p>
<p>choice when casting their vote. Some States reported that they organized regular training 
</p>
<p>opportunities for all officials responsible for elections on how to interact with persons with 
</p>
<p>different impairments and how to support them in the exercise of the right to vote. 
</p>
<p>61. One of the best ways to guarantee that the measures adopted are appropriate is to 
</p>
<p>involve people with disabilities in their design. Norway indicated that organizations 
</p>
<p>representing persons with disabilities participated in the testing of electoral equipment and 
</p>
<p>that, at the general election in 2009, there was no significant difference in voter 
</p>
<p>participation among people with disabilities and the general population. 
</p>
<p>62. Lifting all restrictions on the political participation of persons with psychosocial or 
</p>
<p>intellectual disabilities is another crucial step to the full implementation of right to political 
</p>
<p>and public participation.71Austria lifted all restrictions on the right of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities to vote and to be elected; persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities 
</p>
<p>are allowed to exercise their political rights on an equal basis with others.72 
</p>
<p><b>  Other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>63. A growing number of States allow some form of local electoral involvement of non-
</p>
<p>citizens within their territory.73 Norway reported providing grants to immigrant 
</p>
<p>organizations to contribute to participation, dialogue and interaction. A number of countries 
</p>
<p>have developed systems of consultation with migrant communities at the national and local 
</p>
<p>levels. In Italy, several municipalities have set up consultative councils for foreigners, who 
</p>
<p>represent either a country or a geographical area.74 Portugal appointed a high commissioner 
</p>
<p>for immigrants and ethnic minorities, whose role is to consult immigrant organizations on 
</p>
<p>proposed draft legislation and on the implementation of laws that have a direct impact on 
</p>
<p>them.75 
</p>
<p>64. The Committee on the Rights of the Child called on governments to make renewed 
</p>
<p>efforts to ensure that children&#8217;s views are heard and taken into account.76A positive 
</p>
<p>initiative in that regard is the Children in Action project that was launched in South Africa 
</p>
<p>to include children&#8217;s participation in parliamentary hearings and public debates.77 In 
</p>
<p>accordance with its Constitution, which establishes the right of children and adolescents to 
</p>
<p>social participation and to be consulted in matters affecting them, Ecuador created an 
</p>
<p>advisory council on childhood and adolescence, in 2007. As regards young voters, in 2012, 
</p>
<p>Argentina lowered its voting age from 18 to 16, thus allowing close to a million and a half 
</p>
<p>young people to be included in the electoral roll. Other countries that allow 16 year olds to

</p>
<p>provides for one quarter of the seats on the local council to be allocated to youth under 35. 
</p>
<p>65. In order to overcome obstacles to the effective protection of the right of lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex persons to participate in political and public affairs, it is 
</p>
<p>crucial for States to combat violence, repeal discriminatory laws and ensure that anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination legislation includes sexual orientation and gender identity among prohibited 
</p>
<p>grounds and also protects intersex persons from discrimination.78 Fiji recently added a 
</p>
<p>clause in its Constitution prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, 
</p>
<p>gender identity and gender expression. Anti-discrimination laws have also been 
</p>
<p>strengthened in several States, including Australia, Chile, Cuba, Georgia, Malta, Moldova 
</p>
<p>and Montenegro. Furthermore, Brazil, Canada, France, Norway, South Africa, the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Uruguay are combatting violence and 
</p>
<p>stigmatization through anti-hate crime laws, national action plans and public education 
</p>
<p>campaigns aimed at countering homophobic and transphobic violence and discrimination.79  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Despite its key importance as a human right in itself and as an enabler of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of other human rights, the right to participate in political and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>affairs continues to face obstacles to its full realization. Unreasonable and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory restrictions, be they on the grounds of race, colour, sex, disability, 
</b></p>
<p><b>language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth 
</b></p>
<p><b>or other status, illegitimately limit the exercise of this right.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Insufficient political will to allow full public participation and legal or practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to discourage participation and restrict the democratic space constitute the  
</b></p>
<p><b>main challenges to the implementation of the right to participate in political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public affairs. Existing structural inequalities, such as poverty, and a decline in 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional forms of political participation are additional challenges to political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public participation. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Discrimination, including intersecting and multiple forms of discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and group-specific challenges prevent the full participation of women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples, members of minorities, persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination ranges from gender stereotyping to non-recognition of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples, from lack of representation of members of minorities in governing 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions to physical barriers that render polling stations inaccessible to persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>To be fully enjoyed, the right to participate in political and public affairs 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires the exercise of a number of other internationally protected rights, such as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedoms of opinion and expression (including access to information), freedoms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and of peaceful assembly. Those rights must be guaranteed to all, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including non-citizens, migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>States have taken a number of measures to address the above-mentioned 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges and to increase participation in political and public affairs. With regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to vote and to be elected, several States have adopted alternative ways of 
</b></p>
<p><b>voting, such as electronic voting, mobile polling stations, postal voting and advance 
</b></p>
<p><b>voting to increase participation at elections. A growing number of States have 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 78 A/HRC/29/23, paras. 19, 78 and 79. 
</p>
<p> 79 See also A/HRC/29/23, paras. 71&#8211;75. </p>


<p><b>extended limited voting rights to non-citizens and some allow non-citizens to stand as 
</b></p>
<p><b>candidates in local elections and be members of the boards of self-governing bodies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Quotas may increase access to elected positions for women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transgender individuals and members of minorities. Quotas work best when they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitored and accompanied by sanctions for non-compliance. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Full and effective participation in political and public affairs is best ensured 
</b></p>
<p><b>when the right itself, combined with the right to equality and non-discrimination, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognized in national legislation and when limitations to this right are exceptional 
</b></p>
<p><b>and justified by reasonable and objective criteria. The right to participate in political 
</b></p>
<p><b>and public affairs should be enforceable by law and its denial should be open to 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial challenge. Appropriate remedies should be available if a violation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>established. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Legal frameworks that include the explicit right of individuals and groups to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any policy, programme or 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy that affects their rights, at the local, national and international levels are 
</b></p>
<p><b>most conducive to the full realization of the right to participate in political and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>affairs.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Exercise of the right to participate in political and public affairs further 
</b></p>
<p><b>depends on transparency and on access to full, updated and understandable 
</b></p>
<p><b>information. This information should be made available free of charge and with 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient time in advance. Participation in political and public affairs is strengthened 
</b></p>
<p><b>when important decisions, such as those on budget and resource allocation, are open 
</b></p>
<p><b>for discussion. Participation mechanisms should be premised on empowerment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Equal access to public service, as a component of the right to political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public participation, can be promoted through diversity programmes, separate 
</b></p>
<p><b>recruitments processes or affirmative measures.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Public life has also been enriched through new forms of participation, such as 
</b></p>
<p>citizens&#8217;<b> initiatives and e-Government, and through the use of information and 
communication technologies. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>As regards participation of women in political and public affairs, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>reported encouraging political parties to adopt effective measures to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>women are placed in top positions on candidates lists so as to have better chances of 
</b></p>
<p><b>being elected as well as fully represented in senior positions in the structures of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties. It is also important to include issues relating to women in election campaigns 
</b></p>
<p><b>and platforms and to appoint women to senior decision-making roles in the executive, 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative and judiciary. A number of States referred to the </b>&#8220;zipper&#8221;<b> requirement for 
electoral lists, which alternate women and men candidates, and to State funding to 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties being contingent on compliance with requirements for increased 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s<b> representation.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>With respect to indigenous peoples, measures to increase their participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>include making information available in indigenous languages and consultation with 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous bodies. In the event that consultation does not take place, various measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been judicially ordered, from invalidation of approval for Government projects, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially in the mining, forestry and energy sectors, to remedies for those affected. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>States also referred to a number of best practices relating to participation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and public affairs by members of minorities. Some States reported on 
</b></p>
<p><b>lowered thresholds for minorities to join elected bodies; others mentioned the system 
</b></p>
<p><b>of seats reserved for minorities in elected bodies, favorable delimitation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>constituencies, or the creation of a council of minority representatives. Minorities in </b></p>


<p><b>Parliament may also be given special procedural rights, such as the right to initiate or 
</b></p>
<p><b>to veto bills regarding issues that directly affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Examples of measures adopted by States to implement the right of persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities to participate in political and public affairs include information 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigns; the removal of existing physical barriers; the availability of information 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ballot papers in accessible formats, including through the use of new technologies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the involvement of persons with disabilities in the design and testing of electoral 
</b></p>
<p><b>equipment. Training sessions for election officials and the lifting of restrictions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>political participation of persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities are also 
</b></p>
<p><b>crucial.
