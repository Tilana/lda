</p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction and general comments 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Mr. Jorge Bustamante, has a 
mandate to request and receive communications from a variety of sources, including from 
migrants themselves on violations of the human rights of migrants and their families. This 
mandate was renewed in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>2. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-
country basis, summaries of general and individual allegations, as well as urgent appeals 
transmitted to Governments between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2007, as well as 
replies received until 10 February 2008. Observations made by the Special Rapporteur have 
also been included where applicable. 
</p>
<p>3. It is important to recall that communications sent to Governments contain only 
requests for information in situations that raise concern, but also very frequently address 
situations where information regarding certain facts and actions needs clarification. The 
establishment of constructive dialogue with Governments is a crucial element to this process, 
as Governments have the primary responsibility for the protection of all persons under their 
jurisdiction and for the implementation of human rights in their countries. 
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does 
he support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The 
communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have a humanitarian and preventive purpose, 
and do not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies. Governments are requested to clarify 
the substance of the allegations, take steps to protect the person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to 
investigate the allegations and prosecute and impose appropriate sanctions on any person 
guilty of violations of human rights.  
</p>
<p>5. In this report, the names of individual victims and alleged perpetrators have been 
replaced by initials in order to protect their privacy and to prevent further victimization as 
well as to avoid pre-judgement of the alleged perpetrators. Country specific communications 
sent and Government replies received, are presented in the language received. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Trends and observations 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 25 
communications on violations on the rights of migrants to 22 Member States.  
</p>
<p>7. Of the communications that were sent, 14<b> </b>were in the form of urgent appeals because 
a human rights violation was ongoing or imminent and there was a need to inform the 
Government authorities about the allegations received without any delay, whilst the remaining 
communications sent, were letters of allegations, pertaining to allegations of human rights 
violations that had already occurred or reflected longstanding concerns. 
</p>
<p>8. Communications were sent to the following countries: Angola, Bulgaria, China, 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Guinea, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, 
Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Mozambique, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia (2), 
South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland (2), United States of America (2) and Yemen. </p>

          page 5 
 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur has continued to cooperate with other mandate-holders in his 
work. A total of 21 communications were sent jointly by the Special Rapporteur and the 
following special procedures mandate-holders:  
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (2); 
 - The Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, degrading or inhumane treatment 
(10); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance (2); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (2); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (8); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
(4); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children (3); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression (1); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (4); 
 - The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders (1); 
</p>
<p> - The independent expert on minority issues (1); 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context (1); 
</p>
<p> - The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (6). 
</p>
<p>10. The situations in which violations of the human rights of migrants are alleged to have 
occurred during the period under review, giving rise to the intervention of the Special 
Rapporteur, include allegations of: (a) arbitrary detention, without any opportunity to 
challenge the legality of their detention before a court, and in some cases, migrants being 
physically and mentally ill-treated while in detention;  (b) summary and extrajudicial 
executions; (c) violence committed by State agents; (d) inhumane conditions of detention; (e) 
ill-treatment in the context of border control; (f) deaths as a result of the excessive use of 
force by members of the police and security forces; (g) impunity for crimes committed against 
immigrants; (h) sexual abuse and sexual exploitation and other forms of violence grounded in 
gender-based discrimination; (i) legislation leading to discrimination and restricting the 
fundamental human rights of migrants; (j) serious human rights violations committed in the 
context of collective deportations of migrants; (k) lack of screening mechanisms to review the 
individual circumstances of the migrants that have been expulsed, in order to ensure that their 
return would not expose them to risk of torture or other serious human rights violations;  (l) 
attacks against human rights activist working on migration issues; (m) trafficking in persons, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>particularly women and children; (n) political campaigns attacking foreigners; (o) violence 
and exploitation of women domestic workers; (p) restrictions on freedom of movement; (q) 
abusive working conditions imposed by employers, sometimes under conditions similar to 
slavery or forced labour; (r) withholding of passports; (s) non-payment of wages; (t) torture; 
(u) confiscation of a migrant&#8217;s belongings and separation of family members during the 
expulsion process; (v) migrants are not provided with an opportunity to challenge their 
forcible removal; (w) holding children among the detainees; (x) illegal international adoptions 
of minors; (y) discrimination and violations of the right to adequate housing, including being 
subjected to forced evictions; (z) no access to legal representation or to consular assistance 
while in detention, and sometimes not being able to benefit from adequate translation during 
trials. 
</p>
<p>11. Only 12 of the 25 communications sent out, received a response from the concerned 
Governments. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all Governments that have 
responded to his communications for their collaboration. He would also like to remind 
Governments that have not responded to do so, and to address all concerns raised in each 
communication. 
</p>
<p>12. It is interesting to note that the largest number of the total joint communications (21) 
was sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture (10), followed by the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (8), and the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (6).  In addition, the Special Rapporteur has also 
addressed laws, regulations, drafts and specific legal provisions which seemed to discriminate 
against migrants. Three letters were sent in this respect. </p>

<p> <b>SUMMARY OF COMMUNICATIONS SENT TO GOVERNMENTS 
AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 13 December 2007 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding information 
received about the ongoing detention and deportation of a large number of Congolese 
nationals from Angola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo since at least 2005.   
</p>
<p>14. According to the reports received, serious human rights violations had been committed 
against Congolese deportees, allegedly by the Angolan security forces at the border between 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.  These abuses reportedly targeted groups 
of migrant workers mainly composed of Congolese citizens who were involved in informal 
diamond-mining activities in Angola. 
</p>
<p>15. The violations reported include the systematic use of physical and sexual violence, 
confiscation of the migrant&#8217;s belongings and separation of family members during the 
expulsion process. Allegedly, women were systematically raped by Angolan security forces, 
on many occasions in front of their children or in public. According to the information 
received, rapes took place during women&#8217;s expulsion from their homes, in provisional 
detention facilities, at the checkpoints and during their transport to the border.  
</p>
<p>16. Reports indicate that the health situation of the expelled migrants is a major concern. 
As most of them have been involved in informal diamond mining, they and their families, 
including children, have allegedly been forced to submit to invasive body searches (including 
the anal and vaginal cavities) to uncover hidden diamonds. According to the information 
received, the searches are being conducted in such a manner that they might cause 
psychological and physical trauma to the deportees.  
</p>
<p>17. It is further alleged that the mental and physical health of women victims of sexual 
violence is of particular concern. It has been reported that they suffer from various pains in 
their vagina and lower stomach, and have been deeply traumatized by the abuse they suffered. 
Most of them have not received any health care upon their arrival to the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, according to the information received, migrants would have been kept in 
incommunicado detention in harsh conditions before their deportations, subjected to beatings 
and other forms of ill-treatment, having been denied food and water provisions, both while in 
detention and during their deportation to the Congolese border. Moreover, there are reports of 
deaths due to exhaustion or maltreatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Angola did not reply to his 
communication. He would like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the 
Government of Angola to these allegations, and would be particularly interested to know 
whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government</b> 
</p>
<p>20. On 22 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, regarding <b>Mr. A.K.</b>, journalist by profession, and a dual Turkmen and Russian 
national.  
</p>
<p>21. According to the information received, A.K. was arrested on 19 February 2007 in the 
port city of Varna, Bulgaria, by police agents reportedly following a formal request for 
extradition from Turkmen authorities. A.K. has been living in Bulgaria since 2001 and 
obtained refugee status in March 2004.  
</p>
<p>22. It is alleged that the Government of Turkmenistan requested his extradition on charges 
of embezzlement and allegations of theft of 40 million of United States dollars in connection 
with A.K.&#8217;s activities as a bank director in Turkmenistan.  
</p>
<p>23. It is further alleged that a previous request for extradition in 2002 was declined by a 
Bulgarian court in May 2003 for the reason that A.K.&#8217;s political activities had been the actual 
grounds for this request. A.K.&#8217;s was a senior member of Turkmenistan's exiled opposition 
<i>Watan</i> party.  
</p>
<p>24. According to the information received, Bulgarian authorities interrogated him 
regarding members of the Turkmen opposition in exile. 
</p>
<p>25. Reports indicate that the decision to extend A.K&#8217;s detention and to extradite him was 
scheduled to be scrutinised by a Varna court on 23 February 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>26. By letter dated 3 April 2007, the Government transmitted the following information 
regarding A.K. 
</p>
<p>27. It is reported that, A.K was born on 3 March 1957, and has dual Turkmen and Russian 
nationality. He has been living in Bulgaria since 2001.  
</p>
<p>28. On 7 April 2004, the Police Department of the Ministry of Interior issued a 
humanitarian-status ID card for him. He also possesses a humanitarian-status certificate to 
travel abroad.  
</p>
<p>29. A.K was arrested in Varna on 20 February 2007, and detained for 72 hours, on the 
basis of ordinance of the Supreme Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Cassation about the crime he was 
accused of, and about the intention of the Turkmen authorities to request his extradition. 
</p>
<p>30. On 21 February 2007, the Prosecutor General of Bulgaria received a letter from the 
Prosecutor General of Turkmenistan with a request for extradition of A.K on charges of 
embezzlement and allegations of theft of some US$ 40 million under articles 229 and 187 of 
the Criminal Code of Turkmenistan.  </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 9 
 
</p>
<p>31. It is also reported that, on 22 May 2003, the District Court of Varna declined a 
previous request for extradition of A.K on the grounds that the prosecution was based on 
political motives.  
</p>
<p>32. According to the information received, when A.K was arrested on 20 February 2007. 
He requested that the Consulate General of the Russian Federation be informed. It is alleged 
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this, as requested, to the Consulate General. 
Furthermore, the Supreme Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Cassation informed the Embassy of the 
Russian Federation in Sofia. 
</p>
<p>33. On 22 February, the District Court of Varna, following the request of the Varna 
District Prosecutor prescribed the detention of A.K for 40 days (until 30 of March 2007).  
</p>
<p>34. Information received indicated that Mr. A.K lodged a complaint against the arrest 
which was confirmed by the Varna Court of Appeal on 27 February 2007. 
</p>
<p>35. It is further alleged that the decision of the Court of Appeal regarding the detention of 
A.K. is final and there is no further possibility of appeal.  
</p>
<p>36. The Court of Appeal also specified that the Regional Court of Varna would consider 
the case in substance as a first instance.  
</p>
<p>37. The Government reported that the rights of A.K. or more precisely, his rights under 
article 9 (rights to freedom and security) and article 14 (right to equal treatment) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, were integrally safeguarded by the 
Bulgarian authorities.  
</p>
<p>38. The Government informed that the request of the Special Rapporteur to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person be 
respected and that the accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations be ensured, 
will be duly noted.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Bulgaria for its detail 
response. 
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 30 November, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning the attacks against the <b>Dagongzhe Centre for Migrant Workers 
(DGZ)</b> and Mr <b>H.Q.</b>  
41. According to the information received, the DGZ Centre is a non-governmental 
organization that provides migrant workers in Shenzhen with free legal advice. H.Q. is the 
licence-holder for the organization. 
</p>
<p>42. It is alleged that the centre has suffered several attacks during the last months. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>43. On 11 October 2007 at approximately 7 p.m., an attack occurred when the Dagongzhe 
Centre&#8217;s glass doors were broken by several men armed with steel water pipes while staff 
members were inside the offices. After they broke the doors, the men reportedly left on 
motorcycles parked outside. 
</p>
<p>44. On 14 November 2007, at approximately 4.30 p.m., a similar attack occurred when 
four men armed with steel water pipes broke the doors of the Dagongzhe Centre and 
proceeded to destroy equipment inside the offices, including the furniture and the water 
machine. The men escaped in a white mini-van with the registration plates obscured. 
</p>
<p>45. According to the information received, there were three policemen on patrol outside 
the offices at the time of the attack, who reportedly looked on without taking any action 
against the attackers. Staff members then reported the attack to the local police station. When 
they inquired about the CCTV on the street outside the offices, they were informed by the 
police that it did not have a &#8220;recording function&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>46. Information received also indicated that, on 20 November 2007, at about 3.30 p.m., 
H.Q. was walking in Longhu New Village when he was reportedly attacked from behind by 
two men armed with knives. He was repeatedly stabbed, particularly in the back and legs. The 
men escaped on a motorbike.  
</p>
<p>47. It is reported that H.Q. was taken to hospital and remains in a serious condition. 
</p>
<p>48. It is further alleged that the attacks against H.Q. and the offices of the Dagongzhe 
Centre for Migrant Workers may be directly related to the human rights activities of the 
centre, in particular its work to defend workers&#8217; rights and its recent promotion of labour law 
reform in China.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the 
Government of China to these allegations. He would like to be kept informed of the 
developments of the case.  
</p>
<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication envoy&#233;e au Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>50. Par lettre dat&#233;e du 14 D&#233;cembre 2007, envoy&#233;e conjointement avec la Rapporteuse 
sp&#233;ciale charg&#233;e de la question de la violence contre les femmes, y compris ses causes et ses 
cons&#233;quences et de Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, concernant des renseignements selon 
lesquels, il y aurait eu des violations graves des droits de l&#8217;homme &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard des d&#233;port&#233;s 
congolais, qui apparemment auraient &#233;t&#233; commis par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; angolaises &#224; la 
fronti&#232;re entre  la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo et l&#8217;Angola.  
</p>
<p>51. Selon les rapports re&#231;us, ces violations ont &#233;t&#233; sciemment dirig&#233;es vers des groupes de  
travailleurs migrants principalement compos&#233;s de citoyens congolais qui travaillent dans des 
activit&#233;s informelles d&#8217;extraction de diamants.   
</p>
<p>52. Ces violations report&#233;es incluraient l&#8217;emploi syst&#233;matique de violences physiques et 
sexuelles, la confiscation des effets personnels des migrants, la s&#233;paration des membres de la </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 11 
 
</p>
<p>famille pendant le processus d&#8217;expulsion, et le viol syst&#233;matique des femmes par les forces de 
s&#233;curit&#233; angolaises, souvent devant leurs enfants ou en public.  
</p>
<p>53. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, les viols auraient eu lieu &#224; tous les stades du 
processus de refoulement, lors de l&#8217;expulsion des femmes de leurs maisons, dans les lieux de 
d&#233;tention provisoires, aux checkpoints et pendant leur transport vers la fronti&#232;re. 
</p>
<p>54. De plus, l&#8217;&#233;tat de sant&#233; des migrants expuls&#233;s est  tr&#232;s pr&#233;occupant. Beaucoup d&#8217;entre 
eux ayant men&#233;s des activit&#233;s informelles d&#8217;extraction de diamants, auraient &#233;t&#233; forc&#233;s, avec 
les membres de leurs familles incluant leurs enfants, de se soumettre &#224; des fouilles corporelles 
inappropri&#233;es et envahissantes (incluant les cavit&#233;s anales et vaginales) afin de d&#233;couvrir des 
diamants cach&#233;s.  
</p>
<p>55. Selon des rapports, les fouilles auraient &#233;t&#233; effectu&#233;es de fa&#231;on &#224; causer des 
traumatismes, aussi bien physiques que psychologiques, aux d&#233;port&#233;s. La sant&#233; mentale et 
physique des femmes victimes de violences sexuelles est une grande pr&#233;occupation : il a &#233;t&#233; 
rapport&#233; que quelques-unes d&#8217;entre elles souffrent de diff&#233;rentes douleurs dans leurs vagins et 
au bas-ventre, et ont &#233;t&#233; profond&#233;ment traumatis&#233;es par les abus dont elles ont souffert.  
</p>
<p>56. Des informations indiqueraient que la plupart d&#8217;entre elles n&#8217;auraient re&#231;u aucun soin 
m&#233;dical depuis leur arriv&#233;e en R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo. 
</p>
<p>57. En outre, selon des rapports, les migrants auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenus secr&#232;tement et dans des 
conditions difficiles avant leur d&#233;portation, qu&#8217;ils auraient &#233;t&#233; battus et  soumis &#224; d&#8217;autres 
formes de mauvais traitements, et qu&#8217;ils auraient &#233;t&#233; priv&#233;s d&#8217;eau et de nourriture, aussi bien 
durant la p&#233;riode de d&#233;tention que pendant la d&#233;portation &#224; la fronti&#232;re congolaise. De plus, il 
y aurait eu des morts dues &#224; l&#8217;&#233;puisement et aux mauvais traitements.

<p>58. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial regrette que le Gouvernement n&#8217;ait pas r&#233;pondu &#224; sa

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 2 May 2007 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the<b> 
</b>Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, regarding the case of Mr. <b>B.A.M., </b>a citizen of Canada, Ms. <b>H.B.H.</b>, a 
citizen of the Comoros, and her children (names and age unknown), Mr. <b>A.A.</b>, a resident of 
France, Mr. <b>T.K.T., </b>a citizen of Eritrea and television cameraman, Mr. <b>S.I.S., </b>a citizen of 
Eritrea and television journalist, Mr. <b>O.A.Y., </b>a citizen of Sweden, and Ms. <b>S.A.N.</b>, also a 
citizen of Sweden, and her children (names and age unknown), Ms. <b>I.C., </b>a citizen of Tunisia, 
Mr. <b>A.M.A.</b>, a citizen of Kenya, and more than 70 others whose names have not been 
reported. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the information received on December 2006, the conflict between the 
militias of the Council of Somali Islamic Courts and the Transitional Federal Government of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Somalia, caused a large flow of refugees seeking to cross the border from Somalia into 
Kenya.  
</p>
<p>61. Reports indicate that on 2 January 2007, Kenyan authorities announced the closure of 
the border for security reasons. Since then, it is reported that the Kenyan security forces have 
been patrolling the border and have arrested a number of those seeking to cross it.  
</p>
<p>62. It is also reported that Kenya has deported at least 84 of those arrested to Somalia, 
from where they were taken to Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>63. In late March the Government released five persons who were arrested and detained 
under these circumstances.  
</p>
<p>64. On 10 April 2007, the Government announced that 29 more of the transferred 
detainees would be released. However, according to the information received, none of the 29 
has been freed.  
</p>
<p>65. The persons named above were allegedly arrested between 30 December 2006 and 
February 2007 as they tried to cross the border from Somalia into Kenya. They were detained 
in various locations in Nairobi before being transferred to Somalia on three charter flights 
between 20 January and 10 February 2007. Once in Somalia, they were reportedly transferred 
to Ethiopia.  
</p>
<p>66. It is further alleged that they were not provided with an opportunity to challenge their 
forcible removal at any stage.  
</p>
<p>67. B.A.M., T.K.T. and S.I.S. are reportedly held at the facilities of the Central 
Investigation Bureau in Addis Ababa (also known as Maikelawi). Others are most likely held 
at the military bases of Debre Zeit, southeast of Addis Ababa, and Jijiga, about 60 kilometres 
from the border with Somalia. 
</p>
<p>68. According to reports received, they are all held incommunicado and are not known to 
have been given any opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention before a court. It 
would appear that they are detained on the suspicion that they might have links with the 
Council of Somali Islamic Courts or with al-Qa'ida, although no such charges are reported to 
have been formally filed against them. 
</p>
<p>69. In the light of their incommunicado detention, we are concerned that they might be at 
risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. We are also concerned about the reported 
presence of children among the detainees. H.B.H. and S.A.N. are both reportedly detained 
with their children. I.C. was pregnant at the time of her arrest and had suffered a bullet wound 
to her back.  
</p>
<p>70. The Ethiopian authorities have acknowledged detaining 41 of more than 80 people 
who were arrested trying to cross from Somalia into Kenya, and have said 29 will be released. 
The whereabouts of the remaining detainees remain unknown.  
</p>
<p>71. Three groups of people who had been detained in Kenya and transferred to Ethiopia 
via Somalia without legal recourse have recently been released by the Ethiopian authorities.  </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 13 
 
</p>
<p>72. H.B.H, her three children and seven other individuals were recently released by the 
Government of Ethiopia. H.B.H is the wife of F.A., who is wanted by the United States of 
America in connection with the 1998 American embassy bombings in Nairobi, and Dar-es-
Salaam. On 7 January 2007, H.B.H. was arrested with her three children, aged 15, 11 and 4. 
H.B.H is apparently not suspected of involvement in the bombings. She was released on 4 
May with her children, and has been returned to the Comoros.  
</p>
<p>73. This follows the release of I.C. on 10 May, along with her husband A.N. Both are 
Tunisian nationals, and have fled to Egypt where they are attempting to claim asylum, fearing 
arrest and mistreatment if they return to Tunisia. I.C., who was pregnant when she was 
arrested on 21 January 2007, has since given birth to a baby boy.  
</p>
<p>74. Three more Swedish men held by Ethiopia were reportedly released and returned to 
Sweden. The Foreign Minister of Sweden made a statement thanking Swedish officials who 
had worked to ensure their release. This follows a 17-year-old Swedish girl being released by 
Ethiopia in late March.  
</p>
<p>75. There are still up to 55 people being detained in Ethiopia after being transferred from 
Kenya via Somalia, transferred in secret without legal recourse. The Government of Ethiopia 
has only acknowledged 41 detainees, including the 22 people whom it has released. Four 
British citizens who were also detained by the Kenyan authorities were sent back to the 
United Kingdom from Somalia on 14 February 2007.  
</p>
<p>76. There is no further news on Canadian national B.A.M., who is still thought to be 
detained incommunicado at the police Central Investigation Bureau (known as Maikelawi) in 
Addis Ababa. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>77. On 22 May 2007, the Government transmitted the following information related to the 
case of the incommunicado detention of individuals of various nationalities in Ethiopia.  
</p>
<p>78. According to the Government, the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia 
handed over to Ethiopia 41 individuals captured in the course of the conflict in Somalia. Most 
of these detainees have been released.  
</p>
<p>79. The Government reported that only 8 of the detainees still remain in custody by the 
order of the Court. According to the Government, these individuals were international 
terrorists who answered the call for jihad by Al Shabab group of extremists against the 
Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and Ethiopia. The Government of Somalia, due 
to the lack of adequate and secure facilities or functional prisons, requested the Government 
of Ethiopia to hold these individuals and to undertake investigations into their activities.  
</p>
<p>80. Additionally, the Government denied the allegation that there were more than 70 other 
detainees in addition to those mentioned in the communication. The Government also denied 
the allegations that the detainees were held incommunicado and were at risk of torture. 
</p>
<p>81. With the exception of three individuals, who refused to exercise their rights, embassy 
or consular officials from their respective countries have visited the detainees. Their 
embassies or consular officials have been cooperating with the competent Government of 
Ethiopia agencies in arranging the return of their nationals.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>82. According to the Government, they were afforded the opportunity to challenge the 
legality of their detention. All detainees have appeared before the competent court in 
accordance with the relevant national legal procedure consistent with international obligations 
of the country.  
</p>
<p>83. With a view to ensure that no detainee was subjected to torture, inhumane or 
degrading treatment, and that the physical and mental integrity of all detainees were fully 
respected, Ethiopian personnel was present during the interrogations of the detainees by 
security experts from their respective countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>84. According to the Government, the 11 women and 14 children detained have been 
released, and eight of the women, along with seven children, have already left the country. 
The three remaining women with seven children are released but they are still in Ethiopia,  
owing to the fact that their countries of origin have yet to finalize their travel documents and 
arrangements.  
</p>
<p>85. Finally, the Government assured the Special Rapporteur that the remaining eight 
detained suspected international terrorists will continue to have access to embassy or consular 
officials of their respective countries and that their rights to a due process are being fully 
respected and they have not been in any manner ill-treated. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Ethiopia for the 
detailed information provided. He would appreciate being kept informed on new 
developments in this case. 
</p>
<p><b>Guatemala</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n enviada al Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>87. El 30 de noviembre de 2007, el Relator Especial transmiti&#243; al Gobierno una carta de 
alegaci&#243;n junto con el Relator Especial sobre la venta de ni&#241;os, la prostituci&#243;n infantil y la 
utilizaci&#243;n de ni&#241;os en la pornograf&#237;a, y la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la 
mujer, sus causas y consecuencias, sobre informaci&#243;n relativa a adopciones de menores en 
Guatemala. 
 
</p>
<p>88. Seg&#250;n los informes recibidos en Guatemala se estar&#237;a llevando a cabo adopciones 
internacionales de menores de edad ilegales, y  en gran parte de los casos, con el enga&#241;o a sus 
familias.  
</p>
<p>89. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, en Guatemala  entre 5.000 y 6.000 ni&#241;os 
ser&#237;an dados en adopci&#243;n cada a&#241;o, convirtiendo a Guatemala en el segundo pa&#237;s del mundo 
con mayor n&#250;mero de adopciones internacionales, despu&#233;s de China.  
 
</p>
<p>90. La demanda internacional provendr&#237;a principalmente de familias estadounidenses, las 
cuales pagar&#237;an entre 13.000 y 40.000 d&#243;lares para &#8220;adquirir&#8221; un beb&#233; guatemalteco. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, beb&#233;s nacidos tras casos de violaci&#243;n sexual estar&#237;an siendo dados en 
adopci&#243;n, siendo las madres coaccionadas o enga&#241;adas para dar al reci&#233;n nacido en adopci&#243;n. </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1

</p>
<p>La cr&#237;tica situaci&#243;n econ&#243;mica y social en que se encuentran estas mujeres ser&#237;a otro factor 
que las hacen a&#250;n m&#225;s vulnerables a ser v&#237;ctimas de las redes de adopciones de ni&#241;os. 
 
</p>
<p>91. La mayor parte de las adopciones, el 99,7%, se har&#237;a por v&#237;a notarial, con base en la 
Ley Reguladora de Tramitaci&#243;n Notarial de Asuntos de Jurisdicci&#243;n Voluntaria, sin la 
observancia de los debidos requisitos para asegurarse cual es la procedencia del ni&#241;o/ni&#241;a. La 
adopci&#243;n por esta v&#237;a no necesitar&#237;a resoluci&#243;n de juez/a competente, el juzgado de familia 
actuar&#237;a &#250;nicamente para solicitar a la trabajadora social que, bajo juramento, efectuara el 
estudio socioecon&#243;mico respectivo. Las adopciones internacionales por v&#237;a judicial no 
llegar&#237;an al 0,3% del total de las adopciones realizadas.  
</p>
<p>92. Asimismo se habr&#237;a descubierto que algunos Jueces de Familia habr&#237;an autorizado 
adopciones sin contar con la opini&#243;n favorable de la Procuradur&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n, en 
violaci&#243;n a la legislaci&#243;n existente en la materia. La participaci&#243;n de autoridades judiciales en 
dichas irregularidades, y el hecho de que los procedimientos para el tr&#225;mite de las adopciones 
establecidos en las leyes generales est&#225;n en desacuerdo con las leyes especiales de protecci&#243;n 
a la infancia, demostrar&#237;a la existencia de un cuadro de pr&#225;cticas violatorias de los derechos 
humanos de la ni&#241;ez. 
</p>
<p>93. Seg&#250;n se informa, habr&#237;an organizaciones asentadas en Guatemala que se dedicar&#237;an a 
la venta ilegal de menores de edad por medio de adopciones internacionales, como ser&#237;a el 
caso de la organizaci&#243;n Casa Quivira. Esta organizaci&#243;n tendr&#237;a como dirigentes ciudadanos 
provenientes de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica y se dedicar&#237;a a la venta de menores de edad a 
este pa&#237;s cobrando a las futuras familias un precio muy alto por cada uno de ellos. 
Supuestamente esta organizaci&#243;n habr&#237;a estado involucrada en la pr&#225;ctica de adopciones 
irregulares, donde 46 ni&#241;os habr&#237;an sido rescatados y repartidos entre instituciones 
evang&#233;licas y cristianas en el mes de agosto de este a&#241;o. Supuestamente habr&#237;an ocurrido 
irregularidades en el juicio realizado contra Casa Quivira, por los hechos mencionados, con el 
objetivo de que dicha organizaci&#243;n saliera impune en relaci&#243;n a los posibles delitos 
realizados. 
</p>
<p>94. Entre las pr&#225;cticas irregulares de adopci&#243;n se incluir&#237;a la realizada por medio de 
Alcaldes Municipales, consistente en la entrega de los ni&#241;os/as por parte de su madre 
biol&#243;gica a una pareja adoptiva. Los padres biol&#243;gicos y los padres adoptivos comparecer&#237;an 
ante el Alcalde de la localidad, normalmente en zonas aisladas en las cuales no hay acceso a 
los juzgados o a las oficinas de un abogado,  para que &#233;ste levantara un acta en la que 
constar&#237;a que los primeros entregan en adopci&#243;n a su hijo. 
</p><p>95. Posteriormente se asentar&#237;a la Partida de Nacimiento en el Registro Civil y el acto de 
la adopci&#243;n quedar&#237;a consumado. Otra de las maneras ser&#237;a por suposici&#243;n de parto, en donde 
la madre biol&#243;gica entregar&#237;a al ni&#241;o a los padres adoptivos inmediatamente despu&#233;s del 
nacimiento. Ambas se internar&#237;an en el mismo sanatorio (privado), la madre biol&#243;gica se 
registrar&#237;a con el nombre de la madre adoptiva y el ni&#241;o saldr&#237;a de la cl&#237;nica como hijo de la 
segunda.  
</p>
<p>96. En este contexto, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH) habr&#237;a 
otorgado medidas cautelares a favor de 26 ni&#241;os y ni&#241;as, solicitando al Estado de Guatemala 
informar el lugar y condiciones donde se encuentran actualmente los ni&#241;os, su situaci&#243;n 
jur&#237;dica y familiar y las medidas que estar&#237;an adoptando para su protecci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n la </p>

noviembre para que el Gobierno de Guatemala informara acerca de las medidas adoptadas, as&#237;

<p><b>Communication envoy&#233; au Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>97. Le 5 Novembre 2007, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la vente d'enfants, la prostitution des enfants et 
la pornographie impliquant des enfants et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la violence contre les 
femmes, concernant l'exploitation d'enfants pour le travail domestique en Guin&#233;e.  
</p>
<p>98. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, en Guin&#233;e, des dizaines de milliers de filles 
travailleraient comme domestiques. Tandis que d'autres enfants de la famille seraient  
scolaris&#233;s, ces filles passeraient leur enfance et leur adolescence &#224; faire des travaux m&#233;nagers 
f&#233;minins: elles nettoieraient, laveraient le linge et s&#8217;occuperaient des jeunes enfants.  
</p><p>99. Beaucoup d&#8217;entre elles travailleraient jusqu&#8217;&#224; 18 heures par jour. La grande majorit&#233; 
d&#8217;entre elles ne seraient pas pay&#233;es; d'autres recevraient des paiements, souvent irr&#233;guliers, en 
g&#233;n&#233;ral inf&#233;rieurs &#224; 5 $US par mois. De nombreuses filles employ&#233;es comme domestiques ne 
recevraient aucune aide quand elles seraient malades, et elles auraient souvent faim car elles 
seraient exclues des repas familiaux. Elles seraient souvent tenues &#224; l&#8217;&#233;cart, insult&#233;es et 
moqu&#233;es. Beaucoup d&#8217;entre elles seraient aussi victimes de coups et de violence et de 
harc&#232;lement sexuels. Malgr&#233; ces conditions, quitter la famille de l&#8217;employeur serait difficile 
pour beaucoup d&#8217;enfants employ&#233;es domestiques qui ne pourraient pas rejoindre leurs parents 
et n&#8217;auraient pas d&#8217;autre endroit o&#249; aller. Ces filles vivraient dans des conditions analogues &#224; 
l&#8217;esclavage.  
</p>
<p>100. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, certaines filles viendraient d&#8217;aussi loin que le Mali. Ces 
adolescentes maliennes en particulier viendraient en Guin&#233;e travailler comme domestiques 
pour gagner de l&#8217;argent pour leurs trousseaux. 
</p>
<p>101. De plus, un nombre important de ces mineurs seraient isol&#233;s dans la maison de leur 
employeur et seraient incapables d&#8217;acc&#233;der &#224; toute information ou assistance de l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur. Ils 
resteraient coinc&#233;s pendant des ann&#233;es dans des situations traumatisantes et de maltraitance. 
</p>
<p>102. Des informations plus r&#233;centes indiqueraient, qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y aurait pas d&#8217;organisme pour la 
protection de l&#8217;enfance pour contr&#244;ler de fa&#231;on syst&#233;matique le bien-&#234;tre des enfants et 
faciliter leur retrait d&#8217;une maison o&#249; ils sont maltrait&#233;s, si n&#233;cessaire. 
</p>
<p>103. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues,  le Minist&#232;re des Affaires sociales a la responsabilit&#233; 
de cette question, mais ne serait pas op&#233;rationnel. Il n&#8217;existerait pas non plus de syst&#232;me de 
placement en famille d&#8217;accueil qui puisse offrir aux enfants un environnement familial 
alternatif protecteur et contr&#244;l&#233;. Bien qu&#8217;il existerait un service d&#8217;inspection du travail, il 
manquerait de personnel et ne s&#8217;occuperait pas de la situation des enfants travaillant comme 
domestiques. 
</p>
<p>104. L&#8217;exploitation et la maltraitance des enfants employ&#233;s comme domestiques constituent 
une violation du droit national et international. La Guin&#233;e est partie &#224; la Convention relative 
aux droits de l&#8217;enfant et &#224; tous les principaux trait&#233;s r&#233;gionaux et internationaux sur le travail </p>

<p>des enfants, la discrimination selon le sexe et la traite. Selon le droit guin&#233;en, les enfants ont 
droit &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation, et la scolarisation dans l&#8217;enseignement primaire est obligatoire. L&#8217;&#226;ge 
minimum pour travailler est de 16 ans, mais il y aurait une disposition qui pr&#233;voit que les 
enfants de moins de 16 ans peuvent travailler avec le consentement de leurs parents ou de 
leurs tuteurs l&#233;gaux. Les enfants de plus de 16 ans sont autoris&#233;s &#224; travailler dans certaines 
limites, mais doivent b&#233;n&#233;ficier de tous leurs droits du travail. De plus, le droit guin&#233;en 
prot&#232;gerait les enfants contre les ch&#226;timents corporels et autres violences physiques, les 
s&#233;vices sexuels, et la traite.  
</p>
<p>105. Le droit international comporte aussi des interdictions claires contre certains 
comportements nocifs, pour prot&#233;ger les enfants contre la discrimination, toute forme de  
violence, d&#8217;atteinte ou de brutalit&#233; physiques, de mauvais traitements ou d&#8217;exploitation, y 
compris la violence sexuelle, la traite et les cons&#233;quences nocives du travail des enfants. Il

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>107. On 6 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
regarding the case of Mr. <b>A.R.M.</b> 
</p>
<p>108. According to the information received, A.R.M is an Ahwazi from the south-western 
region of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was accepted by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Damascus office as a refugee. He was arrested 
by Syrian security forces on 11 May 2006 and handed over to Iranian authorities in Tehran on 
15 May 2006.  
</p>
<p>109. It is alleged that, since his arrest, he has not had access to a lawyer and has been 
detained in solitary confinement.  
</p>
<p>110. Information received also indicates that A.R.M was expected to go on trial in March, 
however, it remained unclear what charges were put against him.  
</p>
<p>111. It is further alleged that he was physically and mentally ill-treated while in detention. 
As a result, he reportedly carries blood in his urine, his liver and kidneys were not functioning 
and he lost all of his teeth. Furthermore, he is paralysed because his spine has been damaged.  
</p>
<p>112. Fears have been expressed with respect to the physical and mental integrity and health 
of A.R.M, particularly in view of his reportedly continued incommunicado detention in 
solitary confinement. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>113. On 23 August 2007, the Government transmitted information relative to the case of 
<b>A.R.M. 
</b></p>
<p>114. According to the information that the Government has received from the judiciary of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, A.R.M, is the head of the military wing of a terrorist group, and 
following participation in several terrorist operations, he had illegally fled Iran to the Syrian 
Arab Republic, where subsequent to his identification by the local pertinent authorities, as 
well as the issuance of writ of arrest by Interpol, he was arrested and extradited to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>115. The Government denied all the allegations reflected in the communication letter sent 
by the Special Rapporteur, including allegations of torture, his illness in prison, lack of access 
to lawyer, as well as to his family. According to the Government A.R.M.&#8217;s health is good. He 
has been in contact with his family. It is also reported that he was allowed to leave the prison 
under police control in December 2006 and March 2007. 
</p>
<p>116.  This case is presently going through investigation and legal proceeding in the 
competent court with the information and presence of A.R.M&#8217;s defence lawyers at different 
stages. No final verdict has been reached.

of Iran for its prompt and detailed reply. He would appreciate being kept informed of new 
developments in this case.<b>

<p><b>Communications sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>118. On 18 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard 
of living, the independent expert on minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
concerning incidents of evictions of Roma communities in Rome and Pisa which allegedly 
would form part of a pattern of discrimination against Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>119. According to the information received, Roma communities in Italy face discrimination 
and violations of their right to adequate housing, including being subjected to forced 
evictions.  
</p>
<p>120. Reportedly, on 19 July 2007, the Italian police, in cooperation with the Romanian 
police, forcibly evicted approximately 1000 Roma from a settlement in Via dell&#8217;Imbarco, 
Magliana suburb, Rome. Earlier in July 2007, the police and the municipal wardens forcibly 
evicted approximately 100 Roma from Romania from a settlement in Bagno di Tivoli, near 
Rome. During both operations personal belongings and dwellings were allegedly destroyed. 
</p>
<p>121. Following an official visit to Romania by Rome&#8217;s mayor, Walter Veltroni, an 
agreement was signed between the Governments of Italy and Romania   whereby the police of </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 19 
 
</p>
<p>these countries would collaborate concerning the eviction, identification and repatriation of 
Roma of Romanian origin living in settlements in the city of Rome. Despite the declaration 
that this would be a plan for &#8220;voluntary return&#8221;, there are allegations that the intention is to 
repatriate Roma settlers forcibly.  
</p>
<p>122. It has also been reported that the Vice-President of the European Commission, Franco 
Frattini, stated that &#8220;it is not true that European citizens cannot be repatriated &#8230; There is a 
very clear directive, valid for all citizens of the European Union that provides for the 
expulsion for all those who cannot prove to have adequate means of subsistence to live in a 
dignified way&#8221;. This statement has been allegedly used by politicians in anti-Roma speeches. 
For instance, the mayor of Verona, Flavio Tosi, who had previously been sentenced to two 
months&#8217; imprisonment for racist propaganda against Roma, used the above statement to 
affirm that many of the Romanian Roma living in a &#8220;nomad camps&#8221; can be repatriated.  
</p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur received also information concerning the case of four 
Romanian Roma children, Lenuca, Danchiu, Dengi and Eva, who, on 11 August 2007, died in 
a fire. For reasons yet unknown, the fire burned down the hut where they were temporarily 
living with their parents in Livorno, following their forced eviction from Pisa in May 2007. 
According to the information received, their parents are currently in detention, charged with 
abandonment of minors and parental negligence. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>124. On 21 December 2007, the Government of Italy replied to the joint allegation letter 
sent on 18 October 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the independent expert on minority issues and 
the Special Rapporteur on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>125. The Government first noted that the question of the living conditions of the Roma 
populations, as laid down in its Consolidated Text 286/1998 as amended and integrated by 
Act 189/2002, was the responsibility of local bodies and that local institutions were still 
proceeding with all pertinent interventions. Within this framework, several initiatives aiming 
at setting up small camps and/or focusing on integration measures are in the process of being 
implemented in different parts of the country as in Naples, Milan, Rovereto and Rome.  
</p>
<p>126. More specifically, in the case of the municipality of Rome, it was noted that actions 
aimed at the reception and integration of Roma communities have been increased and 
strengthened. The Government reported that the &#8220;Pronta Accoglienza&#8221; (reception centres) 
received thousands of Roma people while ad hoc structures have been opened specifically for 
mother and child groups.   
</p>
<p>127. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement located in the Magliana area, Via 
dell&#8217;Imbarco, Rome on July 19, 2007, the Government reported that the Roman police, in 
agreement with the municipality, the Nucleo Assistenza Emarginati (outcasts assistance 
cluster) and the municipal police carried out the removal of a Roma illegal settlement located 
under an overpass, in an area subjected to overflow and that was found in appalling hygienic 
and sanitary conditions. 
</p>
<p>128. A decision to intervene had been previously agreed within the Provincial Committee 
for Public Order and Security and had been repeatedly requested by the Municipal Agency for </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>Electricity and Water in order to allow urgent maintenance works close to the settlement. 
Evacuation of the area was carried out with medical units, charity institutions and sanitation 
experts.  
</p>
<p>129. The Government reported that the removal affected about 500 (not 1,300) people 
belonging to a Romanian ethnic group and who, after being informed about the impossibility 
of remaining in an unsafe area, voluntarily moved away. A few of them, who did not intend to 
leave their premises, immediately received assistance from the Roman social services. 
Following the event, the police and social workers intervened in order to assist the more 
disadvantaged categories, like the mothers and children.  
</p>
<p>130. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement in Bagni di Tivoli, in the former 
Stacchini powder warehouse on July 26, 2007, the Government reported that, according to a 
decision taken by the &#8220;Illegal Roma settlement issues working group&#8221; of the local Prefettura 
(prefecture), the police, the Carabinieri, Civil Protection and other competent offices of the 
Tivoli Municipality carried out the removal of an illegal settlement within the private area of 
the former powder warehouse. This action had been made necessary as a consequence of 
requests by the owner of the site and other private citizens. During the intervention, 80 
Romanian citizens were requested to pick up their belongings and leave the place. 
</p>
<p>131. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement in Pisa in May 2007, the Government 
reported that the removal of a small community from the so-called CEP area in Pisa had been 
planned and carried out by the Municipal Police of Pisa. Goods of subsistence and meal 
tickets were supplied and the only family with minors was assisted. An alternative 
accommodation at a nearby landlord in the area has been offered to this family. The 
Government underlined that this family was not one of the families involved in the terrible 
episode occurred in Livorno. 
</p>
<p>132. Furthermore, in 2002, the city of Pisa started a specific programme called Le Citt&#224; 
Sottili, mainly aimed at the final closure of the Roma settlement. Four out of five Roma 
camps have been definitely closed. 
</p>
<p>133. At the time the Government sent this communication, there were still two areas where 
some family groups had been temporarily accommodated and various housing possibilities 
had been already foreseen for them. In the area of Coltano, they have started to build up a 
village in order to accommodate about 15 family groups by the spring 2008. 
</p>
<p>134. The Government specified that, out of 572 Roma citizens coming from various 
regions of the Balkans, half benefited from the programme Le Citt&#224; Sottili and were offered 
adequate housing and that another substantial number was well-placed in temporary housing 
solutions.  
</p>
<p>135. The Government also reported that each single family group was backed by a specific 
project in order to cope with the integration process autonomously and that all persons still 
staying within the settlement and in the transition areas were supported with targeted 
interventions.  
</p>
<p>136. The Government also indicated that all the children in the age of compulsory 
education had entered a school and had a sufficient level of attendance and that all of these 
projects have been approved by the social cooperative societies and local associations. As to </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 21 
 
</p>
<p>the Roma from Rumania, during the summer 2004, after the removal of illegal settlement in 
Pisa, the authorities detected hazardous situations for the health of some minors and 
consequently five Romanian Roma family groups were resettled along the line drawn with 
&#8220;La Citt&#224; Sottile&#8221;. Two of these family groups then decided to move autonomously. 
</p>
<p>137. In April 2005, after the fire of a warehouse, 11 families were accommodated in 
temporary facilities within the Municipality of San Giuliano Terme. In spring and summer 
2006, the Municipality joined the programme and paid for those families who benefited from 
the above-mentioned projects. 
</p><p>138. In its reply the Government noted that, after the arrivals of a number of Roma from 
Romania, especially at the beginning of 2007, several situations of marginalization and 
poverty arose in the territory of Pisa. By the end of 2006, the IRRMA (&#8220;regional action 
against marginality&#8221;) project started. This project was developed by the Tuscany Regional 
Administration in cooperation with the CNCA (Reception Communities National 
Coordination Board), managed within the Pisa territory by the social cooperative Il Cerchio 
and aiming to taking care of the Romanian Roma. It was added that two family groups had 
been supported for housing projects along with a number of people looking for employment, 
and this with good results.  
</p>
<p>139. The Government indicated that the Municipality of Pisa was committed to further 
interventions aimed at family groups with sufficient income to guarantee their integration, 
and/or who had a particular health situation. It was also reported that actions would be 
developed with the objective of closing the illegal settlement and preventing the creation of 
new ones.  
</p>
<p>140. Concerning the events of Livorno on August 11, 2007, the Government reported that 
around midnight, the Fire Brigade was requested to extinguish a fire in the outskirts of the 
town, where three huts made of wood and plastic were on fire. The charred corpses of four 
children were found and identified According to their parent&#8217;s statements, they were 
Romanians of 4, 7, 8 and 11 years of age. Late in the night, the police arrested the parents of 
the victims, who were questioned by the judge. They were considered to be guilty of child 
abandonment and consequently for their deaths.  
</p>
<p>141. Following investigation, and despite the parents&#8217; allegations, there would be no 
responsibility attributed to a third person and the possibility of a racist or a xenophobic attack 
was excluded. The authorities also specified that the victims weren&#8217;t living temporarily in 
Livorno because of their forced eviction from Pisa.   
</p>
<p>142. Concerning non-discrimination, the Government recalls that besides article 3, c.2, of 
the Italian Constitution, the Law decree No. 286/98 settled the procedures for civil action 
against discriminatory acts due to racial, ethnical, national or religious reasons committed by 
a private or by the public administration. It was noted that this decree established measures of 
social integration as the organization of training courses tailored for public officers and 
private corporations in charge of foreign citizens or working in the immigration field.  
</p>
<p>143. The Government also explained that the National Office against Racial Discrimination 
(UNAR), was offering free legal consulting to victims of discrimination who report to 
competent jurisdictional authorities. Periodical meetings with the Rome associations have 
permitted to this Office to play an intermediation role and to determine the main sectors of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>potential intervention by the State or by the local authorities, including housing, health and 
legal status.  
</p>
<p>144. Finally, the Government mentioned the very recent agreement signed in Bucharest, on 
December 20, 2007, by the Italian Minister for Social Solidarity and the Romanian Minister 
of Labour. It was explained that this agreement would aim to establish a partnership in order 
to reduce, in both countries, the level of poverty of Romanian citizens, in particular Roma 
people. It was finally noted that this agreement is providing the utilization of national and 
European funds for the implementation of joint projects in the fields of labour, education and 
housing.     
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>145. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Italy for its detailed and 
informative reply to his communication of 18 October 2007. The Special Rapporteur

</b></p>
<p>151. On 13 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding 430 Eritrean nationals, including over 50 women 
and children who would be facing imminent deportation to Eritrea.  </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 23 
 
</p>
<p>152. Reports indicate that there were 130 detainees, including several women and children, 
at the detention centre in al-Marj, 1,000 km from Tripoli, while the remaining 300 are 
detained in Misratah, about 200 km from Tripoli.  
</p>
<p>153. It is alleged that the majority of the detainees are conscripts who fled Eritrea to avoid 
military service.  
</p>
<p>154. It is further alleged that the right to conscientious objection is not recognized in 
Eritrea. Military service in Eritrea is compulsory for men aged 18 to 40 and for women aged 
18 to 27. Military offenders are punished without due process.  
</p>
<p>155. According to the information received, the 430 individuals would be facing imminent 
deportation to Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>156. During their detention, Libyan authorities have reportedly beaten and raped or 
sexually abused some detainees.  
</p>
<p>157. Fears have been expressed that should they be forcibly returned to Eritrea, they may 
be at risk of torture or ill-treatment, as well as for potential persecution with regard to their 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  
</p>
<p>158. Further concern is expressed for their physical and mental integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>159. On 10 May 2007, the Government replied to this communication sent on 13 February 
</p><p>2007. 
</p>
<p>160. The Government denied the veracity of the facts alleged in the summary of the case 
sent by the Special Rapporteurs.  
</p>
<p>161. The Government also reported that there are 164 Eritreans who are currently being 
held in centres for illegal migrants after being caught attempting to migrate illegally to 
Europe. They are being well-treated and are provided with humanitarian and health 
assistance, as witnessed by many foreign media representatives and delegations from States 
and non-governmental organizations which have visited these camps. 
</p>
<p>162. Additionally the Government reported that the Eritrean nationals come to the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya either because they are fleeing compulsory military service or for other 
reasons. Most of them enter Libya as a transit zone and are bound for the northern shores of 
the Mediterranean Sea. According to the Government, the repatriation of these Eritrean 
nationals is an appropriate step to take.  
</p>
<p>163. Act No. 6 of 1987 regulates aliens entry, residence and departure from the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya. Anyone who breaches this act will be arrested and detained in designated 
places of detention and the competent authorities shall take legal proceedings against them. 
</p>
<p>164. According to the Great Green Document on Human Rights, the Promotion of Freedom 
Act and the relevant laws, and pursuant to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture, to which the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  is a party, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>the competent Libyan authorities have no right to extradite or repatriate an individual where 
there is evidence to show that the individual will be subjected to torture or an unfair trial. 
</p><p>165. The Great Green Document and the Freedom Act guarantee freedom of conscience, 
expression and opinion and freedom of worship. Everyone is entitled to security of person and 
not to be subjected to cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment. Article 431 of the Criminal 
Code prescribes a sentence of imprisonment for public officials who use violence against 
individuals. Article 435 of the Code prescribes a term of imprisonment for any official who 
commits or orders torture. 
</p>
<p>166. According to the Government, some members of the police may use force during 
arrests in order to deal with individuals who resist arrest. It is also reported that, one police 
officer has been convicted for abuse of authority.  
</p>
<p>167. Finally the Government reported that such cases are isolated cases and those 
responsible face the most severe criminal and disciplinary penalties when evidence of their 
guilt is presented. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government in response to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 18 May 2006  
</b> 
</p>
<p>169. On 18 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Malaysia, regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Indonesian 
domestic workers in Malaysia. 
 
</p>
<p>170. The Special Rapporteur requested the Government to send detailed information 
concerning the draft MOU and, more specifically, on how it would address the 
recommendations the Special Rapporteur had made on his letter dated 18 May 2006.  
</p>
<p>171. By letter dated 14 March 2007, the Government of Malaysia provided information 
regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Indonesian domestic 
workers in Malaysia. 
 
</p>
<p>172. The Government reported that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was 
signed between the Government of Malaysia and the Government of Indonesia on 13 May 
2006, entering into force on 13 June 2006. The MOU seeks to establish a framework to 
facilitate the selection and recruitment of domestic workers from the Republic of Indonesia to 
work in Malaysia. 
 
</p>
<p>173. According to the Government, the MOU provides for certain responsibilities of  
employers with respect to their workers, inter alia: 
 </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 25 
 
</p>
<p> - To recruit Indonesian workers only through licensed recruitment agencies and with the 
necessary approval from the relevant authorities in Malaysia; 
 - To ensure that the terms and conditions of the contract are explained in detail;  
 - To state the wages clearly in the contract;  
- To provide appropriate accommodation; 
- To respect the freedom of belief of the workers; 
 - To ensure that domestic workers are only required for household duties and not be engaged 
in other additional duty; 
 - To ensure that domestic workers undergo a medical examination in accordance with the 
requirements of the relevant authorities in Malaysia and Indonesia; 
 - To ensure that domestic workers receives a foreign worker card, which the worker keeps for 
identification purposes; 
 - To pay the cost of the repatriation of the worker where the contract of employment is 
terminated by the employer. 
 
</p>
<p>174. The Government also reported that The MOU is an additional document that was 
elaborated taking into account existing provisions in the legislations of the two Governments 
with the purpose of protecting the rights and interests of domestic workers and employers. 
 
</p>
<p>175. The MOU  also regulates also the activities of the recruitment agencies.  
 
</p>
<p>176. According to the Government, the employer is held responsible for the safekeeping of 
a worker&#8217;s passport. The passport is kept by the employers according to Section 12 (1) (g) of 
the Passport Act 1966 (Act 150), which provides that a person is able to keep lawfully another 
person&#8217;s passport. It is also reported that article 8 (A) (xiii) of the MOU does not intend to 
deprive the right of domestic workers to hold their passports but only ensure that the passports 
are kept in safe custody and protected from any unfortunate event such as being stolen. 
</p>
<p>177. The Government also reported that for purposes of identification of domestic workers, 
the Immigration Department of Malaysia issues foreign worker card which shall be kept at all 
times by the domestic worker. This card is an identity card, which contains relevant 
information of the worker. This card enables domestic workers to move freely in the country. 
According to the MOU, the worker has the responsibility to obtain the card from the 
Immigration Department. 
</p>
<p>178. Although the MOU does not set a minimum wage, it contains a provision that states 
that the domestic worker will not be compelled to accept the work offered if she/he does not 
agree with the monthly wage. Any modification of the contract has to be made upon the 
consent of the domestic worker. 
</p>
<p>179. According to article 8 (A) of the MOU, the contract of employment has to include the 
description of the job, the wage, allowances, working hours, overtime rate, rest days, days of 
annual leave, days of sick leave, public holidays and provisions for housing. 
</p>
<p>180. The MOU provides that the contract of employment shall state clearly the address of 
the workplace. According to the MOU, the employer has the obligation to provide the worker 
with insurance coverage. 
</p>
<p>181. The Government informed that the MOU does not contain provisions regarding 
mechanisms and remedies for workers in case of abuses, and sanctions for employers and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>recruitment agencies. It is reported that workers can submit their complaints to the 
Government to the Labour Department under the Ministry of Human Resources in Malaysia. 
In case of abuse, the workers can report to the police. Under the MOU, in the event of non-
compliance by the employers or licensed recruitment agencies of the provisions of the MOU, 
an action can be taken against the employer or the agency.

<p>190. According to the information received from Maputo, women and children are 
reportedly trafficked via Ressano Garcia or the Lebombo border to Gauteng, South Africa.  
</p>
<p>191. Reports indicate that another route used for trafficking of persons to South Africa, 
specifically to Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, is the border at Ponta do Ouro. The trafficking of 
these persons continues further either to the south of Swaziland and directly to Johannesburg 
and Pretoria, or south to Durban and Pietermaritzburg. It is estimated that approximately 
1,000 Mozambican women per year are trafficked along these routes.  
</p>
<p>192. Reportedly, children are also trafficked daily in trucks through the Kruger National 
Park or the Swaziland border. Mozambicans from the north are purportedly being trafficked 
into South Africa via Zimbabwe.

<p>193. It is further alleged that people being trafficked from the Great Lakes Region and East 
Africa enter the north of Mozambique via Malawi or Tanzania. Mozambican ports are also 
said to be a stopping point for traffickers travelling by sea, who then continue the journey 
overland to South Africa. 
</p>
<p>194. It is moreover reported that small-scale trafficking networks, based at transit houses in 
the border region between Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa, use minivan taxis to 
smuggle both migrants and trafficking victims across the border.  
</p>
<p>195. It is also alleged that accomplices in Johannesburg, Maputo and in the Lebombo 
region in South Africa reportedly assist this process through recruiting, accommodating and 
transferring migrants and trafficked persons to the final destinations. Organized groups of 
Mozambican refugees living legally in South Africa are also reported to be involved in such 
activities. 
</p>
<p>196. In this context, young women attempting to find work in South Africa are allegedly 
led to believe that they will be offered employment as waitresses or domestic workers. 
However, upon arrival at the said transit centres, the women are separated from others, and 
forced into prostitution or forced labour in agriculture, manufacturing or service industries. 
When subjected to forced labour, reports indicate that they are often subject to sexual abuse 
by their employers.  
</p>
<p>197. Reports also indicate that young women and girls are sold, at the transit centres in 
Tonga and Johannesburg in South Africa, as &#8220;wives&#8221; for South African men. There are 
reports of &#8220;stocks&#8221; of women being displayed and of the possibility of &#8220;wives&#8221; ordered on 
demand.  
</p>
<p>198. Trafficked children are reportedly sold for US$ 30 to 50 per child. According to the 
information received, orphans are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, particularly because 
of a reported practice of informal adoption of children and because of adoption laws alleged 
to facilitate their trafficking. There are an estimated 1.6 million orphans in Mozambique, of 
whom 380,000 have lost their parents due to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>199. Moreover, AIDS is reported to play a major role in increasing the demand for the 
trafficking of younger and presumably uninfected sex workers. Extreme poverty may also 
render women and children more vulnerable to being trafficked. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>200. According to information received, so far, no suspected trafficker has ever been tried 
for trafficking in persons, but instead under laws related to kidnapping, corruption of minors 
and hijacking. Furthermore, it is reported that trafficking through several unguarded borders is 
facilitated by the complicity or the tolerance of some border authorities.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations</b> 
</p>
<p>201. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the 
Government of Mozambique to these allegations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>New Zealand 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>202. On 28 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government  
regarding the case of Ms. <b>T.A.T.</b>, reportedly a trafficking victim. 
</p>
<p>203. According to the information received, T.A.T was reportedly trafficked to Auckland, 
New Zealand, in 2003. T.A.T is married to a citizen of New Zealand. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>204. According to reports, in 2003, T.A.T was deceived by unknown persons into believing 
that papers had been arranged for her to work lawfully as a waitress in New Zealand. Upon 
her departure to New Zealand, she was told by her traffickers that she would be travelling 
with a false passport. When she protested against this, she was warned that she already owed 
her traffickers the sum of US$ 5,000 for her ticket to New Zealand and for arrangements 
undertaken to provide her with a visa and temporary residence permit for New Zealand. She 
was also threatened that if she refused to comply with instructions, her family in her country 
of origin would suffer.  
</p>
<p>205. Information received also indicated that, upon arrival in New Zealand, she had her 
passport taken away and the traffickers took her to an apartment in a nightclub where she was 
sold to a group of men who forced her to work as a prostitute. There were two other women 
of the same nationality in that apartment who had also found themselves in her situation and 
who had also been brought to New Zealand under similar circumstances of false promises. 
</p>
<p>206. It is also reported that, T.A.T and the women she lived and worked with were never 
allowed to leave the apartment, except for once a week to buy their weekly groceries; on such 
occasions, they were always accompanied. The women were given very little food and, when 
T.A.T fell ill during her captivity, the traffickers were reluctant to let her see a doctor.  
</p>
<p>207. Six months after T.AT arrived in New Zealand, the nightclub was suddenly closed 
down and the traffickers who had forced her to work as a prostitute left the premises. It is 
alleged that she was still forced to continue working as a prostitute to pay her debt. T.A.T and 
the two other women, however, managed to escape from the flat and went into hiding. It is 
then that T.A.T met the man who later became her husband. 
</p>
<p>208. It is further alleged that, at that stage, T.A.T sent an application to the immigration 
authorities to obtain a residence permit. Her husband also wrote to the Immigration Office to 
support his wife&#8217;s application, stressing that T.A.T had not voluntarily used false documents </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 29 
 
</p>
<p>to enter New Zealand, but had been forced by her traffickers to do so. The immigration 
authorities nevertheless issued T.A.T with a Removal Order, arguing that they found no 
substantial evidence of T.A.T's actual identity.  
</p>
<p>209. Reports indicated that the authorities argued that she had committed a serious offence 
in using false documentation to enter the country and was therefore advised to make 
arrangements to leave the country voluntarily; otherwise she would be arrested and deported.  
</p>
<p>210. On 29 March 2007, T.A.T launched an appeal against the Removal Order, in 
accordance with section 130 of the Immigration Act of 1987.  
</p>
<p>211. It is reported that a number of the traffickers had been convicted but that some of the 
trafficked women had already been sent away from New Zealand. Other traffickers, including 
the man who met T.A.T. at the airport, allegedly remained at large. T.A.T fears that she would 
face a risk to her life, if she were returned to her country. 
</p>
<p>212. On 20 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants wrote again to the 
Government asking for information of any developments on this case.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>213. By letter dated 5 July, the Government acknowledge receipt of the letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteurs on 28 June 2007, and informed that T.A.T.'s file would be assigned to an 
investigator.  
</p>
<p>214. On 27 August 2007, the Government of New Zealand replied to the letter concerning 
the case of T. A. T. 
</p>
<p>215. In its response, the Government states that it has reviewed T.A.T.&#8217;s case, and that 
further enquiries by the relevant authorities are still being conducted. New Zealand notes that 
all enquiries conducted thus far show no evidence to support the claim that T.A.T. is a victim 
of trafficking, and accordingly, the Government disputes the veracity of the allegations 
contained in the above-mentioned letter of 28 June 2007.  
</p>
<p>216. The Government also reported that any new information related to this case would be 
transmitted without delay to the Special Rapporteurs.  
</p>
<p>217. Finally, the Government assured the Special Rapporteurs that any further steps will be 
taken to return T.A.T. to her country until the enquiries of her case have been concluded. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>218. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of New Zealand for its 
detailed response and for the authorization to let T. A. T. stay in New Zealand until all 
enquires have been concluded. He would appreciate receiving information on the outcome of 
the investigations launched in the case.<b>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1

</p>
<p>219. On<b> </b>20 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government concerning the case of Mr. <b>S.O.</b>, a citizen of Nigeria, who was 
reportedly at imminent risk of execution.  
 
</p>
<p>220. The case of S.O. was previously brought to the attention of the Government (together 
with the cases of 12 other Nigerian migrant workers) by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture in a communication dated 30 November 2004. 
Regrettably, their communication has remained without reply. 
 
</p>
<p>221. According to the communication of 30 November 2004, S.O. and 12 other Nigerian 
migrant workers resident in Jeddah, &#8220;were among hundreds detained in Jeddah on 29 
September 2002 after a policeman was killed in a fight between local men and African 
nationals&#8221;. All the other men arrested on that occasion have been deported, including 21 who 
served prison sentences ranging from six months to two years and flogging. 
</p>
<p>222. Subsequent to their arrest, the 13 Nigerian nationals were tortured and ill-treated, 
including being hung upside down and beaten and subjected to electric shocks to the genitals. 
According to the information received, since their arrest over two years ago, the men have not 
had access to a lawyer or consular assistance. Moreover, translators were present on only two 
of the four previous court appearances, and all proceedings and court documents are in 
Arabic. 
</p>
<p>223. Reports indicated that, on 22 November 2004, a hearing in the case of the 13 men took 
place before three judges in a closed session, without the assistance of a lawyer, a consular 
representative or adequate translation facilities. They could not fully understand the 
proceedings, which were conducted in Arabic, and were not able to fully understand whether 
the hearing concerned the prolongation of their detention or constituted their trial. 
</p>
<p>224. It is further alleged that S.O. was sentenced to death at a closed trial in May 2005. The 
12 other Nigerian men were sentenced to prison terms and corporal punishment. During the 
trial, S.O. and his co-defendants neither had access to legal representation nor to consular 
assistance, nor did they benefit from adequate translation. During interrogation they had been 
told to put their fingerprints, which can act as a signature, on statements written in Arabic, 
which they could not read. It is possible that these statements were used as evidence against 
them during the trial proceedings. Staff from the Nigerian consulate in Jeddah attempted to 
visit the men in prison on 19 May 2005, but were not allowed to see them. The death sentence 
imposed on S.O. was upheld by the Court of Cassation and ratified by the Supreme Judicial 
Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>225. On 5 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an allegation letter regarding the execution on 19 
February 2007 of four Sri Lankan citizens, <b>Ranjith de Silva, Victor Corea, Sanath 
Pushpakumara </b>and<b> Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara</b>.  </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 31 
 
</p>
<p>226. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants had previously raised their concerns 
about this case in a communication to the Government of 13 April 2005, which unfortunately 
has remained without reply. 
</p>
<p>227. In the previous communication, they explained that, according to the information 
received, three Sri Lankan migrant workers &#8211;Victor Corea, Ranjith de Silva and Sanath 
Pushpakumara &#8211; had been involved in a series of armed robberies and had been arrested by 
the Riyadh police on 10 March 2004.  
</p>
<p>228. According to the information received, in October 2004 they were sentenced to death 
on charges of possession of illegal firearms and attempted robbery by the Saudi Arabian High 
Court. Their sentences were reportedly upheld in March 2005 and an appeal for mercy was at 
the time pending before the King of Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>229. On the basis of the information received, they expressed the concern that &#8220;the three 
men were sentenced to death after trials that appear[ed] to have fallen short of international 
fair trial standards. It is reported that they did not have any legal representation during their 
trials, although a translator was provided. The translation of proceedings is no substitute for 
adequate legal representation as required by international standards. In addition, it is alleged 
that after their trial, the three men were asked to sign a document in Arabic, stating their 
acceptance of the death sentence which only Mr. Silva reportedly refused to sign&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>230. More detailed reports received have added the name of a fourth defendant in the same 
case, Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara, and state that<b> </b>the execution took place on 19 February 
2007. This confirmed the concerns raised two years ago with regard to the lack of due 
process. It is reported that: &#8220;Around nine months after their arrest in March 2004, an official 
in al-Ha&#8217;ir prison where the four men were held informed them that they had a court hearing. 
The hearing lasted around three hours. The judge interrogated the four men, who were 
allowed only to speak in reply to his questions. The judge also asked whether they had 
suffered beatings during interrogation, to which they replied that they had. Minutes were 
taken and proceedings were interpreted, but no prosecutor was present and the defendants did 
not have legal or consular assistance. At no time were the defendants told that they might face 
the death penalty, nor were they ever informed that they had a right to a lawyer or a right not 
to incriminate themselves.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>231. According to reports received, several months after the first hearing, prison officials 
brought the four defendants to court a second time, again without prior notice. At this second 
hearing, two judges conferred for 20 minutes, then sentenced all four to death.  
</p><p>232. In response to a query from the court, all four defendants refused to accept the verdict, 
and the court sent the case for review to the Court of Cassation. The four men were unaware 
how to conduct an appeal and were not invited to make any submissions to the Court of 
Cassation or informed whether there would be any hearing. Three months later, the men were 
advised by a judge in a third trial session that the cassation court had upheld the verdict. No 
copy of the judgment was given to the four defendants.    
233. The four defendants managed to contact the Sri Lankan embassy from prison after the 
trial. The Sri Lankan diplomats informed them that it was too late to appoint a lawyer and that 
instead they would issue an appeal for clemency.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>234. On 19 February 2007, however, a royal order affirmed the death sentence. Ranjith de 
Silva, Victor Corea, Sanath Pushpakumara and Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara were executed on 
the same day. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>235. By letter dated 16 July 2007, the Government transmitted the following information to 
the Special Rapporteur regarding the cases of Ranjith de Silva, Victor Corea, Sanath 
Pushpakumara and Sharmila Sangeeth Kumara.  
</p>
<p>236. The Government reported that the charges brought against the persons,  mentioned on 
the communication letter, were substantiated by conclusive evidence of their commission of 
the crime, including their confessions, the medical reports, the report on the crime, the 
identification of the weapons used, the report on the examination of the accused and the 
reports on the inspection of the scene of the crime.  
</p>
<p>237. The Government further reported that, according to articles 155 and 182 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, the judicial proceedings were open to observers.  
</p><p>238. Finally, the Government informed that death sentences are handed down by the 
general courts in cases entailing the fixed penalties prescribed in the Islamic sharia  and in 
cases of lex talionis and crimes involving repeated offences of drug smuggling and 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>239. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply. He would 
like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the Government of Saudi Arabia<b> </b>to the 
communications that have remained without reply. 
 
</p>
<p><b>South Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
 
</b></p>
<p>240.  On 23 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning cases of trafficking in women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation and 
forced labour, through and from Mozambique to South Africa.  
 
</p>
<p>241. It was reported that South Africa is the main destination country for Mozambican 
victims of trafficking. Mozambique is particularly exposed to trafficking in persons due 
mainly to porous borders and the absence of protective legislation against trafficking.From 
Maputo in Mozambique, women and children are reportedly trafficked via Ressano Garcia or 
the Lebombo border in Mozambique to Gauteng. It is further alleged that another route used 
for trafficking of persons to South Africa, specifically to Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, is the 
border at Ponta do Ouro. The trafficking continues further either to the south of Swaziland 
and directly to Johannesburg and Pretoria, or south to Durban and Pietermaritzburg. It is 
estimated that approximately 1,000 Mozambican women per year are trafficked along these </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 33 
 
</p>
<p>routes. Reportedly, children are also trafficked daily in trucks through the Kruger National 
Park or the Swaziland border. Mozambicans from the north of Mozambique are trafficked 
into South Africa via Zimbabwe. It is reported that people being trafficked from the Great 
Lakes Region and East Africa enter the north of Mozambique via Malawi or Tanzania. 
Mozambican ports are also said to be a stopping point for traffickers travelling by sea, who 
then continue the journey overland to South Africa. 
</p><p>242. It is further reported that small-scale trafficking networks, based at transit houses in the 
border region between Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa, use minivan taxis to 
smuggle both migrants and trafficking victims across the border. Accomplices in 
Johannesburg, Maputo and in the Lebombo region reportedly assist them through recruiting, 
accommodating and transferring migrants and trafficked persons. Organized Mozambican 
refugees living legally in South Africa are also reported to be involved in such activities.  
</p>
<p>243. Reports indicate that, in this context, young women attempting to find work in South 
Africa are allegedly led to believe that they will be offered employment as waitresses or 
domestic workers. However, upon arrival at the transit centres the women are separated from 
others, and forced into prostitution or forced labour in agriculture, manufacturing or service 
industries. When subjected to forced labour, reports indicate that they are also often subject to 
sexual abuse by their employers. Reports also indicate that young women and girls are sold at 
the transit houses in Tonga and Johannesburg as &#8220;wives&#8221; to South African men. There are 
reports of &#8220;stocks&#8221; of women being displayed and of the possibility to order &#8220;wives&#8221; on 
demand.  
</p>
<p>244. Trafficked children are reportedly sold for US$ 30 to 50 per child. Orphans are 
particularly vulnerable to trafficking, particularly because of an alleged practice of informal 
adoption of children and because of adoption laws in Mozambique that are reported to 
facilitate their trafficking. There is an estimated 1.6 million orphans in Mozambique, of whom 
380,000 have lost their parents due to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>245. In addition, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa is reported to play a 
major role in increasing the demand for the trafficking of younger and presumably uninfected 
sex workers. Furthermore, it is reported that trafficking through several unguarded borders 
with Mozambique is facilitated by the complicity or the tolerance of border authorities.  
</p>
<p>246. The Government has been undertaking considerable efforts to combat trafficking, 
including the ratification, on 20 February 2004, of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Furthermore, in 
June 2006, the President signed into law the Children's Act of 2005, which prohibits the 
trafficking of children, namely &quot;the recruitment, sale, supply, transportation, transfer, 
harbouring or receipt of children, within or across the borders of the Republic&quot;.  
</p>
<p>247. However, according to the information received, national legislation explicitly 
prohibiting trafficking in adults is still to be adopted. The protection of trafficking victims 
remains also remains inadequate.  
</p>
<p>248. It is alleged that in December 2005, for example, 940 Mozambican illegal immigrants 
were deported without first being screened to identify if any amongst them were trafficked 
persons. </p>

Government of South Africa to these allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Sweden 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
 
</b></p>
<p>250. On 11 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the case of Ms. <b>L.K.</b>,<b> </b>a 
Turkish woman of Kurdish origin.  
</p>
<p>251. According to information received in 1988, while still living in Turkey, L.K, then 16, 
was forced by her parents to enter a marriage with a 31-year-old man. Her husband abused 
physically and mentally both her and their two sons, almost every day throughout their 
marriage. Sometimes he would lock her and their two children out of the house and they 
would be forced to sleep outside.  
</p>
<p>252. It is also reported that he repeatedly threatened L.K. that he would hang her and make 
it look like suicide if she did not obey him. L.K. sought support from her family several times, 
but was told to return to her husband. Moreover, her mother threatened to marry her again to 
an even older man if she did not obey.  
</p>
<p>253. In 2004, following a relationship with one of her husband&#8217;s friends, which was 
discovered by her family and discussed in a village meeting, L.K. went into hiding.  
</p>
<p>254. According to reports, her brothers announced that they would kill her if they found 
her. Subsequently, she received help in leaving her village and fleeing the country.  
</p>
<p>255. Reports indicate that L.K. arrived in Sweden on 31 March 2005, where she applied for 
asylum on 1 April 2005, referring to the risk of violence committed in the name of honour. 
Her asylum application was rejected by the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) on 
26 August 2006. 
</p>
<p>256. Following that decision L.K. appealed to the Swedish Aliens Board 
(Utl&#228;nningsn&#228;mnden), which rejected her application on 29 October 2005. This decision 
could not be appealed, and the authorities prepared for her deportation.  
</p>
<p>257. Information received also indicates that, on 15 November 2005, temporary legislation 
came into force, which allowed for a review of rejected asylum applications. L.K.&#8217;s 
application was reviewed in accordance with the new legislation, but once again rejected. The 
latter decision could not be appealed.  
</p>
<p>258. In March 2006 a new Aliens' Act came into force, according to which asylum 
applications are tried in first instance by the Swedish Migration Board. This decision of the 
first instance can be appealed to the Migration Court. If there are exceptional reasons or if 
there is a need for a legal precedent, this decision can be appealed a second time to the </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 35 
 
</p>
<p>Appellate Migration Court. However, the procedure in the new Aliens Act does not apply to 
those asylum-seekers who, like L.K., already had their case tried in full.  
</p>
<p>259. It is further alleged that L.K., after having exhausted all the remedies in Sweden, is 
facing the risk of being deported to Turkey.  
</p>
<p>260. Fears have been expressed that she may face a serious risk of being killed in the name 
of &#8220;honour&#8221; if deported back to Turkey. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>261. By letters dated 17 January and 1 February 2007, the Government transmitted the 
following information regarding the L.K. case. 
</p>
<p>262. By letter dated 12 June 2007, the Government reported that the Swedish Migration 
Board, as well as the former Swedish Appeal Board, had found strong reasons to question the 
credibility of L.K.&#8217;s story. The strong lack of credibility is the main reason for the rejection of 
L.K.&#8217;s application for asylum. 
</p>
<p>263.  The Government further reported that the Swedish Migration Board, in its decision of 
26 August 2007, and the former Swedish Appeal Board, in its decision of 29 October 2005, 
considered that L.K. would not be subjected to violence or honour killings were she returned 
to Turkey. 
</p>
<p>264. Additionally, the Government provided information regarding the Swedish Aliens 
Act. According to the Aliens Act&#8217;s chapter 12,  paragraphs 18 and 19, when the decision to 
refuse an alien entry into Sweden has entered into force, the alien can apply for impediment of 
enforcement of the deportation. As the decision to refuse L.K. entry into Sweden has, by the 
decision of 29 October 2005 of the former Swedish Appeal Board, entered into force, the 
rules of impediment to enforcement are the rules applicable to the case of  L.K.  
</p>
<p>265. The Government further reported that the deportation of L.K. had been temporarily 
suspended for the purpose of investigation. 
</p>
<p>266.  However, the Swedish Migration Board decided to reject L.K.&#8217;s application of 
impediment of enforcement.  
</p>
<p>267. The Board came to the conclusion that it was not likely that L.K. would be subject to 
honour-related violence once deported to Turkey. 
</p>
<p>268. The Swedish Migration Board is still of the opinion that there are strong reasons to 
question the credibility of the story of L.K. and has found no other reasons for granting her 
asylum or a residence permit in Sweden.  
</p>
<p>269. The Government also reported that L.K. has the possibility to appeal the decision of 
the Board to the Migration Court in Sweden. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>

<p>271.  The Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to the report to the Human Rights Council on 
the mission of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, to Turkey (A/HRC/4/34/Add.2). The report focuses on the continued severe 
problems of &#8220;honour&#8221;-related violence, including murder and forced suicides, in South-
Eastern and Eastern Anatolia and highlights serious protection gaps for women at risk of such 
violence.

<p><b>Communication envoy&#233; au Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>272. Le 27 juillet 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur 
les formes contemporaines de racisme, de discrimination raciale, de x&#233;nophobie et de 
l'intol&#233;rance, a adress&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement suisse concernant une 
nouvelle campagne du parti politique Union D&#233;mocratique du Centre (UDC).  
 
</p>
<p>273. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le parti politique Union D&#233;mocratique du Centre aurait 
lanc&#233; une nouvelle campagne pour promouvoir une proposition d&#8217;initiative populaire 
concernant le renvoi des citoyens &#233;trangers qui auraient commis un crime grave en Suisse. 
Dans le cadre de cette campagne, une publicit&#233; visuelle ayant pour titre &#171;Pour plus de s&#233;curit&#233; 
&#187; aurait &#233;t&#233; publi&#233;e dans plusieurs journaux suisses, montrant trois moutons blancs sur un 
drapeau suisse basculant un mouton noir hors du drapeau. Ces images s&#8217;accompagneraient du 
texte suivant: &#171;Gr&#226;ce &#224; l&#8217;initiative sur le renvoi, nous pouvons enfin syst&#233;matiquement 
renvoyer les &#233;trangers qui commettent un crime grave en Suisse. Nous augmentons ainsi la 
s&#233;curit&#233; pour les enfants, les femmes et les hommes&#187;. 
 
</p>
<p>274. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a exprim&#233; sa vive inqui&#233;tude quant au fait que ce type d&#8217;images 
puisse utiliser intentionnellement des ambig&#252;it&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; la question de la couleur des moutons 
pour transmettre un message de nature raciste. Dans ce sens, il a rappel&#233; au Gouvernement 
suisse des informations dont il a fait &#233;tat dans son rapport de mission au Conseil des droits de 
l&#8217;homme (A/HRC/4/2007/19/Add.2) concernant des campagnes politiques pr&#233;c&#233;dentes de 
l&#8217;UDC, montrant entre autres des mains de couleur essayant d&#8217;attraper des passeports suisses 
dans un panier. En outre, comme constat&#233; dans son rapport de mission, il a exprim&#233; sa 
profonde pr&#233;occupation quant &#224; la possibilit&#233; que cette campagne puisse contribuer &#224; la 
tendance de banalisation et de l&#233;gitimation du racisme et de la x&#233;nophobie dans les milieux 
politiques et intellectuels en Suisse. Finalement, il a exprim&#233; son inqui&#233;tude quant &#224; la 
possibilit&#233; que ce type de publicit&#233; produise une augmentation de la discrimination et de la 
x&#233;nophobie dont souffrent majoritairement les membres des communaut&#233;s &#233;trang&#232;res et des 
minorit&#233;s nationales, notamment les Noirs. 
 
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b> 
</p>
<p>275. Le 13 septembre 2007, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication du Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial du 27 juillet 2007.  
 
</p>
<p>276. Le Gouvernement a tout d&#8217;abord not&#233; que toutes les soci&#233;t&#233;s modernes doivent 
aujourd&#8217;hui faire face &#224; une acc&#233;l&#233;ration de la diversit&#233; dans tous les domaines et que, en 
Suisse, comme partout ailleurs en Europe, les dynamiques li&#233;es &#224; la globalisation peuvent 
conduire &#224; un climat de tension identitaire, susceptible d&#8217;&#234;tre exploit&#233; politiquement. Le 
Gouvernement a cependant indiqu&#233; que ces confrontations sont le signe d&#8217;une d&#233;mocratie </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 37 
 
</p>
<p>vivante &#224; laquelle participent tous les groupes de la population. En Suisse, la d&#233;mocratie 
directe permet, par le biais de referendums lanc&#233;s contre des lois vot&#233;es par le Parlement et 
d&#8217;initiatives &#233;manant du peuple qui proposent des modifications constitutionnelles, de 
discuter de th&#232;mes controvers&#233;s sur la sc&#232;ne publique. 
 
</p>
<p>277. Le Gouvernement a &#233;galement soulign&#233; qu&#8217;une grande transparence est assur&#233;e dans 
le d&#233;bat politique visant &#224; trouver des solutions pratiques et constructives, et que les 
campagnes li&#233;es a ce d&#233;bat, dans les phases initiales tout a moins, peuvent &#234;tre accompagn&#233;es 
d&#8217;expressions exag&#233;r&#233;es et regrettables. Le Gouvernement a toutefois observ&#233; que les auteurs 
de l&#8217;initiative doivent savoir, compte tenu de l&#8217;exp&#233;rience historique, qu&#8217;en caricaturant la 
r&#233;alit&#233;, ils compromettent leurs chances de succ&#232;s. 
 
</p>
<p>278. La d&#233;mocratie directe, finalement, oblige les citoyens actifs &#224; se d&#233;terminer 
concr&#232;tement. Il est d&#233;montr&#233; qu&#8217;elle n&#8217;a pas entrain&#233; d&#8217;abus de caract&#232;re raciste, m&#234;me aux 
moments les plus difficiles de l&#8217;histoire europ&#233;enne. 
 
</p>
<p>279. Dans sa r&#233;ponse, le Gouvernement a &#233;galement not&#233; que, pour adh&#233;rer &#224; la 
Convention pour l&#8217;Elimination de la Discrimination Raciale, en 1994, la Suisse a modifi&#233; son 
Code p&#233;nal en y inscrivant l&#8217;art 261 bis qui rend punissable toute incitation au racisme dans 
l&#8217;espace public. Cet article a &#233;t&#233; accept&#233; par le peuple le 25 septembre 1994. 
 
</p>
<p>280. En ce qui concerne la campagne de l&#8217;UDC, le Gouvernement a confirm&#233; qu&#8217;une 
initiative populaire visant le renvoi des citoyens &#233;trangers qui auraient commis un crime grave 
a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e le 10 juillet 2007 et que des affiches conformes &#224; la description contenue dans la 
lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation ont &#233;t&#233; placard&#233;es dans toutes les r&#233;gions de la Suisse. Le Gouvernement a 
pr&#233;cis&#233; que les actes &#224; caract&#232;re potentiellement raciste commis dans l&#8217;espace public &#233;tant 
poursuivis d&#8217;office, il appartient, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, aux tribunaux de juger si ces affiches sont 
condamnables.  
 
</p>
<p>281. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que, &#224; ce jour, les tribunaux ont privil&#233;gi&#233; la confrontation 
politique ouverte plut&#244;t qu&#8217;une application rigoureuse de l&#8217;interdiction. Les arr&#234;ts rendus 
correspondent &#224; l&#8217;opinion du Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral, selon laquelle la confrontation politique a plus 
d&#8217;impact, &#224; long terme, qu&#8217;une condamnation par le juge. Le Gouvernement observe que cette 
attitude est coh&#233;rente avec la jurisprudence constante de la Cour europ&#233;enne des droits de 
l&#8217;homme qui souligne l&#8217;importance particuli&#232;re de la libert&#233; d&#8217;expression dans une soci&#233;t&#233; 
d&#233;mocratique et qui n&#8217;accepte gu&#232;re des restrictions de cette libert&#233; dans le d&#233;bat politique. 
 
</p>
<p>282. Le Gouvernement a &#233;galement indiqu&#233; que la r&#233;colte de signatures et, si cette initiative 
aboutit, les d&#233;bats qui auront lieu avant la votation, permettront de se confronter &#224; son 
contenu. Si l&#8217;initiative est accept&#233;e par le peuple et les cantons, les autorit&#233;s f&#233;d&#233;rales et 
cantonales devront veiller &#224; ce qu&#8217;elle soit mise en &#339;uvre de mani&#232;re conforme aux 
engagements internationaux de la Suisse. 
 
</p>
<p>283. Finalement, la r&#233;ponse indique que le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral a r&#233;it&#233;r&#233; &#224; plusieurs reprises son 
engagement contre le racisme et qu&#8217;il continuera &#224; prendre clairement position contre toute 
forme de discrimination et de x&#233;nophobie. Le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral porte une attention particuli&#232;re 
aux questions migratoires et &#224; la politique d&#8217;int&#233;gration; c&#8217;est pour cela qu&#8217;il a d&#233;cid&#233;, le 22 
aout 2007, d&#8217;adopter un train de mesures visant &#224; favoriser l&#8217;int&#233;gration et &#224; combattre la 
discrimination. Ce projet a &#233;t&#233; &#233;labor&#233; en &#233;troite collaboration par tous les organes f&#233;d&#233;raux </p>

f&#233;d&#233;ral est convaincu qu&#8217;un travail constructif de ce genre est la meilleure r&#233;ponse aux 
manifestations x&#233;nophobes.

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p><b>284. </b>Le Rapporteur sp&#233;ciale remercie le Gouvernement pour sa r&#233;ponse d&#233;taill&#233;e et 
approfondie.<b>

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>285. On 26 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning the recent implementation of provincial labour legislation in 
Thailand&#8217;s upper South provinces, including Phuket, Ranong, Rayong, Surat and Thani. This 
new legislation covers a specific group of migrant workers from Laos, Cambodia and 
Myanmar and reportedly restricts their fundamental human rights, making them more 
vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and human trafficking. 
 
</p>
<p>286. According to the information received, since December 2006, new regulations have 
been implemented restricting, inter alia, the freedom of movement of these  migrant workers 
reportedly due to national security concerns. The new legislation provides for various 
restrictive measures, such as a ban on public gatherings of more than five persons without 
prior permission, a ban on the use of motorcycles and cars, and a curfew obliging migrant 
workers to be in their residences from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. unless they are under the supervision 
of their employer or in cases of health emergencies. 
</p>
<p>287. Employers are allegedly required to submit to the provincial authorities a list of the 
names of migrant workers who own mobile phones, together with phone registration numbers 
and SIM cards numbers, in order to monitor their phone calls. These regulations therefore 
restrict migrants&#8217; rights inter alia to a family life, to practise their religion, to access to social 
services, including health services. The same restrictions ultimately prevent these workers 
from being able to bring complaints against their employers in situations of violations of 
labour laws, including abuse and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>288. Fears have been expressed that these restrictions to freedom of movement and privacy 
are discriminatory, since they are applicable only to this specific group of migrant workers, 
from Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>289. Moreover, reports also indicate that there are an increasing number of migrant workers 
in these provinces who are subject to harsh and unsafe working conditions, including 
excessive working hours and non payment of wages. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>290. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the 
Government of Thailand to these allegations.

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>291. On 28 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
regarding changes made to the Highly Skilled Migration Programme. 
 
</p>
<p>292. According to information received, the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) 
was launched on 28 January 2002, and designed to allow individuals who are highly skilled 
and have skills and experience to seek entry to work in the United Kingdom without having 
prior offer of employment, or to take up self-employment opportunities.  
</p>
<p>293. It was further reported that the initial criteria for the selection of HSMP applicants had 
changed a number of times, namely on 31 October 2003, 12 April 2005, 3 April and 7 
November 2006.  
</p>
<p>294. On 7 November 2006, the Home Office revised the Highly Skilled Migrant 
Programme (HSMP) rules for Further Leave to Remain (FLR) extension and Indefinite Leave 
to Remain (ILR) which was allegedly published in the Explanatory Memorandum HC 1702.  
</p>
<p>295. Reports indicate that the latest revisions to HSMP include: an increase of scoring 
points to qualify as a HSMP applicant, from 65 to 75 points, the need to provide evidence of 
English-language ability at the extension stage, and an increase from four  to five years to 
apply for FLR extension and ILR. 
</p>
<p>296. Concern is expressed for the applicants who are already living in the United Kingdom 
under previous HSMP rules of which they fully respected the requirements and now need to 
reapply and requalify under the new criteria, of which they may not fulfil the latest 
requirements. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>297. By letter dated 21 September 2007, the Government provided information regarding 
the most recent changes to the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP). 
</p>
<p>298. The Immigration Rules change made on 3 April 2006 was not a change to the HSMP 
selection criteria, but a change to the qualifying period for settlement from four to five years 
for all employment categories in the Immigration Rules. 
</p>
<p>299. In its February Paper &#8220;Controlling our borders: the five-year strategy for asylum and 
immigration&#8221;, the Government set out its view that permanent migration must also be a 
journey towards being as socially integrated as possible. Increasing the qualifying period for 
settlement to five years brings the Government in line with the European norm for these 
purposes and also helps to ensure that settlement is a final stage in an on-going process of 
building up an attachment to the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>300. According to the Government, the changes were made following research into the way 
that the HSMP was working in practice, and which selection criteria were the best predictors 
of labour-market success. This research showed that the majority of those on the scheme were 
in highly skilled employment and were making an important economic contribution to the 
United Kingdom. But a minority were failing to find highly skilled jobs, and were therefore 
not fulfilling the purpose of the scheme.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>301. The Government reported that it had made changes to the selection criteria for initial 
applications. This was to ensure that the programme continues to attract those migrants who 
are of the greatest benefit to the British economy and to make it clearer and more objective, in 
line with their aims for the forth-coming Points-Based System for managed migration. Points 
are awarded for qualifications, previous earnings, age and experience in the United Kingdom. 
In addition, under both the old and the new HSMP, participants have to show that they intend 
to make the United Kingdom their main home, and are able to maintain and accommodate 
themselves without recourse to public funds.  
</p>
<p>302. They have also amended the requirements for applicants who have previously had a 
grant of leave in this category and are applying for an extension. Under the old HSMP, in 
operation up to November 2006, participants had to show that they had taken all reasonable 
steps to become lawfully economically active in the United Kingdom in order to extend their 
leave. Following the November 2006 changes, applicants now have to show that they can pass 
a points test similar to that required of applicants who are applying for initial leave. They have 
made the extension test more rigorous to ensure that those extending their leave under the 
HSMP are actually doing highly skilled work. Their analysis of the way the scheme was 
operating prior to the changes showed that some of those with HSMP visas were not in highly 
skilled employment.  
</p>
<p>303.  The Government also informed that a mandatory English-language requirement has 
also been imposed for applicants seeking initial leave or extension of their leave under HSMP. 
This is to ensure that HSMP helps them to select those migrants who will make the greatest 
economic contribution to the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>304. There are robust new document-verification powers to help the Government to deal 
with forged and fake documents submitted in support of applications.  
</p>
<p>305. Existing grants of leave continue unaffected by the changes. Only those making new 
applications for either initial leave, or an extension of leave, after the new rules came into 
effect, will be affected by the changes.  
</p>
<p>306. Regarding complaints made about the programme, the Government informed that they 
have received a judicial review challenge relating to the fact that those who gained initial 
leave under the old HSMP will have to make new extension applications under the new 
HSMP. This application for judicial review was refused permission. The judicial review 
application has now been resubmitted and is currently awaiting permission to be heard.  
</p>
<p>307. The Government expects that most of those people who would have succeeded under 
the old criteria will also succeed under the new. For those who are not able to pass the new 
points test for extension applications, but who have been making an economic contribution to 
the United Kingdom, the Government has put significant transitional arrangements in place.  
</p>
<p>308. According to the Government, HSMP participants who have been in employment for 
specified periods of time will be able to switch into work permit employment without their 
employer needing to undertake a Resident Labour Market Test (a test to ensure that there are 
no willing and suitably qualified domestic workers available for the post). Transitional 
arrangements have also been put in place for HSMP participants who are self-employed.

<p>309. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland for its detailed response.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication  sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>310. On 8 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the case of Mr. <b>A.M.K.,</b> a 
Cameroonian national, formerly a police officer in Loum and held at Oakington detention centre 
in Cambridge.  
 
</p>
<p>311. It is alleged that A.M.K. was detained in his home country Cameroon between 20 
November 2004 and 11 February 2005 based on allegations that he supported the political 
opposition. He was at first held in solitary confinement in a detention centre in Douala in a very 
dark cell measuring 1.5 metres by 2 metres During that time he was frequently forced into 
uncomfortable positions and severely beaten with rubber whips on his buttocks and soles.  
 
</p>
<p>312. According to the information received, after three weeks he was transferred to a 
disciplinary prison in Edear, where he shared a cell with other inmates. The cell was extremely 
dirty, light was scarce, he frequently had no access to water and the little water that he received 
was of poor quality, as was the food. He was not given food for prolonged periods and not 
allowed to exercise. During his custody, he had no access to a lawyer. 
 
</p>
<p>313. It is further alleged that, as a result of the treatment and the detention conditions, he 
sustained eye problems, a stomach condition and scars, mainly on his buttocks and the soles of 
his feet. He also suffers from depression.  
</p>
<p>314. In February 2005 A.M.K. fled to the United Kingdom, where he asked for asylum on 14 
April 2005. His claim, after having been considered by several instances, was finally rejected on 
22 February 2007 based on the argument that the medical evidence was not &#8220;completely 
conclusive&#8221; and did not constitute &#8220;independent corroborative evidence&#8221;. It was alleged that he 
was due to be deported on 9 March 2007 at 9 p.m.  
</p>
<p>315. Concern is expressed for A.M.K.'s physical and mental integrity, should he be forcibly 
returned to Cameroon. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>316. By letter dated 28 March 2007, the Government provided information regarding the 
case of A.M.K. 
</p>
<p>317. The Government reported that, A.M.K. claimed to have entered the United Kingdom at 
Gatwick airport on 3 April 2005 using a French passport to which he was not entitled. 
According to the Government, he sought asylum on 14 April 2005, on which date he was 
informed of his liability to removal from the United Kingdom as an illegal entrant. 
</p>
<p>318. The Government also reported that his case was accepted into the fast-track procedure 
and, as an integral part of that procedure, he was detained at Harmondsworth. He was 
interviewed on 22 April 2005 about the basis of his claim.  
</p>
<p>319. On 25 April 2005 his asylum claim was rejected. The Immigration and Nationality 
Directorate (IND) accepted that A.M.K had been a policeman in Cameroon at some point but </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>did not accept as true any other aspect of his claim. IND took the view that A.M.K.&#8217;s motives 
for coming to the United Kingdom were primarily for economic reasons.  
</p>
<p>320. A.M.K.&#8217;s appeal against this decision was heard by an immigration judge and 
dismissed on 4 May 2005.  
</p>
<p>321. According to the Government, the immigration judge held that there was no evidence 
to support the appellant&#8217;s assertion that he would be at risk of his life if he were to return.  
</p>
<p>322. A.M.K. applied to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal for a reconsideration of that 
decision. His application was rejected.  
</p><p>323. A.M.K. refused to cooperate with procedures to obtain travel documents for him and 
because his return to Cameroon was therefore no longer imminent he was released from 
detention on 14 July 2005.  
</p>
<p>324. On 12 December 2006, A.M.K.&#8217;s solicitors made a purported fresh application on his 
behalf citing an asserted interference with his human rights under articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Those representations were rejected on 22 
February 2007.  
</p>
<p>325. On 23 February 2007 A.M.K. was detained under Immigration Service powers and 
directions were set for his removal to Cameroon on 2 March 2007. There were deferred for 
administrative reasons on 1 March and were reset for 9 March 2007.  
</p>
<p>326. On 5 March 2007 his legal representatives lodged an application for judicial review 
with the Administrative Division of the High Court.  
</p>
<p>327. Mr. Koimon was released from detention on 9 March 2007 pending the outcome of his 
application to the Court.  
</p>
<p>328. The Government reported that the account set out in the letter sent to the Government 
was the basis of A.M.K.&#8217;s application for asylum in the United Kingdom. Neither the 
Immigration and Nationality Directorate nor the independent immigration appellate 
authorities, specifically set up to adjudicate on these matters, accepted any part of his account 
as being true, other than he had at some point been a policeman in Cameroon.  
</p>
<p>329. The Government also provided information regarding the standard of proof required in 
an asylum claim, which is referred to as &#8220;reasonable likelihood&#8221;. The asylum case worker is 
guided in this by the published Asylum Policy Instructions (API). 
</p>
<p>330. The API on Assessing the Claim states that the decision maker will seldom be able to 
say with certainty whether or not an applicant will be persecuted if returned to his or her 
country of origin. The appropriate test for a decision maker to apply is to consider whether, at 
the date when they are making their decision, there is a reasonable degree of likelihood of the 
applicant being persecuted in their country of origin. The courts have said that a &#8220;reasonable 
degree of likelihood&#8221; has the same meaning as the term &#8220;real risk&#8221;, which is the test used by 
decision makers when assessing whether an applicant will be subject on return to treatment 
which violates article 3 of the European Convention on the Human Rights.  </p>

<p>          A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
          page 43 
 
</p>
<p>331. This does not require the decision maker to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities 
that the applicant is more likely than not to suffer persecution for a Convention reason in their 
country of origin. Where the objective country evidence, applied to the applicant&#8217;s case, 
suggests that there is a continuing reasonable likelihood that the applicant would face 
persecution in their country of origin, the applicant should normally be granted refugee status.  
</p>
<p>332. Decision makers should bear in mind that, however well-founded an applicant&#8217;s 
original/historic reasons for fleeing their country of origin, they are only entitled to a grant of 
asylum where at the date of decision they continue to have a well-founded fear of persecution 
for a Convention reason. 
</p>
<p>333. According to the Government, if an applicant has already been subjected to, or 
threatened with, persecution or serious harm, this could be a serious indication that 
persecution or harm might happen again.  
</p>
<p>334. The API on the European Convention on Human Rights contains guidance on the 
consideration to be given to human rights issues which are raised alongside an asylum claim 
or are inherent in that claim.  
</p>
<p>335. This API states under &#8220;Standard of Proof&#8221; that a person must show there are 
substantial grounds for believing that, if returned to their country of origin or other country of 
return, there is a real risk of their being subjected to serious harm.  
</p><p>336. The Government also reported that, in order to maintain the integrity of its asylum 
system and to deter unfounded applications, it is important that they be able to enforce the 
return of those who are found not to be genuinely in need of international protection and who 
have no right to remain in the United Kingdom. According to the Government, they would 
not seek to enforce the return of A.M.K. to Cameroon unless they are satisfied it was safe to 
do so. The rationality of this decision has been confirmed by the independent Asylum and 
Immigration Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>337. As with returns to all countries, the Home Office does not actively monitor the 
treatment of individual Cameroonian nationals once they have been removed from the United 
Kingdom. Had it been considered that an individual was likely to suffer persecution on his 
return then he would not have been removed. It would generally be inappropriate and 
impractical for the United Kingdom to actively monitor individual citizens of another country 
once they returned there. It is necessary to take a pragmatic approach, but one that certainly 
should not be interpreted as disinterest.  
</p>
<p>338. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office follows the human rights situation through its 
network of posts around the world, including in Cameroon. It will pass to the Home Office 
any allegations that returnees have been mistreated, and where appropriate may be asked to 
make discreet enquiries, often through NGOs or other third parties. Such information will 
always be taken fully into account as a factor in the formulation of asylum policies and hence 
the decision whether it is safe to return an individual.

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>340. On 31 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the case of Mr<b>. </b>N.V., a 43-year-old US 
citizen, Indian by birth, detained at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. 
 
</p>
<p>341. According to the information received, N.V. emigrated from India to the United States in 
1988 and later became the Director of the Medical Examiner's Management Information Systems 
Department of the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, a position he held for 15 
years.  
 
</p>
<p>342. It is alleged that in 2005 he was charged with embezzling more than US$ 10 million in 
Federal Emergency Management Agency cash allocated for a computer system that analyses 
DNA and was used to identify the bodies after the attacks of 11 September 2001 on the World 
Trade Center in New York.  
 
</p>
<p>343. Reports indicate that on 7 December 2005 he was arrested. However, no arrest warrant 
was shown to him.  
 
</p>
<p>344. It is further alleged that since then, he has been detained at the high-security Metropolitan 
Detention Center. His first bail application was reportedly denied for the reason that he was not a 
United States citizen. Information received also indicated that, after he had proven that he held 
American citizenship, his application for bail was rejected reportedly because of his original 
Indian  nationality. 
</p>
<p>345. According to reports, N.V., who is a practising Hindu, is provided with meals containing 
meat, which runs counter to the principles of his religion.  Furthermore, he has not had the 
opportunity to practise his religion in prison. N.V. has been purportedly subjected to regular strip 
searches and humiliations and has been forced to work under severe conditions.  He has been 
refused access to proper medical care, although he informed the prison authorities about his 
suffering from pain.   
</p>
<p>346. Reports also indicate that N.V. is being held together with sentenced criminals in prison, 
some of whom are believed to be dangerous. 
</p>
<p>347. Fears have been expressed that the conditions at the detention centre might prevent N.V.  
from preparing his defence adequately. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>348. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his interest in receiving the reply of the 
Government of the United States of America to these allegations.

<p>349. On 1 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government, regarding the case of Mr. <b>S.S.K.</b>, aged 37, an Egyptian 
national, detained at York County Prison in Pennsylvania.  
 
</p>
<p>350. According to the allegations received he was at imminent risk of forcible return to Egypt. 
S.S.K. arrived from Egypt to the United States of America (John F. Kennedy Airport) on 11 
February 1998, where he applied for asylum.  
 
</p>
<p>351. Reports indicate that, since he had been charged with murder in Egypt, he was taken into 
custody upon his arrival to the United States. On 24 February 2004, a review of the decision of 
removal by the Board of Immigration Appeals by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals granted him 
relief from removal under the Convention against Torture. The Court found that there was a 
substantial likelihood that he would be tortured if returned to Egypt.  
 
</p>
<p>352. Information received also indicates that, on 6 February 2006, the United States District 
Court for the District of New Jersey granted a petition for habeas corpus, and ordered his release 
from detention, subject to monthly reporting to the Department of Homeland Security.   
 
</p>
<p>353. On 29 May 2007, he was detained when he appeared for his monthly appointment.  He 
was informed that diplomatic assurances had been received from the Government of Egypt on 24 
January 2007. The assurances were reportedly sufficient to ensure that he could be removed 
without any danger of torture upon his return. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland 
Security was thereby revoking the deferral of his removal. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>354. By letter dated 3 July 2007, the Government provided the Special Rapporteur with 
information regarding the case of S.S.K.  
</p>
<p>355. The Government reported that S.S.K. was denied admission to the United States due 
to the fact that the Department of State had cancelled his non-immigrant visa while he was en 
route to New York after the Government of Egypt notified the United States Embassy in 
Cairo that S.S.K. was suspected of committing the brutal murder of Ms. H.Z.M.Y. just hours 
before leaving Egypt.  
</p>
<p>356. The Government also reported that United States immigration laws allow inadmissible 
aliens to pursue certain forms of relief and protection from removal. According to the 
Government, S.S.K. has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to do so. Among these 
safeguards is protection based on regulations that implemented American obligations under 
article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, under which it is more likely than not, that the person would be 
tortured.  
</p>
<p>357. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Court of Appeals) in a 
published decision on 24 February 2004, upheld a Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) 
decision, finding S.S.K. removable from the United States, but granting him a deferral of 
removal to Egypt on the basis that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured there. 
In that same opinion, the court of appeals also upheld a BIA finding that there were serious </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>reasons to believe that S.S.K. murdered H.Z.M.Y. The evidence against him included, among 
other things, both his fingerprints at the scene of the crime and his shirt, stained with blood 
that matched H.Z.M.Y.&#8217;s blood type.  
</p>
<p>358. Pursuant to regulatory procedures that implement United States obligations under the 
Convention against Torture in the immigration context, the Department of State engaged in 
discussions and other communications with the Government of Egypt concerning the 
treatment that S.S.K. would receive if he were removed to that country. The Government 
reported that, in the course of these classified diplomatic communications, the Government of 
Egypt provided formal written assurances to the Government of the United States that S.S.K. 
would not be tortured if he were removed to Egypt.  
</p>
<p>359. The Government recalled that the United States did not agree with the non-binding 
opinion of the Human Rights Committee that article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights creates a non-refoulement obligation on States Parties, nor did it share the 
view expressed in the letter that diplomatic assurances were never reliable or effective in 
protecting against torture.  
</p>
<p>360. The Government also reported that the United States did not believe that diplomatic 
assurances were appropriate in every case or that they could serve as a substitute for a case-
by-case analysis of whether United States obligations under article 3 of the Convention 
against Torture would be met. The Government reported that the United States employs 
properly tailored diplomatic assurances from foreign Governments related to torture in 
appropriate cases.  
</p>
<p>361. After a careful review, the Department of State determined and formally conveyed its 
view to the Department of Homeland Security that the assurances received from the 
Government of Egypt regarding the treatment of S.S.K. were of sufficient reliability to enable 
the Secretary of Homeland security to conclude that, if S.S.K. were removed to Egypt with 
these assurances, it would not be likely that he would be tortured.  
</p>
<p>362. According to the Government, in evaluating the credibility of assurances of this 
nature, the United States considers, among other relevant information, information concerning 
the judicial and penal conditions and practices of the country providing assurances; the 
identity and position of the official relaying the assurances and the ability of that person to 
speak on behalf of that Government; and United States diplomatic relations with the country 
providing the assurances. 
</p>
<p>363. In this case, the Department of Homeland Security agreed with the Department of 
State&#8217;s assessment and concluded that the assurances were sufficiently reliable to permit 
S.S.K.&#8217;s removal to Egypt. The Secretary of Homeland Security thereby terminated his 
deferral of removal. S.S.K., who had been released but monitored, was retaken into custody 
by the Department of Homeland Security on 9 May 2007, for the purpose of effecting his 
removal to Egypt. S.S.K. challenged the Government&#8217;s actions by means of a federal court 
litigation in both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the United 
States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

</b> 
</p>
<p>365. On 3 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the case of Mr <b>A.F.</b>,<b> </b>aged 34, an Iraqi national and 
teacher, resident in Sanaa, Yemen, since 2002.  
 
</p>
<p>366. According to the information received, A.F was reportedly arrested by agents of the 
intelligence services (Al Amn Assiyassi) in Sanaa on 16 January 2007. He was secretly detained on 
their premises for more than two months before being transferred in late March to an administrative 
detention centre for persons to be expelled.  
 
</p>
<p>367. It is alleged that on 18 April 2007 he was returned to the headquarters of the intelligence 
service in Sanaa, where he is still reportedly being held in incommunicado detention.  
 
</p>
<p>368. It is further alleged that no charges have been brought against A.F. 
</p>
<p>369. Reports indicate that a request for release dated 15 August 2007, filed with the Prosecutor 
General of Sanaa, has not been answered.
