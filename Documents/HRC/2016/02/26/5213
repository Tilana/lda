</p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur carried out a visit to Botswana, by invitation of the Government, 
from 19 to 28 March 2009. The purpose of the visit was to shed light on the challenges that some 
of the many diverse indigenous peoples of Botswana face, especially in relation to their distinct 
cultural identities and marginalized conditions, with a view to developing practical solutions to 
address those challenges. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of 
Botswana for its assistance and support prior to and during the visit, and for its continued 
engagement in constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>2. Following his visit, the Special Rapporteur provided the Government with a written 
overview of his initial observations and requested that it provide clarification on a number of 
issues raised during the visit. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Botswana for 
the information provided in response to the questions asked. The Special Rapporteur is 
committed to reviewing carefully and giving due consideration to the information provided by 
the Government, as well as to the concerns raised by all interested parties, in his final report.  
</p>
<p>3. The preliminary observations on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Botswana are 
intended to provide initial information on the visit and the relevant exchange of information. A 
full report on the mission and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment of the human rights situation 
of indigenous peoples in Botswana, including conclusions and recommendations, will be 
finalized and submitted to the Human Rights Council at a later date. 
</p>
<p>4. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the Ministry 
of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration and the Inter-Ministerial Committee, 
comprising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Local 
Government, the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources, the Ministry of the 
Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, the Ministry of Defence, Justice and Security, the Ministry 
of Lands and Housing, and the Ministry of Education, as well as members of the United Nations 
country team. He also met with representatives of academic, civil society and business sector 
groups. He travelled to various parts of the country to hold discussions with local indigenous 
communities and the organizations that work with them, to hear their concerns and gather 
information.  
</p>
<p>5. It is apparent to the Special Rapporteur that the Government of Botswana is committed to 
building a society in which all are equal and to elevating the economic and social conditions of 
the country&#8217;s people. The Special Rapporteur notes a number of important, and in many ways 
exemplary, initiatives undertaken by the Government to address the situation of historically and 
still marginalized indigenous peoples in Botswana, particularly the Basarwa (or San), especially 
with respect to improving their access to crucial services, including health and education, and 
creating opportunities for income generation. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur also notes the Government&#8217;s long-term efforts to address the 
underdevelopment of marginalized indigenous peoples through the Remote-Area Development 
Programme. While in the past there have been certain problems associated with the design and 
implementation of the programme, recent assessments have culminated in constructive 
recommendations that, if implemented, could have a positive impact in addressing the 
underdevelopment of many disadvantaged indigenous groups in Botswana. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur is also aware of the Government&#8217;s initiatives to eradicate 
discrimination and to build an inclusive society. In particular, he notes the recent adoption of 
constitutional and legislative reforms, such as the Bogosi Act, aimed at ensuring equal 
representation and participation in the political process for all the people of Botswana. Some 
indigenous groups in Botswana, including and perhaps most notably the Basarwa, have 
historically been excluded from political and decision-making processes. These reforms are an 
important step towards achieving greater participation and representation in those processes, 
although significant challenges remain. 
</p>
<p>8. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the important advances that Botswana has 
made, he must also take into account the repeated statements of discontent he heard among all 
the communities visited (predominantly Basarwa and Bakgalagadi indigenous communities), 
including in relation to the fulfilment of rights associated with access to health and education 
services, land and resources, and the decision-making processes affecting them. Despite the 
positive efforts made by the Government, the Special Rapporteur heard that the language, culture 
and heritage of the indigenous groups are often not adequately taken into account in the design 
and implementation of the Government development initiatives affecting them, and that they are 
not adequately consulted, with the result that the ultimate success of the Government&#8217;s initiatives 
is impeded. 
</p>
<p>9. An issue of particular concern is the relocation of indigenous groups from the Central 
Kalahari Game Reserve, which the Government has promoted pursuant to its development and 
conservation plans. In the settlements of Kaudwane and New Xade outside the game reserve, 
several Basarwa community members who had been resettled there from the reserve complained 
of their relocation; in the communities of Gugamma and Metsiamanong, located inside the game 
reserve, individuals who have remained or managed to return there expressed concern at the lack 
of access to services, including water. The renowned Tsodillo Hills heritage site is another place 
from which indigenous people have been relocated. The Special Rapporteur visited the site and a 
community that had been relocated from it, and heard from community members, who expressed 
a range of concerns related to their relocation. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur understands that the Government has a different perspective on the 
above-mentioned relocations and other issues raised by members of indigenous communities; 
nonetheless, he is concerned by these issues and is endeavouring to address them in a 
constructive manner consistent with his mandate. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur understands that he was able to visit only a small fraction of the 
many communities of Basarwa and other non-dominant tribes in Botswana. Nonetheless, he was 
struck by the apparent sincerity and consistency of the accounts of discontent he heard, and by 
the fact that these accounts are reinforced by the information and analysis provided by respected 
non-governmental actors in Botswana and other credible sources, including those associated with 
international institutions, such as the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur believes that the concerns expressed to him during his visit are 
associated with three underlying, interrelated issues: (a) respect for cultural diversity and </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.4 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>identity; (b) consultation and political participation; and (c) redress for historical wrongs. 
The Special Rapporteur is evaluating these underlying issues in connection with an ongoing 
exchange of information, and will address them and provide recommendations thereon in his 
final report, with a view to developing potential solutions to meet these challenges. 
</p>
<p>13. As the Special Rapporteur continues work on his final report for submission to the 
Council, he reiterates his commitment to engage in a dialogue with the Government of Botswana 
over the concerns raised both in these initial observations and in the Government&#8217;s preliminary 
response of March 2009, and he recognizes that such engagement is essential to his work as 
Special Rapporteur.
