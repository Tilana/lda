INTRODUCTION
PART I
Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation is a large primary silver producer with significant gold assets located in
North America and is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the operation and/or ownership, development and
exploration of silver and gold mining properties and companies located primarily within South America (Chile,
Argentina and Bolivia), Mexico (Chihuahua), United States (Nevada and Alaska) and Australia (New South Wales).
Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to collectively as “Coeur” or the
“Company.” Coeur was incorporated in Idaho in 1928.
OVERVIEW OF MINING PROPERTIES AND INTERESTS
The Company’s most significant operating and development-stage mining properties and interests are:
(cid:129) Coeur owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of Empresa Minera Manquiri S.A. (“Manquiri”), a Bolivian
company that controls the mining rights for the San Bartolomé mine, which is an open pit silver mine in
Bolivia where commercial production commenced June 2008.
(cid:129) On December 21, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bolnisi Gold NL (“Bolnisi”)
and Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation (“Palmarejo”), through which its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. owns and is developing the underground and surface Palmarejo silver and gold
project in Mexico. The Palmarejo project is currently in the beginning stage of commercial production.
Through the Bolnisi acquisition, the Company also controls other exploration-stage properties in northern
Mexico.
(cid:129) Coeur owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the capital stock of Coeur Argentina S.R.L., which owns
and operates the underground high-grade silver Martha mine located in Santa Cruz, Argentina. Mining
operations commenced at the Martha mine in June 2002. In 2007, the Company built a stand-alone mill to
process ore from the Martha mine which previously was transported to its Cerro Bayo mine for processing.
The Company carries on an active exploration program at its Martha mine and on its other land in Santa
Cruz, which totals over 560 square miles.
(cid:129) The Rochester mine is a silver and gold surface mining operation located in northwestern Nevada that has
been 100% owned and operated by the Company since 1986. During 1999, the Company acquired the
mineral rights to the Nevada Packard property, which is located one and one-half miles south of the
Rochester mine, and commenced mining there in the first quarter of 2003. The active mining of ore at the
Rochester mine was completed during 2007; however, silver and gold production is expected to continue
through 2014 as a result of continuing heap leaching operations.
(cid:129) In September 2005, the Company acquired, for $36.9 million, all of the silver production and reserves, up to
17.2 million payable ounces, contained at the Broken Hill mine in Australia, which is owned and operated
by Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. (“PBH”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perilya Limited (“Perilya”). The Broken
Hill Mine is located in New South Wales, Australia and is an underground zinc/lead/silver mine.
(cid:129) In May 2005, the Company acquired, for $44.0 million, all of the silver production and reserves, up to
20.0 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor mine in Australia, which is owned and operated by
Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”). The
Endeavor mine is an underground zinc/lead/silver mine located in New South Wales, Australia, which has
been in production since 1983.
(cid:129) Coeur owns 100% of the Cerro Bayo mine in southern Chile, which comprises a high-grade gold and silver
underground mine and processing facilities. The Cerro Bayo deposit was discovered during 2000. Initial
mining operations commenced in late 2001 and processing started in April 2002. The Company carries on an
active exploration program on its 176 square mile property package in southern Chile. During the fourth
quarter of 2008, the Company temporarily suspended operations at Cerro Bayo in order to conserve existing
2
reserves and focus on exploration and development of new discoveries and existing veins. The Company’s
objective is to recommence production at lower costs and higher production rates in 2010.
(cid:129) The Company owns 100% of the Kensington property, located north of Juneau, Alaska, which is a
development-stage underground gold property. An updated feasibility study was completed for the property
during 2004 and construction activities commenced in 2005. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 in Federal Court
challenging a certain permit necessary for construction of a tailings facility. During 2008, the Company
continued all surface facility construction activities not impacted by the legal challenge. The Company will
provide an updated timetable and cost estimates once it receives a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court,
more fully described under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” below.
Coeur also has interests in other properties which are subject to silver or gold exploration activities upon which
no minable ore reserves have yet been delineated.
SILVER AND GOLD PRICES
The Company’s operating results are substantially dependent upon the world market prices of silver and gold.
The Company has no control over silver and gold prices, which can fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is
illustrated by the following table, which sets forth the high and low prices of silver (as reported by Handy and
Harman) and gold (London Final) per ounce during the periods indicated:

MARKETING
The Company markets its metals products and concentrates primarily to bullion trading banks and third-party
smelters. These customers then sell the metals to end users for use in industry applications such as electronic
circuitry, jewelry and silverware production and the manufacture and development of photographic film. Sales of
metals to bullion trading banks amounted to approximately 45%, 47% and 47% of total sales of metals in 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and sales of metal concentrates to third-party smelters amounted to approximately
55%, 53% and 53% of total metal sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Generally, the loss of a single bullion
trading bank customer would not adversely affect the Company in view of the liquidity of the product and
availability of alternative trading banks. In 2008, the Company had sales of concentrates to two third-party smelters,
Met-Mex Penoles and Nyrstar, which each constituted 10% or more of the Company’s total metal sales. A
significant delay or disruption as the result of a disruption in the Company’s contracts could have a materially
adverse effect on our operations if we were unable to locate an alternate smelter to treat our concentrates.
The Company had no future silver or gold production hedged at December 31, 2008. Coeur has historically
sold the gold from its mines both pursuant to forward contracts and at spot prices prevailing at the time of sale. Silver
has been sold at spot prices prevailing at the time of sale.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
General
The Company’s commitment to environmental responsibility has been recognized in 24 awards received since
1987, which included the Dupont/Conoco Environmental Leadership Award, awarded to the Company on
October 1, 1991 by a judging panel that included representatives from environmental organizations and the
federal government, the “Star” award granted on June 23, 1993 by the National Environmental Development
Association, the Environmental Waikato Regional Council award for Golden Cross environmental initiative granted
on May 15, 1995 and in March 2004 the Habitat Restoration Award from the Nevada Division of Wildlife for
developing habitat at the Rochester mine. In 1994, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and in
1997, the Company’s Vice President of Environmental and Governmental Affairs, were awarded the American
3
Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers’ Environmental Conservation Distinguished Service
Award. In 2006, the Company’s Kensington Gold Project was awarded the prestigious 2006 Hardrock Mineral
Community Outreach and Economic Security Award presented by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in
recognition of responsible mineral resource development while demonstrating an understanding of sustainable
development.
The Company’s activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the
environment, prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic
substances and other matters. Although the Company is usually involved in regulatory proceedings for renewal or
reissuance of various permits, such regulations have never caused the Company to close any mine. The costs
associated with compliance with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and
regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and
continued operation of the Company’s properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of
environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, the Company must comply with known
standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although Coeur has been recognized for its
commitment to environmental responsibility and believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, the more stringent implementation thereof through
judicial review or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon the
Company.
For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company expended $8.6 million, $5.2 million and
$5.6 million, respectively, in connection with routine environmental compliance activities at its operating properties
and expects to expend approximately $5.5 million for that purpose in 2009. Future environmental expenditures will
be determined by governmental regulations and the overall scope of the Company’s operating and development
activities.
Federal Environmental Laws
Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores are currently exempt from the extensive set of
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste, although such wastes may be
subject to regulation under state law as a solid or hazardous waste. The EPA has worked on a program to regulate
these mining wastes pursuant to its solid waste management authority under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (“RCRA”). Certain ore processing and other wastes are currently regulated as hazardous wastes by
the EPA under RCRA. If the Company’s mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste or such wastes resulted in
operations being designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen-
sation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) for cleanup, material expenditures would be required for the
construction of additional waste disposal facilities or for other remediation expenditures. Under CERCLA, any
present owner or operator of a Superfund site or an owner or operator at the time of its contamination generally may
be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup
efforts. Such owner or operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural
resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon the
Company’s tailings and waste disposal in Alaska under the Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and state law
counterparts, and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Air
emissions are subject to controls under Nevada’s and Alaska’s air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air
Act.
Proposed Mining Legislation
Legislation has been introduced regularly in the U.S. Congress over the last decade to change the Mining Law
of 1872, as amended, under which the Company holds unpatented mining claims on federal lands. A portion of the
Company’s U.S. mining properties are on unpatented mining claims on federal lands. It is possible that the Mining
Law may be amended or be replaced by more onerous legislation in the future. Previously proposed legislation
contained a production royalty obligation, new environmental standards and conditions, additional reclamation
requirements and extensive new procedural steps which would be likely to result in delays in permitting. Most
recently, in late January 2009, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives called the “Hardrock
4
Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009” (H.R. 699). The proposed legislation contains new proposed royalties on
gross revenues for new and existing mining operations on public lands, among other provisions. The ultimate
content of this or any future proposed legislation, if enacted, is uncertain. If a royalty on unpatented mining claims
were to be imposed under any ultimately enacted law, the Company’s operations could be adversely affected,
although the majority of the Company’s operations are either outside of the United States or on private patented
lands and would be unaffected by potential legislation. In addition, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management have considered revising regulations governing operations under the Mining Law on federal lands
they administer, which, if implemented, may result in additional procedures and environmental conditions and
standards on those lands.
Any reform of the Mining Law or Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service regulations thereunder
based on these initiatives could increase the costs of mining activities on unpatented mining claims, or could
materially impair the ability of the Company to develop or continue operations which derive ore from federal lands,
and as a result could have an adverse affect on the Company and its results of operations. Until such time, if any, as
new reform legislation or regulations are enacted, the ultimate effects and costs of compliance on the Company
cannot be estimated.
Foreign Government Regulations
The mining properties of the Company that are located in Chile and Argentina are subject to various
government laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the air, surface water, ground water and the
environment in general, as well as the health of the work force, labor standards and the socioeconomic impacts of
mining facilities upon the communities. In Chile, a recently established State Council for the Environment
(“COREMA”) has responsibility to define policy, approve plans and programs, control regulatory activities and
enforce compliance in Chile. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations to which it is subject in Chile and Argentina.
The Republic of Bolivia, where the San Bartolomé mine is located, and the country of Mexico, where the
Palmarejo project is located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to
those in effect in the United States and other South American countries. The permitting process requires a thorough
study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact
analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of mining operations.
The Company has received all permits required to operate the San Bartolomé mine and to build and operate the
Palmarejo project.
The Company does not directly hold any interest in mining properties in Australia. However, under the
respective Silver Sale Agreements with CBH and PBH, the Company has purchased the silver reserves and
resources in the ground of these mining companies. These two companies are responsible for the mining operation
and compliance with government regulations and the Company is not responsible for compliance. The Company is,
however, at risk for any production stoppages resulting from non-compliance. The mining properties of CBH and
PBH are subject to a range of state and federal government laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the
air, surface water, ground water, noise, site rehabilitation and the environment in general, as well as the occupational
health and safety of the work force, labor standards and the socio-economic impacts of mining facilities among
local communities. In addition, the various federal and state native title legislation recognize and protect the rights
and interests in Australia of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in land and waters, according to their
traditional laws and customs, and may restrict mining and exploration activity and/or result in additional costs. CBH
and PBH are required to deal with a number of governmental departments in development and exploitation of their
respective mining properties. The Company is not aware of any substantial non-compliance with applicable laws
and regulations to which these companies are subject in Australia.
Maintenance of Claims
United States
At mining properties in the United States, including the Rochester and Kensington mines, operations are
conducted in part upon unpatented mining claims, as well as patented mining claims. Pursuant to applicable federal
5
law, in order to maintain the unpatented claims, it is necessary to pay to the Secretary of the Interior, on or before
August 31 of each year, a claim maintenance fee of $125 per claim. This claim maintenance fee is in lieu of the
assessment work requirement contained in the Mining Law. In addition, in Nevada, holders of unpatented mining
claims are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee of $8.50 per
claim. No maintenance fees are payable for patented claims. Patented claims are similar to land held by an owner
who is entitled to the entire interest in the property with unconditional power of disposition.
Chile
In Chile, operations are conducted upon mineral concessions granted by the national government. For
exploitation concessions (somewhat similar to a U.S. patented claim), to maintain the concession, an annual tax is
payable to the government before March 31 of each year in the approximate amount of $1.14 per hectare. For
exploration concessions, to maintain the right, the annual tax is approximately $0.30 per hectare. An exploration
concession is valid for a five-year period. It may be renewed for new periods unless a third-party claims the right to
explore upon the property, in which event the exploration concession must be converted to an exploitation
concession in order to maintain the rights to the concession.
Argentina
Minerals are owned by the Argentine government, which allows individual provinces to impose a maximum
3% mine-mouth royalty on mineral production. The first step in acquiring mining rights is filing a cateo, which
gives exclusive prospecting rights for the requested area for a period of time, generally up to 3 years. Maximum size
of each cateo is 10,000 hectares; a maximum of 20 cateos can be held by a single entity (individual or company) in
any one province.
The holder of a cateo has exclusive right to establish a Manifestation of Discovery (“MD”) on that cateo, but
MD’s can also be set without a cateo on any land not covered by someone else’s cateo. MDs are filed as either a vein
or disseminated discovery. A square protection zone can be declared around the discovery — up to 840 hectares for
vein MD or up to 7,000 hectares for a disseminated MD. The protection zone grants the discoverer exclusive rights
for an indefinite period, during which the discoverer must provide an annual report presenting a program of
exploration work and investments related to the protection zone. A MD can later be upgraded to a Mina (mining
claim), which give the holder the right to begin commercial extraction of minerals.
Bolivia
The Bolivian national mining company, Corporación Minera de Bolivia (“Comibol”), is the underlying owner
of all of the mining rights relating to the San Bartolomé mine, with the exception of the Thuru property, which is
owned by the Cooperativa Reserva Fiscal, a local miners’ cooperative. Comibol’s ownership derives from the
Supreme Decree 3196 in October 1952, when the government nationalized most of the mines in Potosí. Comibol has
leased the mining rights for the surface sucu or pallaco gravel deposits to several Potosí cooperatives. The
cooperatives in turn have subleased their mining rights to Manquiri through a series of “joint venture” contracts with
Manquiri. In addition to those agreements with the cooperatives, Coeur, through its subsidiary Manquiri, holds
additional mining rights under lease agreements with Comibol. All of Manquiri’s mining and surface rights
collectively constitute the San Bartolomé project.
Australia
At mining properties in Australia operated by CBH and PBH, operations are conducted on designated Mining
Leases issued by the relevant state government mining department. Mining Leases are issued for a specific term and
include a range of environmental and other conditions including the payment of production royalties, annual lease
fees and the use of cash or a bank guarantee as security for reclamation liabilities. The amounts required to be paid
to secure reclamation liabilities are determined on a case by case basis. In addition, both CBH and PBH hold a range
of exploration titles and permits, which are also issued by the respective state government mining departments for
specified terms and require payment of annual fees and completion of designated expenditure programs on the
6
leases to maintain title. In Australia, minerals in the ground are owned by the state until severed from the ground
through mining operations.
Mexico
In order to carry out mining activities in Mexico, the Company is required to obtain a mining concession from
the General Bureau of Mining which belongs to the Ministry of Economy (Secretaría de Economía) of the Federal
Government, or be assigned previously granted concession rights, and both must be recorded with the Public
Registry of Mining. In addition, mining works may have to be authorized by other authorities when performed at
villages, dams, channels, general communications ways, submarine shelf of islands, islets and reefs, marine beds
and subsoil, federal maritime-terrestrial zones, etc. Reports have to be filed with the Bureau in May of each year
evidencing previous calendar year mining works. Generally nominal biannual mining duties are payable in January
and August of each year, lack of said duties payment may cause cancellation of the concessions. Obligations such as
not to withdraw permanent works of fortification, technical reports etc, are to be fulfilled upon expiration or
cancellation of the concession.

DEFINITIONS
The following sets forth definitions of certain important mining terms used in this report.
“Ag” is the abbreviation for silver.
“Au” is the abbreviation for gold.
“Cash Costs” are costs directly related to the physical activities of producing silver and gold, and include
mining, processing, transportation and other plant costs, third-party refining and smelting costs, marketing expense,
on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and in-mine drilling expenditures that are related to production
and other direct costs. Sales of by-product metals, including gold, are deducted from the above in computing cash
costs per ounce. Cash costs exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization, corporate general and administrative
expense, exploration, interest, and pre-feasibility costs and accruals for mine reclamation. Cash costs are calculated
and presented using the “Gold Institute Production Cost Standard” applied consistently for all periods presented.
“Cash Costs per Ounce” are calculated by dividing the cash costs computed for each of the Company’s
mining properties for a specific period by the amount of gold ounces or silver ounces produced by that property
during that same period. Management uses cash costs per ounce produced as a key indicator of the profitability of
each of its mining properties. Gold and silver are sold and priced in the world financial markets on a U.S. dollar per
ounce basis. By calculating the cash costs from each of the Company’s mines on the same unit basis, management
can easily determine the gross margin that each ounce of gold and silver produced is generating. While this
represents a key indicator of the performance of the Company’s mining properties you are cautioned not to place
8
undue reliance on this single measurement. To fully evaluate a mine’s performance, management also monitors
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) based profit/(loss), depreciation and amortization
expenses and capital expenditures for each mine as presented in Note R — Segment Information in the Notes to the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Total cash costs per ounce is a non-GAAP measurement and
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on it and are urged to read all GAAP accounting disclosures
presented in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
“Concentrate” is a product containing the valuable metal and from which most of the waste material in the ore
has been eliminated.
“Cut-off Grade” is the lowest grade of mineral resource considered economic; used in the calculation of
reserves in a given deposit.
“Cyanidation” is a method of extracting gold or silver by dissolving it in a weak solution of sodium or
potassium cyanide.
“Dilution” is an estimate of the amount of waste or low-grade mineralized rock which will be mined with the
ore as part of normal mining practices in extracting an ore body.
“Doré” is unrefined gold and silver bullion bars which contain gold, silver and minor amounts of impurities
which will be further refined to almost pure metal.
“Gold” is a metallic element with minimum fineness of 999 parts per 1000 parts pure gold.
“Heap Leaching Process” is a process of extracting gold and silver by placing broken ore on an impermeable
pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver, which are then
recovered in metallurgical processes.
“Mineralized Material” is gold and silver bearing material that has been physically delineated by one or more
of a number of methods, including drilling, underground work, surface trenching and other types of sampling. This
material has been found to contain a sufficient amount of mineralization of an average grade of metal or metals to
have economic potential that warrants further exploration evaluation. While this material is not currently or may
never be classified as ore reserves, it is reported as mineralized material only if the potential exists for reclas-
sification into the reserves category. This material cannot be classified in the reserves category until final technical,
economic and legal factors have been determined. Under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s
standards, a mineral deposit does not qualify as a reserve unless it can be economically and legally extracted at the
time of reserve determination and it constitutes a proven or probable reserve (as defined below). In accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, mineralized material reported in the Company’s Form 10-K no
longer includes inferred mineral resources.
“Non-cash Costs” are costs that are typically accounted for ratably over the life of an operation and include
depreciation, depletion and amortization of capital assets, accruals for the costs of final reclamation and long-term
monitoring and care that are usually incurred at the end of mine life, and the amortization of the cost of property
acquisitions.
“Operating Cash Costs Per Ounce” are cash costs per ounce minus production taxes and royalties.
“Ore Reserve” is the part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced
at the time of the reserve determination.
“Probable Reserve” is a part of a mineralized deposit which can be extracted or produced economically and
legally at the time of the reserve determination. The quantity and grade and/or quality of a probable reserve is
computed from information similar to that used for a proven reserve, but the sites for inspection, sampling and
measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower
than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Mining dilution,
where appropriate, has been factored into the estimation of probable reserves.
“Proven Reserve” is a portion of a mineral deposit which can be extracted or produced economically and
legally at the time of the reserve determination. The quantity of a proven reserve is computed from dimensions
9
revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of
detailed sampling and the sites for inspections, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic
character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of a proven reserve is well-established.
Mining dilution, where appropriate, has been factored into the estimation of proven reserves.
“Run-of-mine Ore” is mined ore which has not been subjected to any pretreatment, such as washing, sorting
or crushing prior to processing.
“Silver” is a metallic element with minimum fineness of 995 parts per 1000 parts pure silver.
“Stripping Ratio” is the ratio of the number of tons of waste material to the number of tons of ore extracted at
an open-pit mine.
“Ton” means a short ton which is equivalent to 2,000 pounds, unless otherwise specified.
“Total costs” are the sum of cash costs and non-cash costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following information sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could
materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results. References to “we,”
“our” and “us” in these risk factors refer to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently
know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
The worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the global capital and credit markets have
affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, as well as the industries of our customers. We
do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.
Recent declines in consumer and business confidence and spending, together with severe reductions in the
availability and cost of credit, and volatility in the capital and credit markets, have adversely affected the business
and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business. Our business is exposed to
risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners. These conditions
have resulted and may continue to result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers,
customers or business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of
production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the
inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase from us, and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors. Any
of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition. Similarly, any of these
events may affect our business partners’ financial condition, such as those companies that operate mines where we
own silver production and reserves, and the negative impact on our business partners could adversely affect our cash
flow, profitability and financial condition.
Moreover, the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund or
support the continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide. Many lenders and institutional investors
have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Continued disruption of the credit markets
has affected and could continue to adversely affect our customers’ access to credit, which supports the continuation
and expansion of their businesses worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, payment
delays or defaults by our customers.
The market prices of silver and gold are volatile. If we experience low silver and gold prices it may result
in decreased revenues, decreased net income or losses and decreased cash flows, and may negatively
affect our business.
Silver and gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are affected by many factors beyond our control,
including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions
regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and
economic conditions and other factors. Because we currently derive approximately 69% of our revenues from
continuing operations from sales of silver, our earnings and cash flows are primarily related to the price of this
metal. Sustained weakness in the price of silver could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash
flows.
The market prices of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold (London Final) on February 26, 2009 were $13.12 and
$937 per ounce, respectively. The prices of silver and gold may decline in the future. Factors that are generally
understood to contribute to a decline in the price of silver include sales by private and government holders, and a
general global economic slowdown.
Coeur may also suffer from declines in mineral prices. Since 1999, Coeur has not engaged in any silver
hedging activities and is currently not engaged in any gold hedging activities. Accordingly, Coeur has no protection
from declines in mineral prices or currency fluctuations.
11
If the prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained period and our net losses resume, we may be forced
to suspend mining at one or more of our properties until the prices increase, and to record additional asset
impairment write-downs. Any lost revenues, continued or increased net losses or additional asset impairment write-
downs would adversely affect our results of operations.
We have significant demands on our liquidity.
We have incurred significant capital expenditures in recent years to acquire and develop additional producing
properties, during which time our revenues have decreased and operating costs have increased. In addition, the
Company plans to invest approximately $130 million in capital activities in 2009 to complete construction of
Palmarejo and for sustaining capital investments at our existing operations. This excludes capital expenditures at
Kensington, which will be updated after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Our ability to fund these operations
depends to a significant extent on both our operating performance, which in turn depends on our production of silver
and gold and the price of silver and gold, as well as on our ability to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity
securities. The current global financial crisis has increased our cost of funds and may impede our ability to raise any
funds that could be required in the future.
We may have to record write-downs of long-lived assets, which could negatively impact our results of
operations.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets (“SFAS 144”), established accounting standards for impairment of the value of long-lived assets such
as mining properties. SFAS 144 requires a company to review the recoverability of the cost of its assets by
estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the
carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows, and recognizing impairment write-downs could negatively
impact our financial condition and results of operations.
If silver or gold prices decline or we fail to control production costs or realize the minable ore reserves at our
mining properties, we may be required to recognize asset write-downs. We also may record other types of additional
mining property charges in the future to the extent a property is sold by us for a price less than the carrying value of
the property, or if reclamation liabilities have to be increased in connection with the closure and reclamation of a
property. Additional write-downs of mining properties could negatively impact our financial condition and results
of operations.
The Kensington property has been the subject of litigation involving a permit required to complete
construction of a required tailings facility. Reference is made to the discussion set forth in “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings — Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge” for a detailed description of the
Kensington project permit legal challenge, including the possibility of an impairment writedown in the event that
the expectation of the long-term price for gold decreases below approximately $750 per ounce.
No assurance can be given as to whether or when regulatory permits and approvals granted to the Company
may be further challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing agencies, or as to whether the Company
will ultimately place the Kensington project into commercial production.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company temporarily suspended operations at Cerro Bayo in order to
conserve existing reserves and focus on exploration and development of new discoveries and existing veins. The
Company’s objective is to recommence production at lower costs and higher production rates in 2010.
The Company determined that the reduced production levels and the increase in operating cost levels was a
triggering event in accordance with SFAS 144, requiring the Company to assess whether the long-lived assets at the
mine were impaired. Step one of the impairment assessment compares the cumulative undiscounted prospective
cash flows of the mine to the sum of the carrying values of the long-lived assets at Cerro Bayo. Should the carrying
values of the long-lived assets at the mine exceed the sum of those undiscounted future cash flows, a comparison of
12
the fair value of the asset to its book value is then required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the
assets, an impairment loss would be recorded.
In projecting its future cash flows, the Company considers certain assumptions for silver prices (including
current and historical prices, analyst consensus forward prices, as well as the trailing three-year average silver
market prices) and production levels, expected and historical operating costs and required capital expenditures
based on available life of mine plans. Assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to significant risk and
uncertainty associated with any differences between specific assumptions and market conditions, such as silver and
gold prices, lower than expected recoverable ounces and/or the Company’s operating performance. Based on the
Company’s assessment, there was not a required impairment at December 31, 2008. Should silver prices fall below
the consensus forward or historical prices, should the cash costs per ounce exceed those projected and historically
achieved, or should an updated reserve report result in a reduction of the number of ounces recoverable at Cerro
Bayo, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss and that loss could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operations and financial position.
Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet our debt payment
obligations.
As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of approximately $462 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our
ability to make scheduled debt payments on our outstanding indebtedness will depend on our future operating
performance and cash flow. Our operating performance and cash flow, in part, are subject to economic factors
beyond our control, including the market prices of silver and gold. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow
to meet our obligations and commitments. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our
debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. We
cannot predict whether we will be able to refinance our debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms.
We might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to conduct our business, make payments when
due or refinance our debt.
We might need to raise additional funds in order to implement our business plan, refinance our debt or acquire
complementary businesses or products. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders of our common stock
could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to
those of the holders of our common stock.
The Palmarejo project is in the beginning stages of commercial production and involves significant risks
associated with the commencement of commercial production.
There can be no assurance that significant losses will not occur at the Palmarejo project in the near future or
that the Palmarejo project will be profitable in the future. Coeur’s operating expenses and capital expenditures may
increase in subsequent years as needed consultants, personnel and equipment associated with advancing explo-
ration, development and commercial production of the Palmarejo project and any other properties Coeur may
acquire are added. The amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing exploration and
development and the results of consultants’ analyses and recommendations, which are beyond Coeur’s control.
Our revenues and income (or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines are depen-
dent in part upon the performance of the operators of the mine.
In May and September 2005, we acquired silver production and reserves at the Endeavor and Broken Hill
mines in Australia, respectively. These mines are owned and operated by other mining companies. The Company’s
revenues and income (or loss) from its interest in the silver production at these mines are dependent in part upon the
performance of those operators and such mines as well as upon zinc and lead prices that are sufficient to maintain
sustainable operations. The decline in primary metal prices may result in cessation of mining operations and an
impairment would likely occur.
13
On August 21, 2008, the operator of the Broken Hill mine advised the market that, following an extensive
review of its Broken Hill operations, it had implemented a plan to resize the operation in light of current low metal
prices. Under the revised operating plan, ore production will decrease from 1.8 to 0.95 million tonnes per year. This
reduction in ore production could have an adverse effect on Coeur’s revenues and income at this mine.
The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves
may not be realized in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively affected by inaccurate
estimates.
The ore reserve figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel. Reserve
estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about
production costs and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process and
the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great
uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may
render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce
reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties, or write down assets as
impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects different from
those we predicted, we may adjust our reserve estimates and alter our mining plans. Either of these alternatives may
adversely affect our actual production and operating results.
We based our ore reserve determinations as of December 31, 2008 on a long-term silver price average of
$13.25 per ounce, with the exception of the Endeavor mine which uses $12.00 per ounce and the Broken Hill mine
which uses $2.22 per ounce of silver, and a long-term gold price average of $750 per ounce for all properties. On
February 26, 2009 silver and gold prices were $13.12 per ounce and $937 per ounce, respectively.
The estimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within the Rochester heap leach pad inven-
tory is inherently inaccurate and subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques. Actual recover-
ies can be expected to vary from estimations.
The Rochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract silver and gold from ore. The heap leach process
is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide
solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical
processes.
We use several integrated steps in the process of extracting silver and gold to estimate the metal content of ore
placed on the leach pads. Although we refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the process, the final
amounts are not determined until a third-party smelter converts the doré and determines final ounces of silver and
gold available for sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used
throughout the production process. Based on this review, we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate. As
a result, actual recoveries can vary from estimates, and the amount of the variation could be significant and could
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our estimates of current and non-current inventories may not be realized in actual production and oper-
ating results, which may negatively affect our business.
We use estimates, based on prior production results and experiences, to determine whether heap leach
inventory will be recovered more than one year in the future, and is non-current inventory, or will be recovered
within one year, and is current inventory. The estimates involve assumptions that may not prove to be consistent
with our actual production and operating results. We cannot determine the amount ultimately recoverable until
leaching is completed. If our estimates prove inaccurate, our operating results may be less than anticipated.
14
Silver mining involves significant production and operational risks. Coeur may suffer from the failure to
efficiently operate its mining projects.
Silver mining involves significant degrees of risk, including those related to mineral exploration success,
unexpected geological or mining conditions, the development of new deposits, climatic conditions, equipment
and/or service failures, compliance with current or new governmental requirements, current availability of or delays
in installing and commissioning plant and equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks.
Problems may also arise due to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such
as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which results in the failure to achieve
expected target dates for exploration or production activities and/or result in a requirement for greater expenditure.
The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, the granting of which may
be at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. There may be delays in obtaining such licenses and quotas
leading to the financial result of Coeur being adversely affected, and it is possible that from time to time export
licenses may be refused. Many of these risks are outside of the ability of Coeur’s management to control and may
result in a materially adverse effect on Coeur’s operations, financial position and cash flows.
Mineral exploration and development inherently involves significant and irreducible financial risks.
Coeur may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mines.
The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks, which even a
combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may result
from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such deposits may be insufficient
in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is
possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored
are ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies rely on consultants and others for exploration,
development, construction and operating expertise.
Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and, in the case of new
properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is
based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and
other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs
of such development projects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of
favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.
Once a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors,
including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government
regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing and exporting of minerals and envi-
ronmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads,
bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or
other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The
exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an
adequate return on invested capital.
Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with our exploration, development and
mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect
our business.
Our ability to sustain or increase our present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and
development of new ore bodies and/or expansion of existing mining operations. Mineral exploration, particularly
for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a
number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change.
Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and, in the case of new
properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is
based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and
other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs
15
of such development projects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of
favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.
Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs
and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash
operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data obtained from a limited number
of drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then
derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the
orebody, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated
climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all
development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our business
results of operations may be negatively affected.
The Company’s marketing of metals concentrates could be adversely affected if there were to be a signifi-
cant delay or disruption of purchases by its third-party smelter customers. In particular, a significant
delay or disruption in our sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases
by our smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
The Company currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third-party smelters in Mexico, Japan and
Australia. The loss of any one smelter customer could have a material adverse effect on us in the event of the
possible unavailability of alternative smelters. No assurance can be given that alternative smelters would be timely
available if the need for them were to arise, or that delays or disruptions in sales could not be experienced that would
result in a materially adverse effect on our operations and our financial results.
Our silver and gold production may decline, reducing our revenues and negatively impacting our
business.
Our future silver and gold production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves and possible closure
of mines. It is our business strategy to conduct silver and gold exploratory activities at our existing mining and
exploratory properties as well as at new exploratory projects, and to acquire silver and gold mining properties and
businesses or reserves that possess minable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in the near future.
We can provide no assurance that our silver and gold production in the future will not decline. Accordingly, our
revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, negatively affecting our results of operations.
There are significant hazards associated with our mining activities, some of which may not be fully cov-
ered by insurance. To the extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our business may be
negatively affected.
The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the
encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic
interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to,
or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,
reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although
we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which
event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operation. Insurance fully covering
many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste
products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to us or to other companies in the
industry. The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our mining activities as described above
could negatively affect our results of operations.
We are subject to significant governmental regulations, and their related costs and delays may negatively
affect our business.
Coeur’s mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure
16
reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations including mine safety,
toxic substances and other matters related to Coeur’s business. Although these laws and regulations have never
required Coeur to close any mine, the costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are
substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations
by governmental authorities could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of
Coeur’s operations and delays in the development of its properties. Moreover, future developments in U.S. federal
laws and regulations are currently especially difficult to predict due to the new President and Congress. These
changes in the federal government may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to new laws, regulations and
regulatory investigations.
In addition, government approvals, approval of aboriginal people and permits are currently and may in the
future be required in connection with the Palmarejo project. To the extent such approvals are required and not
obtained, Coeur may be curtailed or prohibited from planned mining operations or continuing its planned
exploration or development of mineral properties at the Palmarejo project.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement
actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be
curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment,
or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties
may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil
or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations.
Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could
require significant expenditures.
Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards
and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid
and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and
enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of
proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and
employees.
To the extent Coeur is subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities or the costs that it
may incur to remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise available to it and could have a material
adverse effect on the combined company. If Coeur is unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, it might be
required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required
remedy. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect.
Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and
injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of Coeur’s past and current operations,
which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal
sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are
inherent in Coeur’s operations. Although Coeur believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, Coeur cannot assure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have a
negative effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
Some of Coeur’s mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of federal
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conser-
vation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardous under RCRA, Coeur would be
required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to
construct hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage
to the environment at a mining facility, such facility may be designated as a “Superfund” site under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any
owner or operator of a Superfund site since the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to
undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator
may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial.
17
Additional regulations or requirements are also imposed upon Coeur’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska
under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which
implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the
Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws could
entail significant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Coeur’s operations.
In the context of environmental permits, including the approval of reclamation plans, Coeur must comply with
standards and regulations which entail significant costs and can entail significant delays. Such costs and delays
could have a dramatic impact on Coeur’s operations. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental
regulation, if any, will not adversely affect Coeur’s operations. Coeur intends to fully comply with all applicable
environmental regulations.
We are required to obtain government permits to expand operations or begin new operations. The acquisi-
tion of such permits can be materially impacted by third-party litigation seeking to prevent the issuance
of such permits. The costs and delays associated with such approvals could affect our operations, reduce
our revenues and negatively affect our business as a whole.
Mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the
commencement of new operations such as the Kensington development project and the Palmarejo project.
Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous
jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. The duration and success of permitting
efforts are contingent on many factors that are out of our control. The governmental approval process may increase
costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted, and could cause us to not proceed
with the development of a mine. Accordingly, this approval process could harm our results of operations.
Reference is made to the discussion of the current litigation regarding the validity of the mine tailings permit at
the Kensington property in Alaska that is set forth under the above risk factor entitled “We may have to record
write-downs of long-lived assets, which could negatively impact our results of operations.”
Our business depends on good relations with our employees.
The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could
adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2008, unions represented approximately 27.5% of our worldwide
workforce. On that date, the Company had 13 employees at its Cerro Bayo mine and 137 employees at its Martha
mine who were working under a collective bargaining agreement. The agreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine
expires on December 21, 2010, and a collective bargaining agreement covering the Martha mine expires on June 1,
2010. Additionally, the Company had 134 employees at its San Bartolomé mine working under a labor agreement
which became effective October 11, 2007 and does not have a fixed term.
We are an international company and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant
operations or interests. Foreign instability or variances in foreign currencies may cause unforeseen losses,
which may affect our business.
Any foreign operation or investment is subject to political and economic risks and uncertainties. These risks
and uncertainties may include exchange controls; extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates; high rates of
inflation; labor unrest; civil unrest; military repression; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or
nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; changes in taxation policies;
restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and laws or policies in the U.S. affecting foreign trade investment
and taxation. Further, foreign operations or investment is subject to changes in government regulations with respect
to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income taxes,
expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land
claims of local people, water use and mine safety.
Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico and Australia are the most significant foreign countries in which Coeur now
directly or indirectly owns or operates mining properties or developmental projects. Coeur also conducts explor-
atory projects in these countries. Argentina and Bolivia, while currently economically and politically stable, have
18
experienced political instability, provincial government pressures on mining operations, currency value fluctuations
and changes in banking regulations in recent years. It is uncertain at this time how new mining or investment
policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in these countries.
Coeur may enter into agreements which require Coeur to purchase currencies of foreign countries in which
Coeur does business in order to ensure fixed exchange rates. In the event that actual exchange rates vary from those
set forth in any such hedge contracts, Coeur will experience U.S. dollar-denominated currency gains or losses.
Continued worldwide economic volatility, future political instabilities or changes in the laws of foreign countries in
which Coeur has significant operations or interests and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
could negatively impact its foreign operations and its business as a whole. Further, property ownership in a foreign
country is generally subject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization with inadequate compensation.
Coeur is exposed to risks with respect to the legal systems in the countries in which it has significant
operations or interests and resolutions of any disputes may adversely affect its business.
Some of the jurisdictions in which Coeur currently and may in the future operate have less developed legal
systems than would be found in more established economies like the United States. This may result in risks such as
potential difficulties in obtaining effective legal redress in the courts of such jurisdictions, whether in respect of a
breach of law or regulation, or in an ownership dispute; a higher degree of discretion on the part of governmental
authorities; the lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations;
inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; or
relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters.
In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the
judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be uncertain, creating particular
concerns with respect to licenses and agreements for business. These may be susceptible to revision or cancellation
and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed. There can be no assurance that joint ventures, licenses, license
applications or other legal arrangements will not be adversely affected by the actions of government authorities or
others, and the effectiveness of and enforcement of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured.
Any of our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which may adversely affect our business.
An important element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines,
properties and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice to engage independent mining consultants to
assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests therein we may acquire may not be
developed profitably or, if profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with
any future acquisitions, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest
expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. We intend to seek shareholder approval
for any such acquisitions to the extent required by applicable law, regulations or stock exchange rules. We cannot
predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable
acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may
impact the price of our common stock and negatively affect our results of operations.
Coeur is continuously considering possible acquisitions of additional mining properties or interests
therein that are located in other countries, and could be exposed to significant risks associated with any
such acquisitions.
In the ordinary course of Coeur’s business, Coeur is continuously considering the possible acquisition of
additional significant mining properties or interests therein that may be located in countries other than those in
which Coeur now has operations or interests. Consequently, in addition to the risks inherent in the valuation and
acquisition of such mining properties, as well as the subsequent development, operation or ownership thereof,
Coeur could be subject to additional risks in such countries as a result of governmental policies, economic
instability, currency value fluctuations and other risks associated with the development, operation or ownership of
mining properties or interests therein. Such risks could adversely affect Coeur’s results of operations.
19
Our ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, our prospects are uncer-
tain for the future growth of our business.
Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we are continually seeking to
replace and expand our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative.
Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition
of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial
resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the
acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable. As a result, our revenues
from the sale of silver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth.
Third parties may dispute our unpatented mining claims, which could result in the discovery of defective
titles and losses affecting our business.
The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of Coeur’s property holdings
in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although Coeur has attempted to acquire satisfactory
title to undeveloped properties, Coeur, in accordance with mining industry practice, does not generally obtain title
opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped
properties, may be defective. Defective title to any of Coeur’s mining claims could result in litigation, insurance
claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole.
The acquisition of title to concessions and similar property interests is a detailed and time consuming process.
Title to, and the area of, concessions and similar property interests may be disputed.
No assurances can be given that title defects to the Palmarejo project do not exist. The Palmarejo project may
be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims and title may be affected by undetected
defects. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Palmarejo project that, if
successful, could impair development and/or operations. A defect could result in Coeur losing all or a portion of its
right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. Also, while Coeur believes that
the registration defects relating to certain non-material properties as described herein will be remedied, there can be
no assurance as to timing or successful completion.
The market price of our common stock has been volatile and may decline.
The market price of our common stock has been volatile and may decline in the future. The market price of our
common stock historically has fluctuated widely and been affected by our operating results and by many factors
beyond our control. These factors include: market prices of silver and gold; general stock market conditions;
interest rates; expectations regarding inflation; currency values; and global and regional political and economic
conditions and other factors.
Conversion of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of
existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Senior Secured Floating Rate
Convertible Notes.
To the extent we issue shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Senior Secured Floating Rate
Convertible Notes, the conversion of some or all of such notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing
stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes. Any sales in the public market of shares
of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of shares of our
common stock. In addition, the existence of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes may encourage
short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could depress the price of shares of our
common stock.
20
We have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and
outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.
The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in
dilution of existing shareholders’ equity interests in the Company. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder
approval, 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series to establish the number of shares to be included
in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and
other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series,
including but not limited to the fixing or alteration of the dividend rights, dividend rate or rates, conversion rights,
voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, the redemption price or prices and the liquidation preferences of any
wholly unissued series of shares of preferred stock, or any or all of them. Any series of preferred stock could contain
dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or
other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has no present intention of
issuing any preferred stock, but reserves the right to do so in the future and has reserved for issuance a series of
preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of
our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.
We are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our charter, in our bylaws and in our shareholder rights
plan that could delay or prevent an acquisition of Coeur even if such an acquisition would be beneficial
to our shareholders.
Certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could provide the ability to delay or prevent a
third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. Some of these provisions
(i) authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior
shareholder approval, commonly referred to as “blank check” preferred stock, with rights senior to those of
common stock; (ii) authorize the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the size of the board without shareholder
approval; (iii) authorize a majority of the directors then in office to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors; and
(iv) require that a “fair price” be paid in some business transactions. We have also implemented a shareholder rights
plan which could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.

SILVER AND GOLD MINING PROPERTIES
South America
Bolivia — San Bartolomé Mine
The San Bartolomé open pit silver mine, operated by Empressa Minera Manquiri SA (“Manquiri”), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, is located on the flanks of the Cerro Rico Mountain bordering the town of Potosí,
Bolivia. Access to the property and the Company’s pre processing facilities is by paved and all-weather gravel roads
leading south-southwest from Potosí.
The mineral rights for the San Bartolomé mine are held through joint venture and long-term lease agreements
with several independent mining cooperatives and the Bolivian State Mining Company (“COMIBOL”). Manquiri
controls 67 square kilometers under lease from COMIBOL and 16,600 acres under lease from the cooperatives at
San Bartolomé and approximately 17.8 square miles of concessions at the Khori Huasi property, a gold exploration
target south of Potosí. The San Bartolomé lease agreements, executed between 1996 and 2003 and with 25 year
terms, are generally subject to a 4% production royalty payable partially to the cooperatives and partially to
COMIBOL. During 2003, the Company acquired additional mining rights known as the Plahipo project which
include the mining rights to oxide dumps adjacent to the original property package. The oxide dumps included in the
Plahipo project are subject to a sliding scale royalty payable to COMIBOL that is a function of silver price. The
Company incurred royalty payments for these mining rights totaling $6.6 million. commencing with operating
activities in June 2008.
Coeur acquired 100% of the equity in Manquiri from Asarco Incorporated (“ASARCO”) on September 9,
1999. Manquiri’s principal asset is the mining rights to the San Bartolomé mine. Silver was first discovered in the
area around 1545. Mining of silver and lesser amounts of tin and base metals has been conducted nearly
continuously since that time from multiple underground mines driven into Cerro Rico. The prior owner did not
conduct any mining or processing of the surface ores at San Bartolomé.
We completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2000, which concluded that an open pit mine was potentially
capable of producing approximately six million ounces of silver annually. In 2003, SRK, an independent consulting
firm, was retained to review the reserve/resource estimate to include additional sampling data to incorporate
additional resources acquired with the Plahipo project at Cerro Rico. During 2003, we retained Fluor Daniel Wright
to prepare an updated feasibility study which was completed at the end of the third quarter of 2004. The study
provides for the use of a cyanide milling flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit which will result in
the production of a doré that may be treated by a number of refiners under a tolling agreement which results in the
return of refined silver to the Company that is readily marketed by metal banks and brokers to the ultimate customer.
During 2004, the Company obtained all operating permits and commercial construction activities commenced.
The property and equipment were placed into service in June 2008 and are maintained in good working
condition through a regular preventative maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power is
supplied to the property by the local power utility. The San Bartolomé mine commenced production on June 27,
2008. Silver production for 2008 was 2.9 million ounces. Total cash costs per ounce for 2008 were $10.53 per
ounce. Operational results continue to improve and the Company now expects production for 2009 to be
approximately 9.0 million ounces of silver.
In November 2007, Bolivia’s Congress approved a reform to the mining tax code. The Bolivia tax rate on most
mining companies has increased from 25% to 37.5%. However, mining companies similar to San Bartolomé that
produce a doré product will receive a 5% credit based upon their specific operation. Thus, the tax rate for
San Bartolomé will be 32.5%.
The Company obtained a political risk insurance policy from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation
(“OPIC”) and another private insurer. The combined policies are in the amount of $155 million and cover Coeur up
to the lesser of $131 million or 85% of any loss arising from expropriation, political violence or currency
inconvertibility. The policy is expected to cost approximately $3.4 million per year, which was capitalized during
the development and construction phases and is now included as a cost of inventory produced (estimated at
approximately $0.21 per ounce of silver produced) over the term of the policies which expire in 2019 and 2024.
22
The Company’s total capital cost (excluding political risk insurance premiums and capitalized interest) to
place the mine into production was $237.9 million.
The silver mineralization at San Bartolomé is hosted in gravel (pallaco) and reworked gravel (sucu and
troceras) deposits and oxide stockpiles and dumps from past mining that occur on the flanks of Cerro Rico. Cerro
Rico is a prominent mountain in the region that reaches an elevation of over 15,400 feet (over 4,700 meters). It is
composed of Tertiary-aged volcanic and intrusive rocks that were emplaced into and over older sedimentary, and
volcanic, basement rocks. Silver, along with tin and base metals, is located in multiple veins and vein swarms that
occur in a northeast trending belt which transects Cerro Rico. The upper parts of the Cerro Rico mineralized system
were subsequently eroded and re-deposited into the flanking gravel deposits. Silver is hosted in all portions of the
pallacos and sucus with the best grades segregated to the coarser-grained silicified fragments. These deposits lend
themselves to simple, free digging surface mining techniques and can be extracted without drilling and blasting. Of
the several pallaco deposits which are controlled by Coeur and surround Cerro Rico, three are of primary
importance and are known as Huacajchi, Diablo and Santa Rita.
In 2009, exploration planned at San Bartolomé will consist of collecting additional data from new pits (pozos)
to further define and/or expand the ore reserves.

(1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. The metal price used for current ore reserves was
$13.25 per ounce of silver.
(2) Ore reserves are open pit-minable and include variable mining recovery factors from 96.1 to 100%.
(3) Metallurgical recoveries are variable per ore type but average 61.1% for silver and should be applied to the total
contained silver ounces.
(4) Ore reserves were prepared by B. O’Leary (Mining Engineer), J. L. Sims (Geologist), and A. Tattersall (Mining

(5) Proven and probable ore reserves are defined by surface drill holes and pits (pozos) with an average spacing of no
more than 70 meters. Proven reserves are those reserves in stockpile at the end of 2008. The grade of ore reserve
block is determined by the grade of proximal drill hole and/or pit composites and three-dimensional models of
geologic controls. A minimum of 8 and maximum of 20 composite were used to classify proven and probable ore
reserves and variable geostatistical estimation variances. Mineralized material is similarly classified.
(6) Cash costs per ounce of silver represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and
evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Pro-
duction Costs.”

Argentina — Martha Mine
The Martha mine is an underground silver and gold mine owned and operated by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which is located in the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina.
Access to the mine is provided by all-weather gravel roads 30 miles northeast of the town of Gubernador Gregores.
The mineral rights for the Martha property are fully-owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L., totaling 195 square
miles (50,623 hectares) of exploration concessions (claims), 86.4 square miles (22,377 hectares) of discovery
concessions, and 0.54 square miles (142 hectares) of exploitation concessions. Martha is centered on the
exploitation concessions, which fully cover the area of the mine infrastructure and the ore reserves reported
herein. Concessions do not have an expiration date; they are subject only to required annual fees. Surface rights
covering the Martha deposit are controlled by the 137.8 square mile (35,705-hectare) Cerro 1o de Abril Estancia
which is owned by Coeur Argentina S.R.L. Included on the estancia is a 60-person man camp, mine and exploration
offices, and assay lab.
The Company acquired the property in 2002 through the purchase of a subsidiary of Yamana Resources Inc. for
$2.5 million. The prior owner conducted minor underground mining on the near-surface portion of the Martha vein
from late 2000 to mid 2001. The Company is obligated to pay a 2% net smelter royalty on silver and gold production
to Royal Gold Corporation granted by Yamana Resources. The Company incurred royalty payments totaling
$1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
24
Prior to 2008 we transported the Martha mine ore by truck approximately 600 miles by road for processing at
the Company’s Cerro Bayo mill located approximately 270 miles away. In 2007, the Company commenced the
construction of a 240 ton per day flotation mill which was completed in December 2007 and produces a flotation
concentrate. During December 2007, the newly-constructed facility commenced operating. In 2008, we began
shipping the concentrate to a third-party smelter located in Mexico. The property and equipment are maintained in
good working condition through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required.
Power is provided by Company-owned diesel generators.
Production at the Martha mine in 2008 was approximately 2.7 million ounces of silver and 3,313 ounces of
gold compared to 2.7 million ounces of silver and 4,127 ounces of gold in 2007. Cash cost per ounce of silver
produced was $7.57 in 2008 compared to $6.27 in 2007. The increase in total cash costs per ounce was primarily due
to an increase in labor and operating supplies and mill start-up related costs in 2008.
Total capital expenditures at the Martha mine in 2008 were $4.5 million and the Company plans approximately
$1.6 million of additional capital expenditures there in 2009.
At Martha, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets within generally
sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Chon Aike Formation. The veins and veinlets occur as sub-parallel clusters
largely trending west-northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. The main ore minerals of silver and gold are
silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite, electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and silver alloy) and native silver.
During 2008, we spent $2.9 million on exploration and $0.4 million on reserve development at the Martha
mine, and $2.6 million at our other properties in the Santa Cruz province, to discover new silver- and gold-bearing
veins and define new reserves. In 2008, exploration tested extensions at depth and on strike on the Martha, R4,
Catalina, Francisca, Belen, Isabel and Betty ore-bearing structures. A total of 37,221 feet (11,345 meters) of drilling
was completed in 2008. During 2009, we expect to spend $2.9 million on exploration for the discovery of new
mineralization and reserve development, across all our large land holdings in the province of Santa Cruz.

(1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. Metal prices used for current ore reserves were
$13.25 per ounce of silver and $750 per ounce of gold
(2) Ore reserves are underground minable and include a dilution of 0.4 meters, at zero grade, added to vein widths.
Mining recoveries are 85% on stope ore and 100% on development ore.
(3) Metallurgical recovery factors of 94% for silver and 93% for gold should be applied to the contained silver and
gold ounces.
(4) Ore reserves were prepared by B. O’Leary (Mining Engineer), J. L. Sims (Geologist) and D. Duffy (Mining
Engineer) of the Company’s technical staff. The independent firm of Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle was used to
assist in preparation of the vein models.
(5) Proven and probable reserves are defined by manual boundaries based on grade thickness contouring to produce
domains imposed on the block models given a certain density of composites. For proven reserves: An area
demonstrating grade continuity defined by two or more bounding horizontal levels of drill holes or channel
samples spaced vertically no more than about 12.5 meters containing horizontally spaced samples less than
5 meters apart — the key feature being confirmation on two levels. For probable reserves: An area demonstrating
grade continuity with channel sample or drill hole spacing less than about 25 meters. Mineralized material is
similarly classified with channel sample or drill hole spacing more than 25 meters and less than 50 meters.
(6) Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to

Chile — Cerro Bayo Mine
The Cerro Bayo District is located south of Coyhaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and due
west of the town of Chile Chico. The underground silver and gold mine and ore processing facilities lie on the east
side of the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and are serviced by an all-weather
gravel road from Chile Chico.
26
The mineral rights for the Cerro Bayo property are fully-controlled by Compañia Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd.
(“CMCB”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, encompassing a 89 square mile contiguous block (23,106
hectares) of exploitation concessions and 18.1 square miles (4,700 hectares) of exploration concessions. The
Company also controls several other concessions southeast of the Cerro Bayo District. The Company’s ore reserves
and rights to operate are fully-contained within the exploitation concessions and separate surface use agreements
from private surface land owners. Exploitation concessions are maintained by annual payments (taxes).
The Company acquired the property in 1990 from Freeport Chilean Exploration Company. No mining or
processing was conducted by the prior owner. Initial mining and processing commenced, by the Company in 1995,
at the Laguna Verde area, in the western portion of the holdings. Mining and processing temporarily ceased in late
2000 then recommenced in 2002 at the Cerro Bayo area on the east. The entire holdings and infrastructure are now
referred to as the Cerro Bayo district. Construction of two ramps to intersect the high-grade Lucero Vein, in the
Cerro Bayo zone on the east side of its holdings, commenced in November 2001. Additional mineralized high-grade
gold and silver vein systems were discovered since then from surface and underground exploration.
The ore processing mill for the Cerro Bayo Mine uses a standard flotation process to produce a high grade gold
and silver concentrate. During 2008, the concentrate processed at this mill was sold to third-party smelters,
primarily in Japan and Mexico. The mill has a design capacity of 1,650 tons per day. During 2008, the Company
experienced recovery rates of approximately 93.4% for silver and 90.2% for gold. Electrical power is generated
on-site by diesel generators and process water is obtained from a combination of the adjacent General Carrera Lake
and from tailings re-circulation. The property, plant and equipment are maintained in good working condition
through a regular preventive maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Mining is conducted
utilizing underground methods. Total capital expenditures at the Cerro Bayo property in 2008 were $8.2 million and
the Company plans approximately $1.6 million of capital expenditures there in 2009.
Production at the Cerro Bayo mine in 2008 was approximately 1.2 million ounces of silver and 21,761 ounces
of gold compared to 1.7 million ounces of silver and 37,479 ounces of gold in 2007. The decrease in silver
production was due to a 39% decrease in tons mined. Cash costs per ounce of silver produced increased to $8.56 in
2008 from $8.22 in 2007.
On October 31, 2008, the Company announced a temporary suspension of operating activities at the Cerro
Bayo mine due primarily to lower metal prices and continuing higher operating costs. During 2009, the Company
will undertake efforts to further explore its holdings and develop a new mine plan and ore reserves in an effort to re-
commence operations in 2010.
Silver and gold mineralization is hosted in epithermal quartz veins and veinlets and lesser amounts of
stockworks and breccias within generally sub-horizontal volcanic rocks of the Ibañez Formation. Veins and veinlets
occur in sub-parallel clusters largely trending north-northwest and dipping steeply to the west or east. The main ore
minerals of silver and gold are silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite and electrum (a naturally-occurring gold and
silver alloy). Numerous epithermal veins located within the Cerro Bayo district offer exploration and development
opportunities for us. To date, we have discovered over 100 veins.
During 2008, the Company continued its exploration and development program in the district with its efforts
concentrated in the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde zones in the east and west sections of the Company’s land
holdings. In 2008, we spent approximately $2.7 million on exploration and $1.5 million on reserve development for
new gold and silver mineralization and completed over 172,000 feet (52,456 meters) of core drilling. Most of this
drilling was focused on exploration and definition of the new silver- and gold-bearing veins discovered approx-
imately one mile east of the ore processing facilities at Laguna Verde; Dagny, Fabiola, Coyita, Yasna and Dalila. In
the second half of 2008 a new vein, termed Delia, was discovered just to the east of the other veins. The Company
plans to continue its extensive exploration and mine development programs in the district in 2009 with a budget of
$3.9 million for this work.

North America
USA — Rochester Mine
The Rochester Mine is an open pit silver and gold mine located in Pershing County, Nevada, which is located
approximately 25 paved and all-weather gravel road miles northeast of the town of Lovelock. The Company owns
100% of the Rochester Mine by virtue of its 100% ownership of its subsidiary, Coeur Rochester, Inc. (“Coeur
Rochester”). The mine consists of the main Rochester deposit and the adjacent Nevada Packard deposit, due south
of Rochester.
Coeur Rochester controls 541 U.S. Federal unpatented claims (including 54 mill sites), 23 patented claims, and
leases an additional 53 unpatented claims, totaling approximately 7,200 acres. All of the Company’s mineral
resources and reserves are located within the claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual
fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and to Pershing County, which acts as administrator of the
claims. Real taxes to the State of Nevada are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease payments are paid annually;
all leases are in good standing.
The Company acquired the Rochester property from ASARCO in 1983 and commenced mining in 1986. No
mining or processing was conducted at Rochester by the prior owner. The Company acquired initial interest in the
adjacent Nevada Packard property in 1996, completed the full purchase in 1999 and commenced mining in 2003.
Very limited mining and processing was conducted at Nevada Packard by the prior owner. Collectively, the
Rochester and Nevada Packard properties comprise the Company’s Rochester silver and gold mining and
processing operation.
In August of 2007, mining and crushing operations at the Rochester mine were suspended. During the third
quarter of 2008, the Company revised its estimates of silver ounces contained in the heap inventory. Consequently,
the Company has extended the anticipated completion of its residual leaching phase from 2011 to 2014. At the
Nevada Packard satellite deposit, located south of the Rochester deposit, the Company commenced mining of silver
in the first quarter of 2003. Mining at Nevada Packard was completed in mid-2007.
The Rochester Mine is fully supported with electricity, supplied by a local power company on their public grid,
telephone and radio communications, production water wells, and processing, maintenance, warehouse, and office
facilities. All of these facilities are in good operating condition with no major maintenance expected. The mine
utilizes the heap leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined using conventional open pit
29
methods. The Company completed mining of the existing ore reserves in August of 2007. While mining operations
were discontinued, it is expected that metal production will continue as a result of residual leaching until
approximately 2014. Production at the Rochester mine in 2008 was approximately 3.0 million ounces of silver
and 21,041 ounces of gold, compared to approximately 4.6 million ounces of silver and 50,408 ounces of gold in
2007. Cash costs per ounce of silver decreased to $(0.03) per ounce in 2008, compared to $1.52 per ounce in 2007.
The decrease in cash costs per ounce is due to decreased mining and crushing costs during the year because mining
and crushing operations were terminated in August 2007, as contained ore reserves were fully mined and placed on
the heap leach pads for on-going leaching and metal recovery.
Based upon actual operating experience and certain metallurgical testing, the Company estimates ultimate
recovery rates from the crushed ore of between 59% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and
93% for gold.
The Company’s capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine totaled approximately $0.6 million in 2008. The
Company plans capital expenditures at the Rochester Mine of $0.7 million in 2009. ASARCO, the prior owner, had
a net smelter royalty interest which is payable only when the market price of silver equals or exceeds $22.54 per
ounce up to a maximum rate of 5%. No royalties were required to be paid by the Company during the three years
ended December 31, 2008.
At Rochester, silver and gold mineralization is hosted in folded and faulted volcanic rocks of the Rochester
Formation and overlying Weaver Formation. Silver and gold, consisting of silver sulfosalt minerals, argentite,
argentian tetrahedrite and minor native gold, are contained in zones of multiple quartz veins and veinlets (vein and
vein swarms and stockworks) with variable but lesser amounts of pyrite.
In 2008, the Company commenced an exploration program to identify new silver- and gold-bearing structures
on its large holdings in the district and to expand and define mineralized material occurring around the Rochester
mine. Over 20,200 feet of reverse circulation and core drilling was completed at the new Mystic Springs targets and
around the Rochester mine. During 2008, we spent $0.6 million on exploration in the Rochester area. The Company
has plans to follow-up on any favorable results from this drilling in 2009.

(1) Current mineralized material is effective as of December 31, 2008. Mineralized material was estimated with a
cutoff grade of 0.56 silver equivalent ounces per ton. Formula Ag equivalent = (Au*221) +Ag.
(2) The mineralized material is in-situ and was estimated with gold and silver prices of $1,000 and $16.00 per
ounce, respectively, historical metallurgical recoveries for gold and silver, historical mine operating costs
within a non-optimized Whittle» open pit model, and include no additional factors for mining dilution or
recovery. The estimate of mineralized material was constrained to exclude any silver and gold mineralization
beneath existing leaching operations.
(3) The Company estimates the ultimate recovery to be approximately 61.5% for silver and 93% for gold. However,
ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease which is currently estimated for 2014.
Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery. Recoveries are calculated based on the ounces
recovered as a percent of the ounces placed on the pad. As ore production ceased in August 2007, silver and
gold recoveries increased significantly as a percent of ore placed on the pad. See “Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates — Ore on Leach Pad.”
(4) Mineralized material was estimated by J. L. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s technical staff. The firm of
Reserva International, an independent consultant, was used to assist with modeling the results from the 2008
drilling conducted at Rochester to produce the new mineralized material.
(5) Mineralized material is defined by drilling on grid of 100 feet by 200 feet, or closer, and includes open pit mine
production sampling to assist with determination of gold and silver grades. In practice, the grade of mineralized
material is defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. The
number of drill samples used in estimation of grades must be at least 4 with a maximum search distance 150 feet
at Rochester and 120 feet at Nevada Packard.
(6) Cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to
monitor and evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to
GAAP Production Costs.”

(7) Mining and crushing operations terminated in August 2007. Residual leaching will continue until approxi-
mately 2014.
Australia
New South Wales — Endeavor Mine
The Endeavor Mine, an underground silver and base metal mine, is located in north central New South Wales,
Australia, about 447 miles (720 kilometers) from Sydney. Access to the mine is by paved roads 30 miles (18
kilometers) to the northwest from the community of Cobar.
The ore reserves at Endeavor are covered by five Consolidated Mining Leases issued by the state of New South
Wales to Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”).
The leases form a contiguous block of 10,121 acres in size and expire between 2019 and 2027.
The Endeavor Mine has been in production since 1983. On September 12, 2003, CBH acquired the Elura mine
and processing facilities from Pasminco and changed the name to the Endeavor Mine. On May 23, 2005, CDE
Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (“CDE Australia”), acquired all of the silver production
and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces, contained at the Endeavor Mine, which is owned and
operated by CBH, for $44.0 million including transaction fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE
Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar
approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal
to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar
an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver
price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this
agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25
per ounce is also payable by CDE Australia in respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they
are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007, $2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable
silver reserves under the terms of the contract. This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests
acquired and is being amortized using the units of production method.
On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver
purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total
of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-
sharing provision is deferred until such time as CDE Australia has received approximately two million cumulative
ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever is later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold
increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. During late November 2008, the mine
exceeded the two million cumulative ounce thresholds and therefore, CDE Australia realized a reduction in
revenues of $73,318 as a result of the silver price-sharing provision. The conditions relating to the second payment
were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In January
2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on April 1, 2008,
plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. CDE Australia has received
approximately 2.1 million payable ounces to date, and the current ore reserve contains approximately 13.5 million
payable ounces based on current metallurgical recovery and current smelter contract terms. Expansion of the ore
reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the modified
contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a result of the conversion of portions of
the property’s existing inventory of mineralized material and future exploration discoveries. CBH conducts regular
exploration to discover new mineralization and to define reserves from surface and underground drilling platforms.
As of December 31, 2008, CDE Australia had recovered approximately 42.8% of the transaction consideration
consisting of 2.1 million payable ounces, or 10.6%, of the 20 million maximum payable silver ounces to which CDE
Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement. No assurances can be made that the
mine will achieve its 20 million payable silver ounce cap to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the
silver sale and purchase agreement.
32
The mine employs bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that
is sold to a third-party smelter. Silver recovery averaged approximately 56.5% in 2008 and 48.0% in 2007. Power to
the mine and processing facilities is provided by the grid servicing the local communities. The property and
equipment are maintained in good working condition, by CBH, through a regular preventive maintenance program
and periodic improvements as required.
Production at the Endeavor mine in 2008 was 824,093 ounces of silver compared to 772,609 ounces of silver in
2007. Cash cost per ounce of silver produced was $2.55 in 2008 compared to $2.67 in 2007.
The Company is not required to contribute to ongoing capital costs at the mine.
At Endeavor, silver, lead, zinc and lesser amounts of copper mineralization are contained within sulfide lenses
hosted in fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic-aged Amphitheatre Group. Sulphide lenses are ellip-
tically-shaped, steeply-dipping to the southwest and strike to the northwest. Principal ore minerals are galena,
sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead and zinc rich sulphide zones.
CBH conducts regular exploration to define new reserves at the mine from both underground and surface core
drilling platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which is the fiscal year used by the operator (CBH), the
exploration expenditure at the mine was A$0.9 million (US$0.6 million).

(1) Ore reserves are effective as of June 30, 2008, which is the end of the most recent fiscal year of the operator,
CBH. Metal prices used were $12.00 per ounce of silver.
(2) The ore reserves are underground minable and include variable mining dilution (5% to 20% additional waste)
and mining recovery factors ranging from 50% (for pillars) to 95%.
(3) Metallurgical recovery factor of 45% should be applied to the silver reserve ounces.
(4) Classification of reserves is based on spacing from drill hole composites to reserve block centers. For proven
reserves the maximum distance is 25 meters and for probable reserves it is 40 meters. A minimum of 15 drill
holes samples are used in estimation of ore reserve grades. Mineralized material is similarly classified.
(5) Cash costs per ounce of silver represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and
evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Pro-
duction Costs.”
New South Wales — Broken Hill Mine
The Broken Hill Mine, an underground lead, zinc and silver mine, is located in western New South Wales,
Australia. Access to the mine is by paved roads leading from the adjacent community of Broken Hill.
The ore reserves at Broken Hill are covered by nine Consolidated Mining Leases issued by the state of New
South Wales to Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. (“PBH”). The leases form a northeast elongate contiguous block of
18,502 acres in size and are currently being renewed. The new leases have various expiration dates ranging from
2019 to 2024.
On September 8, 2005, CDE Australia acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to 17.2 million
payable ounces (24.5 million contained ounces), contained at the Broken Hill mine in Australia, which is owned and
operated by PBH for $36.9 million including transaction fees. In addition, CDE Australia pays PBH an operating
cost contribution of approximately $2.00 for each ounce of payable silver. Under the terms of the agreement, PBH
may earn up to $0.75 million per year of additional consideration by meeting certain silver production thresholds.
No additional payments pursuant to production thresholds were made during 2008.
The mine uses bulk mining methods and utilizes a conventional flotation mill to produce a concentrate that is
sold to third-party smelters in Australia. Silver recovery averaged approximately 72.5% in 2008 and 83.6% in 2007.
The property and equipment are maintained in good working condition by PBH, through a regular preventive
maintenance program and periodic improvements as required. Power to the mine and processing facilities is
provided by the grid servicing the local community.
As of December 31, 2008, CDE Australia had recovered approximately 120% of the transaction consideration
consisting of 5.4 million payable ounces, or 31.4%, of the 17.2 million payable silver ounces to which it is entitled to
under the terms of the silver sale agreement. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum
payable ounces of silver production as set forth in the contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore
34
reserves will occur as a result of conversion of portions of the property’s inventory of mineralized material and
future exploration discoveries on the property. PBH conducts regular exploration to discover new mineralization
and define reserves from surface and underground drilling platforms. For its fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, PBH
has budgeted A$5.8 million (US$5.1 million) for this work. CDE Australia is not required to contribute to ongoing
capital costs at the mine. No assurances can be made that the mine will achieve its 17.2 million payable silver ounce
target to which CDE Australia is entitled under the terms of the silver sale and purchase agreement.
Silver production in 2008 from the Broken Hill mine amounted to approximately 1.4 million ounces of silver
compared to 1.6 million ounces of silver in 2007. The decrease in silver production is primarily due to an 18.5%
decrease in ore grades. The cash cost per ounce of silver production, which includes the operating cost contribution
and smelting, refining and transportation costs, was $3.41 in 2008 compared to $3.18 in 2007.
Silver, lead and zinc mineralization at Broken Hill is contained within sulfide lenses hosted in metasedi-
mentary and igneous rocks of Precambrian-aged Broken Hill and underlying Thackaringa groups. In general
sulphide lenses are tabular in shape steeply dipping to the north-northwest and striking east-northeast. Principal ore
minerals are galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Silver occurs with both lead- and zinc-rich sulphide zones but is
higher grade in the lead zones.
PBH conducts regular exploration to define new ore reserves, largely from underground core drilling
platforms. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which is the fiscal year used by the operator, A$11.3 million
(US$7.2 million) was spent on near-mine exploration.

(1) Ore reserves are effective as of June 30, 2008, which is the end of the most recent fiscal year of the operator
(PBH). Metal prices used were $2.22 per ounce of silver.
(2) The ore reserves are underground minable reserves and include factors for mining dilution and recovery.
Dilution ranges from 0% to 20% of additional tonnage while recovery ranges from 80% to 100% of the diluted
tonnage and averages 85%.
(3) Metallurgical recovery factor of 72% should be applied to the silver reserve ounces.
(4) The ore reserves were estimated by the technical staff of CBH Resources, the mine operator, and reviewed by B.
O’Leary (Mine Engineer) and J. L. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s technical staff.
(5) The proven and probable reserves are a combination of zinc, lead and silver mineralization remnant from
historic mining and new parts or extensions of the mine. Proven and probable reserves must be accessible as
defined by the site specific conditions of the mine. Furthermore, reserves are defined by definition drilling on a
grid of 40 meters horizontally by 20 meters vertically and over 70% of the proven reserves are drilled on a 20
meter by 10 meter grid.
(6) Cash costs per ounce of silver represent a non-U.S. GAAP measurement that management uses to monitor and
evaluate the performance of its mining operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Pro-
duction Costs.”
Discontinued Operation
USA — Coeur Silver Valley
On June 1, 2006, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary Coeur
Silver Valley, Inc. to U.S. Silver Corporation for $15 million in cash and additional consideration received of
$1.1 million for working capital. Coeur Silver Valley was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that owned
and operated the Galena underground silver mine, an operating mine, and the Coeur and Caladay properties, which
adjoin to the Galena mine, located in the heart of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District in Shoshone County, Idaho.
Coeur Silver Valley’s property consisted of 6,131 acres of Company-owned fee land, patented mining claims and
unpatented claims in addition to 4,800 acres of leased claims. Coeur Silver Valley’s operations were accessed by
paved road from US Interstate 90 south of the town of Wallace, Idaho. Silver Valley recommenced operations at the
Coeur mine in June 1996 and continued mining existing reserves there through July 2, 1998 when known reserves
were depleted. Silver Valley resumed production at the Galena Mine in May 1997, and operations continued to the
date of the sale.
The Galena Mine property was located immediately west of the City of Wallace in Shoshone County in
northern Idaho. The property consisted of 52 patented mining claims and 25 unpatented mining claims totaling
approximately 1,100 acres.
36
The Galena Mine was an underground silver-copper mine served by two vertical shafts. The No. 3 shaft was
the primary production shaft and was 5,800 feet deep. The Galena shaft primarily provided utility access for water,
electrical power and sand backfill for underground operations down to the 2,400 level.
The mine utilized conventional and mechanized cut and fill mining methods with sand backfill to extract ore
from the high grade silver-copper vein deposits that constituted the majority of the ore reserves. Silver and copper
were recovered by a flotation mill that produced a silver rich concentrate which was sold to third-party smelters in
Canada. Silver recovery through the mill averaged 96% in 2006, the last year that the Company operated the mine.
Waste material from the milling process was deposited in a tailings pond located approximately two miles
from the mine site. As of the date of the sale, the tailings containment pond, which was expanded on an as needed
basis, had capacity for approximately seven additional years at current production rates.
Silver production at the Galena Mine in 2006, up to the date of the sale, was approximately 768,674 ounces of
silver. Cash costs for 2006 were $9.75 per ounce. Total capital expenditures by Silver Valley at the Galena Mine in
2006 were $0.6 million.

SILVER AND GOLD DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
Mexico — Palmarejo Silver and Gold Project
The Palmarejo project is being built as an open-pit and underground silver and gold mine and ore processing
facility, located in the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico. Access to the Palmarejo property is by paved and all
weather dirt roads southwest from the capitol city of Chihuahua.
On December 21, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bolnisi Gold NL (“Bolnisi”) and
Palmarejo Silver and Gold Corporation (“Palmarejo”) resulting in 100% ownership of the project. The Palmarejo
silver and gold mine is currently in the beginning stage of commercial production.
The Company’s property position at Palmarejo consists of 32 mining concessions totaling 46.9 square miles
(12,141 hectares). Of the total concessions, 23 concessions consisting of 46.1 square miles (11,949 hectares) are
owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. (Coeur Mexicana), formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V. (a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company), and the remaining nine concessions, representing 0.74 square miles (191.96
hectares) are held by Coeur Mexicana under various agreements and leases. All of the company’s reserves are
located on concessions owned 100% by Coeur Mexicana. All concessions owned by Coeur Mexicana are valid until
37
at least 2029. In addition to the Palmarejo project, the Company also acquired the Yecora exploration-stage property
located in Sonora, on the border with Chihuahua and the El Realito and La Guitarra exploration-stage properties in
Chihuahua.
Total capital costs in 2008 were $190.3 million. This excludes $17.0 million of costs that were expensed as pre-
development. The Company expects to spend approximately $100 million in capital expenditures during 2009.
Silver production in 2009 is anticipated to be 5.4 million ounces and gold production is estimated to be 72,000
ounces during this initial year of operations.
On June 10, 2008, Coeur announced the results of a feasibility study for the Palmarejo silver/gold open pit/
underground project. The feasibility study reflects results from geologic, engineering and economic analyses for
only the Palmarejo deposit. This study established the first proven and probable mineral reserve for the Palmarejo
project.
The terrain at the Palmarejo project mine is characterized by steep-sided hills and V-shaped valleys, although
sites for mining infrastructures such as a mill should not pose a significant problem. Dumps and tailings will likely
need to be placed within the upper reaches of drainage valleys, which would require the construction of a retention
dam(s).
The Palmarejo mine is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain range that
comprises the central spine of northern Mexico. The north-northwest-trending Sierra Madre Occidental is
composed of a relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau. This
volcanic plateau is deeply incised in the Palmarejo project area, locally forming steep-walled canyons. The Sierra
Madre Occidental gives way to the west to an extensional terrain that represents the southward continuation of the
Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then to the coastal plain of western Mexico.
The gold and silver deposits at the Palmarejo project, typical of many of the other silver and gold deposits in
the Sierra Madre, are classified as epithermal deposits, and are hosted in multiple veins, breccias and fractures.
These geologic structures trend generally northwest to southeast and dip either southwest or northeast. The dip on
the structures ranges from about 45 degrees to 70 degrees. In the mineralized portions of the structures gold and
silver are zoned from top to bottom with higher silver values occurring in the upper parts of the deposit to a gold-rich
basal portion, sometimes accompanied by base metal mineralization. The Palmarejo property contains a number of
mineralized zones or areas of interest. The most important of these to date is the Palmarejo zone in the far north of
the concessions which covers the old Palmarejo gold-silver mine based on the northwest-southeast trending
La Prieta and La Blanca gold-silver bearing structures. In addition to Palmarejo, mineralized vein and alteration
systems in the Trogan license area have been identified on other strongly mineralized corridors, roughly sub-
parallel to the Palmarejo zone. The most significant of these additional targets are the Guadalupe (including
Animas) and La Patria vein systems in the southern part of the property and are currently under investigation by the
Company’s exploration teams.
The Company spent $8.6 million on exploration at the Palmarejo District in 2008, its first year of exploration
since completion of the acquisition, to discover new silver and gold mineralization and define new ore reserves. Its
exploration budget for 2009 is $8.2 million.

(1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. Metal prices used in calculating proven and
probable reserves were $13.25 per ounce of silver and $750 per ounce of gold.
(2) The ore reserves are underground and open pit minable and include factors for mining dilution and recovery.
For underground-minable reserves, 15% additional tons at 0.004 ounces per ton of gold and 0.46 oz/ton of silver
was added for dilution and 100% mining recovery. For open pit-minable reserves, 10% additional tons at the
same grades as mining dilution were added and a 95% mining recovery.
(3) Metallurgical recovery factor of 90.8% and 93.8% should be applied to the contained silver and gold reserve
ounces, respectively.
(4) The ore reserves were estimated B. O’Leary (Mine Engineer), J. Sims (Geologist) and A. Tattersall (Mine
Engineer) of the Company’s technical staff. Mineralized material includes estimates for the La Patria zone
prepared by Mine Development Associates (“MDA”) as of September 17, 2007.
(5) Proven and probable reserves are defined by exploration holes drilled from stations on a nominal grid spacing of
40 meters. Measured resources determination parameter is material demonstrating grade continuity that is less
than or equal to 15 meters distance from the nearest hole, with a minimum of 5 samples, no more than 2 of
which originate from the same diamond drill hole. The corresponding estimation parameter for indicated
resource estimation is less than or equal to 35 meters.

USA — Alaska — Kensington Gold Project
The Kensington underground gold project, consisting of the Kensington and adjacent Jualin properties, is
located on the east side of the Lynn Canal about 45 miles north-northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The mine will be
accessed by a horizontal tunnel and utilize conventional and mechanized underground mining methods. The ore will
be processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which will be sold to third-party smelters. Waste
material will be deposited in an impoundment facility on the property. Power is supplied to the site by on-site diesel
generators. Access to the project is presently by helicopter, float plane or boat from Juneau.
Coeur Alaska, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Coeur Alaska”), controls two contiguous
land groups: the Kensington and Jualin. The Kensington property consists of 51 private patented lode and mill-site
claims covering approximately 766 acres, 407 federal unpatented lode claims covering approximately 5,290 acres,
and eight State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately 95 acres. The Company controls the Jualin
Property, under a lease agreement with Hyak Mining Company, through the cessation of mining, so long as the
Company makes timely payments pursuant to the lease agreement. The Jualin Property consists of 25 patented lode
and mill-site claims covering approximately 416.5 acres, 472 federal unpatented lode claims and one unpatented
mill-site claim covering approximately 8,479 acres, and 25 State of Alaska mining claims covering approximately
381 acres. The Federal and State claims, as well as the private patented lode and mill-site claims, provide Coeur
with the necessary rights to mine and process ore from Kensington. All of the Company’s ore reserves are located
within the patented claims. The unpatented claims and mill sites are maintained via annual filings and fees to the
BLM, which acts as administrator of the claims. State claims are maintained via filings and fees to ADNR —
Juneau Recorder’s Office. Real property taxes to the State of Alaska are paid yearly for the patented claims. Lease
payments are paid annually and all leases are in good standing.
The property is located on the east side of Lynn Canal between Juneau and Haines, Alaska. Coeur Alaska is
obligated to pay a scaled net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur
Alaska recoups the $32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after
July 7, 1995 in connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at
$400 per ounce gold prices to a maximum of 21⁄2% at gold prices above $475 per ounce, with the royalty to be
capped at 1.0 million ounces of production.
The Kensington property litigation, described under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Federal Court (Alaska)
Kensington Project Permit Challenge,” has contributed to an increase in capital costs. Total expenditures by the
Company at the Kensington property in the year ended December 31, 2008 were $42.1 million. Such expenditures
were used to continue the permitting and development activities. Based upon the Company’s current estimates, an
impairment write-down could be necessary should the expectation of the long-term price for gold decrease below
approximately $750 per ounce. As of February 26, 2009, the current gold price is $937. As of December 31, 2008,
the carrying value of the Kensington project’s long-lived assets was $338.2 million.
The Company will provide an updated timetable and cost estimates once it receives a decision from the
U.S. Supreme Court. No assurances can be made that the project will achieve its schedule and cost estimates.
Further, no assurance can be given as to whether or when regulatory permits and approvals granted to the Company
may be further challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing agencies, or as to whether the Company
will ultimately place the Kensington project into commercial production.
The Kensington ore deposit consists of multiple precious metals bearing mesothermal, quartz, carbonate,
pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in the Cretaceous age Jualin diorite. The gold-telluride-
mineral calaverite is associated with the pyrite mineralization.
In 2008, the Company continued the exploration program started in the third quarter of 2005 designed to
increase the size and geologic continuity of gold mineralization in its mineralized material inventory and ultimately
result in an increase in ore reserves. In 2008, a total of $0.2 million was spent on this program.

(1) Current ore reserves are effective as of December 31, 2008. Metal price used in calculating proven and probable
reserves was $750 per ounce of gold.
(2) The ore reserves are underground minable and include factors for mining dilution and recovery. A factor of
approximately 10% additional tonnage at 0.063 ounces per ton of dilution was included. An average 97%
mining recovery was included.
(3) Metallurgical recovery factor of 95.3% should be applied to the contained gold reserve ounces.
(4) The ore reserves were estimated B. O’Leary (Mine Engineer), J. L. Sims (Geologist) of the Company’s
technical staff. Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, an independent consultant group, performed an
independent review of the Company’s updated resource estimate model used to prepare the ore reserve
estimates and AMEC, an independent consultant group, were used to help prepare the Company’s mine plan
and mining cost estimates.
(5) Proven and probable reserves are defined underground drilling and underground workings. In practice, reserve
blocks are defined by the number of proximal composites and three-dimensional geologic controls. Proven ore
reserves include stockpiled ore. Ore reserve must be defined by least 10 drill samples from at least 2 drill holes
spaced not more than 60 feet from the block center. Mineralized material is similarly classified.
(6) Ore reserve estimates are based upon an operating scenario according to operating permits that have been
received. Certain of these permits are the subject of legal proceedings. See the additional discussion under
“Item 3. Legal Proceedings — Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge” and “Item 1A.
Risk Factors.”
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY
Coeur, either directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns, leases and has interests in certain
exploration-stage mining properties located in the United States, Chile, Argentina, Tanzania, Bolivia, and as of
December 31, 2008, Mexico. Exploration and reserve development expenditures of approximately $23.6 million,
$11.9 million and $9.5 million were incurred by the Company in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.
41
Highlights of the 2008 program include:
(cid:129) Discovery of the Delia vein at Cerro Bayo, Chile; a wide, silver- and gold-bearing vein located about 500
meters south of the Cerro Bayo mill.
(cid:129) Favorable results from drilling on three targets at Joaquin, an exploration property located northwest of the
Company’s Martha mill facility.
(cid:129) Addition of three new properties — La Currita near Palmarejo, Nico near Martha and Huantajaya in
northern Chile.
Coeur plans to invest $17.6 million in exploration during 2009 with over 85% of the budget earmarked for
expansion of mineral resources and reserves at or near its existing operations at Palmarejo (Mexico), Martha
(Argentina) and Cerro Bayo (Chile).
USA — Kensington/Jualin
No drilling was completed in 2008 at Kensington. The Company plans for an additional drilling program in
2009. The Company’s rights to use and develop the Jualin property are subject to an Amended Lease Agreement
dated August 5, 2005 between Hyak Mining Company Inc. as Lessor and Coeur Alaska as Lessee which expires in
2035 with provision for lease extensions through cessation of mining operations. Approximately $0.2 million was
spent in exploration in 2008 on Jualin.
USA — Rochester
The Company invested $0.6 million on exploration around the Rochester and Nevada Packard deposits in
2008. A total of 20,255 feet of reverse circulation drilling was completed, primarily at Rochester, to expand and
define known zones of silver and gold mineralization.
Chile — Cerro Bayo Mine
Coeur continued to conduct extensive exploration at its 100%-owned Cerro Bayo gold/silver mining operation
in southern Chile. Approximately $2.7 million was spent in exploration, and an additional $1.5 million was
capitalized as reserve development during 2008. A total of over 172,400 feet (52,556 meters) of core drilling was
completed during the year to discover new mineralization and define new ore reserves. The most significant result
of this program was the expansion and definition of new ore at several of the new silver- and gold-bearing veins
discovered near the Laguna Verde ore processing facility in 2007 and the discovery of a new, major vein in that area
in 2008, termed Delia. Many of the new drill holes into Delia intersected wide silver and gold mineralization that is
expected to be an important contribution along with Dagny, Fabiola and other veins in the district towards the
development of a new, multi-year mine plan. Silver and gold mineralization at Delia now extends for over 1
kilometer on strike and up to 100 meters vertically. The Company believes that there is potential to discover
additional high grade veins within the entire Cerro Bayo district.
Chile — Other Properties
In 2008, Coeur completed an agreement for an option to purchase 100% of the Huantajaya silver property in
northern Chile. The property covers over 624 hectares of prospective ground, in a historic silver district, 15
kilometers east of the port city of Iquique. Access to the property and local infrastructure are excellent. Surface
geological and geophysical exploration program is planned in early 2009, to define new drilling targets.
The 2009 exploration budget for Chile is $4.2 million of which $3.9 million is devoted to Cerro Bayo.
Argentina — Martha Mine
In 2008, the Company’s exploration efforts consisted of mapping, sampling and over 47,400 feet (14,463
meters) of core drilling for a total expenditure of $3.3 million, of which $0.4 million was capitalized as reserve
development.
42
Argentina — Other Properties
The Company also continued exploration in other parts of the Santa Cruz Province near the Martha mine.
Activities focused on the El Aguila, Sascha and Joaquin properties. In 2008 drilling and other exploration work was
conducted at the three properties. By property, core drilling amounted to the following subtotals: El Aguila —
4,193 feet (1,278 meters), Sascha — 2,008 feet (612 meters), and Joaquin — 5,397 feet (1,645 meters). In addition,
the Company also conducted exploration at its wholly-owned Lejano and Cisne properties in west central Santa
Cruz Province. At Cisne, a total of 1,132 feet (345 meters) of core was drilled in the first quarter and at Lejano,
7,766 feet (2,367 meters) of core was drilled throughout the year.
Drilling at Joaquin in the fourth quarter returned encouraging results with 1,648 meters of drilling in 15 core
holes on three targets; La Morena, La Negra and La Morocha. Joaquin is located about 80 kilometers northwest of
the Company’s Martha mine, and the Company has an option to earn up to 71% managing interest in a joint venture
with property owners Mirasol Resources Ltd. A second phase of drilling will begin early this year.
(cid:129) At the La Morena target, drilling of six core holes encountered near-vertical zones of silicified breccias and
veins. Drill intercepts reach up to 16.5 meters estimated true width with gold grades up to 7.67 grams per
tonne in higher-grade portions of the breccias. Drilling tested to 120 meters depth and just 200 meters of
strike of the target system which extends over 2.5 kilometers on surface.
(cid:129) At La Negra, drilling of three core holes tested approximately 150 meters of strike and down to 100 meters
below the surface of this epithermal vein system which has been traced for over 500 meters on surface. Two
veins and related breccias in their hangingwall and footwall have been identified with this initial core
drilling. All holes returned very encouraging silver and gold mineralization with values up to 541 grams per
tonne of silver and 2.87 of gold.
(cid:129) At La Morocha, drilling of six core holes tested the target structure along an exposed strike length of 450
meters and 110 meters down dip. Wide intercepts — up to 42 meters estimated true width — were
discovered, with values up to 140 grams per tonne silver and 0.47 grams per tonne of gold. La Morocha
is currently at least 970 meters long.
In February 2009, the company completed an agreement for an option to earn up to 75% managing interest in a
joint venture on the Nico property owned by Mirasol Resources Ltd. Nico is a large property located about 45
kilometers north of the Martha mine, covering over 20,000 hectares of prospective ground with potential for silver
mineralization in veins and bulk tonnage silver mineralization in breccias and mantos. Detailed exploration is
planned to start during the first quarter of 2009.
The Company has budgeted $2.7 million for 2009 in Argentina for the Martha mine, Joaquin and Nico
exploration.
Africa, Tanzania
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company acquired ten prospecting licenses for properties located in the
Lake Victoria Gold Belt of Tanzania, Africa, and in 2005, 2006 and 2007 added the Saragurwa, Bismark and Pangea
properties, respectively. Based on results from its annual exploration programs, four of the original ten concessions
were not renewed. Except for Saragurwa, Bismark and Pangea, all properties are held 100% by Tanzanian
subsidiaries of the Company. Saragurwa and Bismark are owned by separate private Tanzanian interests and Pangea
is controlled by a Tanzanian subsidiary of Barrick Gold Company. Coeur Tanzania Ltd. has an option to acquire all
three properties in return for staged work and payment commitments. The Company is currently addressing its
strategic options in Tanzania which includes a possible sale or a joint venture partner.
In 2008, exploration work consisted of mapping, trenching, sampling and acquisition and interpretation of
detailed ground geophysical data and core and reverse circulation drilling. In total 11,647 feet (3,550 meters) of core
drilling was completed in 2008 at Kiziba Hill which lies on the same belt of Archean-aged rocks, commonly termed
“greenstone,” which host the Geita gold mine to the east.
During 2008, the Company spent $2.0 million on exploration activities in Tanzania and expects to spend
approximately $0.2 million in 2009.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
States of Maine, Idaho and Colorado Superfund Sites Related to Callahan Mining Corporation
During 1991, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation. To
date, no claim has been made for any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
During 2001, the U.S. Forest Service (“USFS”) made a formal request for information regarding the
Deadwood Mine Site located in central Idaho. Callahan Mining Corporation had operated at this site during
the 1940s. The USFS believes that some cleanup action is required at the location. However, the Company did not
acquire Callahan until 1991, more than 40 years after Callahan disposed of its interest in the Deadwood property.
The Company did not make any decisions with respect to generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at the
site. Therefore, the Company believes that it is not liable for any cleanup, and if Callahan might be liable, it has no
substantial assets with which to satisfy any such liability. To date, no claim has been made by the United States for
any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
During 2002, the EPA made a formal request for information regarding a Callahan mine site in the State of
Maine. Callahan operated there in the late 1960s, shut the operations down in the early 1970s and disposed of the
property. The EPA contends that some cleanup action is warranted at the site, and listed it on the National Priorities
List in late 2002. In January 2009, the EPA and the State of Maine made additional formal requests for information
relating to the Maine Callahan mine site. The Company believes that because it made no decisions with respect to
generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at this location, it is not liable for any cleanup costs. If Callahan
might have liability, it has no substantial assets with which to satisfy such liability. To date, no claim has been made
for any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
In January 2003, the USFS made a formal request for information regarding a Callahan mine site in the State of
Colorado known as the Akron Mine Site. Callahan operated there in approximately the late 1930s through the
1940s, and to the Company’s knowledge, disposed of the property. The Company is not aware of what, if any,
cleanup action the USFS is contemplating. However, the Company did not make decisions with respect to
generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at this location, and therefore believes it is not liable for any
cleanup costs. If Callahan might have liability, it has no substantial assets with which to satisfy such liability.
Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge
On September 12, 2005, three environmental groups, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (“SEACC”),
The Sierra Club and Lynn Canal Conservation (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court
in Alaska against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps of Engineers”) and the USFS seeking to invalidate the
permit issued to Coeur Alaska for the Company’s Kensington mine. The Plaintiffs claim the Clean Water Act
(“CWA”) Section 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers authorizing the deposition of mine tailings into a
nearby lake called Lower Slate Lake conflicts with the CWA. They additionally claim the USFS’s approval of the
Amended Plan of Operations is arbitrary and capricious because it relies on the 404 permit issued by the Corps of
Engineers. Following the District Court’s remand of the Section 404 permit to the Corps of Engineers for further
review, the Corps reinstated the Company’s permit on March 29, 2006. The lawsuit challenging the permit was re-
opened on April 6, 2006; Coeur Alaska filed its answer to the Amended Complaint and Coeur Alaska, the State of
Alaska, and Goldbelt, Inc., a local native corporation, were granted Defendant-Intervenor status to join the agencies
in their defense of the permit.
On August 4, 2006, the Federal District Court in Alaska dismissed the Plaintiffs’ challenge and upheld the
Section 404 permit. On August 7, 2006, the Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal of the decision to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals (“Ninth Circuit Court”) and on August 9, 2006 the Plaintiffs additionally filed a Motion for
Injunction Pending Appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court. The Ninth Circuit Court granted a temporary injunction
pending appeal on August 24, 2006, enjoining certain activities relating to the lake tailings facility.
On May 22, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the District Court’s August 4, 2006 decision which had
upheld the Company’s 404 permit and issued its opinion that remanded the case to the District Court with
instructions to vacate the Company’s 404 permit as well as the USFS Record of Decision approving the general
tailings disposal plan and the Goldbelt 404 permit to construct the Cascade Point Marine Facility. On August 20,
44
2007, Coeur Alaska filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc with the Ninth Circuit Court, as did the State of Alaska
and Goldbelt, Inc. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the Corps of Engineers, and USFS additionally filed a
limited Petition for Rehearing with the Ninth Circuit Court panel seeking reconsideration of the mandate of the
May 22, 2007 panel decision. On October 29, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court denied the Petitions for Rehearing En
Banc. On November 14, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court granted a stay of the mandate pending further appeal to the
United States Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”), subject to the development of a reclamation plan for the lake area.
The Company and the State of Alaska filed Petitions for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States
on January 28, 2008. On June 27, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the State of Alaska and
Coeur Alaska’s Petitions for writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court. Oral arguments were
made before the Supreme Court by both parties on January 12, 2009. The Company expects a decision on the case
pending with the Supreme Court in the second quarter of 2009. The Company cannot predict if it will prevail in this
appeal.
On October 1, 2008 the Company announced a temporary curtailment of its development activities at the
Kensington Project until such time as a decision is rendered from the Supreme Court. Consequently, the Company
laid off approximately 50% of its existing workforce and paid termination benefits of $0.3 million.
No assurance can be given as to whether or when regulatory permits and approvals granted to the Company
may be further challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing agencies, or as to whether the Company
will ultimately place the Kensington project into commercial production.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The Company’s management focuses on maximizing cash flow from its existing operations, the main factors
of which are silver and gold prices, cash costs of production and capital expenditures. The Company also focuses on
reducing its non-operating costs in order to maximize cash flow.
Overview:
(cid:129) Silver and gold prices averaged $15.06 per ounce and $871.96 per ounce in 2008, respectively. Silver hit a
high of $20.70 per ounce on March 5, 2008 and a low of $8.81 per ounce on October 28, 2008. Gold hit a high
of $1,011 per ounce on March 17, 2008 and a low of $713 per ounce on October 24, 2008;
(cid:129) The Company produced a total of 12.0 million ounces of silver and 46,115 ounces of gold during 2008;
(cid:129) The Company completed construction and commenced production at its 100%-owned San Bartolomé silver
mine in Bolivia in June 2008;
(cid:129) The Company invested a total of $380.3 million in capital expenditures during 2008, including $190.3 mil-
lion at Palmarejo (excludes $17.0 million of expenditures that were expensed as pre-development costs),
$108.7 million at San Bartolomé and $40.9 million at Kensington;
(cid:129) The Company implemented aggressive cost reductions in October, resulting in a 22% reduction in general
and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007;
(cid:129) The Company sold $230 million of 31⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes on March 18, 2008;
(cid:129) The Company sold $50 million of Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes on October 20, 2008;
(cid:129) The Company temporarily suspended operations at its Cerro Bayo Mine on October 31, 2008 due primarily
to lower metals price and higher operating costs; and
(cid:129) The Company entered into a $20 million gold lease facility with Mitsubishi International Corporation on
December 18, 2008.

General
The results of the Company’s operations are significantly affected by the market prices of gold and silver
which fluctuate widely and are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including interest rates,
expectations regarding inflation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals
stockpiles, global and regional political and economic conditions, and other factors.
The San Bartolomé mine, Rochester mine, Cerro Bayo mine and Martha mine, each operated by the Company,
and the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines which are operated by others, constituted the Company’s principal sources
of mining revenues in 2008.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are
involved in preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact its
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the
accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. We
have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based
on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The preparation of these statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base these
estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances;
however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed
throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The areas
requiring the use of management’s estimates and assumptions relate to recoverable ounces from proven and
probable reserves that are the basis of future cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation and
amortization calculations; useful lives utilized for depreciation, depletion, and long lived assets; estimates of
recoverable gold and silver ounces in ore on leach pad; reclamation and remediation costs; valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets; and post-employment and other employee benefit liabilities. For a detailed discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies, see Note B — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue includes sales value received for our principal product, silver, and associated
by-product revenues from the sale of by-product metals consisting primarily of gold and copper. Revenue is
recognized when title to silver and gold passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title
passes to the customer based on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined at the point revenue is
recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets, for example, the London Bullion Market
for both gold and silver, in an identical form to the product sold.
Under our concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, final gold and silver prices are set on a
specified future quotational period, typically one to three months, after the shipment date based on market metal
prices. Revenues are recorded under these contracts at the time title passes to the buyer based on the forward price
for the expected settlement period. The contracts, in general, provide for a provisional payment based upon
provisional assays and quoted metal prices. Final settlement is based on the average applicable price for a specified
future period, and generally occurs from three to six months after shipment. Final sales are settled using smelter
weights, settlement assays (average of assays exchanged and/or umpire assay results) and are priced as specified in
the smelter contract. The Company’s provisionally priced sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to
be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of
concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge
accounting. The embedded derivative is recorded as a derivative asset in prepaid expenses and other, or a derivative
liability on the balance sheet and is adjusted to fair value through revenue each period until the date of final gold and
silver settlement. The form of the material being sold, after deduction for smelting and refining is in an identical
51
form to that sold on the London Bullion Market. The form of the product is metal in flotation concentrate, which is
the final process for which the Company is responsible.
The effects of forward sales contracts are reflected in revenue at the date the related precious metals are
delivered. Third-party smelting and refining costs are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $33.2 million consisting of
2.2 million ounces of silver and 8,388 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $32.1 million
including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary
(plus or minus) approximately $22,000 and for each one dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue
would vary (plus or minus) approximately $8,000. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding
provisionally priced sales of $61.2 million consisting of 3.3 million ounces of silver and 20,775 ounces of gold,
which had a fair value of approximately $63.8 million including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per
ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $33,000 and for each one
dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $21,000.
Estimates. The preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. The most critical
accounting principles upon which the Company’s financial status depends are those requiring estimates of
recoverable ounces from proven and probable reserves and/or assumptions of future commodity prices. There
are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many factors beyond our
control. Ore reserves estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of samplings of drill holes and other
openings. These estimates involve assumptions regarding future silver and gold prices, the geology of our mines,
the mining methods we use and the related costs we incur to develop and mine our reserves. Changes in these
assumptions could result in material adjustments to our reserve estimates. We use reserve estimates in determining
the units-of-production depreciation and amortization expense, as well as in evaluating mine asset impairments.
We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We utilize the methodology set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” to evaluate the recoverability of our assets. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future
cash flows or probability-weighted cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the
assets, including property, plant and equipment, mineral property, development property, and any deferred costs.
The accounting estimates related to impairment are critical accounting estimates because the future cash flows used
to determine whether an impairment exists is dependent on reserve estimates and other assumptions, including
silver and gold prices, production levels, and capital and reclamation costs, all of which are based on detailed
engineering life-of-mine plans. An impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss
recognized represents the excess of the asset’s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value. We review the
carrying value of our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our
assets may not be fully recoverable. We did not record any write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006.
We depreciate our property, plant and equipment, mining properties and mine development using the units-of-
production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on our proven and probable recoverable reserves or
on a straight-line basis over the useful life, whichever is shorter. The accounting estimates related to depreciation
and amortization are critical accounting estimates because 1) the determination of reserves involves uncertainties
with respect to the ultimate geology of our reserves and the assumptions used in determining the economic
feasibility of mining those reserves and 2) changes in estimated proven and probable reserves and useful asset lives
can have a material impact on net income.
Ore on leach pad. The Rochester Mine utilized the heap leach process to extract silver and gold from ore.
The heap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying
52
a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in
metallurgical processes.
We used several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed on the leach pads. As
the ore body was drilled in preparation for the blasting process, samples are taken of the drill residue which is
assayed to determine estimated quantities of contained metal. We estimated the quantity of ore by utilizing global
positioning satellite survey techniques. We then processed the ore through crushing facilities where the output was
again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation with the data collected from the mining
operation was completed with appropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. The crushed ore was then
transported to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collected from the leach
pads, it is continuously sampled for assaying. The quantity of leach solution is measured by flow meters throughout
the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, the product is converted to dorè, which is the final
product produced by the mine. The inventory is stated at lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using a
weighted average cost method.
Our reported inventories include metals estimated to be contained in the ore on leach pad of $30.2 million as of
December 31, 2008. Of this amount, $9.2 million is reported as a current asset and $21.0 million is reported as a
non-current asset. The distinction between current and non-current is based upon the expected length of time
necessary for the leaching process to remove the metals from the broken ore. The historical cost of the metal that is
expected to be extracted within twelve months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained
within the broken ore that will be extracted beyond twelve months is classified as noncurrent. The ore on leach pad
inventory is stated at actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad during the current
period, adjusted for the effects on monthly production costs of abnormal production levels.
The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time, and the quantity of metal that may be extracted
relative to such twelve-month period, requires the use of estimates which are inherently inaccurate since they rely
upon laboratory testwork. Testwork consists of 60-day leach columns from which we project metal recoveries into
the future. The quantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis. The rate at
which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon laboratory column tests and
actual experience occurring over approximately twenty years of leach pad operation at the Rochester Mine. The
assumptions we use to measure metal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes
estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. We periodically review our estimates compared
to actual experience and revise our estimates when appropriate. However, the ultimate recovery will not be known
until leaching operations cease, which is currently estimated for 2014.
When we began operations at the Rochester mine in 1986, based solely on laboratory testing, we estimated the
ultimate recovery of silver and gold at 50% and 80%, respectively. Since 1986, we have adjusted the expected
ultimate recovery 3 times (once in each of 1989, 1997 and 2003) based upon actual experience gained from leach
operations. In 1989, we increased our estimated recoveries for silver and gold to 55% and 85%, respectively. The
change was accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate, which had the effect of increasing the estimated
recoverable ounces of silver and gold contained in the heap by 1.6 million ounces and 10,000 ounces, respectively.
In 1997, we revised our estimated recoveries for silver and gold to 59% and 89%, respectively, which increased the
estimated recoverable ounces of silver and gold contained in the heap by 4.7 million ounces and 39,000 ounces,
respectively. In 2003, we revised our estimated recoveries for silver and gold to 61.5% and 93%, respectively, which
increased the estimated recoverable ounces of silver and gold contained in the heap by 1.8 million ounces and
41,000 ounces, respectively. During the third quarter of 2008, we increased our estimated silver ounces contained in
the heap inventory by 5.4 million ounces. The increase in estimated silver ounces contained in the heap inventory is
due to changes in estimated silver recoveries anticipated for the remainder of the residual leach phase. There were
no changes in recoveries related to gold contained in the heap. Consequently, we believe our current residual heap
leach activities are expected to continue through 2014. However, the ultimate recovery will not be known until
leaching operations cease.

Inventories of ore on leach pads are valued based upon actual production costs incurred to produce and place
such ore on the leach pad during the current period, adjusted for the effects on monthly production of costs of
abnormal production levels, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process. The costs consist
of those production activities occurring at the mine site and include the costs, including depreciation, associated
with mining, crushing and precipitation circuits. In addition, refining is provided by a third-party refiner to place the
metal extracted from the leach pad in a saleable form. These additional costs are considered in the valuation of
inventory.
Reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on legal and
regulatory requirements. Management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as
remediation cost for inactive properties. Such costs related to active mines are accrued and charged over the
expected operating lives of the mines using the units-of-production method.
The estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by our assets and the estimated liabilities for reclamation
and remediation are determined using the Company’s assumptions about future costs, mineral prices, mineral
processing recovery rates, production levels and capital and reclamation costs. Such assumptions are based on the
Company’s current mining plan and the best available information for making such estimates. On an ongoing basis,
management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on
such estimates and assumptions.
Income taxes. The Company computes income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.” SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A
valuation allowance has been provided for the portion of the Company’s net deferred tax assets for which it is more
likely than not that they will not be realized.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state
and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years
through 1999. Federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2007 are subject to examination. The Company’s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There were no
significant accrued interest or penalties at December 31, 2008.

(A) The leach cycle at Rochester requires 5 to 10 years to recover gold and silver contained in the ore. The
Company estimates the ultimate recovery to be approximately 61.5% for silver and 93% for gold. However,
ultimate recoveries will not be known until leaching operations cease which is currently expected to continue
through 2014. Current recovery may vary significantly from ultimate recovery. See Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates — Ore on Leach Pad. In August 2007, mining and crushing activities were terminated
as ore reserves were fully mined.
(B) The Company acquired its interests in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines in May 2005 and September 2005,
respectively.
(C) Units sold at realized metal prices will not match reported metal sales due primarily to the effects on revenues
of mark-to-market adjustments on embedded derivatives in the Company’s provisionally priced sales
contracts.
“Operating Costs per Ounce” and “Cash Costs per Ounce” are calculated by dividing the operating cash costs
and cash costs computed for each of the Company’s mining properties for a specified period by the amount of gold
ounces or silver ounces produced by that property during that same period. Management uses cash operating costs
and cash costs per ounce as key indicators of the profitability of each of its mining properties. Gold and silver are
sold and priced in the world financial markets on a U.S. dollar per ounce basis.
“Cash Operating Costs” and “Cash Costs” are costs directly related to the physical activities of producing
silver and gold, and include mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining and smelting costs,
marketing expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties, in-mine drilling expenditures that are related
to production and other direct costs. Sales of by-product metals are deducted from the above in computing cash
costs. Cash costs exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization, accretion, corporate general and administrative
expense, exploration, interest, and pre-feasibility costs. Cash operating costs include all cash costs except
production taxes and royalties if applicable. Cash costs are calculated and presented using the “Gold Institute
Production Cost Standard” applied consistently for all periods presented.
Total operating costs and cash costs per ounce are a non-GAAP measure and investors are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on it and are urged to read all GAAP accounting disclosures presented in the consolidated
58
financial statements and accompanying footnotes. In addition, see the reconciliation of “cash costs” to production
costs under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs” set forth below.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Costs to GAAP Production Costs
The tables below present reconciliations between non-GAAP cash operating costs per ounce and cash costs per
ounce to production costs applicable to sales including depreciation, depletion and amortization, which is
calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Total cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of
producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining and marketing expense,
on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes, net of by-product revenues earned
from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. Cash operating costs include all cash costs
except production taxes and royalties if applicable. Total cash costs and cash operating costs are performance
measures which we believe provides management and investors with an indication of net cash flow, after
consideration of the realized price received for production sold. Management also uses these measurements for
the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective.
“Cash operating costs per ounce” and “Total cash costs per ounce” are measures developed by precious metals
companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard, however, there can be no assurance that our reporting of
these non-GAAP measures are similar to that reported by other mining companies. Cash operating costs and total
cash cost, as alternative measures, have the limitation of excluding potentially large amounts related to inventory
adjustments, non cash charges and by product credits. Management compensates for this limitation by using both
GAAP production costs and non-GAAP cash costs metrics in its planning.
Production costs applicable to sales including depreciation, depletion and amortization, is the most compa-
rable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP to total cash costs. The sum of the production costs
applicable to sales and depreciation, depletion and amortization for our mines as set forth in the tables below is
included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

(1) The Company’s share of silver production at Endeavor and Broken Hill commenced in May 2005 and
September 2005, respectively.
(2) By-product credits are based upon production units and the period’s average metal price for purposes of
reporting cash costs per ounce.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007
Revenues
Sales of metal from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $25.9 million, or
12.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2007 to $189.5 million. The decrease in sales of metal was primarily due
to a decrease in the quantity of gold ounces sold during 2008, partially offset by increased metal prices realized in
2008 compared to 2007. In 2008, the Company sold 11.0 million ounces of silver and 49,130 ounces of gold,
compared to sales of 11.5 million ounces of silver and 94,284 ounces of gold in 2007. In the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company realized average silver and gold prices of $14.31 per ounce and $915 per ounce,
respectively, compared with realized average prices of $13.59 per ounce and $700 per ounce, respectively, in the
prior year.
Included in revenues is by-product metal sales consisting of gold. In 2008, by-product revenues totaled
$58.6 million compared to $64.4 million in 2007. The decrease in by-product revenues is due to a decrease in the
quantity of gold sold in 2008 partially offset by an increase in the realized prices of gold. The Company believes that
presentation of these revenue streams as by-products from its current operations will continue to be appropriate in
the future.
In the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company produced a total of 12.0 million ounces of silver and
46,115 ounces of gold compared to 11.5 million ounces of silver and 92,014 ounces of gold in 2007. The increase in
silver production in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to the commencement of production activities at
the San Bartolomé mine, offset by lower silver production from the Rochester, Cerro Bayo and Broken Hill mines.
61
Costs and Expenses
Production costs applicable to sales from continuing operations for the year ended 2008 decreased by
$7.7 million, or 6.6%, from the same period of 2007 to $109.3 million. The decrease in production costs applicable
to sales for the year is primarily the result of $18.1 million lower production costs at the Rochester mine primarily
due to the increase in estimated recoverable silver ounces contained in the heap inventory at the Rochester mine.
Production costs also declined by $7.7 million primarily due to the temporary suspension of activities at Cerro Bayo
due to uneconomical total production costs and a decision to conserve existing reserves and focus on exploration
and development of new discoveries. These decreases were partially offset by a $17.7 million increase in operating
costs due to commencement of operations at the San Bartolomé mine.
Depreciation and amortization increased in the year ended December 31, 2008 by $6.3 million, or 30.2%, over
the prior year, primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion expense from the San Bartolomé mine which
began operations at the end of June 2008.
Administrative and general expenses increased $2.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to
increased costs associated with the Company’s audit and tax services and other corporate expenses.
Exploration expenses increased by $8.6 million or 71.9% in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of increased
exploration activities primarily due to the addition of the Palmarejo project.
A total of $17.0 of pre-development costs at the Palmarejo project were recorded as expenses during 2008. The
Company completed its final feasibility study for the Palmarejo project on June 10, 2008 and commenced
capitalizing its mine development expenses for the remainder of 2008. No pre-development expenses were recorded
during the year ended 2007.
A total of $3.2 million of idle facility expenses were incurred at the Cerro Bayo Mine due to the temporary
suspension of operating activities. No idle facility expenses were recorded during the year-ended 2007.
Litigation settlement expenses decreased by $0.5 million in 2008. During the first quarter of 2007, the
Company accrued the remaining $0.5 million royalty to the U.S. Government called for under the May, 2001
settlement agreement relating to the Federal National Resource action commenced against the Company in March
1996. The final payment was made early in the second quarter of 2007. No litigation settlement expenses were
recorded during 2008.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest and other income in the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $15.6 million, or 85.9%
compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower levels of invested cash
and short-term investments as a result of construction activities at the Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington
projects and lower interest rates earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Unrealized gains (loss) on derivative instruments in the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by
$1.8 million, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due to mark to market
adjustments related to the Gold Lease Facility, conversion option and warrant of the Senior Secured Floating
Convertible Notes. No unrealized gains (loss) on derivative instruments were recorded during 2007.
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $4.1 million in 2008 compared to $0.4 million in 2007. The
increase in interest expense is related to the issuance of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes, 31⁄4%
Convertible Senior Notes, Gold Lease Facility and other short term borrowing and capital lease obligations.
Capitalized interest was $12.2 million in 2008 compared to $2.3 million in 2007.

$(14,927)
In 2008, the Company recognized a current provision in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company accrued
foreign withholding taxes of approximately $1.5 million on inter-company transactions between the U.S. parent and
subsidiaries operating in Mexico, Argentina and Australia. The Company recognized a $23.4 million net deferred
tax benefit for the recognition of deferred taxes on deductible temporary differences and net operating loss
carryforwards in various jurisdictions (principally Mexico). The Company recognized a $2.5 million deferred tax
provision in Bolivia for inflationary adjustments on non-monetary assets and unrealized foreign exchange gains on
U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in Bolivia.
In 2007, due to higher metal prices, the Company recognized a current provision in the U.S. and all foreign
operating jurisdictions. The Company accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $0.9 million on interest
payable on inter-company loans from the U.S. Parent to the Argentina and Australia subsidiaries. The Company
recognized a $2.2 million deferred tax provision in foreign jurisdictions for the recognition of the benefit of tax loss
carryforwards in Chile net of the recognition of deferred taxes on taxable temporary differences in Argentina and
Australia. During 2007, the Company recorded $1.1 million in income tax provisions resulting from its assessment
of prior period tax contingencies across its various tax jurisdictions in accordance with FIN 48.
Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006
Revenues
Sales of metal from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased by $1.3 million, or
1%, from the year ended December 31, 2006 to $215.3 million. The decrease in sales of metal was primarily due to a
decrease in the quantity of silver and gold ounces sold during 2007, partially offset by increased metal prices
realized. In 2007, the Company sold 11.6 million ounces of silver and 94,284 ounces of gold, compared to sales of
12.8 million ounces of silver and 116,400 ounces of gold in 2006. In the year ended December 31, 2007, the
Company realized average silver and gold prices of $13.59 and $700, respectively, compared with realized average
prices of $12.03 and $623, respectively, in the prior year.
63
Included in revenues is the by-product revenue associated with by-product metal sales consisting of gold. In
2007, by-product revenues totaled $64.4 million compared to $68.8 million in 2006. The decrease is due to a
decrease in the quantity of gold sold in 2007. The Company believes, based on the best estimates, that presentation
of these revenue streams as by-products from its current operations will continue to be appropriate in the future.
In the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company produced a total of 11.5 million ounces of silver and
92,014 ounces of gold compared to 12.8 million ounces of silver and 116,254 ounces of gold in 2006. The decrease
in silver production in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to decreased production at the Rochester,
Cerro Bayo and Broken Hill mines in 2007 as compared to 2006.
Costs and Expenses
Production costs applicable to sales from continuing operations for the year ended 2007 increased by
$24.6 million, or 26.7%, from the same period of 2006 to $117.0 million.
The increase in production costs applicable to sales for the year is primarily the result of higher costs per ounce
allocated with the drawdown of heap leach inventory associated with historic ore production, which is recognized as
expense as ounces are recovered from the leaching process and sold. In addition, the increase in production costs is
attributable to higher costs of labor, fuel, power and other consumables at the Company’s other mine operations. In
addition, during 2007, the Rochester mine recorded a $1.5 million expense associated with the cessation of mining
and crushing activities and a $1.0 million expense associated with early termination of employees employed in
mining and crushing activities.
Depreciation and amortization decreased in the year ended December 31, 2007 by $5.8 million, or 21.6%, over
the prior year, primarily due to decreased depreciation and depletion expense attributable to the Rochester mine due
to the cessation of mining and crushing activities in August of 2007.
Administrative and general expenses increased $4.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to
compensation costs associated with the Company’s annual incentive plan, business development activities related to
the Bolnisi and Palmarejo acquisition and increases in other corporate expenses.
Total exploration expenses were $11.9 million in 2007 compared to $9.5 million in 2006.
Litigation settlement expenses decreased by $1.9 million in 2007 to $0.5 million. During 2006, the Company
commenced payments pursuant to the Federal Natural Resource Settlement Decree dated May 14, 2001. Under the
terms of the settlement, the Company was required to pay royalties on all of its domestic and foreign operating
properties, up to a cumulative maximum of $3.0 million, amounting to a 2% net smelter royalty on silver production
if the price of silver exceeds $6.50 per ounce, and a $5.00 per ounce royalty on gold production if the price of gold
exceeds $325 per ounce. The royalty payment obligation commenced on May 14, 2006 and expires after May 14,
2021. The Company made its final payment to the U.S. government called for under the settlement agreement in the
first quarter of 2007.
Other Income and Expenses
Interest and other income in the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased by $0.5 million compared with the
year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of assets of
$1.9 million offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower levels of cash and short-term investments and lower
interest rates earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
64
Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately
$14.9 million compared to $8.2 million in 2006. The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s
income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:

In 2007, due to higher metal prices, the Company recognized a current provision in the U.S. and all foreign
operating jurisdictions. Further, the Company accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $0.9 million on
interest payable on inter-company loans from the U.S. Parent to the Argentina and Australia subsidiaries. Finally,
the Company recognized a $2.2 million deferred tax provision in foreign jurisdictions for the recognition of the
benefit of tax loss carryforwards in Chile net of the recognition of deferred taxes on taxable temporary differences in
Argentina and Australia. During 2007, the Company recorded $1.1 million in income tax provision resulting from
its assessment of prior period tax contingencies across its various tax jurisdictions in connection with the adoption
of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.
In 2006, due to significantly higher metals prices, additional proven and probable reserves, and a full year of
operation in Australia, the Company recognized a current provision in the U.S. and all foreign operating
jurisdictions. Further, the Company accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $0.7 million on interest
payable on inter-company loans from the U.S. Parent to the Argentina and Australia subsidiaries. Finally, the
Company recognized an additional $2.9 million deferred tax benefit in Chile as anticipated metals prices and
projections of future pre-tax income are sufficient to utilize the remaining net operating loss carry-forwards in
Chile.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital; Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2008 decreased by $160.9 million to a deficit of approx-
imately $8.5 million compared to positive working capital of approximately $152.4 million at December 31, 2007.
Approximately $340.0 million of this decrease in working capital was attributed to capital spending related to the
Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington projects, approximately $36.8 million relates to the December 31, 2008
fair value of the warrant and conversion option associated with the floating rate securities. This was partially offset
by the proceeds received from the issuance of notes and an increase in net proceeds from the sale of investments.
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.95 to 1 at December 31, 2008 compared to 2.4 to 1 at
December 31, 2007.
65
Net cash used in operating activities in 2008 was $7.4 million compared with net cash provided by operating
activities of $40.1 million in 2007 and $91.2 million in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities consist of the

A total of $326.2 million was used in investing activities in 2008 compared to $211.5 million used in 2007. The
increase of $114.8 million used in investing activities is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related
to the construction activities at the Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington projects partially offset by net
proceeds from sales of short-term investments.
The Company’s financing activities provided $255.7 million of cash during 2008 compared to net cash used in
financing activities of $0.6 million in 2007. The increase is due to cash proceeds from the issuance on March 18,
2008 of the Company’s 31⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 in the aggregate amount of $230 million, the
issuance on October 20, 2008 of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes in the aggregate amount of
$50 million and the cash proceeds on December 18, 2008 of $20 million related to the Gold Lease Facility. This was
partially offset by the repayment of a credit facility, long-term debt and capital lease obligation of approximately
$32.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $77.9 million in 2008 compared to a decrease of
$172.0 million in 2007.
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $28.6 million.
Since year-end, the Company has received approximately $95.4 million of cash proceeds consisting of $20.4 million
from the exercise of a warrant relating to the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes it issued in October of
2008 and a gold royalty stream transaction with Franco-Nevada Corporation under which Franco-Nevada pur-
chased 50% of the life of mine gold to be produced by Coeur from its Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico. See
Note U — Subsequent Events — in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. As of
January 31, 2009, the Company estimates its cash balance was approximately $100 million.
The Company believes this liquidity, combined with cash flow from existing operations during the year, will be
adequate to meet its operating obligations during the next twelve months. The Company plans to invest approx-
imately $136 million in capital activities in 2009 to complete construction of Palmarejo and for sustaining capital
investments at its existing operations. This estimate of capital expenditures excludes projected 2009 capital
expenditures at the Kensington property, for which the Company will update capital cost and timetable estimates
once it receives a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” on page 44.
The Company may elect to defer some capital investment activities or to secure additional capital to ensure it
maintains sufficient liquidity. In addition, if the Company decides to pursue the acquisition of additional mineral
interests, new capital projects, or acquisitions of new properties, mines or companies, additional financing activities
may be necessary. There can be no assurances that such financing will be available when or if needed upon
acceptable terms, or at all, when or if needed.
Acquisitions of Bolnisi and Palmarejo
On December 21, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the shares of Bolnisi Gold NL and
Palmarejo Gold and Silver Corporation in exchange for a total of approximately 272 million shares of Coeur
66
common stock, a total cash payment of approximately $1.1 million and the assumption of liabilities of $0.7 billion.
Coeur issued 0.682 shares of Coeur common stock (or, at the election of the Bolnisi shareholder, CHESS Depositary
Interests representing Coeur shares) and A$0.004 in cash (or approximately US$1.0 million in the aggregate) for
each Bolnisi ordinary share, and 2.715 shares of Coeur common stock and C$0.004 in cash (or approximately US
$0.1 million in the aggregate) for each Palmarejo common share.
Capitalized Expenditures
During 2008, the Company expended $0.6 million at the Rochester mine, $8.2 million at the Cerro Bayo mine,
$4.5 million at the Martha mine, $26.5 million at the Endeavor mine, $0.5 million for corporate and other activities,
$108.7 million for the development of the San Bartolomé project, $40.9 million for construction and development
activities at the Kensington project and $190.3 million at the Palmarejo project. During 2009, the Company plans to
expend approximately $0.7 million for investment activities at the Rochester mine, $0.1 million at Cerro Bayo,
$1.6 million at Martha, $6.8 million at San Bartolomé property, $119.1 million at the Palmarejo development
property and $0.5 million for corporate and other activities. The Company will update its capital expenditures at the
Kensington development property once a decision is received from the U.S. Supreme Court. See “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” on p. 44.
Gold Lease Facility
On December 18, 2008, the Company entered into a $20 million Gold Lease Facility with Mitsubishi
International Corporation (“MIC”). Under the Gold Lease Facility, the Company received proceeds of $20 million
for the sale of 23,529 ounces of gold simultaneously leased from MIC to the Company. The Company has
committed to this number of ounces of gold to MIC over the next twelve months at scheduled delivery dates. The
Company is required to pledge certain collateral including standby letter of credits of $5.5 million and $7.5 million
of metal inventory at our refiners. The Company accounts for the Gold Lease Facility as a derivative instrument and
is recorded in accrued liabilities and other. As of December 31, 2008, based on the current futures metals prices for
each of the delivery dates, using a 15% discount rate, the fair value of the Gold Lease Facility was $18.8 million.
The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $1.2 million in 2008, which is reflected in earnings as unrealized gains
(losses) in derivatives and other.
Debt and Capital Resources
Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes
On October 20, 2008 the Company completed an offering of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes. The Company also sold to the purchaser a warrant to purchase up
to an addition $25 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day
immediately preceding the maturity date. The conversion price is $1.15 per share. The net proceeds to the Company
were $40.7 million.
The notes bear interest at LIBOR plus 7.50% per year, provided that in no event will the annual rate be less than
9.00% or more than 12.00%. As of December 31, 2008 the interest rate was 12%. Interest is payable, at the
Company’s option, in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. The notes are the
Company’s senior secured obligations, ranking equally with all existing and future senior obligations and ranking
senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and are secured by certain assets of the Company’s
Coeur Rochester, Inc. subsidiary. See Note O — Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments — in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the
derivative features of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes.
31⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes
On March 18, 2008, the Company completed an offering of $230 million in aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due 2028. The notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 31⁄4% per year, payable on
67
March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2008. The notes mature on March 15, 2028,
unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by the Company.
Each holder of the notes may require that the Company repurchase some or all of the holder’s notes on
March 15, 2013, March 15, 2015, March 15, 2018 and March 15, 2023 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, shares of common stock
or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election. Holders will also have the right,
following certain fundamental change transactions, to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their
notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem the notes for cash in whole or in part at any time on or after
March 22, 2015 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The notes provide for “net share settlement” of any conversions. Pursuant to this feature, upon conversion of
the notes, the Company (1) will pay the note holder an amount in cash equal to the lesser of the conversion
obligation or the principal amount of the notes, and (2) will settle any excess of the conversion obligation above the
notes’ principal amount in the Company’s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election.
The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances, at the holder’s option, at an initial conversion rate of
176.0254 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $5.68 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances.
The fair value of the 31⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes as determined by market transactions on December 31,
2008 was $74.5 million.
11⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes
The $180.0 million principal amount of 11⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes due January 2024 outstanding at
December 31, 2008 are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder on January 15, 2011,
2014, and 2019, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $7.60 per share, subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances.
The Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments. The notes are redeemable at the option of the
Company before January 18, 2011, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock over a specified number of
trading days has exceeded 150% of the conversion price, and anytime thereafter. Before January 18, 2011, the
redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus an amount equal to 8.75% of the
principal amount of the notes, less the amount of any interest actually paid on the notes on or prior to the redemption
date. The notes are due on January 15, 2024.
Each holder of the notes may require that the Company repurchase some or all of the holder’s notes on
January 15, 2011, January 15, 2014 and January 15, 2019 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, shares of common stock or a
combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election. Holders will also have the right,
following certain fundamental change transactions, to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their
notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest.
The fair value of the notes as determined by market transactions on December 31, 2008 and 2007 was
$54.0 million and $156.6 million, respectively.
Bank Loans
During 2008, the Company received short-term borrowings from Banco Bisa and Banco de Credito de Bolivia
for an amount of $3.0 million to fund working capital requirements. The short-term borrowings bear interest rates
between 8.5% and 10.1% and expire between April and June 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into several temporary credit lines in the amount of
$3.5 million with the Standard Bank of Argentina secured by a stand by letter of credit to fund working capital
68
requirements. The credit lines bear interest rates of 7.25% to 9.85% and expire at various dates in 2009 on or before
June 30, 2009.
Palmarejo had an amended temporary credit facility of $2.0 million secured by the Company’s investments in
asset backed commercial paper, to fund working capital requirements. On June 3, 2008, the Company paid off the
outstanding balance on the credit facility.
Cost Reduction Plan
In October 2008, Coeur implemented a cost reduction plan designed to reduce non-operating costs by
$10 million, or approximately 40%, annually. The results of these efforts were reflected in the fourth quarter of 2008
with general and administrative expenses declining 22.0%, or $1.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
In addition, operating activities at the Cerro Bayo mine were temporarily suspended and construction activities were
curtailed at Kensington until a decision is made by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Issuances of Common Stock
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company completed a public offering of 27.6 million shares of common
stock at a public offering price of $5.60 per share. The Company realized net proceeds of $146.2 million after
payment of the underwriters’ discount and other offering costs. Offering costs incurred were $8.3 million.

(1) On October 20, 2008 the Company completed an offering of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes. The Company also sold to the purchaser a warrant to purchase
up to an addition $25 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business
day immediately preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion price is $1.15 per share. The net proceeds
69
to the Company were $40.7 million. The notes bear interest at LIBOR plus 7.50% per year, provided that in no
event will the annual rate be less than 9.00% or more than 12.00%. Interest is payable, at the Company’s option,
in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. The notes are the Company’s senior
secured obligations, ranking equally with all existing and future senior obligations and ranking senior to all
existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and are secured by certain assets of the Company’s Coeur
Rochester, Inc. subsidiary. See Note O — Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments — in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a discussion of
the derivative features of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes.
On March 18, 2008, the Company completed an offering of $230 million in aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due 2028. The notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 31⁄4% per year, payable
on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2008. The notes mature on March 15,
2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by the Company. Each holder of the notes may require
that the Company repurchase some or all of the holder’s notes on March 15, 2013, March 15, 2015, March 15,
2018 and March 15, 2023 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and
shares of common stock, at the Company’s election. Holders will also have the right, following certain
fundamental change transactions, to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes for cash at
a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid
interest. The Company may redeem the notes for cash in whole or in part at any time on or after March 22, 2015
at 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes provide
for “net share settlement” of any conversions. Pursuant to this feature, upon conversion of the notes, the
Company (1) will pay the note holder an amount in cash equal to the lesser of the conversion obligation or the
principal amount of the notes, and (2) will settle any excess of the conversion obligation above the notes’
principal amount in the Company’s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election.
The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances, at the holder’s option, at an initial conversion rate of
176.0254 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $5.68 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances.
The $180.0 million principal amount of 11⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 outstanding at December 31,
2008 are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder on January 15, 2011, 2014 and
2019 unless previously redeemed at a conversion rate of approximately 131.5789 shares of Coeur common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, representing a conversion price of $7.60 per share, subject to
adjustment in certain events.
The Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments. The Debentures are redeemable at the option
of the Company before January 18, 2011, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock over a specified
number of trading days has exceeded 150% of the conversion price, and anytime thereafter. The Debentures
have no other funding requirements until maturity on January 15, 2024.
(2) The Company has entered into various capital lease agreements for commitments principally over the next year.
(3) Reclamation and mine closure amounts represent the Company’s estimate of the cash flows associated with its
legal obligation to reclaim and remediate mining properties. This amount will decrease as reclamation and
remediation work is completed. Amounts shown on table are undiscounted.
(4) Severance amounts represent a termination benefit program at the Rochester mine as the mine approaches the
end of mine life and accrued benefits for government mandated severance at the Cerro Bayo mine and
San Bartolomé project.
(5) Purchased obligation for the Kensington property in Alaska.
Risk Factors; Forward-Looking Statements
For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the
Company’s business, securities, financial condition or operating results, reference is made to the disclosure set forth
under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” above. In addition, because the preceding discussion includes numerous forward-
looking statements relating to the Company, its results of operations and financial condition and business, reference
70
is made to the information set forth above in “Item 1. Business — Important Factors Relating to Forward-Looking
Statements.”
Environmental Compliance Expenditures
For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company expended $8.6 million, $5.2 million
and $5.6 million, respectively, in connection with routine environmental compliance activities at its operating
properties. Such activities include monitoring, earth moving, water treatment and re-vegetation activities.
The Company estimates that environmental compliance expenditures during 2009 will be approximately
$5.5 million to obtain permit modifications and other regulatory authorizations. Future environmental expenditures
will be determined by governmental regulations and the overall scope of the Company’s operating and development
activities. The Company places a very high priority on its compliance with environmental regulations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1 “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (the “FSP”). The FSP applies to convertible
debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including
partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a
derivative under FASB Statement No. 133. The FSP requires that the liability and equity components of convertible
debt instruments within the scope of the FSP be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity’s
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the
liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the
principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component is reported as a debt
discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument’s expected life using the effective interest
method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied
retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this
statement.
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”) which provides revised guidance
for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and
the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged
items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the
Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of
adopting this statement on the Company’s derivative instrument disclosures.
In February 2008, the FASB staff issued Staff Position No. 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
(“FSP FAS 157-2”). FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). The provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 are effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (fair value option) with
changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Company already records marketable securities at fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and derivative
71
instruments and hedging activities at fair value in accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS 133). The adoption of SFAS 159 had no impact on
the financial statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments or
other assets and liabilities.
On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) as it
relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. This standard is now the single source in GAAP for the definition of fair value, except for the fair value of
leased property as defined in SFAS 13. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable
inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best
information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad
levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that
tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 were effective beginning January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have
a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to various market risks as a part of its operations. In an effort to mitigate losses
associated with these risks, the Company may, at times, enter into derivative financial instruments. These may take
the form of forward sales contracts, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The Company does
not actively engage in the practice of trading derivative instruments for profit. This discussion of the Company’s
market risk assessments contains “forward looking statements” that contain risks and uncertainties. Actual results
and actions could differ materially from those discussed below.
The Company’s operating results are substantially dependent upon the world market prices of silver and gold.
The Company has no control over silver and gold prices, which can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous
factors, such as supply and demand and investor sentiment. In order to mitigate some of the risk associated with
these fluctuations, the Company will at times enter into forward sale contracts. The Company continually evaluates
the potential benefits of engaging in these strategies based on current market conditions. The Company may be
exposed to nonperformance by counterparties as a result of its hedging activities. This exposure would be limited to
the amount that the spot price of the metal falls short of the contract price. The Company has historically sold silver
and gold produced by our mines pursuant to forward contracts and at spot prices prevailing at the time of sale. Since
1999, the Company has not engaged in any silver hedging activities and is currently not engaged in any gold
hedging activities.
The Company enters into concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters. The contracts, in general,
provide for a provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices. The provisionally priced
sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale.
The embedded derivative, which is the final settlement price based on a future price, does not qualify for hedge
accounting. These embedded derivatives are recorded as derivative assets (in Prepaid expenses and other), or
derivative liabilities (in Accrued liabilities and other), on the balance sheet and are adjusted to fair value through
earnings each period until the date of final settlement.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $33.2 million consisting of
2.2 million ounces of silver and 8,388 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $32.1 million
72
including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary
(plus or minus) approximately $22,000 and for each one dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue
would vary (plus or minus) approximately $8,000.
The Company operates, or has mining interests, in several foreign countries, specifically Australia, Bolivia,
Chile, Mexico and Argentina, which exposes it to risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the
currencies involved. As part of its program to manage foreign currency risk, the Company enters into, from time to
time, foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts enable the Company to purchase a fixed amount
of foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are related to firm commitments are
designated and effective as hedges and are deferred and recognized in the same period as the related transaction. All
other contracts that do not qualify as hedges are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in
income. The Company continually evaluates the potential benefits of entering into these contracts to mitigate
foreign currency risk and proceeds when it believes that the exchange rates are most beneficial. During 2008, the
Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign exchange risk associated
with forecasted Mexican peso and Argentine peso operating costs at its Palmarejo project and Martha mine,
respectively. During 2007 and 2006, the Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to
reduce the foreign exchange risk associated with the forecasted Chilean peso operating costs for 2008 and 2007 at
its Cerro Bayo mine.
The Mexican peso contracts require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Mexican pesos at a weighted
average exchange rate of 13.57 pesos to each U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2008, the Company had Mexican peso
foreign exchange contracts of $22.4 million in U.S. dollars. These contracts had a fair value of $2.0 million at
December 31, 2008.
The Argentine peso contracts require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Argentine pesos at a weighted
average exchange rate of 4.03 pesos to each U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2008, the Company had Argentine peso
foreign exchange contracts of $12.9 million in U.S. dollars. These contracts had a fair value of $1.5 million at
December 31, 2008.
The Chilean peso contracts entered into in 2007 require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Chilean
pesos at a weighted average exchange rate of 503 pesos to each U.S. dollar. There were no outstanding contracts at
December 31, 2008.
On December 18, 2008, the Company entered into a $20 million Gold Lease Facility with Mitsubishi
International Corporation (“MIC”). Under the Gold Lease Facility, the Company received proceeds of $20 million
for the sale of 23,529 ounces of gold simultaneously leased from MIC to the Company. The Company has
committed to this number of ounces of gold to MIC over the next twelve months at scheduled delivery dates. The
Company is required to pledge certain collateral including standby letter of credits of $5.5 million and $7.5 million
of metal inventory at our refiners. The Company accounts for the Gold Lease Facility as a derivative instrument and
is recorded in accrued liabilities and other. As of December 31, 2008, based on the current futures metals prices for
each of the delivery dates, using a 15% discount rate, the fair value of the Gold Lease Facility was $18.8 million.
The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $1.2 million in 2008, which is reflected in earnings as unrealized gains
(losses) in derivatives and other.
The fair value of the Company’s 31⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes and 11⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes at
December 31, 2008 was $74.5 million and $54.0 million respectively. The fair value was estimated based upon bond
market closing prices near the balance sheet date.
On October 20, 2008, the Company completed an offering of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes, realizing net proceeds of $40.2 million after deducting $0.5 mil-
lion of issuance costs. The purchaser also received warrants to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible notes for $20 million. Upon exercising the conversion option, the holder receives
common stock of the Company at an initial conversion rate of 869.5652, plus an additional payment in common
stock or cash, at the election of the Company, representing the value of the interest that would be earned on the notes
through the earlier of the fourth anniversary of the conversion date or October 15, 2013, at the interest rate
applicable on the conversion date. The conversion option is considered an embedded derivative that is required to be
73
separated from the host debt contract for accounting purposes. The warrants are also considered derivative
instruments. These derivatives are recorded in accrued liabilities and other on the balance sheet and are adjusted to
fair value through earnings. At the issuance date, because the combined fair value of the conversion option and the
warrants exceeded the net proceeds, the notes were recorded with a full original issue discount. The amount by
which the fair value of the conversion option and warrants exceeded the proceeds received, or $10.0 million, was
recorded as a loss upon issuance and is included in unrealized gains (loss) on derivatives and other in the
consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of the conversion option and warrants were $32.2 million and
$18.5 million, respectively, at the issuance date and $21.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, at December 31,
2008.
As of December 31, 2008, $12.4 million of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes had been
converted into 15.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The financial statements required hereunder and contained herein are listed under “Item 15. Exhibits,
Financial Statement Schedules” below.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by it in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and
forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Based on an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures conducted by the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, such officers concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31,
2008.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 defines internal control over financial reporting
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that:
(cid:129) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(cid:129) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and
(cid:129) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.
74
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based upon those criteria.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, have audited in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by COSO, and its report dated March 2, 2009, which is included in this Form 10-K immediately
preceding the Company’s audited financial statements, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.
(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

ment is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008,
and our report dated March 2, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
NOTE A — BUSINESS OF COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION
Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Coeur” or the “Company”) is principally
engaged in silver and gold mining and related activities including exploration, development, and mining at its
properties located in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), the United States (Nevada and Alaska),
Australia (New South Wales) and Mexico (Chihuahua).
NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the wholly-owned subsidiaries of
the Company, the most significant of which are Empressa Minera Manquiri S.A., Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V.
(formerly Planet Gold S.A. de C.V.), Coeur Rochester, Inc., Coeur Argentina, CDE Australia Pty Ltd., Coeur
Alaska, Inc., and CDE Cerro Bayo Ltd. The consolidated financial statements also include all entities in which
voting control of more than 50% is held by the Company. The Company has no investments in entities in which it
has greater than 50% ownership interest accounted for using the equity method. Intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in corporate joint ventures where the Company has
ownership of 50% or less and funds its proportionate share of expenses are accounted for under the equity method.
The Company has no investments in entities in which it has a greater than 20% ownership interest accounted for
using the cost method.
Revenue Recognition: Pursuant to guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition for Financial Statements”, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, no obligations remain and collectability is probable. The
passing of title to the customer is based on the terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined at the point
revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets, for example the London Bullion
Market for both gold and silver, in an identical form to the product sold.
Under our concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters, final gold and silver prices are set on a
specified future quotational period, typically one to three months, after the shipment date based on market metal
prices. Revenues and production costs applicable to sales are recorded on a gross basis under these contracts at the
time title passes to the buyer based on the forward price for the expected settlement period. The contracts, in
general, provide for a provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices. Final settlement
is based on the average applicable price for a specified future period, and generally occurs from three to six months
after shipment. Final sales are settled using smelter weights, settlement assays (average of assays exchanged and/or
umpire assay results) and are priced as specified in the smelter contract. The Company’s provisionally priced sales
contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The
host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates measured at the forward price at the time of sale. The
embedded derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting. The embedded derivative is recorded as a derivative
asset, in prepaid expenses and other assets, or as a derivative liability in accrued liabilities and other on the balance
sheet and is adjusted to fair value through revenue each period until the date of final gold and silver settlement. The
form of the material being sold, after deduction for smelting and refining is in an identical form to that sold on the
London Bullion Market. The forms of the Company’s products are as metal in flotation concentrate and doré
bullion, which is the final process for which the Company is responsible.
The effects of forward sales contracts are reflected in revenue at the date the related precious metals are
delivered or the contracts expire. Third-party smelting and refining costs of $9.5 million, $8.4 million and
$9.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $33.2 million consisting of
2.2 million ounces of silver and 8,388 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $32.1 million
including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
(plus or minus) approximately $22,000 and for each one dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue
would vary (plus or minus) approximately $8,000. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding
provisionally priced sales of $61.2 million consisting of 3.3 million ounces of silver and 20,775 ounces of gold,
which had a fair value of approximately $63.8 million including the embedded derivative. For each one cent per
ounce change in realized silver price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $33,000 and for each one
dollar per ounce change in realized gold price, revenue would vary (plus or minus) approximately $21,000.
Short-term Investments: Short-term investments principally consist of highly-liquid United States, foreign
government and corporate securities; all are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with
maturities that range from three months to forty years. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Any
decline in market value considered to be other than temporary is recognized in determining net income (loss).
Realized gains and losses from the sale of these investments are included in determining net income (loss).
Ore on Leach Pad: The heap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an
impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold,
which are then recovered in metallurgical processes. In August 2007, the Company ceased mining and crushing
operations at the Rochester mine as ore reserves were fully mined. Residual heap leach activities are expected to
continue through 2014.
The Company used several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed on the
leach pads. As the ore body was drilled in preparation for the blasting process, samples were taken of the drill
residue which is assayed to determine estimated quantities of contained metal. The Company estimated the quantity
of ore by utilizing global positioning satellite survey techniques. The Company then processed the ore through
crushing facilities where the output was again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation
with the data collected from the mining operation was completed with appropriate adjustments made to previous
estimates. The crushed ore was then transported to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the
leach solution is collected from the leach pads, it is continuously sampled for assaying. The quantity of leach
solution is measured by flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, the
product is converted to dorè, which is the final product produced by the mine. The inventory is stated at lower of cost
or market, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method.
The Company reported ore on the leach pads of $30.2 million as of December 31, 2008. Of this amount,
$9.2 million is reported as a current asset and $21.0 million is reported as a non-current asset. The distinction
between current and non-current is based upon the expected length of time necessary for the leaching process to
remove the metals from the broken ore. The historical cost of the metal that is expected to be extracted within twelve
months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained within the broken ore that will be extracted
beyond twelve months is classified as non-current. Inventories of ore on leach pad are valued based on actual
production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad, adjusted for effects on monthly production of
costs of abnormal production levels, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process.
The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time and the quantity of metal that may be extracted
relative to the time the leach process occurs requires the use of estimates which are inherently inaccurate since they
rely upon laboratory testwork. Testwork consists of 60 day leach columns from which the Company projects metal
recoveries up to five years in the future. The quantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights
and assay analysis. The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon
laboratory column tests and actual experience occurring over approximately twenty years of leach pad operations at
the Rochester Mine. The assumptions used by the Company to measure metal content during each stage of the
inventory conversion process includes estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. The
Company periodically reviews its estimates compared to actual experience and revises its estimates when
appropriate. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company increased its estimated silver ounces contained in
F-10
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
the heap inventory by approximately 5.4 million ounces. The increase in estimated silver ounces contained in the
heap inventory is due to changes in estimated silver recoveries anticipated over the remainder of the residual
leaching phase. There were no changes in estimated recoveries related to gold contained in the heap. Consequently,
the Company believes its current residual heap leach activities are expected to continue through 2014. The ultimate
recovery will not be known until leaching operations cease.
Metal and Other Inventory: Inventories include concentrate ore, dorè, ore in stockpiles and operating materials
and supplies. The classification of inventory is determined by the stage at which the ore is in the production process.
To extent there is work in process inventories at the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines, such amounts are carried as
inventories. Inventories of ore in stock piles are sampled for gold and silver content and are valued based on the
lower of actual costs incurred or estimated net realizable value based upon the period ending prices of gold and
silver. Material that does not contain a minimum quantity of gold and silver to cover estimated processing expense
to recover the contained gold and silver is not classified as inventory and is assigned no value. All inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method. Concentrate
and dorè inventory includes product at the mine site and product held by refineries and are also valued at the lower of
cost or market value. Concentrate inventories associated with the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines are held by third
parties. Metal inventory costs include direct labor, materials, depreciation, depletion and amortization as well as
administrative overhead costs relating to mining activities.
Property, Plant, and Equipment: Expenditures for new facilities, assets acquired pursuant to capital leases, new
assets or expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities are capitalized and depreciated using the
straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the shorter of estimated productive lives of such
facilities or the useful life of the individual assets. Productive lives range from 7 to 31 years for buildings and
improvements, 3 to 13 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 7 years for furniture and fixtures. Certain mining
equipment is depreciated using the units-of-production method based upon estimated total proven and probable
reserves. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Operational Mining Properties and Mine Development: Capitalization of mine development costs that meet
the definition of an asset begins once all operating permits have been secured, mineralization is classified as proven
and probable reserves and a final feasibility study has been completed. Mine development costs include engineering
and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body, the removal of overburden to
initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways, shafts, lateral access, drifts,
ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines. Costs incurred during the start-up phase of a mine are
expensed as incurred. Costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are
expensed and classified as Exploration or Pre-development expense. All capitalized costs are amortized using the
units of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on recoverable ounces to be mined from
proven and probable reserves. Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to
construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Gains or losses from sales or
retirements of assets are included in other income or expense.
Drilling and related costs incurred at our operating mines are expensed as incurred as exploration expense,
unless we can conclude with a high degree of confidence, prior to the commencement of a drilling program, that the
drilling costs will result in the conversion of a mineral resource into proven and probable reserves. Our assessment is
based on the following factors: results from previous drill programs; results from geological models; results from a
mine scoping study confirming economic viability of the resource; and preliminary estimates of mine inventory, ore
grade, cash flow and mine life. In addition, the Company must have all permitting and/or contractual requirements
necessary to have the right to and/or control of the future benefit from the targeted ore body. The costs of a drilling
program that meet these criteria are capitalized as mine development costs. All other drilling and related costs,
including those beyond the boundaries of the development and production stage properties, are expensed as
incurred.
F-11
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
Drilling and related costs of approximately $3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008
and December 31, 2007, met the criteria for capitalization listed above at our properties that are in the development
and production stages.
The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the
production phase are referred to as “pre-stripping costs.” Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development
of an open pit mine. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that
are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in production costs applicable to sales in the same period
as the revenue from the sale of inventory.
Mineral Interests: Significant payments related to the acquisition of land and mineral rights are capitalized as
incurred. Prior to acquiring such land or mineral rights, the Company generally makes a preliminary evaluation to
determine that the property has significant potential to develop an economic ore body. The time between initial
acquisition and full evaluation of a property’s potential is variable and is determined by many factors including:
location relative to existing infrastructure, the property’s stage of development, geological controls and metal
prices. If a mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are amortized when production begins using the units-of-
production method based on recoverable ounces to be mined from proven and probable reserves. If no mineable ore
body is discovered, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future
economic value. The Company amortizes its mineral interests in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines using the
units of production method.
Asset Impairment: The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” to evaluate the recoverability of its assets.
Management reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances
indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if
total estimated future cash flows or probability-weighted cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the
carrying amount of the assets, including property plant and equipment, mineral property, development property, and
any deferred costs. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the difference between book value and
discounted estimated future cash flows or the application of an expected present value technique to estimate fair
value in the absence of a market price. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold and silver
prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and capital, all
based on life-of-mine plans and projections. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks
and uncertainties. If the assets are impaired, a calculation of fair value is performed and if the fair value is lower than
the carrying value of the assets, the assets are reduced to their fair market value. Any differences between significant
assumptions and market conditions and/or the Company’s operating performance could have a material effect on
the Company’s determination of ore reserves, or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets
resulting in impairment charges. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, in
estimating future cash flows, all assets are grouped at a particular mine for which there is identifiable cash flow.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company, under the terms of its lease, self insurance, and bonding
agreements with certain banks, lending institutions and regulatory agencies, is required to collateralize certain
portions of the Company’s obligations. The Company has collateralized these obligations by assigning certificates
of deposit that have maturity dates ranging from three months to a year, to the respective institutions or agency. At
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company held certificates of deposit and cash under these
agreements of $23.1 million and $25.8 million, respectively, restricted for this purpose. The ultimate timing for the
release of the collateralized amounts is primarily dependent on the timing and closure of each mine. In order to
release the collateral, the Company must seek approval from certain government agencies responsible for
monitoring the mine closure status. Collateral could also be released to the extent the Company was able to
secure alternative financial assurance satisfactory to the regulatory agencies. The Company believes there is a
F-12
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
reasonable probability that the collateral will remain in place beyond a twelve-month period and has therefore
classified these investments as long-term. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the Company held certificates of
deposit totaling $8.5 million that were pledged to support letters of credit to Mitsubishi International of $5.5 million
and to Banco de Credito e Inversiones of $3.0 million. These amounts are included in prepaids and other.
Reclamation and Remediation Costs: The Company follows SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and
normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is
depreciated over the life of the asset. An accretion cost, representing the increase over time in the present value of
the liability, is recorded each period in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. As reclamation work is
performed or liabilities are otherwise settled, the recorded amount of the liability is reduced.
Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of
each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred at the site. Such cost estimates include, where
applicable, ongoing care and maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in
the period an estimate is revised.
Foreign Currency: Substantially all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income.
Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (as amended by
SFAS No. 137) and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities.” These Statements require recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value. Appropriate accounting for changes in the fair value of
derivatives held is dependent on whether the derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as an accounting
hedge and on the classification of the hedge transaction.
Stock-based Compensation Plans: Effective January 1, 2006, the Company began recording compensation
expense associated with awards of equity instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment.” The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under SFAS No. 123(R),
and, consequently, has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this transition method,
compensation cost associated with awards of equity instruments recognized includes: 1) amortization related to
the remaining unvested portion of all awards granted for the fiscal years 1995 to 2005, based on the grant date fair
value, estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation;” and 2) amortization related to all equity instrument awards granted subsequent to December 31,
2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
compensation costs are included in administrative and general expenses, production costs applicable to sales and
the cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment as deemed appropriate.
The Company continues to estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. In addition, the Company estimates the fair value of performance share
grants using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The Company estimates forfeitures of stock-based awards
based on historical data and periodically adjusts the forfeiture rate. The adjustment of the estimated forfeiture rate
will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
Income Taxes: The Company computes income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.” SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and liability approach that results in the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A
valuation allowance has been provided for the portion of the Company’s net deferred tax assets for which it is more
likely than not that they will not be realized.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state
and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years
through 1999. Federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2007 are subject to examination. The Company’s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There were no
significant accrued interest or penalties at December 31, 2008.
Comprehensive Income (loss): Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as changes in
shareholders’ equity that result from transactions and events other than those with shareholders. Items of

Net Income Per Share: The Company follows SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share,” which requires the
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to

For the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, options to purchase 1,440,365, 531,112 and 322,653 shares of
common stock at prices between $3.24 to $7.09, $4.81 to $8.94 and $6.66 to $15.19, respectively, were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price of options was greater than the average market price of
the common shares. The options, which expire between 2009 to 2018, are outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Potentially dilutive shares totaling 23,684,211 attributed to the 11⁄4% Convertible Senior Notes and 8,096,593
attributed to the Senior Secured Floating Convertible Notes have been excluded from the earnings per share
calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008 as their effect was anti-dilutive. The 31⁄4% Convertible Senior
Notes were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because there is no excess value upon conversion over
the principal amount of the Notes.

amounts reported in their consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The areas requiring the use of
management’s estimates and assumptions relate to recoverable ounces from proven and probable reserves that are the
basis of future cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation and amortization calculations; useful lives
utilized for depreciation, depletion and amortization; estimates of future cash flows for long lived assets; estimates of
recoverable gold and silver ounces in ore on leach pad; the amount and timing of reclamation and remediation costs;
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; and estimates of other employee benefit liabilities.
Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2008 the Company
reclassified approximately $142.8 million from non-producing and development properties to operational mining
properties related to the commencement of operations at the San Bartolomé mine.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1 “Accounting for
Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)”
(the “FSP”). The FSP applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or
other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required
to be separately accounted for as a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133. The FSP requires that the liability and
equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of the FSP be separately accounted for in a
manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible
debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component).
The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability
component is reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument’s expected life
using the effective interest method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1,
2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company estimates that approximately
$140.1 million of debt discount will be recorded and the effective interest rate on the Company’s 31⁄4% Convertible
Senior Notes will increase by approximately 7.6 percentage points to 10.8%, including the amortization of the debt
discount.
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”), which provides revised guidance
for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and
the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged
items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the
Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of
adopting this statement on the Company’s derivative instrument disclosures.
In February 2008, the FASB staff issued Staff Position No. 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
(“FSP FAS 157-2”). FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). The provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 are effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159, “The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an
instrument-by-instrument basis (fair value option) with changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Company
already records marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and derivative instruments and hedging activities at fair value in
accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended
F-16
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
(SFAS 133). The adoption of SFAS 159 had no impact on the financial statements as management did not elect the
fair value option for any other financial instruments or other assets and liabilities.
On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) as it
relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. This standard is now the single source in GAAP for the definition of fair value, except for the fair value of
leased property as defined in SFAS 13. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable
inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best
information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad
levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under
SFAS 157 are described below:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;
Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by level
within the fair value hierarchy. As required by SFAS 157, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based
on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. (in thousands):

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
The Company’s marketable equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because
they are valued using quoted market prices. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as the
quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.
The Company’s marketable debt securities, and short-term certificates of deposit and restricted investments
are valued using pricing models which require inputs that are derived from observable market data and as such are
classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s outstanding debentures are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
The Company’s derivative instruments related to the concentrate sales contracts, foreign exchange contracts
and gold lease facility are valued using quoted market prices and other significant observable inputs, including fair
value modeling techniques. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The conversion option, warrants and asset backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) fall within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy because there are no observable market quotes. For these instruments, management uses significant
other observable inputs adjusted for various factors such as valuation models which require a variety of inputs,
including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility and correlation of
such inputs. The Company estimated fair value of the conversion option and warrant using a Monte Carlo
simulation model including extended terms, LIBOR volatilities and correlation of such inputs.

In February 2007, FAS Statement No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities”, (“FAS 159”). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value, with the objective of improving financial reporting value by mitigating volatility in
reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex
hedge accounts provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 were adopted January 1, 2008. The Company did not elect
the Fair Value Option for any of its financial assets or liabilities, and therefore, the adoption of FAS 159 had no
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE C — ACQUISITIONS OF BOLNISI AND PALMAREJO
On December 21, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of all the shares of Bolnisi Gold NL
(“Bolnisi”) and Palmarejo Gold and Silver Corporation (“Palmarejo”) in exchange for a total of approximately
272 million shares of Coeur common stock, a total cash payment of approximately $1.1 million and assumption of
liabilities of $0.7 billion. Coeur issued 0.682 shares of Coeur common stock (or, at the election of the Bolnisi
shareholder, CHESS Depositary Interests representing Coeur shares) and A$0.004 in cash (or approximately
US$1.0 million in the aggregate) for each Bolnisi ordinary share, and 2.715 shares of Coeur common stock and
C$0.004 in cash (or approximately US$0.1 million in the aggregate) for each Palmarejo common share. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets and not as a business combination since Bolnisi and Palmarejo
were considered to be in the development stage.

NOTE D — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company committed to a plan to sell Coeur Silver Valley Inc. (“CSV”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation, that owned and operated the Galena underground
silver mine and adjoining properties in Northern Idaho. On April 10, 2006, the Company announced that it had
entered into an agreement to sell 100% of the shares of CSV to U.S. Silver Corporation for $15 million in cash. On
June 1, 2006, the Company completed the sale of 100% of CSV to U.S. Silver Corporation for a total of $15 million
in cash plus a post-closing working capital adjustment of $1.1 million. The Company recorded, within discontinued
operations, a gain of approximately $11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Pursuant to SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” CSV was classified as held for sale and the
results of its operations reported in discontinued operations beginning in the period ended June 30, 2006.

Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (“ABCP”)
The Company acquired certain asset-backed securities in connection with the Bolnisi and Palmarejo acqui-
sition. Palmarejo had investments in non-bank sponsored ABCP, of which $6.3 million was invested in Apsley
Trust Class A and $0.5 million in Aurora Trust Class E.
Since a portion of the assets supporting the commercial paper was invested in U.S. sub-prime residual
mortgage-backed securities, the Company determined the fair value of the investments based on the best available
market data for such investments at the date of acquisition. The Company recorded these investments at the date of
the Palmarejo acquisition, as a non-current asset, at their estimated fair value of $5.3 million ($5.3 million Canadian
dollars).
On August 16, 2007, it was announced that a group representing banks, asset providers and major investors had
agreed to stand-still with regard to all non bank sponsored ABCP (the “Montreal Proposal ABCP”). On Decem-
ber 24, 2008, a tentative deal was reached between investors and banks to restructure the majority of Montreal
Proposal ABCP.
The Company has determined the fair value of its investments in ABCP using available information regarding
the proposed restructuring, market conditions and other factors as of the measurement date of December 31, 2008.
Under the restructuring plan, the ABCP investments will be converted to new notes with maturities matching
underlying assets. The new notes will have interest rates commensurate with the nature of underlying assets.
Based on the Company’s assessment of the fair value of its investments in ABCP as of December 31, 2008, the
Company recorded an additional adjustment of $2.6 million to reduce the carrying value of the investment during
the year ended December 31, 2008. The total fair value of the ABCP investments is estimated to be $1.8 million at
December 31, 2008. This estimate is subject to measurement uncertainty and is dependent on market conditions as
of the measurement date.

At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately $37.3 million, $22.1 million and $12.9 million,
respectively, of invoices for capital expenditures remained in accounts payable and for purposes of the consolidated
cash flows were treated as non-cash transactions.
In connection with the acquisition of Bolnisi and Palmarejo, the Company assumed certain liabilities related to
capital leases. In December 2006, Bolnisi, through its Canadian subsidiary Palmarejo, entered into a 2-year lease
agreement for a power station. Under the terms of the agreement, including an amendment in January 2007, the
Company will pay a fixed monthly amount of $0.3 million, including interest calculated at the rate of LIBOR plus
2.5%, starting at the date that the construction of the equipment is completed. The Company has the option at the
end of the agreement to purchase the equipment by paying a nominal amount. In June 2007, Palmarejo entered into
a 5-year lease agreement for mining equipment to be delivered to Palmarejo as the equipment becomes available
from the supplier. Mining equipment with a cost of $37.3 million was delivered as of December 31, 2008. The
Company paid a monthly amount of approximately $1.0 million during the 2008 period, including interest
calculated at the rate of LIBOR plus 3.65%. The Company has the option at the end of the agreement to purchase the
equipment by paying a nominal amount.

(A) On December 21, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the shares of Bolnisi and Palmarejo in
exchange for a total of approximately 272 million shares of Coeur common stock and a total cash payment of
approximately $1.1 million. The total consideration paid was $1.1 billion and assumed liabilities were
$0.7 billion.
(B) Balance represents acquisition cost of mineral interest.
(C) During the second quarter of 2008, the Company commenced commercial production activities at its
San Bartolomé property. Consequently, capitalized development costs were re-classified to operational mining
properties in 2008.
(D) During the third quarter of 2005, the Company commenced construction activities at its Kensington property.
The costs incurred subsequent to commencing construction have been capitalized as developmental properties.
Operational Mining Properties
San Bartolomé Mine: The San Bartolomé Mine is a silver mine located near the city of Potosi, Bolivia. The
mineral rights for the San Bartolomé project are held through long-term joint venture/lease agreements with several
local independent mining co-operatives and the Bolivian State owned mining company, (“COMIBOL”). The
Company commenced commercial production in June 2008.
Rochester Mine: The Company has conducted operations at the Rochester Mine, located in Western Nevada,
since September 1986. The mine utilizes the heap-leaching process to extract both silver and gold from ore mined
using open pit methods. Rochester’s primary product is silver with gold produced as a by-product.
Cerro Bayo Mine: The Cerro Bayo Mine is a gold and silver underground mine located in southern Chile.
Commercial production commenced on April 18, 2002.
Martha Mine: The Martha Mine is an underground silver mine located in Argentina, approximately 270 miles
southeast of Coeur’s Cerro Bayo mine. Coeur acquired a 100% interest in the Martha mine in April 2002. In July
2002, Coeur commenced shipment of ore from the Martha Mine to the Cerro Bayo facility for processing. In
December 2007, the Company completed a 240 tonne per day flotation mill, which produces a flotation concentrate.
Mineral Interests
Endeavor Mine: On May 23, 2005, the CDE Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur (“CDE
Australia”) acquired all of the silver production and reserves, up to a maximum 17.7 million payable ounces,
contained at the Endeavor Mine in Australia, which is owned and operated by Cobar Operations Pty. Limited
(“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”), for $44.0 million including transaction
fees. Under the terms of the original agreement, CDE Australia paid Cobar $15.4 million of cash at the closing. In
addition, CDE Australia agreed to pay Cobar approximately $26.5 million upon the receipt of a report confirming
that the reserves at the Endeavor mine are equal to or greater than the reported ore reserves for 2004. In addition to
these upfront payments, CDE Australia originally committed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00
for each ounce of payable silver plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. This further
increment was to have begun on the second anniversary of this agreement and is 50% of the amount by which the
silver price exceeds $5.23 per ounce. A cost contribution of $0.25 per ounce is also payable by CDE Australia in
respect of new ounces of proven and probable silver reserves as they are discovered. During the first quarter of 2007,
$2.1 million was paid for additional ounces of proven and probable silver reserves under the terms of the contract.
This amount was capitalized as a cost of the mineral interests acquired and is being amortized using the units of
production method.
On March 28, 2006, CDE Australia reached an agreement with CBH to modify the terms of the original silver
purchase agreement. Under the modified terms, CDE Australia owns all silver production and reserves up to a total
F-24
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
of 20.0 million payable ounces, up from 17.7 million payable ounces in the original agreement. The silver price-
sharing provision is deferred until such time as CDE Australia has received approximately 2 million cumulative
ounces of silver from the mine or June 2007, whichever is later. In addition, the silver price-sharing threshold
increased to $7.00 per ounce, from the previous level of $5.23 per ounce. The conditions relating to the second
payment were also modified and tied to certain paste fill plant performance criteria and mill throughput tests. In
January 2008, the mine met the criteria for payment of the additional $26.2 million. This amount was paid on
April 1, 2008, plus accrued interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from January 24, 2008. During late November
2008, the mine exceeded the 2.0 million cumulative ounce thresholds and therefore, CDE Australia realized a
reduction in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $73,000 as a result of the silver price sharing
provision. CDE Australia has received approximately 2.1 million payable ounces to-date and the current ore reserve
contains approximately 13.5 million payable ounces based on current metallurgical recovery and current smelter
contract terms. Expansion of the ore reserve will be required to achieve the maximum payable ounces of silver
production as set forth in the modified contract. It is expected that future expansion to the ore reserve will occur as a
result of the conversion of portions of the property’s existing inventory of mineralized material and future
exploration discoveries. CBH conducts regular exploration to discover new mineralization and to define reserves
from surface and underground drilling platforms.
Broken Hill Mine: On September 8, 2005, CDE Australia acquired all of the silver production and reserves,
up to 17.2 million payable ounces (24.5 million contained ounces), contained at the Broken Hill mine in Australia,
which is owned and operated by Perilya Broken Hill Ltd. (“PBH”), for $36.9 million including transaction fees. In
addition, CDE Australia pays PBH an operating cost contribution of approximately $2.00 for each ounce of payable
silver. Under the terms of the agreement, PBH may earn up to $0.75 million per year of additional consideration by
meeting certain silver production thresholds. No additional payments pursuant to production thresholds were made
during 2006, 2007 or 2008.
Non-Producing and Development Properties
Palmarejo: Palmarejo is located in the State of Chihuahua in northern Mexico, and its principal silver and
gold properties are collectively referred to as the “Palmarejo mine.” The Palmarejo mine is currently in the initial
stages of production. The Company invested approximately $190.3 million at the Palmarejo mine during 2008.
Kensington: Kensington is a gold property located near Juneau, Alaska. The mine has been constructed as an
underground gold mine accessed by a horizontal tunnel and will utilize conventional and mechanized underground
mining methods. The ore will be processed in a flotation mill that produces a concentrate which will be sold to
third-party smelters. During 2008, the Company capitalized $40.9 million in connection with construction activities
at Kensington.

March 22, 2015 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The notes provide for “net share settlement” of any conversions. Pursuant to this feature, upon conversion of
the notes, the Company (1) will pay the note holder an amount in cash equal to the lesser of the conversion
obligation or the principal amount of the notes, and (2) will settle any excess of the conversion obligation above the
notes’ principal amount in the Company’s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election.
The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances, at the holder’s option, at an initial conversion rate of

Bridging Debt Facility
On October 22, 2007, Bolnisi entered into a $20 million credit facility with Macquarie Bank Limited to fund
further exploration and development of the Palmarejo silver/gold project, surrounding exploration and development
areas and for working capital purposes. The credit facility was extended to September 30, 2008 and had an interest
at a variable rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of 2.45%. The Company paid off the outstanding balance under the facility
on September 30, 2008.
Bank Loans
During 2008, the Company received short-term borrowings from Banco Bisa and Banco de Credito de Bolivia
for an amount of $3.0 million to fund working capital requirements. The short-term borrowings bear interest rates
between 8.5% and 10.1% and expire between April and June 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into several temporary credit lines in the amount of
$3.5 million with the Standard Bank of Argentina secured by a stand by letter of credit to fund working capital
requirements. The credit lines bear interest rates of 7.25% to 9.85% and expire at various dates in 2009 on or before
June 30, 2009.
On August 30, 2007, Palmarejo entered into a temporary credit facility of $2.0 million secured by the
Company’s investments in asset backed commercial paper, to fund working capital requirements. The credit facility
was amended on October 9, 2007. On June 3, 2008, the Company paid off the outstanding balance on the credit
facility.
Capitalized Interest
The Company capitalizes interest incurred on its various debt instruments as a cost of properties under
development. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company capitalized interest of
$12.2 million, $2.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
NOTE J — RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION COSTS
Reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Management
estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties.
The Company uses assumptions about future costs, mineral prices, mineral processing recovery rates, production
F-27
COEUR D’ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
levels and capital and reclamation costs. Such assumptions are based on the Company’s current mining plan and the
best available information for making such estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and
assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions.
The asset retirement obligation is measured using the following factors: 1) Expected labor costs, 2) Allocated
overhead and equipment charges, 3) Contractor markup, 4) Inflation adjustment, and 5) Market risk premium. The
sum of all these costs is discounted, using the Company’s credit adjusted risk-free interest rate from the time it
expects to pay the retirement obligation to the time it incurs the obligation. The measurement objective is to
determine the amount a third party would demand to assume the asset retirement obligation.
Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, the Company capitalized the asset
retirement cost as an increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The Company depletes this
amount using the units-of-production method. The Company is not required to re-measure the obligation at fair
value each period, but the Company is required to evaluate the cash flow estimates at the end of each reporting
period to determine whether the estimates continue to be appropriate. Upward revisions in the amount of
undiscounted cash flows are discounted using a current credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Downward revisions are
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate that existed when the original liability was recorded, or, if not
readily determinable, at the weighted average discount rate used to record the liability.
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $34.7 million and $33.1 million, respectively, was accrued for reclamation
obligations related to currently producing and developmental mineral properties. In addition, the Company has
accrued $0.4 million and $1.0 million for reclamation obligations associated with former mining activities at the
Ropes Gold mine and Golden Cross mine, respectively. These amounts are also included in reclamation and mine
closure liabilities.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reviewed and revised its cash flow estimates for its asset retirement
obligations. This resulted in an increase to the asset retirement obligation of $6.5 million and a corresponding
increase to the carrying amount of the asset to be retired. The increase was due to additional reclamation required at
the Company’s Cerro Bayo mine, Palmarejo project and San Bartolomé mine. The increase was discounted using
the Company’s current weighted average credit adjusted risk-free rate of 17.1%.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company reviewed and revised its cash flow estimates for its asset retirement
obligations. This resulted in an increase to the asset retirement obligation of $3.4 million and a corresponding
increase to the carrying amount of the asset to be retired. The increase was due to additional reclamation required at
the Company’s Cerro Bayo mine, Kensington project and San Bartolomé project. The increase was discounted
using the Company’s current weighted average credit adjusted risk-free rate of 9.34%.

The Company has evaluated the amount of taxable income and periods over which it must be earned to allow
for realization of the deferred tax assets. Based upon this analysis, the Company determined it is more likely than
not that net deferred tax assets of $3.6 million will be realized in Chile. Thus, the Company has recorded valuation
allowances as follows (In thousands):

The Company continues to monitor the valuation allowance quarterly, and will make the appropriate
adjustments as necessary.
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes,” (FIN 48) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” on January 1, 2007.
FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position
to be recognized in a company’s financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than
not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The Company
determined that FIN 48 had no impact on the financial statements, and as a result, did not record any cumulative
effect adjustment related to the adoption of FIN 48.

The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as a
component of income tax expense and has recorded approximately $0.1 million during 2008.
The Company files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction, various U.S. states and in certain foreign
jurisdictions. To the extent there are loss carryovers in any such jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally
remains open.
The Company has previously determined the earnings from certain foreign jurisdictions were not indefinitely
reinvested. Accordingly, the Company has recognized deferred taxes and withholding taxes related to those
jurisdictions. During 2008, the Company determined that it was reasonable, appropriate and prudent that a portion
of the anticipated future cash flows from Mexico would be indefinitely reinvested to fund ongoing capital
improvements and additional exploration activities within and around the Palmarejo operating site.

NOTE L — SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY
On May 11, 1999, the Company’s shareholders adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Plan”). The Plan
entitles each holder of the Company’s common stock to one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one one-
hundredth of a share of newly authorized Series B Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $100. The rights
will not be distributed and become exercisable unless and until ten business days after a person acquires 20% of the
outstanding common shares or commences an offer that would result in the ownership of 30% or more of the shares.
Each right also carries the right to receive upon exercise that number of Coeur common shares which has a market
value equal to two times the exercise price. Each preferred share issued is entitled to receive 100 times the dividend
declared per share of common stock and 100 votes for each share of common stock and is entitled to 100 times the
liquidation payment made per common share. The Board may elect to redeem the rights prior to their exercisability
at a price of $0.01 per right. The rights will expire on May 24, 2009, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the
Company. Any preferred shares issued are not redeemable. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were a total of
566,739,877 and 550,453,019 rights outstanding, respectively, which was equal to the number of outstanding shares
of common stock.
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company completed a public offering of 27.6 million shares of common
stock at a public offering price of $5.60 per share. The Company realized net proceeds of $146.2 million after
payment of the underwriters’ discount. Offering costs incurred were $8.3 million.
NOTE M — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company has an Annual Incentive Plan, a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2003 Long-Term Incentive
Plan”), the “1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan” and the 2005 Non-Employee Directors’ Plan (the “2005 Non-
Employee Directors’ Plan”). Total employee compensation expense charged to operations and capital projects
under these Plans was $5.1 million, $6.3 million and $4.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Annual Incentive Plan
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors may annually approve cash-based awards to the
executive officers and key management employees based on certain Company and employee performance
measures. Cash payments for awards for 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $2.2 million, $2.6 million and
$2.2 million, respectively.

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under the 1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended by shareholders in 1995, the Company may grant non-
qualified and incentive stock options that are exercisable at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the
date of grant and vest cumulatively at an annual rate of one third during the three-year period following the date of
grant. In addition to stock options, the Company’s 1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash
based awards, and stock based awards.
The number of shares authorized to be issued under this plan was 2.9 million shares. There were 0.6 million
shares reserved for issuance under this plan at December 31, 2008 for stock options previously awarded. No further
awards will be made under this plan.
2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) was approved by our shareholders on May 20, 2003, and
replaced our prior 1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the plan, we may grant nonqualified stock options,
incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards to our executive officers and other key
employees.
The number of shares authorized for grant under this plan was 6.8 million shares. There were 5.4 million shares
reserved for issuance under this plan at December 31, 2008. Of the 5.4 million shares, 3.5 million shares can be
issued for future grants. There were 1.4 million options and 0.5 million performance shares outstanding under this
plan at December 31, 2008.
Non-Employee Directors Plan
On June 3, 2005, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2005 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Incentive
Plan and authorized 500,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the plan. During 2008 and 2007, 55,782
and 59,476 shares were issued in lieu of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of Directors’ fees. At
December 31, 2008, 0.3 million shares are reserved for issuance under this plan.
Under the previous Directors’ plan, options were granted only in lieu of annual directors’ fees. At Decem-
ber 31, 2008, 0.4 million shares are reserved for issuance under this plan for stock options previously awarded. No
further grants will be made under this plan.
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, options to purchase 2,433,182 shares and 2,281,595 shares of common
stock, respectively, were outstanding under the LTIP and the Directors’ Plans described above. The options are
exercisable at prices ranging from $0.74 to $7.09 per share.
Stock options granted under the Company’s incentive plans vest over three years and are exercisable over a
period not to exceed 10 years from the grant date. Exercise prices are equal to the higher of the fair market value of
the shares on the date of the grant or the par value per share. The value of each option award is estimated on the date
of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Restricted stock grants are recorded based on the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and
vest in equal installments annually over two and three years. Holders of the restricted stock are entitled to vote the
shares and to receive any dividends declared on the shares.
Performance shares are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. Compensation costs
ultimately recognized are equal to the grant date fair value. Vesting is contingent on meeting certain market
conditions based on relative total shareholder return. The performance shares vest at the end of the three-year

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
service period if the market conditions are met and the employee remains an employee of the Company. The
existence of a market condition requires recognition of compensation cost over the requisite period regardless of
whether the market condition is ever satisfied.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company began recording compensation expense associated with awards of
equity instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”. The Company adopted the
modified prospective transition method provided for under SFAS No. 123(R), and, consequently, has not retro-
actively adjusted results for prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with awards
of equity instruments recognized in 2006 includes: 1) amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all
awards granted for the fiscal years 1995 to 2005, based on the grant date fair value, estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”; and 2) amortization related to
all equity instruments awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The compensation cost is included in admin-
istrative and general expenses, production costs and the cost of self-constructed property, plant and equipment as
deemed appropriate.
SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction
of taxes paid. There were no significant excess tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
The compensation expense recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 for awards of equity instruments was $2.9 million, $3.7 million and
$2.5 million, respectively, of which $0.2 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, was capitalized
as part of mine development activities. As of December 31, 2008, there was $1.4 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost (net of estimated forfeitures) related to unvested stock options, restricted stock grants and
performance share grants which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years.
The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. The Company estimates forfeitures of stock-based awards based on historical data and
adjusts the forfeiture rate periodically.
The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) as of January 1, 2006 resulted in a decrease in net income of
$1.4 million, or less than $0.01 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. The impact of
adoption excludes the amortization of restricted stock awards in the amount of $1.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006. Compensation expense related to the amortization of restricted stock awards was recognized
prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).
Cash received from share options exercised under the Long-Term Incentive Plan for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were less than $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively,
and is reflected as an other financing activity in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. The
adjustment of the forfeiture rate results in a cumulative adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is charged.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded an adjustment of $0.1 million to reduce
compensation expense for forfeited awards.

The expected volatility of the option is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices.
The Company estimated the expected life of options granted using the midpoint between the vesting date and the
original contractual term. The risk free rate was determined using the yield available on U.S. Treasury Zero-coupon
issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. The Company has not paid dividends on its
common stock since 1996.

NOTE N — DEFINED CONTRIBUTION AND 401(k) PLANS
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company provides a noncontributory defined contribution retirement plan for all eligible U.S. employees.
Total contributions charged to expense were $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $1.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, which is based on a percentage of the salary of eligible employees.
401(k) Plan
The Company maintains a retirement savings plan (which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue code) covering all eligible U.S. employees. Under the plan, employees may elect to contribute up to 100%
of their cash compensation, subject to ERISA limitations. The Company adopted a Safe Harbor Tiered Match and is
required to make matching contributions equal to 100% of the employee’s contribution up to 3% of the employee’s
compensation plus matching contributions equal to 50% of the employee’s contribution up to an additional 2% of
the employee’s compensation. Employees have the option of investing in twelve different types of investment funds.
Total plan expenses recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements were $0.6 million, $0.6 million
and $0.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and plan expenses charged to operations were $0.4 million,
$0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
NOTE O — DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into derivative instruments to manage the Company’s exposure to foreign currency
exchange rates and market prices associated with changes in gold and silver commodity prices. The Company
accounts for its derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair market value of
derivative contracts, which qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, are recorded as other comprehensive
income or loss and such amounts are recognized in earnings as the associated contracts are settled.

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts
During 2008, the Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign
exchange risk associated with forecasted Mexican peso and Argentine peso operating costs at its Palmarejo project
and Martha mine, respectively. During 2007 and 2006, the Company entered into forward foreign currency
exchange contracts to reduce the foreign exchange risk associated with the forecasted Chilean peso operating costs
for 2008 and 2007 at its Cerro Bayo mine.
The Mexican peso contracts require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Mexican pesos at a weighted
average exchange rate of 13.57 pesos to each U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2008, the Company had Mexican peso
foreign exchange contracts of $22.4 million in U.S. dollars. These contracts had a fair value of $2.0 million at
December 31, 2008.
The Argentine peso contracts require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Argentine pesos at a weighted
average exchange rate of 4.03 pesos to each U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2008, the Company had Argentine peso
foreign exchange contracts of $12.9 million in U.S. dollars. These contracts had a fair value of $1.5 million at
December 31, 2008.
The Chilean peso contracts entered into in 2007 require the Company to exchange U.S. dollars for Chilean
pesos at a weighted average exchange rate of 503 pesos to each U.S. dollar. There were no outstanding contracts at
December 31, 2008.
Gold Lease Facility
On December 18, 2008, the Company entered into a $20 million Gold Lease Facility with Mitsubishi
International Corporation (“MIC”). Under the Gold Lease Facility, the Company received proceeds of $20 million
for the sale of 23,529 ounces of gold simultaneously leased from MIC to the Company. The Company has
committed to this number of ounces of gold to MIC over the next twelve months at scheduled delivery dates. The
Company is required to pledge certain collateral including standby letter of credits of $5.5 million and $7.5 million
of metal inventory at our refiners. The Company accounts for the Gold Lease Facility as a derivative instrument and
is recorded in accrued liabilities and other. As of December 31, 2008, based on the current futures metals prices for
each of the delivery dates, using a 15% discount rate, the fair value of the Gold Lease Facility was $18.8 million.
The Company recorded an unrealized gain of $1.2 million in 2008, which is reflected in earnings as unrealized gains
(losses) in derivatives and other.
Concentrate Sales Contracts
The Company enters into concentrate sales contracts with third-party smelters. The contracts, in general,
provide for a provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices and the provisionally
priced sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale.
The embedded derivative, which is the final settlement price based on a future price, does not qualify for hedge
accounting. These embedded derivatives are recorded as derivative assets (in Prepaid expenses and other), or
derivative liabilities (in Accrued liabilities and other), on the balance sheet and are adjusted to fair value through
earnings each period until the date of final settlement.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $33.2 million consisting of
2.2 million ounces of silver and 8,388 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $32.1 million
including the embedded derivative.

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of $61.2 million consisting of
3.3 million ounces of silver and 20,775 ounces of gold, which had a fair value of approximately $63.8 million
including the embedded derivative.
Commodity Derivatives
The Company has occasionally entered into forward metal sales contracts to manage the price risk associated
with a portion of its cash flows against fluctuating gold prices. As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, the Company
had no outstanding forward sales contracts for either gold or silver.
Conversion Option of Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes
On October 20, 2008, the Company completed an offering of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes, realizing net proceeds of $40.2 million after deducting $0.5 million
of issuance costs. The purchaser also received warrants to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate
principal amount of convertible notes for $20 million. Upon exercising the conversion option, the holder receives
common stock of the Company at an initial conversion rate of 869.5652, plus an additional payment in common
stock or cash, at the election of the Company, representing the value of the interest that would be earned on the notes
through the earlier of the fourth anniversary of the conversion date or October 15, 2013, at the interest rate applicable
on the conversion date. The conversion option is considered an embedded derivative that is required to be separated
from the host debt contract for accounting purposes. The warrants are also considered derivative instruments. These
derivatives are recorded in accrued liabilities and other on the balance sheet and are adjusted to fair value through
earnings. At the issuance date, because the combined fair value of the conversion option and the warrants exceeded
the net proceeds, the notes were recorded with a full original issue discount. The amount by which the fair value of
the conversion option and warrants exceeded the proceeds received, or $10.0 million, was recorded as a loss upon
issuance and is included in unrealized gains (loss) on derivatives and other in the consolidated statements of
operations. The fair values of the conversion option and warrants were $32.2 million and $18.5 million, respectively,
at the issuance date and $21.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.
As of December 31, 2008, $12.4 million of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes had been
converted into 15.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock.
Credit Risk
The credit risk exposure related to any potential derivative instruments is limited to the unrealized gains, if any,
on outstanding contracts based on current market prices. To reduce counter-party credit exposure, the Company
deals only with a group of large credit-worthy financial institutions and limits credit exposure to each. The
Company does not anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties. In addition, to allow for situations
where positions may need to be revised, the Company deals only in markets that it considers highly liquid.
NOTE P — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Labor Union Contract
The Company maintains two labor agreements in South America, consisting of a labor agreement with
Syndicato de Trabajadores de Compañía Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd. at its Cerro Bayo mine in Chile and with
Associacion Obrera Minera Argentina at its Martha mine in Argentina. The agreement at Cerro Bayo is effective
from December 24, 2007 to December 21, 2010 and the agreement at Mina Martha is effective from June 12, 2006
to June 1, 2010. Certain employees at San Bartolomé are covered by a labor agreement that became effective
October 11, 2007. This Bolivian labor agreement does not have a fixed term. As of December 31, 2008, the
Company had approximately 27.5% of its worldwide labor force covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Termination Benefits
In September 2005, the Company established a one-time termination benefit program at the Rochester mine as
the mine approaches the end of its mine life. The employees will be required to render service until they are
terminated in order to be eligible for benefits. Approximately 85% of the workforce was severed by the end of 2008,
while the remaining employees are expected to stay on for residual leaching and reclamation activities. As of
December 31, 2008, the total benefit expected to be incurred under this plan is approximately $5.0 million. The
liability is recognized ratably over the minimum future service period. The amount accrued as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (in thousands):

The Company does not have a written severance plan for any of its foreign operations including Chile,
Argentina, Bolivia and Mexico. However, laws in these foreign jurisdictions require payment of certain minimum
statutory termination benefits. Accordingly, in situations where minimum statutory termination benefits must be
paid to the affected employees, the company records employee severance costs in accordance with SFAS No. 112,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.” The Company has accrued obligations for postemploy-
ment benefits in these locations of approximately $2.4 million as of December 31, 2008.
Kensington Production Royalty
On July 7, 1995, Coeur, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coeur Alaska, Inc. (“Coeur Alaska”), acquired
the 50% ownership interest of Echo Bay Exploration Inc. (“Echo Bay”) in the Kensington property from Echo Bay
and Echo Bay Alaska, Inc., giving Coeur 100% ownership of the Kensington property. The property is located on
the east side of Lynn Canal between Juneau and Haines, Alaska. Coeur Alaska is obligated to pay Echo Bay a scaled
net smelter return royalty on 1.0 million ounces of future gold production after Coeur Alaska recoups the
$32.5 million purchase price and its construction and development expenditures incurred after July 7, 1995 in
connection with placing the property into commercial production. The royalty ranges from 1% at $400 gold prices
to a maximum of 21⁄2% at gold prices above $475, with the royalty to be capped at 1.0 million ounces of production.
NOTE Q — SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
The Company markets its metals products and concentrates primarily to bullion trading banks and five third-
party smelters. These customers then sell the metals to end users for use in industry applications such as electronic
circuitry, jewelry and silverware production and the manufacture and development of photographic film. Sales of
metals to bullion trading banks amounted to approximately 45%, 47% and 47% of total metals sales in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. Generally, the loss of a single bullion trading bank customer would not adversely affect the
Company in view of the liquidity of the markets and availability of alternative trading banks.
The Company currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third-party smelters in Japan, Mexico and
Australia. Sales of metals concentrates to third-party smelters amounted to approximately 55%, 53% and 53% of
metals sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The loss of any one smelter customer could have a material
adverse effect on the Company in the event of the possible unavailability of alternative smelters.

NOTE R — SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision-making group is
comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice President of Operations and the
President of South American Operations.
The operating segments are managed separately because each segment represents a distinct use of Company
resources which contribute to Company cash flows in its respective geographic area. The Company’s reportable
operating segments include the Rochester, Cerro Bayo, Martha, San Bartolomé, Kensington, Palmarejo, Endeavor
and Broken Hill mining properties. All operating segments are engaged in the discovery and/or mining of gold and
silver and generate the majority of their revenues from the sale of these precious metal concentrates and/or refined
precious metals. The Cerro Bayo and Martha mines sell precious metal concentrates, typically under long-term
contracts,
to a smelter located in Japan (Dowa Mining Ltd.), Mexico (Met-Mex Penoles) and Germany
(Norddeutsche). Refined gold and silver produced by the Rochester mine is principally sold on a spot basis to
precious metals trading banks such as Standard Bank and Mitsui. Concentrates produced at CDE Australia
(Endeavor and Broken Hill mines) are sold to Nyrstar (formerly Zinifex), an Australia smelter. The Company’s
exploration programs are included as other. The other segment also includes the corporate headquarters, elimination
of intersegment transactions and other items necessary to reconcile to consolidated amounts. The accounting
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies
above. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on profit or loss before interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization, unusual and infrequent items, and extraordinary items.
Revenues from silver sales were $130.9 million, $151.0 million and $147.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. Revenues from gold sales were $58.6 million, $64.3 million and $68.8 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

NOTE S — LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS
States of Maine, Idaho and Colorado Superfund Sites Related to Callahan Mining Corporation
During 1991, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Callahan Mining Corporation.
During 2001, the United States Forest Service (“USFS”) made a formal request for information regarding the
Deadwood Mine Site located in central Idaho. Callahan Mining Corporation had operated at this site during the
1940s. The USFS believes that some cleanup action is required at the location. However, the Company did not
acquire Callahan until 1991, more than 40 years after Callahan disposed of its interest in the Deadwood property.
The Company did not make any decisions with respect to generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at the
site. Therefore, the Company believes that it is not liable for any cleanup, and if Callahan might be liable, it has no
F-43

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
substantial assets with which to satisfy any such liability. To date, no claim has been made by the United States for
any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
During 2002, the EPA made a formal request for information regarding a Callahan mine site in the State of
Maine. Callahan operated there in the late 1960s, shut the operations down in the early 1970s and disposed of the
property. The EPA contends that some cleanup action is warranted at the site, and listed it on the National Priorities
List in late 2002. In January 2009, the EPA and the State of Maine made additional formal requests for information
relating to the Maine Callahan mine site. The Company believes that because it made no decisions with respect to
generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at this location, it is not liable for any cleanup costs. If Callahan
might have liability, it has no substantial assets with which to satisfy such liability. To date, no claim has been made
for any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
In January 2003, the USFS made a formal request for information regarding a Callahan mine site in the State of
Colorado known as the Akron Mine Site. Callahan operated there in approximately the late 1930s through the
1940s, and to the Company’s knowledge, disposed of the property. The Company is not aware of what, if any,
cleanup action the USFS is contemplating. However, the Company did not make decisions with respect to
generation, transport or disposal of hazardous waste at this location, and therefore believes it is not liable for any
cleanup costs. If Callahan might have liability, it has no substantial assets with which to satisfy such liability. To
date, no claim has been made for any cleanup costs against either the Company or Callahan.
Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge
On September 12, 2005, three environmental groups (“Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in
Alaska against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps of Engineers”) and the USFS seeking to invalidate the
permit issued to Coeur Alaska, Inc. for the Company’s Kensington mine. The Plaintiffs claim the Clean Water Act
(“CWA”) Section 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers authorizing the deposition of mine tailings into
Lower Slate Lake conflicts with the CWA. They additionally claim the USFS’s approval of the Amended Plan of
Operations is arbitrary and capricious because it relies on the 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers.
Following the District Court’s remand of the Section 404 permit to the Corps of Engineers for further review, the
Corps reinstated the Company’s permit on March 29, 2006. The lawsuit challenging the permit was re-opened on
April 6, 2006; Coeur Alaska filed its answer to the Amended Complaint; and Coeur Alaska, the State of Alaska, and
Goldbelt, Inc., a local native corporation, were granted Defendant-Intervenor status to join the agencies in their
defense of the permit.
On August 4, 2006, the Federal District Court in Alaska dismissed the Plaintiffs’ challenge and upheld the
Section 404 permit. On August 7, 2006, the Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal of the decision to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals (“Ninth Circuit Court”) and on August 9, 2006 the Plaintiffs additionally filed a Motion for
Injunction Pending Appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court. The Ninth Circuit Court granted a temporary injunction
pending appeal on August 24, 2006, enjoining certain activities relating to the lake tailings facility.
On May 22, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the District Court’s August 4, 2006 decision which had
upheld the Company’s 404 permit and issued its opinion that remanded the case to the District Court with
instructions to vacate the Company’s 404 permit as well as the USFS Record of Decision approving the general
tailings disposal plan and the Goldbelt 404 permit to construct the Cascade Point Marine Facility. On August 20,
2007, Coeur Alaska filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc with the Ninth Circuit Court, as did the State of Alaska
and Goldbelt, Inc. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the Corps of Engineers, and USFS additionally filed a
limited Petition for Rehearing with the Ninth Circuit Court panel seeking reconsideration of the mandate of the
May 22, 2007 panel decision. On October 29, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court denied the Petitions for Rehearing En
Banc. On November 14, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court granted a stay of the mandate pending further appeal to the
Supreme Court, subject to the development of a reclamation plan for the lake area. The Company and the State of
Alaska filed Petitions for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States on January 28, 2008. On June 27,

(Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)
2008, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the State of Alaska and Coeur Alaska’s Petitions for a writ of
certiorari to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court. Arguments were made before the Supreme Court by
both parties on January 12, 2009. The Company expects a decision on the case pending with the Supreme Court in
the second quarter of 2009. The Company cannot predict if it will prevail in this appeal.
On October 1, 2008 the Company announced a temporary curtailment of its development activities at the
Kensington Project until such time as a decision is rendered from the U.S. Supreme Court on its original tailings
plan. Consequently, the Company laid off approximately 50% of its existing workforce and paid termination
benefits of $0.3 million.
No assurance can be given as to whether or when regulatory permits and approvals granted to the Company
may be further challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing agencies, or as to whether the Company
will ultimately place the Kensington project into commercial production.

On January 21, 2009, the Company announced that it entered into a gold royalty stream transaction with
Franco-Nevada Corporation under which Franco-Nevada purchased a royalty covering 50% of the life of mine gold
to be produced by Coeur from its Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico. Coeur received total proceeds of
US$80.0 million consisting of US$75.0 million in cash plus a contingent payment comprised of special warrants to
purchase $5 million of common shares of Franco-Nevada for no additional consideration received once the mine
achieves certain completion tests. The royalty is payable when the market price for each ounce of gold sold is
greater than $400 (increasing by 1% per annum beginning on the fourth anniversary of the transaction). The royalty
is considered a derivative financial instrument under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
hedging Activities.” Accordingly, changes in fair value of the contract will be recorded in earnings currently.
As of March 2, 2009, $47.5 million of the $50 million Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes have been
converted into 61.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock, and all of the $25 million of the notes issued in
January 2009 for the warrant exercise have been converted into 36.9 million shares of the Company’s common
stock.

Our earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges for 2004 and 2008. The amounts by which earnings were inadequate to cover fixed 
charges were approximately $23.9 million in 2004 and $25.7 million in 2008. Earnings were sufficient to cover fixed charges from 2005 to 
2007.
For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income from continuing operations before income 
taxes and gains/(losses) on the early retirement of debt and fixed charges, and fixed charges consist of interest and that portion of rent deemed 
representative of interest. Fixed charges consist of interest, preferred stock dividends and that portion of rent deemed representative of interest.
