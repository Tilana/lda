Articles of Association
The meeting approved an amendment to the Articles of Association to clarify its ability to post
notices to shareholders on its website.
There were no votes against any of the resolutions.
Richard Poulden, Chairman and CEO of Wishbone, commented:
"We will issue a full trading update when we issue our half year results but I can say that we are
extremely pleased with the progress made in the few weeks since we raised our debt funding. I
have also noted comments that we are about to issue all of the increased share capital. I would
like to clarify that this is not the case and it is perfectly normal for companies to have issuable
shares held in reserve"
