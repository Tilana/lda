Appendix 4E Preliminary Final Report  
For the Financial Year Ended 
30 June 2016
Review of results 
 
(a)
Production and sales 
Troy  Resources  Limited  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”  or  “Troy”  or  “Group”)  total 
production for the year was 82,826 gold equivalent ounces (2015: 121,835 gold equivalent 
ounces) or  60,743 ounces of gold and 1,668,604 ounces of silver (2015: 78,001 ounces of 
gold and 3,111,182 ounces of silver). 
Group  sales  for  the  year  totalled  87,153  gold  equivalent  ounces  (2015:  122,184  gold 
equivalent ounces). 
Troy’s  Karouni  gold  project  in  Guyana,  South  America  (“Karouni’)  achieved  commercial 
production in January 2016 and produced 34,740 ounces of gold for the six months to 30 
June 2016 from the processing of 356,772 tonnes of ore at an average gold grade of 3.37 
grams per tonne (g/t). Sales for Karouni totalled 32,732 gold ounces.  
Karouni  cash  costs  were  US$515  per  gold  ounce  produced  and  All-in  Sustaining  costs 
(AISC)  were  US$816  per  gold  ounce  produced.  The  proceeds  received  from  the  sale  of 
4,984  gold  ounces  produced  prior  to  commercial  production  were  credited  against  the 
project’s capitalised mine development costs.  
Troy’s  Casposo  gold  silver  operation  in  San  Juan  Province,  Argentina  (‘Casposo’) 
underwent  a  labour  restructuring  programme  before  the  mine  was  placed  on  care  and 
maintenance in late January. The plant completed processing activities and was also placed 
on care and maintenance in February. The Company reached agreement with Austral Gold 
Limited on 4 March to divest a 51% controlling interest in Casposo. Consequently, Casposo 
is reported as a discontinued operation during the period to 4 March 2016, with Troy’s 49% 
minority interest after that time being equity accounted.  
During the period to 4 March 2016 Casposo produced 17,214 ounces of gold (2015: 55,859) 
and  1,668,604  ounces  of silver  (2015:  3,111,182)  from  the  processing  of  271,977  tonnes 
(2015: 509,489) of ore at an average gold grade of 2.16g/t (2015: 3.73g/t) and silver grade 
of 230.23g/t (2015: 235.72g/t). 
Casposo cash costs on a co-product basis were US$984 per gold equivalent ounce (2015: 
US$668). Total gold equivalent ounces produced at Casposo were 39,297 (2015: 99,963).  
Troy’s Andorinhas operation in Para State, Brazil ("Andorinhas") ceased operations in May 
2016. The plant was sold to Anfield Gold Corp. with handover occurring during June 2016. 
Andorinhas is also reported as a discontinued operation in the current year. 
Andorinhas  produced  8,789  ounces  of  gold  for  the  year  (2015:  22,142  ounces)  at  an 
average cash cost of US$976 per ounce (2015: US$889). AISC  were US$1,110 per gold 
ounce (2015: US$1,137).  
The Group’s available cash at 30 June 2016 was $3.1 million (2015: $59.8 million) which, 
together  with  Karouni  gold  inventories  at  market  value,  resulted  in  liquid  assets  of  $12.5 
million. 
Gold equivalent ounces  
Gold equivalent ounces produced are the result of converting silver ounces produced to an 
equivalent value of gold ounces using actual prices achieved and adding that to actual gold 
ounces produced.
