<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy, adopted on 8 September 2006, reaffirming that the promotion and protection of 
human rights for all and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, 
recognizing that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights 
are not conflicting goals but complementary and mutually reinforcing, and stressing the 
need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that any measure taken to counter terrorism 
complies with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses serious concern</i> at the violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as of refugee and international humanitarian law, in the context of 
countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of the 
</p>
<p>Council on its thirteenth session (A/HRC/13/56), chap. I. 
</p>

<p> 3. <i>Deeply deplores</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their 
families and expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of 
providing them with proper assistance; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and 
financing of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever 
committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renews its 
commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and, in 
that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to 
implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which reaffirms, inter 
alia, respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be the fundamental basis of the 
fight against terrorism; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to ensure that any person 
whose human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated has access to an effective 
remedy and that victims will receive adequate, effective and prompt reparations where 
appropriate, including by bringing to justice those responsible for such violations; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to protect all human rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that certain counter-
terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of these rights; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to safeguard the right to 
privacy in accordance with international law, and urges them to take measures to ensure 
that interferences with the right to privacy are regulated by law, subject to effective 
oversight and appropriate redress, including through judicial review or other means; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to respect the right to be equal 
before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, as provided for by international law, 
including international human rights law, such as article 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee 
law;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reiterates</i> the concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 
64/168 with regard to measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, and 
urges all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons deprived of liberty, 
regardless of the place of arrest or of detention, enjoy the guarantees to which they are 
entitled under international law, including the review of their detention and other 
fundamental judicial guarantees; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Acknowledges</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/37); 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests</i> all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the 
performance of the tasks and duties mandated, including by reacting promptly to the urgent 
appeals and providing the information requested, and to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Regrets</i> that the Special Rapporteur did not submit the compilation of good 
practices on legal and institutional frameworks and measures that ensure respect for human 
rights by intelligence agencies while countering terrorism as mandated by the Council in 
paragraph 12 of its resolution 10/15 of 26 March 2009, and therefore reiterates the requests 
to the Special Rapporteur, with the support of the Secretariat, to present the compilation to 
the Council no later than its fifteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering

resolution 60/158, and requests the High Commissioner to continue her efforts in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to contribute 
further appropriately to the ongoing discussion regarding the efforts of Member States of 
the United Nations to assure adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear 
procedures, in particular with regard to placing on, reviewing and removing individuals and 
entities from terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision taken by the Security Council in its resolution 1904 
(2009) of 17 December 2009 to establish an office of the Ombudsperson, and looks forward

persons on the consolidated list of the Security Council established and maintained by the 
1267 Committee; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are 
participating in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which provide technical 
assistance related to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, 
include, as appropriate and where consistent with their mandates, the respect of 
international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and 
refugee law, as well as the rule of law, as an important element of technical assistance that 
they offer to States related to counter-terrorism, including by drawing on the advice of, and 
otherwise ensuring the ongoing dialogue with, the special procedures of the Council within 
their mandates and the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant stakeholders;  
</p>

ongoing governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the High Commissioner and the relevant special 
procedures of the Council to engage in further<b> </b>dialogue with the Security Council Counter-
Terrorism Committee in order to promote a consistent approach to the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and would welcome further 
efforts by the Security Council Counter-Terrorism and 1267 committees, in the fulfilment 
of their respective mandates, to integrate a human rights approach into its counter-terrorism 
objectives; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to present their 
reports, bearing in mind the content of the present resolution, to the Council at its sixteenth
