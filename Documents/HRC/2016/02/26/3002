<p> I. Introduction .............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="5">0. During the mission the Special Rapporteur was also informed that racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance against asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, 
including irregular migrants, still prevails in Hungary. According to some interlocutors 
negative stereotypes towards them are deeply entrenched among the general public, and 
asylum seekers and refugees often complain of experiencing racial discrimination and 
xenophobia on a regular basis, especially in the areas of employment, health, housing and 
education. Cases of racist and discriminatory behaviour by courts in considering asylum 
seekers&#8217; requests were also reported. Regarding housing in particular, concerns were

 10 E/CN.<footnote name="4">9. A number of pieces of legislation have been adopted by the Government to address 
issues related to refugees, asylum seekers, statelessness and migrants, including the 2007 
Act II on the Entry and Stay of Third Country Nationals (Third Country Nationals Act) and 
the Asylum Act LXXX of 2007 (Asylum Act), both amended by Act CXXXV of 2010. At 
the institutional level the Office of Immigration and Nationality is responsible for asylum 
procedures. According to the authorities Hungary has established a new statelessness 
determination procedure by virtue of the above-mentioned Act II of 2007, which was 
commended by UNHCR.13 However, while Hungary has developed good practice in the 
form of an operational stateless status determination mechanism. The Hungarian Helsinki 
Committee brought it to the attention of the Special Rapporteur that applicants illegally 
staying in Hungary are de facto excluded from this procedure since lawful stay in Hungary 
is a precondition for applying for stateless status.  
</footnote>/2000/16/Add.1, para. 104; A/HRC/4/9/Add.<footnote name="2">4. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that following the adoption of the new 
Constitution the Parliamentary Commissioners for Civil Rights, Future Generations, and 
the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities were merged into a single institution, namely 
the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights. He deeply regrets the abolition of the 
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, an 
independent body which was designated to address the rights of national and ethnic 
minorities. According to article 30 of the Constitution &#8220;(1) The Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights shall protect fundamental rights and shall act at the request of any 
person. (2) The Commissioner for Fundamental Rights shall examine or cause to examine 
any abuses of fundamental rights of which he or she becomes aware, and shall propose 
general or special measures for their remedy. (3) The Commissioner for Fundamental 
Rights and his or her deputies shall be elected for six years by a two-thirds vote of the 
Members of Parliament. The deputies shall defend the interests of future generations and 
the rights of nationalities living in Hungary. The Commissioner for Fundamental Rights

Authority, which operates under the direction of the Minister of Public Administration and 
Justice. The lack of adequate resources was also reported.

<p>  A. National and ethnic minorities ........................................................................  26&#8211;<footnote name="2">2. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the large number of complaints received by the 
Authority, which demonstrates its effectiveness. However he is surprised that among the 
nearly 1,500 complaints the Authority launched proceedings in only 377 cases. This may 
indicate a limited knowledge among the general public of the competence of the Authority 
and the concept of discrimination.

Afghans, Somalis and persons originally from the former Yugoslavia) and some 3,<footnote name="2">8. While the legal and policy measures developed for minorities are welcomed, the 
long-standing issue of their representation in the Hungarian Parliament remains unresolved 
to date. Hungarian minorities are still not represented in the Parliament although the law on 
minorities provides for it. According to the Government the new Parliament adopted a

beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. In 2011, 1,693 asylum-seekers were registered (19.5 
per cent less than in 2010), mainly from Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Syria, and 
Somalia. The vast majority of asylum seekers enter the country unlawfully (95 per cent).

of police officers in the Jobbik political party. Similarly he is concerned at the growth of 
paramilitary organizations with racist platforms which target Roma and are reported to have 
close links with the Jobbik. According to some interlocutors, such paramilitary 
organizations include the now-disbanded Hungarian Guard established by Jobbik in 2007 
and other similar organizations such as the Civil Guard Association for a Better Future and 
the Magyar Nemzeti G&#225;rda, a new group with the same aims and leadership as the banned 
Hungarian Guard. They are reported to have harassed, intimidated and attacked Roma in 
areas inhabited by Roma. </footnote>7 14

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Hungary 
(Budapest, &#211;zd, Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata, P&#233;cs and Moh&#225;cs) from 23 to 27 May 2011. He held 
extensive meetings with authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches.  
</p>
<p>2. In addition to the meetings with government and State institutions, the Special 
Rapporteur met with representatives from the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner 
for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for 
Data Protection and Freedom of Information. The Special Rapporteur also had extensive 
meetings with political parties, civil society organizations, lawyers, representatives of 
minorities, academics and private citizens, as well as individual victims of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He also visited a prison in Budapest 
(F&#337;v&#225;rosi B&#252;ntet&#233;s-v&#233;grehajt&#225;si Int&#233;zet) and a school in the city of &#211;zd. A full list of 
authorities met by the Special Rapporteur is contained in the appendix. 
</p>
<p>3. The visit to Hungary by the Special Rapporteur has a particular significance since it 
occurred more than ten years after the first visit to Hungary of a previous Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and follows the visit in 2006 of the Independent Expert on minority issues. Thus 
in order to assess the main challenges that lie ahead in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in Hungary, the Special Rapporteur 
relied on recommendations made by the earlier mandate holders. He also followed up on 
the relevant recommendations and commitments made by the Government during the 
universal periodic review process of the Human Rights Council that took place on 11 May 
2011. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
Hungary for its full cooperation and openness in the preparation and conduct of the visit.  
He also wishes to convey his appreciation to the various civil society representatives who 
cooperated with him through the mission. The conclusions and recommendations in this 
report are based on the fruitful exchanges with Hungary-based interlocutors and the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s own analysis. He hopes that these will contribute to finding concrete ways 
and means of addressing the challenges raised in this report in an effective and human 
rights-compliant manner. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report is structured as follows: in chapter II, the Special Rapporteur 
briefly refers to the general background. He then examines the legal and institutional 
human rights framework for combating racism in chapters III and IV. In chapter V he 
addresses a number of key issues in the fight against racism, presenting the views shared 
with the Special Rapporteur both by Government officials and civil society. Finally, 
conclusions and recommendations are presented in chapter VI.

<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>7. According to the 2001 census,1 out of a total population of 10,198,<footnote name="31">. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to implement these policies 
fully, especially the National Social Inclusion Strategy &#8220;Extreme Poverty, Child Poverty 
and the Roma&#8221; for 2011-2020. In particular, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government ensure the effective involvement of all the relevant actors, including Roma, in 
the development and implementation of the National Social Inclusion Strategy and ensure 
</footnote>5 there were 
190,046 Roma (1.9 per cent); 62,233 Germans (0.6 per cent); 17,693 Slovaks (0.17 per 
cent); 15,620 Croatian (0.15 per cent); 7,995 Romanians (0.07 per cent); 5,070 Ukrainians 
(0.04 per cent); 3,816 Serbs (0.03 per cent); 3,040 Slovenians (0.02 per cent); 2,962 Poles 
(0.02 per cent); 2,509 Greeks (0.02 per cent); 1,<footnote name="3">6. The Special Rapporteur was particularly alarmed to hear from several interlocutors 
that racism against Roma prevails not only in the mindsets of the general public but also </footnote>58 Bulgarians (0.01 per cent); 1,098 
Ruthenians (0.01 per cent) and 620 Armenians (0.006 per cent). There are also an estimated 
100,000 Jews in Hungary. Unofficial estimates variously put the number of Roma between 
250,000 and 800,000 of the population. Hungary has a growing immigrant population, 
dominated by numerous Chinese.  
</p>
<p>8. According to information received subsequent to the mission a national census was 
carried out in October 2011. The final results of the census had not yet been published at 
the time of writing. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. At the international level, Hungary is a State party to the core international human 
rights instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol. Hungary is also a State 
party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons, the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the UNESCO 
Convention against Discrimination in Education. However Hungary is not a party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>10. At the regional level, Hungary has ratified key instruments including the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European 
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Framework Convention for the Protection 
of National Minorities, the European Social Charter of 1961 and the Revised European 
Social Charter of 1996. Hungary has yet to ratify the 1995 Collective Complaints Protocol 
of the European Social Charter, the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, 
concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through 
computer systems, and Protocol No. 12 to the Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which provides for a general prohibition of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6  
</b></p>
<p>interlocutors expressed concern about the way the process for the adoption of the new 
Constitution had been carried out, including the limited time frame established for its 
adoption, the lack of transparency and adequate consultation of the general public, and the 
limited opportunities for an adequate public debate. 
</p>
<p>12.  The new Constitution2 contains provisions of particular relevance to the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur, including article XV, which prescribes that &#8220;(1) Every person shall 
be equal before the law. Every human being shall have legal capacity. (2) Hungary shall 
ensure fundamental rights to every person without any discrimination on the grounds of 
race, colour, sex, disability, language, religion, political or other views, national or social 
origin, financial, birth or other circumstances whatsoever. [&#8230;] (4) Hungary shall adopt 
</p>
<p>special measures to promote the implementation of legal equality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The other relevant provisions concern the Hungarian ethnic and national minorities 
referred to as &#8220;Nationalities&#8221;. Article XXIX affirms that &#8220;(1) Nationalities living in 
Hungary shall be constituent parts of the State. Every Hungarian citizen belonging to any 
nationality shall have the right to freely express and preserve his or her identity. 
Nationalities living in Hungary shall have the right to use their native language and to the 
individual and collective use of names in their own languages, to promote their own 
cultures, and to be educated in their native languages. (2) Nationalities living in Hungary 
shall have the right to establish local and national self-governments. (3) The detailed rules 
for the rights of nationalities living in Hungary and the rules for the elections of their local 
and national self-governments shall be defined by a cardinal Act&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with concern that the new Constitution no longer stipulates explicitly whether the 
rights recognized as belonging to minorities will be guaranteed and supported by the State. 
Furthermore, the Constitution no longer includes provisions regarding the collective 
participation of minorities in public affairs and their representation. Article 2 (2) of the 
Constitution under the Chapter entitled &#8220;State&#8221; only prescribes that &#8220;Nationalities living in 
</p>
<p>Hungary shall contribute to Parliament&#8217;s work as defined by a cardinal Act&#8221;. Finally, while 
the new Constitution declares the right for minorities to use their native languages, article H 
only provides for the protection of the Hungarian language without referring to other 
languages.<footnote name="3">5. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors stressed that racial prejudice and negative 
stereotypes of Roma remain deeply rooted in Hungarian society. Several NGOs confirmed 
that public opinion is distrustful and vindictive towards Roma, including the young 
generation. There was a perception among some civil society interlocutors that the 
Government seemed to deny this reality. However the authorities recognized the difficulties 
associated with changing mentalities and reaffirmed their commitment to do so while 
stating that young people are more open and tolerant due to an integrated education.  
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to non-citizens, article XIV (3) states that &#8220;Hungary shall grant asylum 
to all non-Hungarian citizens as requested if they are being persecuted or have a well-
founded fear of persecution in their native countries or in the countries of their usual 
residence due to their racial or national identities, affiliation to a particular social group, or 
to their religious or political persuasions, unless they receive protection from their countries 
of origin or any other country&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur welcomes such provisions. 
However he is concerned that some human rights are granted to Hungarian citizens, but not 
to non-citizens including for instance the right to education (article XI (1)) and the 
enjoyment of social security (article XIX (1)).

culture&#8221;. </p>

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Specific legislation prohibiting racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption by Parliament on 22 December 
2003, of Act No. CXXV on Equal Treatment and Promotion of Equal Opportunities (Equal 
Treatment Act) which entered into force on 27 January 2004. The Act constitutes 
comprehensive legislation to combat racial discrimination. It prohibits both direct and 
indirect discrimination on 19 grounds, including racial origin, colour, nationality, origin of 
national or ethnic minority, mother tongue, religious or ideological conviction, sexual 
orientation, and sexual identity (article 8). It also explicitly prohibits segregation (article 7 
(1)). A broad range of fields are covered under this legislation including employment, 
social security, health care, housing, education and training, as well as the sale of goods and 
use of services<i>. </i>The Act further applies to both public and private actors and allows the 
adoption of positive measures of a temporary duration for certain disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p>16. Since its adoption the Act has been amended and improved including in the area of 
employment. In this regard the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the payment of 
different salaries wages or other benefits to individuals on the basis of their colour, race, 
nationality, national or ethnic origin is always considered to violate the principle of equal 
treatment. The Special Rapporteur further notes with appreciation that institutions financed 
by the State budget and employing more than 50 people, as well as legal entities in which 
the State has a majority ownership, are required to adopt an equal opportunities plan. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Hungarian Criminal Code contains specific prohibitions with regard to racism. 
Section 174/B of the Criminal Code criminalizes violence against a member of a national, 
ethnic, racial or religious group, which is punishable with imprisonment of up to five years 
under section 174/B (1), and between two to eight years under section 174/B (2) if the 
crime is committed (a) by force of arms; (b) in an armed manner; (c) causing a considerable 
injury of interest; (d) with the torment of the injured party; (e) in groups; (f) in a criminal 
conspiracy. Under section 269 entitled &#8220;Incitement against a Community&#8221; a person who 
incites the general public to hatred of any national, ethnic, racial group or certain groups of 
the population, shall be punishable for a felony offence with imprisonment of up to three 
years. 
</p>
<p>18. The Hungarian Criminal Code also contains provisions under section 269/B on the 
use of symbols of despotism such as a swastika, the SS sign, an arrow cross, hammer and 
sickle, a five-pointed red star or a symbol depicting any of the above. Such an offence is 
punishable with a fine unless a more serious crime is committed. The crimes of genocide 
(section 155) and apartheid (section 157) are also included in the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the Government, racist motivation is an aggravating circumstance 
under the Criminal Code in case of homicide (section 166 (2) (c)) and assault (section 170 
(3)). The authorities also reported that the Criminal Code was amended in 2010 in order to 
introduce a new crime of denial of the holocaust, and a new administrative offence which 
consists in the conduct and participation in the activities of a civil organization disbanded 
by Court decision or the wearing of a uniform or vestment of such a dissolved civil 
organization at a public event.<footnote name="4">5. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at the rise of the Jobbik in Hungary 
and at its openly anti-Roma and anti-Semitic statements. Several interlocutors reported that 
the Jobbik&#8217;s discourse has been focused mainly on Roma, including on the alleged &#8220;Gypsy 
criminality&#8221; that needs to be combatted to protect ethnic Hungarians and maintain public 
order. Some interlocutors highlighted that traditional political parties were not firm enough 
in condemning such extremist rhetoric, which legitimizes this and aggravates the intolerant 
climate towards the Roma.

</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the mission the Special Rapporteur noted that significant changes have been 
made in government bodies responsible for issues related to the mandate. They include in 
particular the creation of the State Secretariat for Social Inclusion under the Ministry of 
Public Administration and Justice, which has the primary responsibility for Roma issues. 
The positive contribution of the Equal Treatment Authority, the administrative body created 
in 2005 in accordance with the above-mentioned Equal Treatment Act should also be 
highlighted.  
</p>
<p>21. The Authority is responsible for ensuring equality and equal treatment by 
monitoring the implementation of the Equal Treatment Act. It is competent to receive 
complaints and investigate matters in response to individual complaints, <i>actio popularis 
</i>submitted by NGOs and other stakeholders, or on its own initiative. The Authority may also 
impose fines. Its decisions are binding and may be made public. The Authority also gives 
opinions on draft legislation, makes proposals to the Government, and works closely with 
civil society actors. According to the report of the activity of the Authority in 2010, among 
the nearly 1,500 complaints, the Authority launched proceedings in 377 cases, in 40 of 
which it established that a violation of rights had occurred, and 244 cases were continuing 
in 2011. The Authority established that the vast majority of complaints received are related 
to employment and that there had been direct discrimination in 36 cases, harassment in 6 
cases, and 1 case each of indirect negative discrimination, unlawful segregation and 
retribution.5

annual report on his or her activities. (5) The detailed rules for the Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights and his or her deputies shall be determined by an Act&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>25. At the time of the mission the Special Rapporteur met with the Parliamentary 
Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. After the mission he was 
informed that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of 
Information had been replaced by an independent authority for the protection of personal 
data and the access to data of public interest (article VI (3)). In this regard the Special 
Rapporteur regrets the lack of ethnically disaggregated data in Hungary. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National and ethnic minorities  
</b></p>
<p>26. Hungary officially recognizes 13 minorities, including Armenians, Bulgarians, 
Croatians, Germans, Greeks, Polish, Roma, Romanians, Ruthenians, Serbians, Slovaks, 
Slovenians and Ukrainians. The Government has made significant efforts to fulfil its 
international human rights obligations with respect to the situation of its national and ethnic 
minorities. Commendable measures have been taken, especially in the areas of culture and 
education, where the Government has developed a very elaborate policy which recognizes 
and promotes the languages of the 13 minorities. The authorities have also continued to 
provide support for activities to preserve and develop the cultural heritage of national 
minorities, which is very much welcomed. However, at the time of the mission the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of a decrease in the Government financial support for bilingual 
schools. Some interlocutors also indicated that mainstream schools do not provide 
sufficient space for minority language teaching and that the most common model remains 
one where minority languages are taught as a second or foreign language.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Act No. LXXVII on the Rights of National and 
Ethnic Minorities, which is the main law regulating the rights of minorities in Hungary. 
Adopted in 1993, the law prohibits assimilation, exclusion and segregation of minorities 
(article 4 (1)) and any violation of the principle of equal treatment (article 3 (5)).7 It further 
recognizes the right for minorities to establish local, national and regional (article 5 (1)) 
minority self-governments<b> </b>primarily competent to deal with cultural and educational 
affairs. The<b> </b>system of minority self-governments remains an important part of the 
autonomy granted to minorities in these areas. The Special Rapporteur also appreciates the 
amendments made to improve the electoral system of minority self-government and ensure 
that only those belonging to a given minority take part in the election. The system of 
minority self-governments is welcomed by the Special Rapporteur as good practice. 
However during the mission some interlocutors expressed concern at the decrease in 
government financial support to minority self-governments. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10  
</b></p>
<p>regulation in 2010 which prescribes that in addition to the 200 parliamentary 
representatives, a maximum of 13 representatives can be elected to ensure the 
parliamentary representation of national and ethnic minorities.8 The new electoral law is 
expected to be implemented during the national elections scheduled for 2014. Furthermore, 
the Government indicated that individuals belonging to minorities have been members of 
the National Assembly for decades as representatives of the various political parties and 
that delegates of the 13 national minority self-governments can participate actively in the 
work of the minority committees and other committees in the Parliament.9 However NGO 
representatives argued that the current situation is not adequate to ensure the proper 
representation of minority interests at the national level and that a specific mechanism for 
their representation in the Parliament is needed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The situation of the Roma minority 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Key measures adopted by the Government 
</b></p>
<p>29. The situation of Roma, who represent the largest minority group in Hungary, was 
more often raised by the different interlocutors in comparison with the 12 other Hungarian 
national and ethnic minorities. All the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors, including 
</p>
<p>Government officials and civil society representatives, agreed that the situation of Roma 
individuals had not improved in recent years, but rather worsened. The problems faced by 
the Roma minority have been addressed by the previous10 and current Government from the 
wide perspective of economically and socially disadvantaged groups. A policy was 
confirmed by the Minister of State for Social Inclusion during a meeting with the Special 
Rapporteur. According to the authorities Roma mainly face economic and social difficulties 
that have their origins both in the collapse of the Communist regime, when the majority of 
Roma lost their jobs, and the current economic situation. The authorities do not consider it 
to be primarily a matter of racial discrimination or racial prejudice as such. Civil society 
interlocutors tended to argue that the current problems experienced by Roma are due to 
racism, racial discrimination and deeply rooted negative stereotypes against Roma.  
</p>
<p>30. Key legal, policy, and institutional measures were initiated and implemented by the 
Government with regard to Roma. The Special Rapporteur welcomes in particular the 
adoption in 2007 by the parliament of the resolution on the Decade of Roma Inclusion 
Programme Strategic Plan for 2007-2015, which sets a framework for action to improve 
Roma access to education, employment, housing and health care; the development and 
adoption of the European Union framework for national Roma integration strategies under 
the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2011; the National 
Social Inclusion Strategy &#8220;Extreme Poverty, Child Poverty and the Roma&#8221; for 2011-2020 
set up as part of the implementation of the European Union Framework for National 
Strategies for Roma Integration; and the Framework Agreement between the Government 
and the National Roma Self-Government drawn up in the course of the mission. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>sufficient funding for its implementation. During the mission, some civil society and Roma 
representatives complained about the lack of implementation of the policies developed for 
Roma, including the Decade Strategic Plan. This was also recognized by the authorities, 
who admitted that pilot projects set up in this framework had not been fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>32. The newly adopted Framework agreement between the Government and the 
National Roma Self-Government was presented by the Government as a major step in 
moving forward to the improvement of the situation of Roma. According to the authorities 
the programme aims to improve the living conditions of Roma and facilitate their social 
inclusion through more employment and educational measures. The agreement establishes a 
joint decision-making system between the Government and the National Roma Self-
Government. The authorities indicated that special measures should be implemented in this 
context. Short- and long-term objectives have been set, some to be achieved by 2015, 
including inter alia the involvement of 100,000 unemployed Roma in the labour market, the 
realization of a comprehensive education reform which will result in 20,000 young Roma 
people learning marketable skills in one of the 50 vocational schools taking part in the 
inclusion programme, and support for the education of 10,000 Roma young people in high 
schools. The Government indicated to the Special Rapporteur that the authorities will take 
responsibility for financing the implementation of the programme.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation at the adoption of the Framework 
agreement. However he regrets the absence of measures to prevent and eliminate racial 
discrimination against Roma. Furthermore, given the overwhelmingly low educational 
levels attained by the Roma the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the public jobs to be 
created may be temporary low-skilled and low-paid employment similar to those already 
existing in the framework of some public work programmes implemented at the local level, 
as for instance in P&#233;cs, where the Special Rapporteur met with the Mayor of the City. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government duly consider the concerns expressed 
by him during its implementation of the Framework Agreement. Moreover some civil 
society representatives argued that the Framework Agreement is essentially a political 
agreement to satisfy public demand which contains very ambitious objectives that are not 
appropriate to the current situation of Roma and may not be implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Structural and institutionalized discrimination 
</i></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that much has been achieved in the past few 
years to fight against racism, racial discrimination and intolerance against Roma and to 
integrate them. He commends the Government for all the efforts made in this regard. 
However, despite the adoption of several positive initiatives, many Roma are still not 
sufficiently integrated into Hungarian society. In addition, Roma continue to suffer from 
racism and racial discrimination which aggravate their socio-economic marginalization and 
exclusion. They experience structural and institutionalized discrimination that will require 
urgent and more vigorous action from the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12  
</b></p>
<p>within public institutions, including the police and the judiciary. During a meeting held 
with the Ministry of Interior the Special Rapporteur was informed about initiatives 
developed both by the Police and the Ministry related inter alia to the recruitment of Roma 
to the police, racial prejudices, racially motivated crime, and &#8220;multicultural conflicts&#8221;. 
While such steps are welcomed, the Special Rapporteur is very concerned at reports 
received during the mission about the persistence of racial profiling against the Roma by 
the police; cases of police officers refusing to record Roma complaints and regularly 
abusing them verbally and physically; and disproportionate fines imposed by the police on 
Roma on a regular basis in breach of the law. Some interlocutors, including Roma victims 
themselves, also indicated that investigations of racist crime against Roma have been 
limited. Discriminatory behaviour by the police must stop, and Hungary must take concrete 
measures to end impunity for police misconduct. Furthermore, while discussing the 
judiciary with several interlocutors, including Roma individuals, the Special Rapporteur 
was told that Roma continue to experience racial discrimination and strong racial prejudice 
from within the judiciary, including from judges. It was reported that the situation is of 
particular concern in the criminal justice system. For instance, cases of Roma being 
sentenced more severely by the Courts were highlighted.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Employment 
</i></p>
<p>37. According to civil society representatives, Roma are often discriminated against in 
employment and as a result face a high rate of unemployment. The unemployment rate of 
Roma is estimated at 70 per cent, more than 10 times the national average;11 most are 
reported to live in extreme poverty. According to the authorities, an important solution to 
the integration of Roma is the creation of public jobs. However, civil society 
representatives argue that public jobs have produced limited results in reducing the Roma 
unemployment rate and lifting them out of poverty and social exclusion. The majority of 
Roma continue to be largely unemployed and dependent on social benefits. They also 
stressed that the number of public jobs available to Roma is very limited, and that these are 
short-term, low-skilled jobs, with low salaries, such as garbage collectors or street 
sweepers. In this regard the Special Rapporteur would like to express his extreme concern 
at information received subsequent to the mission about a public work programme 
implemented in Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata under which Roma had to work in inhuman circumstances 
under the surveillance of guards while receiving low salary for such jobs.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Education  
</i></p>
<p>38. Some measures have been initiated to tackle discrimination and segregation against 
Roma in the area of education, including for instance the 1993 Act LXXIX on Public 
Education, which prohibits segregation, the reconsideration of the configuration of 
catchment areas in cases where segregation occurs, as well as public education equal 
opportunity action plans, which according to the authorities is an obligation for the schools 
and the municipalities.12 In the city of Moh&#225;cs where the Special Rapporteur met with the 
Office of the Mayor, the city Council created the General Education Center (Moh&#225;cs 
T&#233;rs&#233;gi &#193;ltal&#225;nos M&#369;vel&#337;d&#233;si K&#246;zpont), the aim of which is to effectively prevent 
segregation in schools. Despite such initiatives the lack of equality in access to quality 
education for Roma persists. As witnessed by the Special Rapporteur, segregation of Roma 
children in the area of education and their poor educational achievements remain an issue

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>of great concern. During the mission the Special Rapporteur visited a primary school in 
&#211;zd where the vast majority of children were Roma. He also met with three generations of 
Roma who have not been to school. Furthermore, some of the interlocutors of the Special 
Rapporteur reported a decline in the quality of education in regions inhabited by Roma and 
the placement of Roma children in special schools. While the authorities reported during 
the mission that five more years were needed to eliminate segregation in the area of 
education, the Special Rapporteur strongly reiterates his call to the Government to urgently 
reinvigorate the education of Roma with all the necessary resources. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Housing and health  
</i></p>
<p>39. During the mission the Special Rapporteur met with Roma families living in public 
social housing lacking basic services and infrastructure, including running water and 
electricity, in a segregated area in &#211;zd. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some 
housing programmes have been developed, some of which as part of the Decade of Roma 
Inclusion Program Strategic Plan. They include for instance the &#8220;Housing and Social 
</p>
<p>Integration Programme for Residents of Roma settlements&#8221; implemented in 30 
municipalities, and the setting up of 160 anti-segregation plans to address the segregation of 
Roma in the area of housing. The Special Rapporteur welcomes such initiatives but, with 
regard to housing, remains concerned at the continuing discrimination, segregation and 
substandard living conditions of Roma and reports of forced evictions of Roma. In addition, 
while the health system was reformed in 2006, a supervisory authority set up to receive 
complaints in case of infringement of the rights of patients, and several programmes 
elaborated by the authorities to raise awareness among medical staff of the specific 
situation of Roma, the Roma minority continue to face discrimination in the access to 
health care and services and have a lower life expectancy rate. 
</p>
<p><i> (e) Political participation 
</i></p>
<p>40. Although there are four Roma in the current Hungarian Parliament, in general Roma 
are still widely excluded from public and political life in Hungary. In this regard the 
Government highlighted the programmes set up to ensure the presence of Roma in the 
administration, the important role of the national Roma self-government, and the political 
organization of Roma through various associations, including the Longo Drom. However 
civil society interlocutors expressed concerns about the fact that both the Longo Drom and 
the current National Roma Self-Government are led by a member of the ruling Fidesz-
Hungarian Civic Union (Fidesz) party, which raises the issue of the real autonomy of the 
National Roma Self-Government and the effective empowerment of the Roma minority in 
general. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Racial violence  
</i></p>
<p>41. Roma in Hungary remain subject to increased violence, which is particularly 
alarming. Several interlocutors reported racist attacks and hate crimes committed against 
Roma individuals, which have resulted in some cases in their houses being burnt, and 
injuries to and deaths of Roma individuals. Furthermore some interlocutors highlighted that 
for fear of further stigmatization and violence some Roma refuse to report incidents to the 
police. The low level of prosecution and sanctions in cases concerning Roma victims, 
which fosters impunity, is also of concern.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Anti-Semitism 
</b></p>
<p>42. As stated earlier there are an estimated 100,000 Jews in Hungary. The Jews are not 
recognized as an ethnic or national minority despite several initiatives to obtain such </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14  
</b></p>
<p>recognition. As mentioned earlier, the Criminal Code was amended in 2010 in order to 
introduce a new crime of denial of the holocaust, which is welcomed by the Special 
Rapporteur as a positive step in combating anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, during the mission 
some interlocutors reported that anti-Semitic discourse is a long-standing problem which 
still persists in Hungary. In addition, reports received from some NGOs in the preparation 
of the mission indicated that the already rampant anti-Roma sentiments have been merged 
with anti-Semitism, including in public statements. In 2010, indications of rising anti-
Semitism in Hungary were highlighted with concern by the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Hate speech 
</b></p>
<p>43. During the mission representatives of the OSCE/ODHIR and some NGO 
representatives drew the attention of the Special Rapporteur to the rise of hate speech in 
Hungary. In this regard the often virulent and widespread anti-Roma statements in the 
media, and in public and political discourse were reported. While the Special Rapporteur 
takes note of the aforementioned provisions of the Criminal Code on the incitement to 
hatred against national, ethnic and racial groups, he would like to strongly reiterate the 
importance of ensuring that the laws and their implementation strictly comply with 
international human rights standards, including article 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Extremist political parties, movements and groups 
</b></p>
<p>44. Since the first visit in 1999 of a Special Rapporteur on racism, Hungary has 
witnessed a strong resurgence of extremist ideas propagated by politicians, public figures 
and some groups of individuals who encourage racial discrimination and incite racial 
violence, especially against the Roma minority. The parliamentary elections held in April 
2010 confirmed this worrying trend, when the political party named &#8220;Movement for a 
Better Hungary&#8221; (Jobbik Magyarorsz&#225;g&#233;rt Mozgalom) received 16.67 per cent of the votes 
and gained 47 seats in the Hungarian Parliament. As a result it became the third biggest 
political party in the Parliament. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Civil Guard Association for a Better Future, with whom the Special Rapporteur 
met in Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata, together with the local representative of Jobbik and the local Roma 
self-government, is reported to have organized public rallies dressed in paramilitary style 
black boots and uniforms in Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata and Hajd&#250;hadh&#225;z. The organization is reported 
to have threatened, harassed and intimidated Roma with weapons and dogs and incited 
hatred against them. The same organization reportedly organized similar rallies in 
Zagyvar&#233;kas, B&#233;k&#233;scsaba, Galgagyorgy, Tat&#225;rszentgy&#246;rgy, Miskolc, and Saj&#243;b&#225;bony. In 
Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata the Special Rapporteur noted the presence of police officers in areas 
inhabited by Roma but he also observed that the majority of the Roma inhabitants were still 
afraid. He met with some Roma victims who expressed serious concern about the 
prosecution carried out against them in the context of the Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata events. According 
to the authorities swift and decisive action was taken to prevent the organized intimidation 
of Roma in Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata. The Government further reported that in response to the events 
in Gy&#246;ngy&#246;spata and Hajd&#250;hadh&#225;z, the legislation was amended to enable the prosecution 
and punishment with custodial sentences of these extremist groups. However, according to 
Roma victims and some NGOs no serious action was taken by the authorities, including the 
police, to prevent the activities of the Civil Guard Association for a Better Future, nor 
investigate and prosecute their conduct. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and statelessness 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16  
</b></p>
<p>reported by some interlocutors about the situation of homeless refugees, especially the 
significant number of Somali refugees who are homeless in Hungary.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that matters related to asylum have been 
mainly considered in the context of the fight against illegal migration and prevention of 
abuse of the asylum system. As a result more restrictive measures were adopted. In this 
regard, concerns were expressed about the manner in which the detention policy applying 
to foreigners, including asylum-seekers apprehended for unlawful entry or stay, has been 
implemented recently. Some interlocutors pointed out that a significant proportion of 
asylum seekers and most of the irregular migrants are routinely detained in detention 
facilities administered by the police. In this regard the harsh conditions of detention of 
asylum seekers and irregular migrants, including women and elderly persons, was brought 
to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned 
about the reported cases of ill-treatment in immigration detention facilities; the prolonged 
periods of administrative detention of asylum seekers without access to effective remedies 
to challenge the detention; and the potential illegal detention of unaccompanied minors. 
The lack of transparency of the detention regime and practice, and the replacement in the 
detention facilities of police officers by untrained civil security guards who had reportedly 
committed abuses in detention centres were reported. It was also reported that judges who 
decide on detention are mainly criminal law judges who do not have the relevant 
knowledge and competence on human rights, refugees and asylum seekers law. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of the new Constitution which came into 
force on 1 January 2012. He believes that certain of its provisions deserve review, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inter alia, in order to strengthen the protection of the rights of minorities, in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that important steps have been taken by the 
Government in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance. Indeed important legislative, institutional and policy measures have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed. However the Government has to ensure that all the measures taken lead to 
</b></p>
<p><b>an effective outcome that will address the situations of all those experiencing racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance in Hungary. </b> 
54. <b>An important criterion in measuring Government success in this endeavour 
will certainly be the removal of Roma from poverty, lack of education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>unemployment, social exclusion and the elimination of racism, racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and intolerance against them. To date, Hungary has not succeeded in fully integrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma into society. Their living conditions continue to be significantly worse than 
</b></p>
<p><b>those of the general population and they face structural and institutionalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. There is a great urgency to reinvigorate the education of Roma and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>change mindsets to develop a more tolerant and inclusive society. </b> 
55. <b>The lack of adequate implementation of the broad range of initiatives 
developed and the insufficiency of funding to ensure their effective implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain a major challenge. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>further efforts to ensure effective implementation of the measures taken, starting at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the local level, while ensuring that the necessary human, financial and technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources are allocated and that minorities and all the relevant actors including civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society are involved. He also recommends the collection of ethnically disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p><b>data and statistics in accordance with international human rights standards, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect for the principle of self-identification. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On national and ethnic minorities  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure adequate 
representation of ethnic and national minorities in the Hungarian Parliament. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover minority self-governments should be strengthened, including through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocation of adequate financial, human and technical resources. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur also recommends that the Government take the necessary measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that students learning in minority language schools, or studying minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages in bilingual schools or as a second or foreign language, have sufficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>learning hours and access to qualified teachers. He recommends that the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide adequate financial resources to bilingual schools. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the situation of the Roma minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Structural and institutionalized discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to build upon the richness 
and diversity of its population to develop a more tolerant and inclusive society. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard he strongly recommends that the Government invest in education. School 
</b></p>
<p>classes which are inclusive and representative of the society&#8217;s ethnic and cultural 
</p>
<p><b>diversity, unbiased schoolbooks aimed at reflecting with objectivity and accuracy the 
</b></p>
<p><b>history of minorities, well-trained teachers and human rights courses are in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect essential to instil a tolerant and respectful mindset from an early age. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Racial discrimination, racism and negative stereotypes against the Roma 
minority within State institutions, including the police and the judiciary, is a reality 
</b></p>
<p><b>that Hungary should not deny. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop regular and mandatory human rights training for State agents including 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the police and the judiciary, ensuring that such training includes issues related 
</b></p>
<p><b>to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Efforts should 
</b></p>
<p><b>also be made to improve relations between the police and Roma to restore confidence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and allow better reporting of racist acts to the police. Proper and prompt investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of complaints against police misconduct towards Roma should also be ensured.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take all the necessary 
measures to reduce the high Roma unemployment rate. A first step in this direction is 
</b></p>
<p><b>to properly address racial discrimination against Roma in the labour market, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that discriminatory attitudes against the Roma in employment are effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctioned. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that institutions financed by the State budget employing more than 50 persons and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal entities in which the State has a majority ownership effectively establish and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement equal opportunities plans and recruit Roma. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to ensure decent and 
qualified jobs for Roma by avoiding addressing their unemployment mainly through 
</b></p>
<p><b>public work programmes that have already yielded limited results in reducing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma unemployment rate and removing them from poverty and social exclusion. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages the Government to adopt more special measures to promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment of Roma in both the public and private sectors. </b></p>

<p><b>  Education 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government increase efforts to 
eliminate racial discrimination and segregation of Roma in education in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure an inclusive education system and high quality education for Roma. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government implement more special 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to ensure access to higher education for Roma; strengthen and increase the 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring of schools to ensure that national policies with respect to desegregation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equal access to education are fully implemented including at the local level; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase measures to address the problem of school dropout of Roma children. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to ensure that children who 
</b></p>
<p><b>cannot cope with education in an integrated classroom are provided with special 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance, not sent to special schools and step up efforts to reintegrate Roma children 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently enrolled in special schools into mainstream schools.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Housing and health 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(a)  guarantee the right of Roma to housing without discrimination as 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided in article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Racial Discrimination (the Convention) and act firmly against any discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices affecting them in this area, taking into consideration general 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation No. 27 (2000) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination on discrimination against Roma and general comment No. 7 (1997) of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on forced evictions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)  Take all the necessary measures to ensure that Roma enjoy the full right

<p><b>to health and health care, and address discriminatory practices among medical

</b></p>
<p><b>culture and identity among such personnel. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Roma must be effectively empowered to decide on their own interests and 
future. In this regard the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the effective participation of Roma in political and public life and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate representation in parliament and political parties. It is important that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government ensure that the composition and leadership of the National Roma Self-
</b></p>
<p><b>G</b>overnment truly reflect the Roma minority&#8217;s choice and interests. The Government 
</p>
<p><b>is also encouraged to take the necessary measures to ensure that a wide range of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma organizations and associations be provided with the necessary resources, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including financial, to effectively participate in public affairs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Racial violence 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take all the 
necessary measures to ensure the protection of Roma from violence and provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate responses to their security concerns. In this regard the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government develop a comprehensive national strategy to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent and combat racial violence against Roma and that ethnically disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p><b>data on racist crimes be collected. Prompt, thorough and impartial investigations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>racist acts against Roma must be carried out and those responsible adequately 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecuted and sanctioned. Roma victims should be provided with access to effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal remedies and adequate reparation. Furthermore, law enforcement agents should </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>be provided with the necessary instructions, procedures and resources to identify, 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigate and register racist crimes against the Roma.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On anti-Semitism 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for further vigilance and action from the 
Government with regard to anti-Semitism and recommends that the Government step 
</b></p>
<p><b>up efforts to prevent and eliminate all the manifestations of anti-Semitism, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a wide range of preventive measures and prosecution when necessary. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On hate speech 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take resolute 
measures to condemn hate speech, including against the Roma. He recalls that, due to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the audience they reach and the moral authority they carry, politicians are urged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid stigmatization of Roma in their statements and political debates, and to firmly 
</b></p>
<p><b>condemn any racist action or discourse against Roma. The Special Rapporteur, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>insisting on the need to preserve freedom of expression, also encourages the media to 
</b></p>
<p><b>play a more positive role in promoting tolerance, respect, and mutual understanding 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to avoid racist, stereotypical and discriminatory reporting of Roma. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly reiterates the importance of ensuring that the 
laws and their implementation strictly respect international human rights standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination. In this regard the Special Rapporteur refers to the four joint written 
</b></p>
<p><b>submissions presented by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinion and expression to the series of expert workshops of the Office of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the prohibition of incitement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>national, racial or religious hatred.14 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On extremist political parties, movements and groups 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the rise of the Jobbik political party 
and the development of extremist paramilitary groups are linked to some extent to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>failure to fully integrate Roma into Hungarian society and the difficulty of traditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties in dealing adequately with the socio-economic problems, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>unemployment, of the Hungarian population. As a result Roma became the main 
</b></p>
<p><b>targets of extremist individuals and politicians, who take advantage of the general

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20  
</b></p>
<p><b>discontent within the population and the current economic crisis to blame them for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the insecurity and socio-economic difficulties endured by the population.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>It is urgent to introduce the necessary safeguards against the anti-Roma and 
anti-Semitic discourse of Jobbik, which flouts human rights including the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-discrimination and equality. In this regard political leaders and political parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>should refrain from endorsing directly or indirectly the rhetoric propagated by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Jobbik and ensure that respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rule of law be the cornerstone of any programme or activity developed by political 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Finally while the Special Rapporteur notes the Government</b>&#8217;s<b> efforts to end the 
activities of extremist paramilitary organizations, he urges it to take more resolute 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to tackle the phenomenon of extremist paramilitary organizations targeting 
</b></p>
<p><b>Roma, including through adequate prosecution and sanction of individuals belonging 
</b></p>
<p><b>to such organizations who are responsible for racist violence against Roma.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and statelessness  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation accepted by the 
Government during its universal periodic review to establish and implement a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive integration strategy for early stage integration of migrants, refugees 
</b></p>
<p><b>and asylum seekers. He recommends that the strategy include specific measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent and eliminate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b>against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and duly take into account the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of homeless refugees. In this regard the Special Rapporteur recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Government fully cooperate with all the relevant actors, including civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society and UNHCR.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Regarding statelessness, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
review the provisions of Act II of 2007, especially those provisions establishing legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>stay in Hungary as a pre-condition for applying for stateless status, and ensure its full 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with its international human rights obligations including the 1954 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, which has been ratified by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take the necessary measures 
to put an end to the harsh conditions of detention of asylum seekers and illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, including acts of ill-treatment in detention facilities. He recalls that 
</b></p>
<p>paragraph 30 of the Durban Programme of Action &#8220;urges States (b) <b>to review and 
</b></p>
<p><b>revise, where necessary, their immigration laws, policies and practices so that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>free of racial discrimination and compatible with </b>States&#8217; obligations under 
</p>
<p><b>international human rights instruments; (d) to ensure that migrants, regardless of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their immigration status, detained by public authorities are treated with humanity 
</b></p>
<p><b>and in a fair manner, and receive effective legal protection and, where appropriate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the assistance of a competent interpreter in accordance with the relevant norms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law and human rights standards, particularly during interrogation; (e) 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that the police and immigration authorities treat migrants in a dignified and 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-</b>discriminatory manner, in accordance with international standards&#8221;<b>. He further 
</b></p>
<p><b>recalls to the Government the recommendations accepted during its universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review to reduce administrative detention of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and only use it in exceptional cases; and to undertake measures aimed at avoiding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>extension of administrative detention of asylum-seekers. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government ensure that more 
administrative judges with the relevant knowledge of and competence in human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, refugees and asylum seekers standards be involved in the current judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>review process of immigration detention facilities. The Special Rapporteur also 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government ensure that specialized human rights training with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a particular focus on the principle of non-discrimination and the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, refugees and asylum seekers is provided to members of the judiciary, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including criminal judges, police officers and immigration officials and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>interested groups including civil guards working in detention facilities, and social 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers dealing with unaccompanied minors. Training with a special emphasis on 
</b></p>
<p><b>bridging intercultural and linguistic gaps should also be provided. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the legal human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Hungary accede to the international 
and regional human rights instruments for which it is not yet a party, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Members of Their Families. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that the 
</b>constitutional changes concerning minorities&#8217; rights will not weaken the current legal 
</p>
<p><b>and institutional framework for their protection, especially with regard to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>representation and participation in public affairs. Furthermore, in the light of general 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination on discrimination against non-citizens, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that all the constitutional provisions restricting certain human rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Hungarian citizens including the right to education and the enjoyment of social 
</b></p>
<p><b>security, be revised to extend equal human rights protection to all individuals residing 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Hungary, including non-citizens.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages the authorities to strengthen measures 
to ensure the effective implementation of the Equal Treatment Act and monitor its 
</b></p>
<p><b>application closely. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Criminal Code does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>explicitly include a general provision under which racist motivation constitutes an 
</b></p>
<p><b>aggravating circumstance. He therefore recommends that the Government explicitly 
</b></p>
<p><b>introduces into the Criminal Code a general provision according to which committing 
</b></p>
<p><b>an offence with racist motivation or aim constitutes an aggravating factor allowing for 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhanced penalties.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the institutional human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that measures be taken to ensure the 
Equal Treatment Authority is fully independent of the Government and to provide it 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the necessary technical, human and financial resources. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>also recommends further steps for the development of accessible and understandable 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising measures on the work and competencies of the Authority aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the general public. Civil society actors could be major partners. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur regrets the abolition of the Parliamentary 
Commissioner for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities and encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to re-establish it in light of the need for an independent body to monitor 
</b></p>
<p><b>the promotion and protection of the rights of minorities. </b></p>
