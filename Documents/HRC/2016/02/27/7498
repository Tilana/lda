<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences, conducted a follow-up mission to Mauritania from 24 to 27 February 2014. 
The main objective of her visit was to assess new developments since her first mission in 
2009 and the initiatives taken by the Government in response to her recommendations. In 
particular, she assessed the status of the road map for the implementation of her 
recommendations to end slavery in Mauritania, which had been prepared in cooperation 
with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to 
promote its formal adoption. The Special Rapporteur also assessed existing legislation, 
institutional mechanisms, programmes and policies aimed at combating all forms of 
slavery, as well as their application in practice. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur hails the commitment and cooperation of Mauritania. She 
found that the Government had made good progress in taking legislative and institutional 
measures aimed at fighting forms of slavery in Mauritania. Following her visit, on 6 March 
2014, the Government formally adopted the road map, which marks a new stage in the 
Government&#8217;s fight against all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, moving from 
adherence to implementation of her recommendations. In particular, the road map provides

<p> Slavery in Mauritania was abolished in 1981, criminalized in 2007 and designated 
as a crime against humanity under the 2012 constitutional reform, which constitutes a 
major achievement for the eradication of slavery practices. This initiative was 
complemented by the Government&#8217;s announcement to establish a dedicated special tribunal 
to prosecute crimes of slavery. Notwithstanding the institutional and legal action taken, 
however, the Special Rapporteur reiterated her concern at the need to implement laws and 
policies fully. With regard to the implementation gap, the Special Rapporteur pointed out 
as examples the low number of prosecutions under the criminalization of slavery act, and 
stressed the need to amend it in order to ensure better protection for victims recognized as 
slaves. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the lack of reliable information, which 
is a prerequisite for the efficiency of Government programmes. She also stresses the need 
for the Government to publish in the Mauritania official gazette the anti-slavery 
conventions it has ratified as soon as possible in order to raise awareness that all work 
should be entered into freely and respect the fundamental rights of the human person.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to her mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 24/3, the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences conducted an official visit from 24 to 27 February 2014 to Mauritania, to 
follow up on the mission conducted in 2009.1 The Special Rapporteur met in Nouakchott 
with Government authorities and representatives of international and non-governmental 
organizations, trade unions, and religious leaders, community members and others working 
in the area of combating all forms of slavery. The objective of her visit was to assess new 
developments since her first visit and the initiatives taken by the Government in response to 
her recommendations. In particular, she sought to assess the status of the road map for the 
implementation of her recommendations to end slavery in Mauritania, which was prepared 
in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), and to promote its formal adoption. 
</p><p>2. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur held extensive consultations with the 
President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly, the 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, the Minister for Justice, the General 
Prosecutor, the Minister of the Interior and Decentralization, the Minister for Social Affairs, 
Children and Family, the Commissioner for Human Rights, Humanitarian Action and 
Relations with Civil Society, the President of the National Human Rights Commission, the 
Director-General of the national agency Tadamoun, and other senior Government 
representatives and representatives of civil society organizations, academia, trade unions, 
the United Nations country team and the donor community, and religious leaders.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Mauritania for 
its full cooperation during the mission and the previous one, as well as during her 
subsequent visits. She also thanks the Government for its renewed invitation for the future, 
as well as for its efforts in preparing the road map for the implementation of the 
recommendations she made as a result of her mission to the country in 2009, as well as the 
constructive dialogue and continuous commitment to cooperate in the fight against all 
forms of slavery. She furthermore greatly appreciates the assistance of numerous civil 
society organizations and institutions within Mauritania and internationally, as well as the 
cooperation of the United Nations country team and OHCHR for facilitating and providing 
logistical support for her mission. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur applauds the pledge made by the Government of Mauritania 
on 6 March 2014 to adopt the road map formally as an essential step forward in the fight 
against slavery. Its implementation will mark a new stage in efforts to eradicate slavery in 
Mauritania and its remnants once and for all. 
</p>
<p>5. The road map embodies the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur 
following her first mission to Mauritania in 2009; she subsequently presented her findings 
and recommendations to the Human Rights Council in 2010 (see also para. 28 below).2 The 
road map is not only an expressed commitment and plan of action prepared by the 
Government of Mauritania in cooperation with the OHCHR Field Office in Nouakchott in 
order to delineate the way forward, but also provides a yardstick for measuring progress 
and tools for identifying remaining or new challenges to the eradication of all forms of 
slavery and slavery-like practices. The aim is to provide constructive guidance, which, it is 
hoped, will assist in the further implementation and, ultimately, the full realization of the 
road map. 
</p>
<p>

<p>6. The Special Rapporteur stresses that her follow-up mission is just an element of 
continuation of the frank and fruitful human rights dialogue commenced in 2009. In 
acknowledging the very good progress made to date, she believes that a common ground 
for action has been found with a concrete common goal, namely, to increase compliance by 
Mauritania with human rights and thereby work towards the eradication of all forms of 
slavery and slavery-like practices. The road map will determine the way forward in 
addressing the different challenges; cohesive cooperation by all stakeholders will be 
required to achieve the full implementation of the road map.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Status of implementation of anti-slavery action 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Slavery laws  
</b></p>
<p>7. Against the background of its ethnic, linguistic and culturally diverse populace, 
consisting of mainly Arab Berbers (also known as &#8220;Moors&#8221;), black Africans (including the 
Pular, Soninke and Wolof) and the Haratine peoples (also called referred to as &#8220;black 
Moors&#8221;, who are black by skin colour, but an integral part of the Moorish ethnic group), 
Mauritania has a shared language and culture, although societal stratification along ethnic 
lines and community groups still persists and translates into functional and practical power 
structures. 
</p>
<p>8. Several attempts have been made to abolish slavery in Mauritania over the past 
century. Order No. 081-234 of 9 November 1981 on the abolition of slavery in Mauritania 
was crucial, despite its vague definition of slavery (namely, not including reference to 
slavery-like practices) and its lack of implementation, given that it was conceived as a 
single measure without enabling factors and/or any transposing regulation. Article 1 
definitively abolished slavery throughout the national territory; article 2 stated that, in 
accordance with sharia law, compensation for the abolition of slavery would be provided to 
rightful claimants (namely, slave owners). The compensation scheme was to be decided by 
a commission composed of <i>ulemas</i> (Islamic scholars), economists and administrators; no 
legal or practical measures were however adopted, which rendered the law de facto 
ineffective.3  
</p>
<p>9. On 3 September 2007, Slavery Act No. 2007-048 was passed, a milestone in the 
eradication of slavery and slavery-like practices. The Act needs, however, to be 
implemented and enforced fully if concrete changes in practice are to be realized. 
</p>
<p>10. The Slavery Act criminalizes slavery and slavery-like practices. It defines in its 
article 2 the exercise of all or some of the rights of property over one or more persons as 
slavery; in article 3, it prohibits all forms of discrimination against persons &#8220;alleged to be a 
slave&#8221;. The slavery <i>corpus delicti</i> refers to &#8220;any person who reduces another person or 
person under their care or responsibility to slavery, or incites them to forfeit their liberty or 
dignity for the purpose of enslaving them&#8221; &#8211; elements of the crime of slavery that must be 
proven in a fair trial before an individual may be tried. The crime is punishable by 5 to 10 
years of imprisonment and a fine of between $2,000 and $4,000. Offences of slavery are 
sanctioned by a prison sentence of between six months and two years, and a fine of $200 to 
$840 can also be imposed. The Act is characterized by its broad regulatory approach, given 
that it also provides for assistance and pecuniary compensation for victims of slavery or of 
slavery-like practices, such as sexual slavery. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the very low number of prosecutions 
under the Act, and urges its application, without any presuppositions, by all institutions and 
</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.1

</p>
<p>stakeholders. As noted by the Special Rapporteur in her previous report,4 the law addresses 
the individual criminal liability of slaveholders only; to be enforced, it relies entirely on the 
police and prosecution, which have shown a reluctance to follow up on allegations of 
slavery-like practices, with most cases being closed without any proper investigation. 
Moreover, no civil cause of action for victims of slavery, which would give victims of 
slavery or an independent mechanism acting on their behalf the right to appeal directly to 
the courts, has yet been introduced. This of particular importance in the case of slavery, 
given that victims of slavery often do not report crimes committed against them, also out of 
fear of retribution or lack of awareness. Moreover, the burden of proof under the Act lies on 
the victim; an investigation can therefore only be initiated if a complaint has been lodged 
by the victim. To date, there has been only one successful prosecution under the Act.  
</p>
<p>12. During her meeting with the Minister for Justice, the General Prosecutor and other 
senior officials, the Special Rapporteur was assured that instructions were given to apply 
and enforce the law, and that prosecutors were instructed to investigate any allegation of 
slavery and slavery-like practices within the scope of the law. The Minister pointed out that 
a commission had been established to review the law and to make suggestions for 
strengthening it, and indicated its readiness to redress any shortcomings. The General 
Prosecutor specified that, since the first condemnation for a case of slavery in 2010, some 
26 final judgements had been handed down to date. The General Prosecutor added that not 
all persons were ultimately convicted, given that magistrates are independent and each case 
had its own procedural process based on the facts of the cases, the body of evidence or 
proof submitted and the crime alleged. The General Prosecutor promised to convey these 
26 final judgements to the Special Rapporteur for her information, though has to date not 
done so. Both the General Prosecutor and the Minister for Justice stressed the cooperation 
with the leading non-governmental organization SOS Esclaves and the Director thereof, 
Boubacar Messaoud, who assists the victims not only during legal proceedings but 
throughout the entire process. 
</p>
<p>13. Besides the general difficulties experienced by rights-holders in their access to the 
judicial sector and the sociocultural obstacles encountered when filing cases of slavery, the 
lack of effective compensation for discrimination and of support for the integration of 
victims beyond a criminal justice approach, as well as a certain disinclination of 
independent judges to prioritize these cases seem to be the main reasons for the low 
numbers of cases brought to trial. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the concerns that she expressed in her previous 
report, namely, that the Slavery Act does not cover all forms of slavery, given that it makes 
no reference to serfdom.  
</p>
<p>15.  The constitutional reform of 2012 (loi constitutionelle No. 2012-015), which 
recognizes slavery as a crime against humanity, reflects the Government&#8217;s commitment and 
political will to eradicate slavery in the country. The new article 13 of the Act specifies 
that, no one may be held in slavery or any form of servitude or subjected to torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It also describes such practices as crimes 
against humanity and punishable by law. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to take all necessary measures to implement this provision in practice. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that, in August 2011, the Government 
had enacted a new law securing the rights of housemaids and domestic workers in private 
households, to replace legislation dating back to 1953 on domestic work. The new law 
seeks to improve and adapt provisions to social and regulatory requirements in the field of 
employment, and lays down the responsibilities, rights and duties of the employee and the

</b></p>
<p>employer.5 The Special Rapporteur encourages in this regard the Government to ratify the 
Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. The National Agency for the Fight against the Consequences of Slavery, for 
Reintegration and for the Fight against Poverty, Tadamoun, established in March 2013 by 
decree No. 2013-048, took over responsibility for overseeing the reintegration of repatriated 
refugees from the former National Agency for the Welcome and Reintegration of Refugees. 
Besides designing, coordinating and implementing reintegration programmes for returnees 
and promoting programmes to eradicate poverty, as advocated by the World Bank in its 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper on Mauritania,6 Tadamoun is responsible for identifying 
and proposing programmes to eradicate the consequences of slavery and to ensure their 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the setting-up of Tadamoun as an important step 
towards a more holistic and sustained approach to address all forms of discrimination and 
poverty at all levels of society. In view of the fact that the new agency combines three 
distinct mandates, however, it will be important to ensure targeted and tailored solutions for 
former slaves in order to prevent the eradication of the vestiges of slavery from being 
incorporated into more general programmes on poverty alleviation.  
</p>
<p>19. According to article 2 of decree No. 2013-048, Tadamoun may lodge complaints 
against alleged perpetrators of slavery-like practices on behalf of the victims as civil party 
and be associated in a court action with the public prosecutor. The Special Rapporteur had 
indeed called for the establishment of an independent Government-funded mechanism, 
enshrined in legislation, that would be empowered to carry out investigations on its own 
initiative and have the standing to bring civil cases of slavery or discrimination before the 
courts. 7  She is however concerned that the agency is, administratively, part of the 
Presidency of the Republic, and that its standing as a civil party contravenes the principle of 
the separation of powers. 
</p>
<p>20. When meeting with agency representatives, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that, even though the legal cell was operational, the agency had not received any complaints 
alleging slavery or slavery-like practices.  
</p>
<p>21. Tadamoun is also engaged in awareness-raising and public information activities, as 
well as in land and property rights protection and restitution cases, and projects to alleviate 
poverty for those living in very precarious conditions. Although at the time of the visit it 
was premature for non-governmental interlocutors to comment on the work of the new 
agency, some indicated that it was not perceived as independent and that they were waiting 
to see how it would develop its legal casework. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the promulgation of Law No. 31 on 20 July 2010, 
which improved compliance of the national human rights commission with the Paris 
Principles and strengthened its independence. As a result, the commission was accredited 
with &#8220;A&#8221; status in 2011 by the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>

<p>23. The national human rights commission is mandated to monitor human rights-related 
issues, to provide advisory opinions on national legislation and to raise awareness on 
human rights issues. It also has the power to investigate human rights violations brought to 
its attention and to take appropriate measures in coordination with the authorities 
concerned. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the commission had conducted 
several investigations in Nouakchott and inside the country on allegations of slavery. To 
date, however, the commission has not submitted any public reports on its investigations, 
which could support the implementation of the law adopted in 2007 and the road map. 
</p>
<p>24. Both the President and the Prime Minister of Mauritania confirmed in a meeting 
with the Special Rapporteur the recently announced intention of the Government to 
establish a special tribunal to prosecute suspects accused of involvement in slavery. The 
justification provided for the creation of the tribunal was to enforce slavery laws 
effectively. The Special Rapporteurs encourages the Government to adopt a rights-based 
approach in establishing and designing the tribunal, which she notes would be an important 
element in the effective implementation of the law and for redress.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Road map 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Drafting history and adoption 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 6 March 2014, the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President of the Republic 
of Mauritania, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, considered and approved a road map for the 
elimination of the vestiges of slavery, drawing on the recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences. The President instructed the Government to take all measures necessary to 
enable the implementation of the measures already taken to eradicate the legacy of slavery. 
</p>
<p>26. Further to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Mauritania in 2009, a workshop, 
jointly organized by the Commissioner for Human Rights and Humanitarian Action and 
Relations with Civil Society in partnership with OHCHR, was held on 21 July 2011 on the 
recommendations she had made following her mission on the economic and social aspects 
of law to foster the fight for and awareness of the eradication of the legacy of slavery. 
Several themes were identified during the workshop: (a) the legal and normative 
framework; (b) policies, measures and programmes; and (c) recommendations for the 
international community and economic actors (namely, foreign enterprises). Each topic was 
covered in depth by a working group, with a view to elaborate a draft plan of action for the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur participated in the follow-up workshop organized by the 
OHCHR on 30 and 31 January 2012 held to validate the plan of action (namely, the road 
map) elaborated during the seminar. The workshop was organized around several 
presentations, including on the context of slavery, the Slavery Act of 2007 and its 
implementation, and the challenges encountered in implementing the recommendations of 
the Special Rapporteur, followed by an interactive dialogue and exchange of views among 
participants. The final road map was prepared in cooperation with the Government, civil 
society actors and OHCHR and its representatives in Nouakchott. 
</p>
<p>28. The road map was the result of a participatory approach involving Governments and 
civil society, with the support of technical and financial partners of Mauritania. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur took note of some editorial and substantive changes made to 
the original road map by the Government prior to its adoption. These changes put a 
particular onus on the Government to implement the road map quickly and 
comprehensively in cooperation with the other participants in the process. The road map </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>has legal, economic and social dimensions designed to bridge the gaps in the 
implementation of the previous laws to eradicate the scourge of slavery, includes concrete 
timelines and attributes responsibilities for the implementation of the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur. The road map is not only an expressed commitment and a 
plan of action for the way forward, but also provides a yardstick for progress and a set of 
tools for identifying the challenges to the eradication of all forms of slavery and slavery-
like practices, with a view to developing constructive recommendations for its 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur hails the formal adoption of the road map as an essential 
step forward in the fight against slavery. Its full implementation will mark a new phase in 
the State&#8217;s efforts to eradicate slavery and its remnants once and for all.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur see the adoption of the road map on 6 March 2014 as a 
turning point, grounded on the way in which this human rights dialogue was conducted, its 
candid and constructive spirit aimed at building cooperation in the fight against slavery in 
Mauritania. The final formal adoption of the road map is not only symbolic, but also marks 
a palpable and traceable commitment of the State and is a benchmark against which 
progress can be measured, impediments to implementation identified and solutions 
discussed and developed to enable, assist and accelerate anti-slavery action and measures. 
</p>
<p>31. The final, formal adoption of the road map should be seen as a unique opportunity 
for further action, as it creates momentum for the fight against slavery. The Special 
Rapporteur pleads for a concerted undertaking by all stakeholders, including government 
authorities, civil society actors, academia, international, United Nations and other agencies 
and the donor community.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Follow-up and monitoring commission 
</b></p>
<p>32. The establishment of a follow-up commission mandated to monitor all measures, 
initiatives, projects, programmes and proposed activities as determined in recommendation 
28 of the road map is an essential element to its effective implementation. The 
recommendation should be realized with immediate effect. Responsibilities in this regard 
lie with the State and civil society actors in the human rights domain, which have a 
tremendously important role in raising awareness, collecting material and monitoring. The 
participation of OHCHR as a standing member of the commission through its Field Office 
in Nouakchott is a particular asset that favours a targeted and systematic approach to the 
eradication of all forms of slavery.  
</p>
<p>33. The overall role of the commission is to engage in follow-up activities to ensure that 
the 29 recommendations contained in the road map are implemented effectively and in a 
timely manner by an interministerial committee, as provided for by the road map. Beyond 
its purely monitoring function, the commission could also act as a platform for support and 
benefit from the input of its members to generate expertise and find solutions, with a view 
to the targeted and efficient adoption and implementation of anti-slavery actions. It could 
ensure a systematic approach to anti-slavery action and its mainstreaming into all 
government policies and legislative and normative action, as well as its ability to instigate 
information-sharing. The Special Rapporteur believes that the commission will be able not 
only to identify obstacles to implementation, but also provide adequate solutions. In no case 
should the commission have a mere watchdog function. </p>

highly values the anti-slavery action taken by the Government, as seen in its 
institution-building, training initiatives and other projects and programmes, which 
reflect its political will and commitment to cooperation. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that the Government has made good progress in the implementation of 
some of the recommendations made in her report submitted following her first 
mission in 2009. Nevertheless, further efforts are necessary in order to implement 
fully the road map, which largely incorporates the recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur after her first mission. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur 
makes the conclusions and recommendations below.  
</b></p>
<p>35. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its efforts to strengthen 
the independence of the national human rights commission, which has a monitoring 
and advisory role, and the establishment of Tadamoun, an autonomous Government-
funded agency mandated to monitor the fight of slavery and its consequences (in 
tandem with the fight against poverty). These efforts are crucial in establishing an 
appropriate, dedicated and functioning institutional infrastructure, which had been 
lacking. It is now important to bring Tadamoun into line with the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur and the requirements of the road map requirements. 
The agency should also be adequately resourced, including in terms of means, training 
and expertise. The integration process should also be furthered through systematic 
efforts that go beyond infrastructure and pay more attention to the protection of 
victims of slavery and slavery-like practices, redress and access to employment and 
livelihood opportunities. Analysis of and research on slavery by the national human 
rights commission, presented in regular public reports, would be crucial for the full 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Slavery law and policies 
</b>36. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Ministry of Justice to expedite the 
review of the Slavery Act of 2007, and calls upon the Government to amend the Act in 
accordance with her previous recommendations and the road map, including to 
ensure better protection for victims recognized as slaves. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the need to accord the right to act as a civil party to an independent 
mechanism in order to ensure that victims of slavery and slavery-like practices are 
assisted by independent lawyers offering pro bono services so that they make take 
effective legal steps and obtain redress, as well as the need to introduce a law against 
discrimination practices based on caste or ethnic slavery. The criminal law approach 
should be accompanied by effective measures to compensate for discrimination and to 
assist the integration of victims of slavery into an independent life. 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>For legislative action to result in concrete changes with a view to ensuring 
enforcement of slavery laws, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government issue orders to the police and the judiciary regarding the enforcement of 
slavery legislation to ensure that allegations of slavery and slavery-like practices are 
effectively investigated and prosecuted.</b>  
</p>
<p>38. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Mauritania to ratify 
ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189). </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>The misinterpretation of religion to justify slavery and slavery-like practices is 
a powerful means to keep slaves in subordination and to perpetuate manifestations of 
slavery. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Ministry of Religious Affairs to 
facilitate the elaboration and pronouncement of a fatwa by religious leaders in 
collaboration with civil society asserting that all forms of slavery and slavery-like 
practices are forbidden under Islam in order to dispel the widespread misperception 
that practices of slavery are linked to Islam. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for affirmative action concerning 
former slaves, given that those who flee often continue to live in slavery, as they lack 
any alternative livelihood. The Government should assist slaves who have fled their 
masters with legal advice, legal assistance to file a case, temporary shelter and, 
wherever possible, microcredit for small businesses. There is also a need to address 
housing, land and property rights of former slaves, given that land ownership and 
land tenure are central to ensuring a sustainable livelihood, effectively &#8220;freeing&#8221; 
former slaves and preventing voluntary servitude. In accordance with the road map, 
the Government should create favourable conditions for equal access to property. The 
planned reception, training and vocational rehabilitation centre for former slaves 
should be transitory in nature, be accessible and provide adequate protection and 
assistance to victims of slavery. In no way should such a centre be used to regroup or 
ghettoize former slaves, or contribute to their further stigmatization.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Awareness-raising and training  
</b>41. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of raising awareness and 
changing peoples&#8217; attitudes and beliefs towards slavery at all levels of society, in 
accordance with the road map. Slavery laws and the road map should be popularized 
and made publicly available, and a nationwide awareness-raising and sensitization 
campaign should be conducted to educate victims of slavery about their rights and the 
remedies available to enable them to pursue legal action and exercise their rights. The 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the Government should, without delay, publish 
the anti-slavery conventions that the State has ratified in the official gazette. 
Awareness-raising efforts should be complemented by mandatory, specialized training 
seminars for judges and representatives of local authorities, gendarmeries, police, the 
media and non-governmental organizations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Study and statistics 
</b>42. <b>As noted during her mission in 2009, the Government lacks definitive data on 
the nature and incidence of slavery in Mauritania, which further exacerbates the 
problem of addressing slavery properly. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to ensure nationwide, systematic and regular collection of disaggregated 
data on all forms of slavery and to conduct a thorough evidence-based study on the 
history and nature of slavery in Mauritania. Given that data have to be used sensibly 
to avoid stigmatization and potential misuse, particular care should be exercised when 
collecting and analysing data in order to respect and enforce data protection and 
privacy.  
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Recommendations for the international community 
</b>43. <b>The international community has an important role to play in assisting and 
cooperating with the Government of Mauritania to implement the road map fully, in 
tandem with non-governmental organizations and all civil society actors. The road 
map, by providing a constant status determination and specifying the appropriate 
follow-up activity needed, will guide actors in their efforts to eradicate all forms of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b>slavery. The road map also provides for a follow-up commission mandated to monitor 
the implementation of the road map. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
members of this monitoring body, and in OHCHR, with its Field Office in 
Nouakchott, be supported in order to allow for active engagement and technical 
assistance projects. Beyond the support for implementation of the road map, 
assistance is still needed in mainstreaming anti-slavery initiatives and action in 
government programmes, as well as in providing technical expertise, human rights 
training and funding of projects to combat slavery and slavery-like practices.  
</b>44. T<b>he Special Rapporteur recommends moreover that the United Nations 
country team identify OHCHR as the common focal point for monitoring the 
implementation of the road map and relevant follow-up. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Recommendations for businesses 
</b>45. <b>The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the possible impact of 
businesses and foreign investors and companies investing in Mauritania that do not 
adhere to international standards preventing the use of child labour and forced 
labour, or to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which provide 
guidance on responsible contracting and State-investor contract negotiations. All 
enterprises should develop corporate social responsibility policies that enable them to 
invest in technical and vocational education and training and to develop professional 
expertise in the Mauritanian labour market.
