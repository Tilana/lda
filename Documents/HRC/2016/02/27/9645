<p><b> I. Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council  
at its twenty-first special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  S-21/1. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ensuring respect for international law in the Occupied  
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the 
</p>
<p>inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the applicability of international human rights law and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
</p>
<p>Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949,
1
 to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention
1
 are 
</p>
<p>under the obligation to respect and ensure respect for the obligations arising from the said 
</p>
<p>Convention in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 
</p>
<p>reaffirming their obligations under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, 
</p>
<p>grave breaches and the responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties,  
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> at the lack of implementation of the recommendations contained 
</p>
<p>in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict of 2009,
2
 and 
</p>
<p>convinced that lack of accountability for violations of international law reinforces a culture 
</p>
<p>of impunity, leading to a recurrence of violations and seriously endangering the 
</p>
<p>maintenance of international peace,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that 9 July 2014 marked the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the advisory 
</p>
<p>opinion by the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction 
</p>
<p>of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that no progress has been made on its 
</p>
<p>implementation, and affirming the urgent need to respect and ensure respect for 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and international human rights law in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Firmly convinced</i> that justice and respect for the rule of law are the indispensable 
</p>
<p>bases for peace, and stressing that prevailing long-standing and systemic impunity for 
</p>
<p>international law violations has created a justice crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</p>
<p>that warrants action, including accountability for international crimes,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the systematic failure by Israel to carry out genuine investigations in an 
</p>
<p>impartial, independent, prompt and effective way, as required by international law, on 
</p>
<p>violence and offences carried out against Palestinians by the occupying forces and settlers 
</p>
<p>and to establish judicial accountability over its military actions in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-21/2

</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the obligations of Israel as the occupying Power to ensure the welfare 
</p>
<p>and safety of the Palestinian civilian population under its occupation in the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip, and noting Israel&#8217;s wilful abdication and 
</p>
<p>rejection of its obligations in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the deliberate targeting of civilians and other protected persons and the 
</p>
<p>perpetration of systematic, flagrant and widespread violations of applicable international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and international human rights law in situations of armed conflict 
</p>
<p>constitute grave breaches and a threat to international peace and security,  
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the massive Israeli military operations in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 13 June 2014, which have involved 
</p>
<p>disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks and resulted in grave violations of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of the Palestinian civilian population, including through the most recent Israeli 
</p>
<p>military assault on the occupied Gaza Strip, the latest in a series of military aggressions by 
</p>
<p>Israel, and actions of mass closure, mass arrest and the killing of civilians in the occupied 
</p>
<p>West Bank,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, 
</p>
<p>including in particular the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, 
</p>
<p>the crisis in access to adequate water and sanitation services affecting nearly 1 million 
</p>
<p>people, and the extensive damage to electricity infrastructure resulting in 80 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population receiving electricity only four hours a day, and underlining the importance of 
</p>
<p>providing emergency humanitarian assistance to them and other victims,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the establishment of the Palestinian national consensus Government on 
</p>
<p>2 July 20143 as an important step towards Palestinian reconciliation, which is crucial for 
</p>
<p>achieving a two-State solution based on the pre-1967 borders and lasting peace, and 
</p>
<p>emphasizing that the situation of the occupied Gaza Strip is unsustainable as long as it 
</p>
<p>remains geographically, politically and economically separated from the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the failure of Israel, the occupying Power, to end its 
</p>
<p>prolonged occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> the widespread, systematic and gross 
</p>
<p>violations of international human rights and fundamental freedoms arising from the Israeli 
</p>
<p>military operations carried out in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 13 June 2014, 
</p>
<p>particularly the latest Israeli military assault on the occupied Gaza Strip, by air, land and 
</p>
<p>sea, which has involved disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, including aerial 
</p>
<p>bombardment of civilian areas, the targeting of civilians and civilian properties in collective 
</p>
<p>punishment contrary to international law, and other actions, including the targeting of 
</p>
<p>medical and humanitarian personnel, that may amount to international crimes, directly 
</p>
<p>resulting in the killing of more than 650 Palestinians, most of them civilians and more than 
</p>
<p>170 of whom are children, the injury of more than 4,000 people and the wanton destruction 
</p>
<p>of homes, vital infrastructure and public properties;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> all violence against civilians wherever it occurs, including the 
</p>
<p>killing of two Israeli civilians as a result of rocket fire, and urges all parties concerned to 
</p>
<p>respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and international human 
</p>
<p>rights law;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls for</i> an immediate cessation of Israeli military assaults throughout the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and an end to attacks against all 
</p>
<p>civilians, including Israeli civilians;  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>5. <i>Welcomes</i> the initiative of Egypt, supported by the League of Arab States, 
</p>
<p>and calls for all regional and international actors to support this initiative in view of 
</p>
<p>securing a comprehensive ceasefire; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately and fully end its 
</p>
<p>illegal closure of the occupied Gaza Strip, which in itself amounts to collective punishment 
</p>
<p>of the Palestinian civilian population, including through the immediate, sustained and 
</p>
<p>unconditional opening of the crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods 
</p>
<p>and persons to and from the Gaza Strip, in compliance with its obligations under 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community, including the States Members of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, international financial institutions and intergovernmental and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, as well as regional and interregional organizations, to provide 
</p>
<p>urgently needed humanitarian assistance and services to the Palestinian people in the Gaza 
</p>
<p>Strip, including by supporting the emergency appeal launched by the United Nations Relief 
</p>
<p>and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East on 17 July 2014;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Expresses</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the rising number of incidents of violence, 
</p>
<p>destruction, harassment, provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers illegally 
</p>
<p>transferred to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against 
</p>
<p>Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, and condemns in the strongest 
</p>
<p>terms the resulting perpetration of hate crimes;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Expresses</i> <i>deep concern</i> at the condition of Palestinian prisoners and 
</p>
<p>detainees in Israeli jails and detention centres, in particular following the arrest by Israel of 
</p>
<p>more than 1,000 Palestinians since 13 June 2014, and calls upon Israel, the occupying 
</p>
<p>Power, to immediately release all Palestinian prisoners whose detention is not in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international law, including all children and all members of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Legislative Council; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians, 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the continued failure of Israel to protect the Palestinian civilian population 
</p>
<p>under its occupation as demanded by international law, and in this context calls for 
</p>
<p>immediate international protection for the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human 
</p>
<p>rights law;  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Recommends</i> that the Government of Switzerland, in its capacity as 
</p>
<p>depositary of the Fourth Geneva Convention,
1
 promptly reconvene the conference of High 
</p>
<p>Contracting Parties to the Convention on measures to enforce the Convention in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ensure its respect in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 1 common to the four Geneva Conventions,
4
 bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>statement adopted by the Conference of the High Contracting Parties on 15 July 1999, and 
</p>
<p>the Declaration adopted by the Conference on 5 December 2001;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> all relevant special procedures mandate holders to urgently seek and 
</p>
<p>gather information on all human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, according to their respective mandates, and to include their 
</p>
<p>observations in their annual reports to the Human Rights Council;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry, to be appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council, to investigate all 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the 
</p>
