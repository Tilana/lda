Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results
INDIANAPOLIS — (PR NEWSWIRE) — August 4, 2016 — Calumet Specialty Products
Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: CLMT) (the “Partnership,” “Calumet,” “we,” “our” or “us”), a leading
independent producer of petroleum-based specialty products, today reported results for the
quarter ended June 30, 2016, as follows:

The Partnership's net loss for the second quarter 2016 includes, but is not limited to, the impact of
four items: (1) $147.3 million of non-cash charges due mainly to the Partnership’s divestiture of
its 50% joint venture interest in Dakota Prairie Refining, LLC (“DPR”); (2) a favorable lower of
cost or market (“LCM”) inventory adjustment of $36.3 million; (3) net expense of $8.2 million
related to the Partnership’s ongoing compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”);
and (4) a $7.1 million loss from unconsolidated affiliates primarily related to DPR, which was
included in results from operations until divested on June 27, 2016.
Management Commentary
“We remain focused on strengthening balance sheet liquidity, reducing operating costs and
pursuing self-help margin capture throughout our portfolio of assets,” stated Tim Go, CEO of
Calumet. “We made meaningful progress in each of these areas during the second quarter,
despite a material year-over-year decline in benchmark refined product margins, elevated RFS
compliance costs and continued commodity price volatility.”
“During the second quarter, we divested our 50% joint venture interest in DPR, resulting in a $32
million net increase in Partnership liquidity, raised $400 million through a senior secured notes
offering and suspended the payment of our quarterly cash distribution to unitholders that
amounted to nearly $225 million of cash outflows in 2015,” continued Go. “These decisive
actions serve to strengthen our balance sheet in a continued volatile market.”
“As of June 30, 2016, we had nearly $470 million in cash and availability on our revolving credit
facility, even after $30 million of related party note repayments and $42 million in cash interest
payments on outstanding unsecured notes during the second quarter 2016,” continued Go.
“Targeted cost reductions and disciplined expense management have resulted in significant
savings on a year-to-date basis,” continued Go. “Total selling, general and administrative
expenses declined $38 million in the first half of 2016, when compared to the prior year period.”
“We continue to source increased volumes of cost-advantaged feedstock in our refining system,
resulting in a lower overall per barrel delivered cost of crude oil,” continued Go. “In the second
quarter 2016, we processed a record 35,600 bpd of cost-advantaged heavy Canadian crude oil
at our Superior and Great Falls refineries.”
“Although specialty products sales volumes increased on a year-over-year basis in the second
quarter 2016, a rapid escalation in crude oil prices during the period impacted segment gross
profit,” continued Go. “We enacted price increases in the specialty products segment in June
2016, in response to higher feedstock costs.”
“Looking ahead to the third quarter 2016, we anticipate increased margin capture within our
specialty products segment, following recent price increases. In our fuel products segment, we
continue to sell gasoline, distillate and jet fuel at a premium to the Gulf Coast in our local
markets, although benchmark refined product margins remain constrained by elevated domestic
fuel products inventories. We expect our asphalt business to reach a seasonal peak in the third
quarter, allowing for the conversion of existing asphalt inventory to cash ahead of the winter,”
concluded Go.

During the second quarter 2016, total specialty products sales volumes increased 15.6% above
year-ago levels. Segment gross profit in the period was impacted by a rapid rise in crude oil
prices, which outpaced adjustments in product pricing during the second quarter 2016. In
response to higher crude oil prices, the Partnership enacted price increases in the specialty
products segment in June 2016.

During the second quarter 2016, a recovery in market premiums on fuel products sold in the
Partnership’s local refining markets was more than offset by an approximately 42% year-over-
year decline in the benchmark Gulf Coast 2/1/1 crack spread and higher RFS compliance costs.
The Great Falls refinery operated at approximately 25,500 bpd during the second quarter 2016,
in line with expectations. Local Great Falls rack prices remain at a premium to Gulf Coast rack
prices.

The average price of NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil declined by more than 20% in
the second quarter 2016 when compared to the second quarter 2015. In response to lower crude
oil prices, domestic oilfield services activity declined sharply during the past year, as the U.S.
land rig count declined more than 53% on a year-over-year basis. The decline in drilling and
completion activity had a material adverse impact on the oilfield services segment in the first half
2016. Although significant cost reduction efforts have taken effect within the segment, customer
activity was well below prior-year levels during the second quarter 2016, resulting in lower net
sales during the period.
Partnership Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had availability under its revolving credit facility of $437.5
million, based on a $502.0 million borrowing base, $64.4 million in outstanding standby letters of
credit and $0.1 million in outstanding borrowings. In addition, the Partnership had $32.2 million of
cash on hand as of June 30, 2016. The Partnership believes it will continue to have sufficient
liquidity from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity and other means by
which to meet its financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated
capital expenditures.

Financial Guidance
Full-Year 2016 Capital Spending Forecast
For the full year 2016, the Partnership anticipates total capital expenditures between $125.0
million and $150.0 million. Anticipated 2016 capital spending includes: (1) $60.0 million to $70.0
million for capital improvement expenditures; (2) $45.0 million to $55.0 million for replacement
and environmental capital expenditures; (3) $10.0 million to $15.0 million for turnaround related
expenditures; and (4) $10.0 million for joint venture contributions.
Full-Year 2016 RFS Compliance Impact Forecast
In conjunction with the Partnership’s ongoing compliance with the RFS, Calumet expects to
purchase blending credits referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). The
Partnership records its outstanding RINs obligation as a balance sheet liability. This liability is
marked-to-market on a quarterly basis to reflect the market price of RINs on the last day of each
quarter. The Partnership expects its gross estimated annual RINs obligation, which includes
RINs that are required to be secured through either blending or through the purchase of RINs in
the open market, will be up to 120 million RINs for the full-year 2016, excluding the potential for
any hardship waivers that may or may not be granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) to any of the Partnership's fuel refineries at a later time. Calumet expects to be
able to satisfy a portion of its 2016 gross RINs obligation through internal blending efforts.
Strategic Update
As previously indicated, Calumet is pursuing a series of cost reduction initiatives, margin
enhancing measures and low-to-no cost projects that are intended to reduce balance sheet
leverage and increase free cash flow on a sustainable basis. By year-end 2018, the program is
projected to generate an incremental $150 million to $200 million of annualized EBITDA per year
as compared to 2015, including $60 million to $75 million of which is expected to be realized in
2016. For information on forward-looking non-GAAP EBITDA, please see the section of this
release entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Operations Summary
The following table sets forth information about our combined operations, excluding the results of
the oilfield services segment. Facility production volume differs from sales volume due to
changes in inventories and the sale of purchased fuel product blendstocks such as ethanol and
biodiesel and the resale of crude oil in our fuel products segment.

Total sales volume includes sales from the production at our facilities and certain third-party
facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements, sales of inventories and the resale
of crude oil to third-party customers. Total sales volume includes the sale of purchased fuel
product blendstocks, such as ethanol and biodiesel, as components of finished fuel products
in our fuel products segment sales.
The increase in total sales volume for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015 is due primarily to increased sales volume of lubricating oils, solvents and
waxes, partially offset by decreased sales of packaged and synthetic specialty products due to
market conditions. Additionally, sales volumes of fuel products including asphalt increased as a
result of increased production at the Great Falls refinery from the expansion project completed in
2016 and market conditions.
The increase in total sales volume for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015 is due primarily to increased sales volume of lubricating oils, diesel and
asphalt as a result of market conditions and increased production at the Great Falls refinery from
the expansion project completed in 2016.
Total feedstock runs represent the bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks processed at our
(2) 
facilities and at certain third-party facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements.
The increase in total feedstock runs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to the same periods in 2015 is due primarily to increased feedstock runs at the Great Falls
refinery from the expansion project completed in 2016 and improved operational reliability,
partially offset by decreased feedstock runs related to the production of solvents as a result of
market conditions.
(3)
Total facility production represents the bpd of specialty products and fuel products yielded
from processing crude oil and other feedstocks at our facilities and at certain third-party
facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements. The difference between total
facility production and total feedstock runs is primarily a result of the time lag between the
input of feedstocks and production of finished products and volume loss.
The change in total facility production for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the same periods in 2015 is due primarily to the operational items discussed above
in footnote 2 of this table.
(4)
Represents production of packaged and synthetic specialty products, including the Royal
Purple, Bel-Ray, Calumet Packaging and Missouri facilities.

accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns; and general economic, market or business
conditions.
For additional information regarding known material factors that could cause our actual results to
differ from our projected results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), including our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We include in this press release the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
and Distributable Cash Flow. We provide reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Distributable Cash Flow to Net income (loss), our most directly comparable financial
performance measure. We also provide a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to Net cash
provided by (used in) operating activities, our most directly comparable liquidity measure. Both
Net income (loss) and Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are calculated and
presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are used as supplemental financial
measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as
investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess:
•
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or
historical cost basis;
•
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our
indebtedness;
•
our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our
industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and
•
the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on
alternative investment opportunities.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to analysts and investors as they exclude
transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze our
ability to pay distributions. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to
meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations.
We define “EBITDA” for any period as net income (loss) plus interest expense (including debt
issuance and extinguishment costs), income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
We define “Adjusted EBITDA” for any period as: (1) net income (loss) plus; (2)(a) interest
expense, (b) income taxes, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) impairment, (e) unrealized
losses from mark-to-market accounting for hedging activities, (f) realized gains under derivative
instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss), (g) non-cash equity based
compensation expense and other non-cash items (excluding items such as accruals of cash
expenses in a future period or amortization of a prepaid cash expense) that were deducted in
computing net income (loss), (h) debt refinancing fees, premiums and penalties, (i) any net loss
realized in connection with an asset sale that was deducted in computing net income (loss) and
(j) all extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain or loss, or revenue or expense; minus
(3)(a) unrealized gains from mark-to-market accounting for hedging activities, (b) realized losses
under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss) and (c) other
non-recurring expenses and unrealized items that reduced net income (loss) for a prior period,
but represent a cash item in the current period.
6
We define “Distributable Cash Flow” for any period as Adjusted EBITDA less replacement and
environmental capital expenditures, turnaround costs, cash interest expense (consolidated
interest expense less non-cash interest expense), income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates,
net of cash distributions and income tax expense (benefit). Distributable Cash Flow is used by
us, our investors and analysts to analyze our ability to pay distributions.
The definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow that are presented in this
release reflect the calculation of “Consolidated Cash Flow” contained in the indentures
governing our 7.625% senior notes due January 15, 2022, that were issued in November 2013
(the “2022 Notes”), our 6.50% senior notes due April 15, 2021, that were issued in March 2014
(the “2021 Notes”), our 7.75% senior notes due April 15, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), that were
issued in March 2015 and our 11.50% senior secured notes due January 15, 2021 (the “2021
Secured Notes”), that were issued in April 2016. We are required to report Consolidated Cash
Flow to the holders of our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes and 2021 Secured Notes and
Adjusted EBITDA to the lenders under our revolving credit facility, and these measures are used
by them to determine our compliance with certain covenants governing those debt instruments.
Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow that are presented in this press release for prior
periods have been updated to reflect the use of the new calculations. Please see our filings with
the SEC, including our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and
Current Reports on Form 8-K, for additional details regarding the covenants governing our debt
instruments.
The preliminary expected range for forward-looking non-GAAP EBITDA contained in this press
release is provided only on a non-GAAP basis, due to the inherent difficulty of calculating items
that would be included in Net income (loss) on a GAAP basis. As a result, reconciliation of
forward-looking non-GAAP EBITDA to GAAP Net income (loss) is not available without
unreasonable effort, and Calumet is unable to address the probable significance of information
that is currently unavailable. It is expected that non-GAAP EBITDA, when reported, will reflect the
exclusion of, among other things, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income
taxes.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives
to net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating
our performance as measured by EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow,
management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measurements. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense
or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Distributable Cash Flow are only three of several measurements that management utilizes.
Moreover, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow in the same manner. The following
tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net
income (loss), our most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, and
Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, our most directly
comparable GAAP liquidity measure, for each of the periods indicated.
