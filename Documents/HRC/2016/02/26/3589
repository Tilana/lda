<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh session from 2 
to 13 May 2011. The review of Solomon Islands was held at the 6th meeting on 4 May 
2011. The delegation of Solomon Islands was headed by Peter Shanel Agovaka, Minister 
for Foreign Affairs and External Trade. At its 10th meeting held on 6 May 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Solomon Islands. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Solomon Islands: Jordan, Mauritius, United 
States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Solomon Islands: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">7. Morocco noted that the national report indicates progress made in spite of 
difficulties linked to high unemployment and poverty and climate change. It commended </footnote>/11/SLB/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">6. Costa Rica acknowledged the social progress achieved by Solomon Islands in the 
area of education and health. It considered that to further improve the situation it would be 
important to grant special attention to girls&#8217; access to education. It was concerned by human 
rights constraints provoked by external factors such as climate change. It recalled, in that 
regard, Human Rights Council resolution 16/11 and invited Solomon Islands to present its 
contribution and comments to OHCHR. It made recommendations. 
</footnote>/11/SLB/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">5. In response to questions raised by countries on the issue of age of criminal 
responsibility, the delegation noted that the Penal Code provides for a current minimum age 
of criminal responsibility of 8 years old. A child under the age of 12 was not criminally 
responsible for an act or omission unless he or she had the capacity to know that he or she 
ought not to do an act or an omission. The minimum age of criminal responsibility was 
currently being considered by the Law Reform Commission, under its mandate to review 
the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedures Code. 
</footnote>/11/SLB/3 and A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">4. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland hoped that the 
Government of Solomon Islands would take the opportunity offered by the review to 
demonstrate that it was genuine in its desire to move on from the tensions and was serious 
in its attempts to rebuild the country. It recognized the challenges faced by Solomon Islands 
and welcomed the announcement of a standing invitation to the special procedures. It hoped 
the Government would seek technical assistance and cultivate the involvement of civil 
society in the follow up to the review. It asked whether the Government would consider 
raising the minimum ages regarding child labour and criminal responsibility. It made 
recommendations. 
</footnote>/11/SLB/3/Corr.<footnote name="1">6. In 2010, the Government had endorsed the National Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s 
Development Policy which provided overarching objectives for gender equality and 
women&#8217;s development, and the National Policy on Eliminating Violence against Women. 
The delegation reported on policies for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, such as the National Children&#8217;s Policy (for ages 0&#8211;<footnote name="1">5. Solomon Islands had passed legislation, endorsed policies and set out action plans 
and guidelines to direct the implementation of human rights. Reference was made in 
particular to the Evidence Act 2009, which eliminated the corroboration warning in sexual 
violence convictions and the use of prior sexual conduct of complainants as evidence to 
question the character and credibility of complainants. In 2009, the Government had 
endorsed the Family Health and Safety Study which showed a very high prevalence of 
domestic violence, as well as a baseline report for creating a future free from violence, 
abuse and exploitation of girls and boys. It had also recognized the recommendations from 
a report on the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the presence of the logging 
industry.

Policy (for ages 14&#8211;<footnote name="2">5. On the establishment of a national human rights institution, that was dependant on 
the draft Federal Constitution being passed. Solomon Islands was, however, open to 
exploring the possibility of establishing a national human rights institution, which was not 
necessarily hinged on the draft Federal Constitution being passed. 
</footnote>9). 
</footnote>).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Czech Republic, France, Latvia, 
Maldives, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to Solomon Islands through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the opening statement, the delegation of Solomon Islands noted that human 
rights was a fundamental principle entrenched in the Constitution, and acknowledged the 
assistance of other Governments, development partners and the civil society for progress 
made in promoting and protecting human rights in Solomon Islands. 
</p>
<p>6. A priority focus was peace and reconciliation since the country was still in a 
peacebuilding and reconstruction phase after a five-year period of social unrest which the 
nation had experienced between 1998 and 2003. Although a lot of emphasis was being 
placed on structural, legislative, social and economic reforms, the losses incurred from the 
unrest were still affecting the enjoyment and realization of civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights by its citizens. 
</p>
<p>7. Solomon Islands was also not immune to the effects of global warming and climate 
change which give rise to environmental degradation, resource depletion, food insecurity, 
social and economic conflicts and growing poverty.  
</p>
<p>8. Solomon Islands participated in the universal periodic review with an open mind, 
sharing information on progress made in advancing human rights and committed to 
learning and benefiting from the interactive dialogue. The delegation thanked development 
partners for their support in preparation for the universal periodic review, in particular the 
Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community </p>


<p>(sponsored by the Government of Netherlands), the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the 
Regional Office for the Pacific of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Commonwealth Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>9. Of a most pressing nature was the need to ratify the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child which Solomon Islands had already signed, and 
which was a priority task in the Government&#8217;s work plan for 2011.   
</p>
<p>10. The delegation reported on its commitment and current efforts to submit its periodic 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, and acknowledged that on the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination were due. The Government planned to set up a treaties 
committee to monitor its reporting obligations. 
</p>
<p>11. Although Solomon Islands was yet to fully implement the concluding observations 
from the Committee on the Rights of the Child of 2003, it had incorporated those 
observations into the National Children&#8217;s Policy.  
</p>
<p>12. As part of Pacific regional commitments, Solomon Islands had committed to the 
2009 Pacific Islands Forum leaders&#8217; Cairns Compact which recognized violence against 
women as pervasive and underreported. The Compact also recognized that sexual and 
gender-based violence was a human security issue and a destabilizing factor for 
communities and societies<i>. </i>The Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Reference Group to 
support national efforts had consequently been developed. 
</p>
<p>13. Solomon Islands was committed to the Pacific Plan, especially Strategic Objective 
12.<footnote name="5">9. Argentina asked what results had been obtained through the implementation of the 
National Policy on Eliminating Violence against Women (2010) and the National Gender 
Equality and Women&#8217;s Development Policy. It also inquired about measures adopted to 
eliminate all forms of discrimination against boys and girls, in particular those belonging to 
ethnic minorities, those living in remote islands, children born out of wedlock and disabled 
children. Argentina made recommendations. </footnote>, which outlined the region&#8217;s commitment to human rights through &#8220;treaty ratification, 
reporting and implementation&#8221; and the Pacific Regional Strategy on Disability. It was also 
committed to the principles of the Millennium Development Goals and the declaration on 
The World Fit for Children. 
</p>
<p>14. The bill of rights was entrenched in chapter II of the 1978 Constitution. The draft 
Federal Constitution had an expanded bill of rights which included civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. It also provided for a national human rights 
commission.  
</p>

<p>and opportunities for all. It specifically aimed to promote gender equality and full 
participation of women. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation also referred to institutions instrumental to promoting human rights, 
such as the Office of the Auditor General, the Office of the Ombudsman and a Leadership 
Code Commission and commended the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands 
for its role in strengthening the capacity of those institutions. The Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission was also established in 2009, with a mandate to promote national unity and 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>19. Solomon Islands thanked delegations for their advance questions and provided 
responses highlighting some challenges. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation reported on the approval of a national policy which set out strategic 
actions and cross-cutting efforts to prevent violence against women, protect victims and to 
prosecute perpetrators. The policy also recognized the need for significant social, political 
and economic empowerment of women. Progress had also been made in proposing 
legislation for trafficking, protection orders for victims of violence in the home, law reform 
to respond to child abuse, neglect and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the promotion of women&#8217;s participation in decision-making, the 
delegation referred to the Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s Development Policy. Some 
significant steps had been taken to promote and increase women&#8217;s participation in politics, 
decision-making and leadership. Regarding women, peace and security, there was currently 
a move to develop a national affirmative/sustain action plan to increase women&#8217;s 
participation. 
</p>
<p>22. On the issue of land ownership, the delegation indicated that this was one of the root 
causes of the civil unrest from 1998 to 2003. The Government initiated the Constitutional 
Reform Programme in 2000 as an initiative to address the issue. Work on the constitutional 
reform was well advanced, with provincial feedback on the 2009 draft Federal Constitution 
now being collected. The Government further developed a land reform policy and 
established the land reform unit, which was working in consultation with land-owning 
groups to determine tribal boundaries and map the relevant areas concerned. A commission 
of inquiry into land dealings and lost properties on Guadalcanal in 2007 had also been set 
up and was now conducting its hearing on abandoned lands. Those initiatives would take 
time to show results, but they were in progress. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding progress made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, especially 
in terms of what it had done to create the social conditions needed to establish peace in the 
long term, the delegation reported that Commissioners were appointed in 2009 and 
operations began in 2010. Significant progress had been made through national and 
provincial public hearings as well as closed hearings for victims of the tensions. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation noted that climate change was a big problem. The Ministry of 
Environment, Conservation, Meteorology and Disaster Management had been established 
and the National Environment Policy to accommodate both the sector and cross-sector 
policies for development was being implemented. </p>

<p>However, there had not been any submissions to the Law Reform Commission in their 
review of the Penal Code to repeal those sections. 
</p>
<p>27. In concluding, Solomon Islands noted that it had frameworks and institutions that 
work to integrate human rights; however, it was also dealing with a range of competing 
priorities and limited resources. It called on the international community to help them to 
explore how they could strategize to ensure that the citizens of Solomon Islands continued 
to enjoy full realization of their rights. The delegation recognized the initiatives of the 
Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community for a 
regional human rights commission that would reinforce national initiatives to promote and 
protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. Solomon Islands announced that it was extending an open invitation to all mandate 
holders of the United Nations special procedures to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>29. Solomon Islands informed that a coordinating committee would be established to 
monitor implementation, monitoring and reporting following the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the interactive dialogue, 28 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in chapter II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>31. Canada welcomed the adoption of policies and plans to address several human rights 
issues as well as the announcement of the extension of an open invitation to the special 
procedures. It was concerned by the lack of law enforcement, ongoing corruption and 
continuing widespread discrimination against women and girls, children of certain ethnic 
minorities, and children with disabilities, endemic practices of domestic violence and ill-
treatment and abuse of children, including child labour, exploitation and prostitution. 
Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Cuba stated that Solomon Islands faced enormous challenges, originating from the 
global economic crisis and serious environmental problems, as well as other consequences 
of the unjust international economic order. Additionally, it noted that the country had been 
faced with an ethnic conflict and that great efforts had been required to restore normality. 
Cuba considered that, nevertheless, the country had deployed significant efforts to 
minimize the negative impact of those circumstances noting, in particular, measures to 
ensure education and improve services for the population. It also took note of the National 
Health Plan 2010&#8211;2015 and collaboration between the two countries to help improve health 
services and train health professionals. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Algeria commended Solomon Islands for having been always a supporter of human 
rights initiatives at the regional level and for governmental efforts in the areas of health, 
youth and education. It expressed the conviction that further progress would be achieved 
within the framework of the implementation of the National Development Strategy 2011&#8211;
2015. It was aware of the constraints faced by a small island developing State in the context 
of the negative impact of climate change and the economic crisis, and recalled that 
international cooperation was important. Algeria made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Ireland welcomed efforts by Solomon Islands to strengthen human rights including 
the Policy Strategic Framework 2008&#8211;2010 and the establishment of the first Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission in the Pacific. It also welcomed the commitment made during 
the review to issue a standing invitation to the special procedures and the initiative to 
consider establishing a national human rights institution. It inquired what initiatives were 
planned and what might be done by the country to tackle climate change. Ireland also asked </p>


<p>what progress had been achieved in developing multi-year plans to guide capacity-building 
for the judiciary and police. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Australia congratulated Solomon Islands for the conduct of its national election in 
2010 and restated its support for future reform. It was pleased with the announcement of a 
standing invitation to the special procedures, recognized the progress achieved in Solomon 
Islands toward strengthening its justice system and noted the importance of consolidating 
those gains, as the regional assistance mission was to draw down. It noted that gender-
based violence remained a significant problem. It welcomed the continuing commitment to 
pursue justice for victims of the &#8220;tensions&#8221; through the extension of the mandate of the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission until 2012. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Norway expressed concern that adolescents did not have adequate information on 
and access to health and, in particular, reproductive health. It was also concerned about 
reports that girls were traded as brides in exchange for payments. It noted that the country 
still maintained criminal sanctions against sexual activity between consenting adults of the 
same sex. Norway appreciated efforts made to end violence against women and reduce 
illiteracy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Hungary commended Solomon Islands for the establishment of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission and recognized steps made towards gender equality, in 
particular changes to the legal practices criminalizing sexual assault. However, it was 
concerned with the increasing number of cases of gender discrimination and violence 
against women and highlighted the lack of judicial redress, which perpetuated gender 
inequality. It noted achievements in ensuring the well-being of children but considered that 
child protection could be further improved through the prohibition of corporal punishment, 
ill-treatment or violence at home, at schools and all other contexts. Hungary made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Brazil appreciated progress made in the country despite constraints posed by 
poverty, unemployment and climate change. It was encouraged by the possibility that 
Solomon Islands would attain the Millennium Development Goals on universal primary 
education. It also welcomed recent legislative measures to provide protection to refugees. 
Brazil noted, however, reports indicating that domestic and sexual violence against women 
and children remained major problems. It also noted with concern the low ages for criminal 
responsibility and employment. Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. France noted with satisfaction that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had 
begun its work in 2010. It also highlighted that primary education, though free, was still not 
compulsory, that the number of girls attending schools was low and that qualified teachers 
rare. It noted the concerns by the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the low 
minimum age of criminal responsibility. It also expressed concern regarding the number of 
cases domestic violence and the fact the Criminal Code criminalizes consensual sexual. 
</p>
<p>40. Thailand noted efforts of Solomon Islands to promote and protect human rights 
despite many existing challenges. It welcomed the announcement of a standing invitation to 
the special procedures. It acknowledged steps taken to strengthen its domestic human rights 
institutions such the amendment of the Evidence Act in 2009. Nevertheless, it shared 
concerns with some international organizations regarding discriminatory practices and laws 
against women and girls. It also noted discrimination of other vulnerable groups. Thailand 
stated that it stood ready to continue cooperating with Solomon Islands in the area of 
capacity-building of human resources in the public sector. It made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>42. The delegation took note of recommendations to ratify human rights instruments 
which Solomon Islands had not yet signed/ratified and reassured countries that Solomon 
Islands would take the necessary steps to do so.  
</p>
<p>43. In relation to the comments of Canada, Solomon Islands acknowledged that the 
current offences in the Penal Code of procuring defilement of a woman by threats, being 
involved with a household permitting defilement of a girl under 15 years, detaining an 
individual in a brothel and obtaining and disposing of minors for immoral purposes only 
applied to girls and women and some offences were limited to acts of sexual intercourse.  
</p>
<p>44. The delegation acknowledged that laws did not criminalize the full range of 
activities associated with child prostitution. Penalties were now low and there was no 
protection for children from being liable to prosecutions for prostitution. Standards from the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, 
prostitution and child pornography were being used to develop recommendations for 
reforms in that area, even though Solomon Islands had only signed the protocol. The Law 
Reform Commission was also considering introduction of an offence regarding the sale of 
children for sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>45. On comments made by Cuba, regarding efforts to promote the rights of women, 
children and persons with disabilities, the delegation referred to progress to be made as part 
of the current National Policy on Eliminating Violence against Women, the Youth and 
Children&#8217;s Policies and the Disability Policy.  
</p>
<p>46. The Constitution did not contain a guarantee of access to health care. However, the 
draft Federal Constitution did include a section on heath care in article 47. The delegation 
took the opportunity to thank the Cuban Government for the number of its students carrying 
out medicine studies in Cuba. Cuba had also sent medical officers and doctors who were 
working in Solomon Islands to assist in alleviating or eliminating some of the health 
problems.  
</p>
<p>47. Solomon Islands had a corporate plan on health care which was based on the 
following qualifications: improvement of access to quality care, management and 
development of human resources, maternity and morbidity reduction, maintenance of health 
environment, promotion of healthy living and lifestyle and improvement of reproductive 
health and family planning. 
</p>
<p>48. In response to comments made by Algeria, the delegation noted that it would work 
to ratify human rights treaties to strengthen its framework and institutions. 
</p>
<p>49. In response to a question made by Ireland, the delegation stated that the Law Reform 
Commission did not have a specific mandate to deal with traditional justice, but the 
Ministry of Justice and the World Bank were currently working together on a project called 
&#8220;Justice for the Poor&#8221; to address the issue. 
</p>
<p>50. The delegation reported that access to justice was a priority for Solomon Islands and 
that it would continue to reform laws and policies. The delegation took the opportunity to 
thank Australia for the assistance provided in institution-strengthening and capacity-
building in the law sector. 
</p>
<p>51. Solomon Islands further stated that it had recently sent an invitation to the OHCHR 
Regional Office for an in-country assessment for the purpose of establishing an office in 
Solomon Islands. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation noted the commitment of the Government to ensure legal 
mechanisms were in place and conducive to the rights of women and children.  
</p>
<p>53. On the issue of corporal punishment of children, the delegation stated that the Penal 
Code contained an offence of cruelty towards children, section 233. However, that section </p>


<p>did not affect the right of any parent or any other person having the control of a child to 
administer reasonable punishment to a child. &#8220;Reasonable&#8221; must be consistent with the 
constitutional right to be free from torture and it was usually determined by the court on a 
case-by-case basis. The review of the Penal Code was looking at whether any further 
provision or guidance should be given in the law about when corporal punishment was 
lawful. 
</p>
<p>54. On issues surrounding sexual relationships between consenting adults of the same 
sex, as raised by Brazil, the delegation indicated that it was being dealt under the review of 
the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>55. The United States of America commended Solomon Islands on holding of national 
elections in 2010 and efforts made, with the assistance of the Regional Assistance Mission 
to the Solomon Islands, to address police corruption and impunity and reduce the backlog 
of cases before the courts. It expressed concern regarding human rights problems, 
including, lengthy pretrial detention, Government corruption, and violence and 
discrimination against women. It noted male dominance in Government and that violence 
against women remained a serious problem. Additionally, it noted that children and foreign 
women were often subjected to forced prostitution and that local children were victims of 
domestic servitude. It encouraged the country to investigate and prosecute human 
trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Slovenia acknowledged the fragile economic and political situation of Solomon 
Islands, resulting from civil unrest in the near past. It commended the National Plan of 
Action for Human Rights outlined in 2010, in which the establishment of a national human 
rights institution was considered. It encouraged the Government to address the widespread 
use of corporal punishment of children. It expressed concern about child prostitution and 
asked what measures would be taken in that regard. Slovenia was also concerned by the 
prevalence of domestic physical and sexual violence against women, which was considered 
in Solomon Islands to be a private issue, a position which results in impunity. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Germany asked what measures had been undertaken to grant equal access to justice 
to all. It inquired about measures adopted to educate the population on the rights of women 
and equal rights of women and men. Germany also asked about efforts made to follow up 
recommendations by the Committee on the Rights of the Child to reduce the number of 
working children and to ensure that children who worked did so in accordance with 
international standards and had access to education. Germany expressed concern that 
children were exposed to prostitution and noted the absence of institutions for the 
rehabilitation of victims and the lack of data. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>58. Chile recognized existing constraints to the enjoyment of human rights created by 
climate change and measures taken to address those by the Government of Solomon Islands 
through the National Policy on Climate Change. Chile reiterated its support to initiatives 
aimed at addressing that issue. It acknowledged public efforts to promote and protect 
human rights and the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It noted the 
National Development Strategy, progress achieved in the area of gender equality and the 
initiative to consider the establishment of a national human rights institution. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>

<p>60. Maldives acknowledged the consultation process engaged by Solomon Islands, a 
fellow member of the Alliance of Small Island States, to prepare its national report for the 
review. It stated that the Working Group should understand the challenges in the promotion 
and protection of human rights faced by the country because of its small size and capacity 
constraints. It recognized the commitment of Solomon Islands to human rights and progress 
achieved in a range of areas covering civil and political rights, and economic, social and 
cultural rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Mexico recognized efforts made to address the past, in particular the establishment 
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It expressed appreciation of the recognition 
by the Government of challenges faced in areas such as youth unemployment, violence 
within the family, gender equality and access to education, as well as efforts to ratify 
international human rights conventions. Mexico asked for greater details on what type of 
international technical cooperation would be needed to prevent and eliminate sexual 
exploitation and abuse, in particular of women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Spain welcomed the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 
2009. It asked how it reconciled the treatment received by Mr. Lusibaea with the work of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It also requested information on measures taken 
by the Government to guarantee gender equality in political life and other domains. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Trinidad and Tobago recognized the many challenges faced by the country and 
commended Solomon Islands for the work undertaken to incorporate into domestic law the 
rights of people with disabilities, child protection and the Convention on Elimination of all 
Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also congratulated the Government for 
acknowledging slow progress in areas such as law reform, the rights of women and 
children, and domestic violence, affirming that the situation was the result of resource 
capacity constraints rather than a lack of commitment. It made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>the country for measures adopted to amend the Constitution, strengthen the rule of law and 
the independence of the judiciary, as well as support civil society. Morocco made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. New Zealand stated that it had been working with Solomon Islands to achieve its 
goal of providing basic education for all and eliminating gender disparity in education. It 
commended the country for impressive progress made in achieving universal basic 
education and for having allocated high levels of the budget for that purpose. It expressed 
concern about the situation of women, noting the absence of women in Parliament and the 
violence against women. It noted improvement in prison conditions and commended the 
country for having signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. China took note of efforts by Solomon Islands to, inter alia, improve the level of 
education and health services in the country. It noted with concern that there was 
widespread discrimination against women across the country and severe poverty and a lack 
of effective guarantee for economic, social and cultural rights of the people. China 
expressed the hope that Solomon Islands would pay attention to economic and social 
development and that effective measures would be taken to achieve gender equality, 
poverty elimination and other Millennium Development Goals. China rejected the reference 
to &#8220;Republic of China&#8221; and &#8220;Taiwan&#8221; in the national report of Solomon Islands. It 
emphasized that, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, the Peoples&#8217; 
Republic of China was the only legitimate representative of the entire country, of which 
Taiwan was an integral part. 
</p>
<p>70. Ecuador welcomed Solomon Islands Government&#8217;s efforts to eliminate child 
malnutrition and maternal mortality and progress in the area of universal education. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Indonesia recognized that Solomon Islands was still confronted by a number of 
challenges which continued to impede progress on human rights and national development. 
It noted progress achieved in providing access to universal primary education through the 
Free-Fee Basic Education Policy, which permitted the country to bring within reach the 
attainment of millennium development goal 2. It was concerned by the fact that gender 
inequality remained an issue, but appreciated the frankness of the Government in conceding 
that more needed to be done to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights of women 
at all levels. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>74. On the issue of education, the delegation acknowledged that because of gender 
disparities, women in Solomon Islands were generally regarded as having lower status than 
men. It was also common in the country that females were attending school at lower rate 
than boys, particularly in middle to higher levels of the education system. Solomon Islands 
had set that in the education work programme as a priority in achieving equal access to 
education. The two core objectives of the programme were: 100 per cent enrolment and 
gender balance. The programme also acknowledged the accessibility for students with 
disabilities and it was working towards ensuring that education services were available to 
all children. The delegation took the opportunity to thank New Zealand for assisting 
Solomon Islands in its efforts to provide free education to all children from primary school 
to the junior secondary school. It also thanked the United Kingdom and the European 
Union for their support for the schools&#8217; infrastructures. 
</p>
<p>75. On the question raised by the Philippines on climate change, the delegation thanked 
the United Kingdom and the European Union for the climate change adaptation and 
mitigation funds established to assist them in their climate change challenges. 
</p>
<p>76. With regard to the issue of birth registration, the delegation acknowledged that the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) child protection baseline study carried out in 
2008 estimated very low birth registration in Solomon Islands. The National Children&#8217;s 
Policy and Action Plan catered for the promotion of registration of all births to create a 
protective environment for children. Current developments included the followings: the 
Government was planning to look at legislative reform in 2011 to support an effective birth 
registration system. In 2010, the Government piloted a revision of birth registration 
procedures in three selected locations. UNICEF was currently supporting the strengthening 
of the operational capacity of the central civil birth registration office and expanding mobile 
network coverage. The Government, in partnership with UNICEF, was looking at assisting 
with birth registration via mobile phone. Awareness-raising campaigns were also carried 
out. 
</p>
<p>77. Referring to the issue of ratifications of human rights conventions, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and External Trade was working on the issue with the Attorney-General&#8217;s 
Chamber. Consultations would start mid-June to establish a national treaties advisory 
committee that would cover human rights committees and International Labour 
Organization (ILO) conventions. The dualist legal system requires domestication of 
international treaties and conventions in order for them to become part of national law. 
Solomon Islands could not just go ahead with ratification without giving it serious 
consideration and hence endorsement by Government, through the Cabinet. The 
Government was looking at the matter in stages, in order to address those issues. 
</p>
<p>78. In concluding, the delegation indicated that the Government was working hard to 
ensure that the issues raised could be rectified as they went along. It thanked all delegations 
for the questions raised and noted that, in spite of the many challenges that Solomon Islands 
was facing, it was determined and committed to address those issues in the country. Much 
had been done but more needed to be done.
