<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants visited the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 22 to 26 June 2009, at the invitation of the 
Government. Given the short length of his visit, the Special Rapporteur only visited 
England, one of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom. While a comprehensive 
approach is privileged in the report, a number of examples are drawn from the observations 
and information gathered in situ. This report presents information on the protection 
afforded to migrants by the Government in light of international human rights standards. 
The report also presents major trends and key challenges, highlights good practices and 
makes recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur consulted with government officials from 
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Home Office, the Department of Health and the 
Department for Children, Schools and Families. He met with the Children&#8217;s Commissioner 
for England, observed immigration operations at Heathrow Airport and visited immigration 
removal centres in the districts of Dover and Gosport. 
</p>
<p>3. At Heathrow airport, he observed operations in terminals 1 and 2 including short-
term holding facilities and the Flight Connections Centre. He was briefed on the iris-
recognition immigration system1 and asylum-seeking processes. In Dover and Gosport, he 
visited immigration removal centres, where he observed routine operations, including the 
initial age assessment interview in a disputed age case. He also interviewed detainees 
charged with immigration-related offences.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also held consultations with the Director of the United 
Kingdom Office of the European Parliament, a number of academic institutions and a 
variety of stakeholders, including representatives of non-governmental organizations2 and 
the International Organization for Migration. He also gathered information directly from 
migrants and held consultations with representatives of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR).  
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government, to UNHCR 
and UNICEF for the support provided in the organization and facilitation of the visit as well 
as to all stakeholders for their time and cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Migration data  
</b></p>
<p>6. The United Kingdom is now a major country of destination of immigration flows. 
International migration has contributed nearly three quarters of the total population growth 
in recent years3 and the number of international migrants has doubled over a 25-year 
</p>
<p>

registered passengers to enter the United Kingdom quickly through automated barriers at certain 
airports.

<p>March 2005. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12095 
</p>
<p>period. The United Nations Global Migration Database shows a total of 3,389,925 
international migrants residing in the United Kingdom in 1981 and 6,486,000 in 2007. The 
population survey carried out in 2007 showed a total of 60,975,000 inhabitants, suggesting 
that international migrants accounted for 10 per cent of the population.4 Also in 2007, other 
sources estimated the number of irregular migrants to be 618,000 (with a range of 417,000 
to 863,000),5 which suggests that irregular migrants represented 9.5 per cent of all 
international migrants. 
</p>
<p>7. International migrants include European Union nationals. Figures published by the 
Office for National Statistics in December 2009 showed that between 2004 and 2008, 
migrants from Accession 8 (A8)6 countries living in the United Kingdom increased from 
167,000 to 689,000.7 
</p>
<p>8. In 2001, around 2.1 million children &#8212; representing 16.3 per cent of the total child 
population &#8212; were from immigrant families. A fifth of those children were foreign-born 
and the remainder were born in the United Kingdom to at least one foreign-born parent. 
More than 40 per cent were from families from Asia, around 20 per cent from families from 
Africa and around 20 per cent from families from other countries in Europe. The main 
countries of origin include Bangladesh, Jamaica, India and Pakistan.8 Estimates also 
suggest that one child in six in the United Kingdom lives with at least one immigrant 
parent.9   
</p>
<p>9. During 2008 and 2009, the Home Affairs Committee conducted an inquiry into 
human trafficking, in which it highlighted the lack of accurate statistical information and 
estimated that there are at least 5,000 trafficked victims in the United Kingdom.10 Between 
April and September 2009, China and Nigeria were the main source countries for the 347 
victims referred to the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre. Over the same period, 
there were also 31 female victims of sexual exploitation under 18 years old, which means 
that approximately 43 per cent of cases concerned trafficking of women for sexual 
exploitation. Between March 2007 and February 2008, 325 children from 52 different 
countries of origin were identified as potentially trafficked or exploited. Many of the 
children came from the United Kingdom, but also from Afghanistan, China, Nigeria, 
Romania and Viet Nam. Some of them have been forced to work in brothels and 
restaurants.11

<p>10. The variety of migration-related data collection tools and methods makes data 
comparison and analysis difficult. The country&#8217;s population census does not include data on 
immigration status and the Control of Immigration Statistics and International Passenger 
Survey, which are the most common statistical tools, record annual inflow of people but do 
not indicate the status or size of the country&#8217;s foreign population. Furthermore, no national 
database includes data on the number of children in immigrant families, while Home Office 
data cover dependents, but do not differentiate among them. Statistics on migrants&#8217; 
detention are not disaggregated by sex and age. Some of these weaknesses are being 
addressed.12  
</p>
<p><b> B. Migration trends  
</b></p>
<p>11. Migration trends in the United Kingdom are heavily affected by global trends and 
the main triggers of international migration into the United Kingdom are economic 
migration, family reunification and asylum-seeking. Since 1997, economic migration has 
increased as a response to a growing labour demand. In 2002, the Government established a 
programme to attract highly skilled migrants13 and, in 2004, opened the labour market to 
A8 nationals. Recent governmental policy has grown more restrictive in relation to family 
migration and the acquisition of settlement and British citizenship. This more restrictive 
tendency has mainly resulted from the perceived lack of social integration of some 
immigrants and requirements for language capacity and knowledge of life in the United 
Kingdom have therefore been introduced, first for naturalization as a British citizen (as of 1 
November 2005) and then for settlement (as of 2 April 2007).  
</p><p>12. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), with the economic 
downturn, the unemployment rate for migrant workers increased in the third quarter of 
2008 to 7.3 per cent, almost one point higher than the total labour force unemployment rate, 
which was estimated to be 6.5 per cent over the same period. The unemployment rate of the 
total labour force is expected to increase to 9.5 per cent in 2010. The range of jobs on the 
National Shortage Occupation List14 has been reduced and the Resident Labour Market 
Test15 reinforced for skilled jobs. Moreover, the qualifications and salary requirements for 
foreign workers have been raised to a master&#8217;s degree and a minimum salary of &#163;20,000. It 
is expected that these changes will contribute to a decrease in the number of non-European 
Union highly skilled workers by half.16 Immigration for low-skilled occupations was 
suspended indefinitely, inter alia, to reduce the number of non-European Union migrant 
workers. Lately, the rate of emigration from the United Kingdom has been increasing.17

</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The international and regional legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>13. The United Kingdom has ratified seven of the core international human rights 
instruments. The State has also ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
and its Protocol; the ILO Convention concerning Migration for Employment No. 97; the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption (both of which contain provisions requiring or encouraging 
measures of protection for witnesses of offences sanctioned under those treaties); the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (both 
of which supplement the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime). The United 
Kingdom is yet to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrants Workers and Members of Their Families (hereinafter &#8220;Migrant Workers 
Convention&#8221;)18 or the ILO Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention No. 
143 (1975). 
</p><p>14. The United Kingdom has repeatedly been encouraged to ratify the Migrant Workers 
Convention, for example, by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,19 the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child20 and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women.21 In the context of the universal periodic review, the State 
did not accept the recommendation regarding the ratification of the Migrant Workers 
Convention22 and stated it has no plans to sign it.23 This position was stressed during the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit when the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) highlighted 
that the United Kingdom requires a stronger and rather restrictive approach to labour 
migration, particularly to irregular migration.  
</p>
<p>15. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight that the ratification of the 
Convention does not limit the right of the State to determine the conditions for admitting 
migrant workers and their family members, as stated in article 79 of the Convention. In his 
view, ratification of the Convention is not incompatible with the Government&#8217;s policy goals 
since, even if the United Kingdom wishes to adopt a restrictive approach to irregular labour 
migration, the State is under the general obligation to treat migrants, regardless of their 
immigration status, in accordance with international human rights standards. He also draws 
attention to the pledges and commitments presented by the State to the General Assembly 
in its campaign for re-election as a member of the Human Rights Council, particularly to its 
fourth commitment on upholding the highest standards of human rights at home, including 
by &#8220;tackling inequality and discrimination, to ensure that every individual is able to fulfil 
their potential through the employment of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities&#8221;.24  
</p>
<p>16. At the regional level, the State is a member of the Council of Europe and the 
European Union and became a party to the European Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 Ratification of the Migrant Workers Convention has strongly been encouraged, inter alia, by the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament (resolution of 24 February 2005 (P6_TA(2005)0051), para. 22) and the 
European Economic and Social Committee (Opinion of 30 June 2004 (SOC/173)).

<p>Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The United Kingdom is also a party to several 
of the protocols to that Convention, although it is yet to ratify Protocol No. 12 on the 
prohibition of discrimination. The State has signed the (revised) European Social Charter 
but is yet to ratify regional instruments strengthening the human rights protection of 
migrant workers.25 The State is a party to the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings, which it ratified in December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The national legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. The United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, 
comprises England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Westminster Parliament 
legislates on certain matters that affect the whole of the United Kingdom and some acts of 
Parliament (including the Human Rights Act of 1998) apply throughout the State. The 
United Kingdom Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories are not part of the territory, 
but the United Kingdom is responsible for their external affairs.26  
</p>
<p>18. Migration is managed by both the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office. The Home Office, through the UKBA, is responsible for securing and managing the 
borders and enforcing immigration and customs regulations. The Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office manages migration from a foreign affairs perspective, including the 
management of embassies and consulates worldwide, and works in partnership with the 
UKBA to achieve common strategic goals in migration governance.  
</p>
<p>19. The three national human rights institutions in the United Kingdom (England, 
Northern Ireland and Scotland) and the four children&#8217;s commissioners (England, Northern 
Ireland, Scotland and Wales) have widely supported the protection of human rights in the 
context of migration, as described in section IV below.  
</p>
<p>20. Within the judiciary, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a superior 
tribunal, deals with appeals against decisions made by the Home Office to deport foreign 
nationals on grounds of national security or for reasons of public interest. The 
Commission&#8217;s procedures allow it to examine all deportation-related evidence, including 
highly classified material, without jeopardizing the source through unauthorized 
disclosure.27 With the new reform, the Commission&#8217;s decisions may be reviewed by the 
Upper Tribunal. 
</p>
<p><b>  Immigration law and policy 
</b></p>
<p>21. The key legal instrument regulating immigration in the United Kingdom is the 
Immigration Act 1971. The current legal framework for immigration is complex and 
includes a wide range of legal instruments yet to be consolidated in a single text, such as 
the Immigration (Carrier&#8217;s Liability) Act 1987; the Immigration Act 1988; the Asylum and 
Immigration Appeals Act 1993; the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996; the Special 
Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997; the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; the 
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment 
of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004; the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006; the UK 
Borders Act 2007 and the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 The European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers, together with the (revised) 
</p>
<p>European Social Charter (arts. 18 and 19 in particular) and the European Convention on Social 
Security strengthen the protection of migrant workers in Europe.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>22. The United Kingdom developed in 2002 the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme, 
which was replaced in 2009 by the highly skilled worker tier on the basis of a points system 
described in paragraph 26. In 2004, it developed a workers registration scheme for A8 
workers, who are thereby required to register (and pay a one-time registration fee of &#163;90) 
with the Home Office within one month of taking up employment.  
</p>
<p>23. Since July 2006, steps have been taken to replace the existing immigration laws with 
a single simplified or consolidated law. In this regard, consultations began in 200728 and 
stand-alone changes to the current system were introduced in July 2009 with the adoption 
of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  
</p>
<p>24. The new act allows for certain functions to be transferred from Her Majesty&#8217;s 
Revenue and Customs Office to UKBA. It also amends several provisions, such as the 
British Nationality Act 1981 provisions relating to naturalization as a British citizen, 
children of foreign and Commonwealth members of the Armed Forces and the registration 
as British citizens of children born abroad to British mothers before 7 February 1961. It 
also introduces powers to control all those arriving in the United Kingdom from another 
part of the Common Travel Area,29 establishes restrictions on studying in the United 
Kingdom, introduces powers to take fingerprints and detain at ports in Scotland, allows 
judicial review applications in immigration and nationality cases to be heard by the new 
Upper Tribunal and introduces a new duty for UKBA to safeguard the welfare of children. 
Although this law complements legislation currently in force, the main goal is to adopt a 
full simplified or consolidated bill and a framework for immigration rules in the near future. 
</p>
<p>25. A five-year asylum and immigration strategy was developed between 2005 and 2006 
to: strengthen border control; fast-track asylum decisions; enforce compliance with 
immigration laws; boost the economy by bringing skills in demand from around the world; 
and ensure legal entry to the country.30 
</p>
<p>26. The strategy sets forth five expected accomplishments, which the Special 
Rapporteur considers punitive rather than protective: (a) to strengthen the use of 
intelligence and risk assessment to target the people, routes and places with a view to 
increasing scrutiny of those who will enter the United Kingdom; (b) to manage the identity 
of foreign nationals through a secure, unique identification to help manage migration and 
reduce unauthorized work; (c) to implement cross-government enforcement action; (d) to 
enhance the system of fast removal of third-country nationals; and (e) to improve the 
management of asylum-seekers to cope with the workload relating to the large numbers of 
applications. UKBA also established a three-pronged business plan (2009&#8211;2012) 
</p><p>27. The points-based system, based on a set of criteria aimed at meeting workforce 
specific needs, was introduced in 2008. This system, also known as the &#8220;five-tier 
immigration system&#8221;, applies to five categories of migrants, each of which has a different

<p><b>  Counter-human trafficking and the protection of victims 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 established a wide range of offences of human 
trafficking for sexual exploitation into, within or from the United Kingdom. The Asylum 
and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 prohibits human trafficking for 
labour exploitation and organ transplantation. Offences carry a maximum sentence of 14 
years&#8217; imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>29. In 2003, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform set up the Poppy Project, aimed at 
providing short-term accommodation and support to women trafficked into prostitution. Its 
capacity amounts to 54 bed spaces in houses and it is the only such project being 
implemented in the country. Only limited numbers of victims of trafficking for sexual 
exploitation have access to accommodation, advice and/or outreach services. Between 
March 2003 and August 2009, the Poppy Project helped 490 victims, including 239 by 
providing urgent accommodation and 251 by providing outreach assessment.31 Since April 
2009, it has also provided help to victims of forced labour and domestic servitude. 
</p>
<p>30. At the time of the report, admission to the Poppy Project was assessed against three 
main criteria, which are age (victims should be over 18), timing (victims should have been 
involved in prostitution within three months of referral), and nationality (victims should 
have been trafficked into the United Kingdom from abroad). However, more recent 
information provided by the Government indicates that the three-month requirement has 
been dropped and that victims who have been trafficked into or within the United Kingdom 
are now eligible for Poppy Project support. Information received by the Special Rapporteur 
also suggested that, in practice, the Government considered victims&#8217; cooperation as a 
requirement to accommodating them under the Poppy Project. In this connection, the 
Government highlighted that cooperation with the police is not a requirement for victims to 
receive assistance, as they must only show a willingness to enter the National Referral 
Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>31. In March 2007, the Government launched the UK Action Plan on Tackling Human 
Trafficking as a platform for developing a more strategic and holistic approach to this issue. 
Accordingly, the Government established the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre 
as a cooperative framework for protecting and promoting the human rights of trafficked 
persons and coordinating efforts with civil society.32 The centre acts as the central 
repository for all data and intelligence on human trafficking and is a multiagency centre 
composed of, inter alia, representatives from the police, UKBA, the Serious Organised 
Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
</p>
<p>32. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has a child trafficking unit 
mandated to act as focal point for producing and disseminating information on and raising 
knowledge and understanding of the nature and scale of the trafficking of children in the 
United Kingdom, along with policy, guidance and training on the best responses to the 
problems identified. On the ground, children services departments are responsible for 
supporting and protecting children abused or with specific needs, by providing foster and/or 
residential care. Assessment or duty teams carry out an initial assessment and facilitate 
children&#8217;s access to the various specialist teams, including the team for children with 
disabilities, the child protection team, a family support team or a &#8220;looked after children 
team&#8221;. The social worker assigned to a specific case establishes a detailed core assessment 
of the child&#8217;s needs and then develops a plan to be followed accordingly.

<p>33. With the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings in 2008, trafficked victims are now provided with a reflection 
and recovery period of at least 45 days, during which time the victims are assisted and not 
removed from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, victims may be granted discretionary 
leave to remain in certain circumstances, as described in section IV. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Good practices 
</b>34. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of various cooperation 
initiatives, which, in his view, illustrate the commitment of the Government and/or other 
stakeholders to a human rights-based approach to migration and/or the protection of the 
human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Identifying, sharing and promoting good practices 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the Migration Excellence 
Programme funded by the Department of Communities and Local Government and 
implemented by the Improvement and Development Agency, which operated from 2007 to 
October 2008.33 He especially welcomes the added value of this programme in identifying, 
sharing and promoting good practices in migration governance, particularly concerning: 
integrating new migrants from A8 States and collecting migration data; modifying local 
services to meet the needs of new residents; and highlighting sample actions to minimize 
tensions between communities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Setting up independent mechanisms to monitor migration governance 
using international law 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur commends the establishment of the independent Chief 
Inspectorate of UKBA, created in 2007 to focus on the overall efficiency and effectiveness 
of the main governmental agency responsible for migration governance. He especially 
welcomes the Inspectorate&#8217;s mandate, which includes, inter alia, the functions of: reviewing 
the process involved in handling individual cases; examining UKBA goals and programmes 
to determine their compliance with international obligations; and carrying out unannounced 
inspections at ports and embassies.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also commends the establishment of four posts of children&#8217;s 
commissioners (for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), in charge of 
promoting awareness of the views and interests of children, particularly regarding health 
and education, training and recreation and their protection from harm and neglect. He 
especially welcomes their role in the protection of children in the context of migration, both 
within their respective jurisdictions34 and collectively through the elaboration of a number 
of recommendations, inter alia, on special protection measures for unaccompanied children 
seeking asylum.35

<p><b> C. Sharing the responsibility of protecting persons in need of international 
protection 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur commends cooperation established between UNHCR and 
the Government through the Quality Initiative Project, whereby UNHCR provides expertise 
to the Home Office on improving the quality of first-instance decision-making in asylum-
seeking applications. He also welcomes the partnership between UNHCR and UKBA in the 
Gateway Protection Programme for resettling the most vulnerable refugees to the United 
Kingdom, which currently offers a legal route for up to 750 refugees per financial year who 
are deemed eligible to be resettled from first countries of asylum to the United Kingdom. 
Furthermore, the beneficiaries are granted permission upon arrival to settle permanently 
instead of being granted a temporary authorization to stay for five years, as is the practice in 
the standard procedure for claiming asylum in the United Kingdom. The Special 
Rapporteur also welcomes the UKBA instruction on mandate refugees36 for the handling of 
applications from abroad for leave to enter for settlement purposes by persons recognized 
as refugees and given asylum by a host country, without this affecting their refugee status.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Protecting and empowering children in the context of migration  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur commends the inclusion of migrant children and children 
from a migrant background in early childhood services aimed at developing children&#8217;s 
capacities in general, while also addressing specific issues such as language command. He 
also welcomes efforts to build intercultural and teaching skills to facilitate inclusion of 
migrant families and their children, regardless of their immigration status, and praises the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to accommodate linguistic and religious diversity and cultural 
perspectives in education plans and programmes. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the child-specific refugee status determination 
process aimed at considering the child&#8217;s needs and requirements handled by officials 
trained in child protection as part of an accelerated procedure of a maximum length of six 
months, including any appeal. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of statutory 
guidance to UKBA on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of 
children, issued under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Workers organizations&#8217; cooperation initiatives in countries of 
destination and origin 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur commends the agreement signed in 2001 between the 
national Trades Union Congress and the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers 
aimed at promoting membership in Trade Union Congress unions of Portuguese migrant 
workers who are Confederation members. He especially welcomes the information 
campaigns undertaken in the migrant workers&#8217; own language on their rights.

 A mandate refugee is a person in a third country, who has been recognized as a refugee by, and given

<p>the protection of, UNHCR. Such a person may also be recognized as a refugee and given asylum by a 
host country without this affecting their mandate refugee status. See UKBA, &#8220;Mandate Refugees&#8221;,

</p>
<p><b> F. National human rights institutions&#8217; commitment to the protection of the 
human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of the three national human 
rights institutions in the United Kingdom to promoting both the human rights of migrants 
and the protection of human rights in the context of migration. He commends migrant 
rights-related activities by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, established in 
2007, which include the publication of a study highlighting the several benefits that 
migration brings to the economy of the United Kingdom37 and the establishment of a 
helpline to address non-nationals&#8217; equality rights. He also praises migrant rights-related 
activities undertaken by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, established in 
1998, and the Scottish Commission for Human Rights, which commenced operations in 
June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Other good practices 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the possibility given to asylum-seekers of 
indicating a preference for the gender of the UKBA representative who will conduct the 
substantive asylum interview and the official who will be responsible for handling their 
claim. Although preferences indicated may not be accommodated for operational reasons, 
the Special Rapporteur welcomes the opportunity given to claimants to indicate the gender 
preference of the interpreter. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the legal options available to persons who need 
protection but who are not deemed refugees. In this regard, he welcomes the establishment 
of the &#8220;discretionary leave to remain&#8221;, granted for a maximum three-year period, available 
to those who have not been considered for international protection or have been excluded. 
He also welcomes the &#8220;humanitarian protection leave&#8221; granted to persons, including 
refused asylum-seekers, who, if returned to their countries may face serious risks to their 
life arising from the death penalty, unlawful killing, torture or inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Major challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The criminalization of irregular migration and the detention of 
immigrants 
</b></p>
<p>45. Section 33 (1) of the 1971 Act, as amended by the 1996 Act, defines an &#8220;illegal 
entrant&#8221; as a person that is either (a) unlawfully entering or seeking to enter in breach of a 
deportation order or of the immigration laws, or (b) entering or seeking to enter by means 
which include deception by another person, and includes a person who has so entered. This 
includes entry without leave (clandestine entry, absconders, unwitting evasion of the 
control); verbal deception; documentary deception; no evidence of lawful entry; entry in 
breach of a deportation order; illegal entry from the Republic of Ireland; and illegal entry 
from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  
</p>
<p>46. UKBA is responsible for the removal of &#8220;illegal entrants&#8221;, who can depart 
voluntarily, either independently or with the support of the International Organization for

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12095 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Migration&#8217;s Assisted Voluntary Return Programme. Those who opt out of voluntary 
departure can be issued a deportation order by the Home Secretary and detained under the 
Immigration Act for examination or removal.  
</p>
<p>47. Detention figures that report the number of persons detained solely under 
Immigration Act powers showed that, at the end of March 2009, a total of 2,460 persons 
were detained in UKBA premises (a figure 7 per cent higher than at the end of March 2008, 
when it stood at 2,305); 2,360 were held at UKBA removal centres and 100 in UKBA 
short-term holding facilities. Furthermore, 30 people detained solely under Immigration Act 
powers were recorded as being less than 18 years of age; 20 of these had been in detention 
for less than 29 days; 5 for between 29 days and 2 months and the remaining 5 for 2&#8211;3 
months. 
</p>
<p>48. Detention statistics provided by the Government show that of the 2,460 people 
detained, 960 had been in detention for less than 29 days; 425 for between 29 days and 2 
months; 360 for 2&#8211;4 months; 225 for between 4&#8211;6 months; 270 for between 6 months and 1 
year; and the remaining 215 for longer than 1 year. These figures are not directly 
comparable with previous figures on length of detention prior to December 2008 because of 
the use of a revised methodology. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The detention of asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>49. The legal regime applicable to asylum-seekers includes the &#8220;detained fast-track&#8221; 
(DFT) procedure, by virtue of which asylum-seekers are held in detention while their 
asylum claims are decided according to an accelerated procedure. Under the DFT, men 
have been held in detention at Harmondsworth near Heathrow Airport since 2003, and 
women have been held at Yarl&#8217;s Wood near Bedford since 2005. Although the DFT is 
supposed to be for cases which can be settled quickly, it is reported that, in practice, most 
asylum claims can be routed through the DFT, regardless of the complexity of the case or 
whether it can be heard properly within an accelerated legal schedule. Additional 
information provided by the Government emphasized the UKBA clear eligibility 
instruction and exclusion criteria for assessing the suitability of a case for DFT and 
highlighted that around 15 per cent of cases entering the DFT procedure are taken out 
because of their complexity. 
</p>
<p>50. Under a new asylum model introduced in March 2007, asylum-seekers are not 
detained, but are subject to closer contact management, through a dedicated Home Office 
case-owner, and have decisions on their asylum claims made according to faster schedules. 
Despite the fact that the model offers accelerated decision-making processes and increased 
contact with asylum-seekers without resorting to detention, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
attention was also drawn to cases of children, torture survivors and trafficked women who 
were detained while their asylum cases were being decided.38  
</p>
<p>51. Official figures report that, at the end of March 2009, a total of 1,740 asylum-
seekers had been detained at some stage solely under Immigration Act powers (71 per cent 
of all detainees), 6 per cent higher than at the end of March 2008 (1,640). Of the asylum-
seekers detained, 88 per cent were male.  
</p>
<p>52. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur also heard numerous allegations of 
instances of indefinite periods of detention of asylum-seekers. This allegation was 
acknowledged as true by UKBA officers in the last meeting held with the Special 
</p>

</p>
<p>Rapporteur on 26 June 2009, when reference was made to the case of Ahmed Daq,39 a 
Somali national and failed asylum-seeker with a criminal record, who was detained for over 
three years with no prospect of deportation and who, by a ruling of the High Court of 
Justice, was granted bail under stringent conditions, including tagging, daily reporting to an 
immigration officer or police station and residence at an address to be identified or agreed 
by the Secretary of State.40  
</p>
<p><b> C. The protection of children 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the withdrawal on November 2008 of the general 
reservation that the State had made upon ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the 
Child in connection with its application in the context of migration. He also notes with 
appreciation the establishment of the &#8220;Every Child Matters&#8221; framework aimed at ensuring 
that all children &#8211; regardless of their background or circumstances &#8211; are supported in the 
areas of health, education, social inclusion, participation and economic well-being. 
However, he regrets that, despite the numbers of immigrant children and children from a 
migrant background in the country, immigration status continues being a major barrier to 
children&#8217;s equal access to education and health care, as suggested by a study released by 
UNICEF in October 2009.41   
</p>
<p>54. Despite the law recognizing equal rights for students, regardless of refugee or other 
status, including for the purpose of the right to mandatory education maintenance grants 
and loans, asylum-seekers who have not been granted any type of leave to remain in the 
United Kingdom must in practice fulfil a three-year residency requirement before becoming 
eligible for higher education grants or loans. They are regarded as overseas students for 
purposes of fees and awards for further and higher education, although they may be eligible 
to take part-time further education courses at reduced fees. Furthermore, asylum-seekers 
generally face difficulties in securing access to further and higher education, particularly if 
they live outside London.42  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the use of detention in 
immigration control and the process of refugee status determination. In this connection, the 
House of Commons has stated in a report that nearly 1,000 children in families each year 
are detained in immigration removal centres.43 Stakeholders estimate that the figure is 
actually double that. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of the instruction issued by UKBA 
regarding age-disputed cases of asylum-seekers, whereby &#8220;the claimant should be treated as 
an adult if their physical appearance/demeanour very strongly suggests that they are 
significantly over 18 years of age&#8221; and expresses concern about the lack of recognition of 
the benefit of the doubt in age-disputed cases. He notes with dismay that this guidance 
relies excessively on subjective criteria, having as a consequence the possibility that minors

<p>could be considered as adults throughout the application process and detained on this basis. 
Furthermore &#8220;the lack of available information about the range of children involved [in 
asylum-seeking] raises considerable concern about safeguarding arrangements&#8221;.44    
</p>
<p><b> D. The protection of migrant domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>57. Reports suggest that approximately 17,000 visas are granted yearly to domestic 
workers, the vast majority of whom are women from non-European Union countries 
accompanying their employers and employed to undertake a range of activities in private 
households, including housekeeping and care work. These workers come from a variety of 
countries such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, while their employers are 
mainly Middle Eastern, Indian or British nationals.45  
</p>
<p>58. Regular migrant domestic workers enjoy employment law protection, including the 
right to the national minimum wage, adequate rest breaks, remunerated holidays and 
maternity-related rights, including leave. Information received suggests that challenges 
remain in the monitoring of living and working conditions, as the workplace of domestic 
workers is the home of their employers.   
</p>
<p>59. Stakeholders drew the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention to reports documenting a wide 
range of abuses encountered by migrant domestic workers in their workplaces, including 
poor working and living conditions, psychological and physical abuse, forced labour, 
sexual aggression, withholding of identity and travel documents, low or no wages and 
excessive working hours sometimes without meal or rest breaks. Allegations of threats and 
intimidation or physical violence and threats not to renew the workers&#8217; visa, to have the 
worker deported, to make spurious allegations to the police about a domestic worker 
stealing or to throw domestic workers out onto the streets were also mentioned during the 
visit. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that the right to change employer 
has been instrumental in facilitating the escape of migrant domestic workers from 
exploitative and abusive situations. This is because they know they can receive support and 
assistance and still seek work with another employer without facing the risk of being 
removed from the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the Government to continue this 
visa scheme for migrant domestic workers for at least two years, notwithstanding the 
introduction of the points-based system for nationals who apply to work in the United 
Kingdom from outside the European Economic Area. As highlighted by certain 
stakeholders and the Home Affairs Committee, migrant domestic workers warrant the 
special status afforded by the current scheme, so that they have access to labour rights 
recognized as for all workers and may change employers in case of abuse or exploitation.   
</p>
<p>62. According to information received, migrant domestic workers who accompany 
diplomats to the United Kingdom encounter the same level of abuse and exploitation as 
those suffered by migrant domestic workers who work for other employers. However, 
migrant domestic workers who accompany diplomats are currently not able to change 
employers outside of the diplomatic mission with which they came. This situation places 
them in a more vulnerable situation; hence they often feel unable to leave exploitative and

<p>abusive situations as usually their families are reliant on their remittances. These workers 
also often feel unable to seek redress and access justice because their immigration status is 
linked to that of their employers, who enjoy diplomatic status. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The protection and assistance for victims of human trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the commitment of the Government 
in this area and commends its decision to provide additional funds over the next two years 
to strengthen the assistance framework for trafficked victims, including the appointment of 
a Poppy Project national coordinator, special support for victims trafficked for labour 
exploitation46 and the expansion of services to victims of domestic servitude.   
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Poppy Project remains marginal, with a low 
accommodation capacity (54 beds). He is also concerned about allegations that the 
accommodation of victims benefiting from the Poppy Project is conditional on their 
cooperation in the prosecution of their traffickers and wishes to draw the Government&#8217;s 
attention to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, particularly, to principle 8, which highlights that trafficked victims&#8217; adequate 
protection from further harm and access to physical and psychological care &#8220;&#8230; shall not be 
made conditional upon the capacity or willingness of the trafficked person to cooperate in 
legal proceedings&#8221;.47 He also notes with concern that victims of internal trafficking are 
denied access to assistance under this project. 
</p><p>65. The Special Rapporteur praises the Government&#8217;s decision to strengthen the support 
mechanisms for victims of forced labour, including through the establishment of the Pay 
and Work Rights Helpline, which renders the five enforcement agencies (the Gangmasters 
Licensing Authority, the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, Her Majesty&#8217;s 
Revenue and Customs Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and 
the Health and Safety Executive) co-responsible in addressing complaints on the rights of 
vulnerable workers. This helpline helped 169 victims between June 2008 and September 
2009.48  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur also commends governmental efforts to address the 
phenomenon of child trafficking, inter alia, through the provision of specialized training for 
immigration officers and other UKBA staff and the publication of various guidance notes 
on protecting children. However, he is concerned about reports of a significant number of 
possible child victims of trafficking who may become unaccounted for by the local 
authority of children&#8217;s services and who are allegedly often re-trafficked or subjected to 
further abuse or exploitation.49 He is also concerned about the capacity of the existing 
agencies to provide comprehensive protection and assistance to child victims of trafficking, 
including safe accommodation, particularly in the light of information indicating that 
trafficked child victims are rarely provided with a full needs assessment, unlike in the case 
of British children, and that they are routinely accommodated in hostels rather than in 
specialized shelters or foster care, even when they are severely traumatized and still at 
risk.50

<p><b> F. Access to health care, regardless of immigration status  
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of interim guidance in April 2009 by 
the Department of Health to clarify the scope of emergency treatment for refused asylum-
seekers and migrants in irregular situations, who, according to the law, do not benefit from 
free health-care services except in case of emergency. He notes with appreciation that this 
guidance indicates that immediately necessary treatment, including maternity care, must 
never be withheld; urgent treatment for conditions such as cancer, which would deteriorate 
significantly if untreated, should not be withheld or delayed if the person cannot pay and is 
unable to return to his/her country; primary health-care trusts should not pursue charges 
beyond what is reasonable and have the option to write off debts where it would be 
impossible or futile to pursue them. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by 
the element of the guidance which states that &#8220;non-urgent treatment, which can wait until 
the person returns home, should not be started until payment has been made&#8221;. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this guidance regrettably does not address the fundamental issue, which 
is not to make health care conditional on a person&#8217;s immigration status.  
</p>
<p>68. Information received suggests that the great majority of separated asylum-seeking 
children are registered with a general practitioner. However, an overwhelming concern 
among nearly all stakeholders was the issue of interpreters and how the lack thereof and the 
reluctance of health services to use them affected children&#8217;s access and ability to 
understand and continue with treatment. This seems to be the case across a range of 
different services including general practitioners, hospitals and counselling and specialist 
mental health services. In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the findings 
from a joint review carried out by the Department of Health and the Home Office on access 
to the National Health Service by foreign nationals in July 2009, which recommends, inter 
alia, that refused asylum-seekers or unaccompanied asylum-seeking children should not be 
charged for access to secondary health care.<b> </b>51 
</p>
<p><b> G. Other concerns 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the threat posed by international terrorism 
and is aware of the long-term strategy for countering international terrorism (CONTEST) 
established in 2003. He welcomes the strategy&#8217;s revisions undertaken in 200652 and 2009,53 
by virtue of which the observance of international law and human rights standards and the 
promotion of good governance were included as guiding principles in all counter-terrorism 
efforts. However, he remains concerned about the human rights implications of the use of 
the grounds of &#8220;national security&#8221; and the &#8220;terrorism threat&#8221; to deprive non-nationals 
legally married to British nationals of the right to stay in the territory of the United 
Kingdom. In this connection, concern is expressed about section 56 of the Immigration, 
Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, in force as of 16 June 2006, which lowers the threshold 
for withdrawal of British citizenship by recognizing a new power of the Secretary of State 
who may order that a person be deprived of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is 
satisfied that deprivation is &#8220;conducive to the public good&#8221;.

<p>70. The Special Rapporteur heard allegations of disproportionate scrutiny and instances 
of psychological mistreatment of persons entering the United Kingdom with valid 
documentation. For example, a non-national holding a valid post-study work permit54 
reported having been given a &#8220;warning&#8221; on her national passport when re-entering the 
United Kingdom after spending a couple of months abroad and having been informed that 
next time she leaves the United Kingdom her permit will expire, despite the fact it has still 
about a year of validity. The Special Rapporteur regrets that this kind of situation fuels a 
climate of mistrust and intolerance at entry checkpoints.   
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur also received information about interrogation and excessive 
delays at airports, which in some instances have caused financial or other harm to persons 
in transit or entering the country, sometimes for short-term visits. According to those who 
report having been affected, these practices are based on race, colour, descent or national or 
ethnic origin and, in some instances, on pregnancy status.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur regrets that these allegations contrast with principles of 
human dignity and appear inconsistent with the <i>jus cogens</i> prohibition of discrimination. As 
noted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, profiling may violate the right to 
equality and non-discrimination when intelligence and law enforcement agents use profiles 
that reflect unexamined generalizations. This will likely be the case if profiling is based on 
ethnic or national origin (racial profiling) or religion (religious profiling), or if profiling 
solely or disproportionately affects a specific part of the population.55 Profiling may also be 
prohibited where it is based on a person&#8217;s country of origin if this is used as a proxy for 
racial or religious profiling.56 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>73. <b>The United Kingdom has shown genuine efforts to deliver a migration policy 
which determines the conditions of admission, stay and removal of non-nationals 
while aiming at complying with human rights obligations. Migration management 
aims at contributing to meet world security challenges and immigration and asylum-
seeking standards and currently focuses on the forcible return of persons in irregular 
situations, strengthening the screening of asylum-seekers and enhancing international 
cooperation with countries affected by conflict as a means of reducing immigration 
flows. Despite progress made, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, a number of 
challenges remain and he accordingly wishes to make the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In relation to the protection of migrant workers, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Consider ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the ILO 
Convention No. 143 concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion 
of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers, adopted by the ILO 
in 1975, with the aim of further strengthening efforts to protect all migrant workers, 
regardless of their immigration status, from abusive practices;

<p> <b>(b) Implement the recommendation made by the House of Lords&#8217; European 
Union Select Committee in its fourteenth report, according to which, the Government 
should commission research into the likely costs and consequences of acceding to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and seek to develop a political consensus for its adoption, 
both within the United Kingdom and across the European Union;</b>57  
</p>
<p> <b>(c) Establish effective and accessible channels which allow all migrant 
workers, including irregular migrant workers, to lodge complaints of violations of 
their rights without fear of retaliation on the grounds that they may be in an irregular 
situation. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In relation to the administrative detention of migrants, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Consider the recommendations made by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention in a 2009 report to the Human Rights Council,</b>58<b> particularly the 
call upon States to restrict the use of detention for immigration purposes, ensuring 
that it is a measure of last resort, only permissible for the shortest period of time and 
when no less restrictive measure is available and therefore, to use and make available 
alternative measures to detention both in law and in practice;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take measures to review the implementation of national laws applicable 
to the detention of migrants to ensure that they are harmonized with international 
human rights norms that prohibit arbitrary detention and inhumane treatment; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Take all necessary steps to prevent cases of de facto indefinite detention 
and grant to migrants in detention all judicial guarantees, including keeping them 
informed of their cases&#8217; status. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In relation to the protection of migrant domestic workers, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Consider affording to migrant domestic workers who accompany 
diplomats, the same protection granted to migrant domestic workers who work for 
other employers, including the right to change employer, as a measure to protect them 
from abusive practices; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Consider continuing to recognize migrant domestic workers as workers 
and, as such, ensure that they are protected by labour law, including that they are 
entitled to the national minimum wage, to change employers and have the possibility 
of renewing their visas on an annual basis provided that they remain in full-time 
employment in the same sector, even if the employment is not continuous; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Address the legislative barriers currently faced by migrant domestic 
workers to accessing compensation and redress under employment legislation, 
including the family worker exemption established in national minimum wage 
regulations and the Race Relations Act 1976; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen training programmes to combat prejudice against migrant 
domestic workers, especially among staff at embassies, immigration officials and 
police officers, so as to help such workers report or escape abusive situations and 
receive the appropriate assistance and counselling, when required; and increase

</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In relation to the protection of children in the context of migration, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Ensure the protection of migrant children accompanied by their families 
from detention and guarantee that migration laws include actual regulations that 
realize children&#8217;s rights and needs in such circumstances;

<p>78. <b>In relation to age-assessment processes in disputed-age cases of allegedly 
separated children who seek asylum, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Elaborate statutory guidance on a holistic and multiagency approach to 
age assessment to be applied in disputed cases of allegedly separated children who 
seek asylum; ensure that such children are able to access formal age assessment 
procedures and, accordingly, take all necessary steps to ensure that appropriate 
referrals are made;

<p> <b>(b) Provide adequate support to social workers and other officials carrying 
out age assessment and training on issues such as cultural and religious sensitivity, 
child protection and post-traumatic treatment;

<p> <b>(c) Recognize the benefit of the doubt in disputed cases of allegedly 
separated and unaccompanied children who seek asylum and, accordingly, apply the 
principle in <i>dubio pro infante</i>, recognize that in disputed-age cases the burden of proof 
is on the Government and accordingly suspend the application of UKBA asylum 
instruction 2.2 on age assessment, which instructs that &#8220;the claimant should be treated 
as an adult if their physical appearance/demeanour very strongly suggests that they 
are significantly over 18 years of age&#8221;;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Provide specific guidance and training at ports and screening units for 
the treatment of disputed-age cases and ensure that age is not assessed in screening 
units or at ports but by specialized units specifically created for that purpose.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In relation to the protection and assistance of victims of trafficking in persons, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Incorporate into national policies, plans and programmes and effectively 
implement the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking;</b>62 
</p>
<p> <b>(b) Ensure that appropriate training is given to law enforcement officials on 
human trafficking and the protection of trafficked victims;
