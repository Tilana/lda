Rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and bearing in mind article 27 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other relevant existing 
international standards and national legislation,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on the rights of persons belonging to national 
or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities adopted by the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Council, including Council resolutions 6/15 of 28 
September 2007 and 7/6 of 27 March 2008,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the need for reinforced efforts to meet the goal of the full realization of 
the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the lack of equal opportunities and equal access to education for many 
persons belonging to minorities, in particular minority children, prevents them from 
contributing fully to their own communities and to the wider society, and perpetuates the 
cycle of poverty experienced acutely by persons belonging to minorities facing 
discrimination, economic marginalization and social exclusion,
