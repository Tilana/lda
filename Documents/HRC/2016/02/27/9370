<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human Rights requested the Working Group 
inter alia &#8220;to monitor and study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military 
assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment of 
human rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination, and to prepare draft 
international basic principles that encourage respect for human rights on the part of those 
companies in their activities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> During recent missions to various countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region, 
the Working Group noted that the enjoyment and exercise of human rights were increasingly 
being impeded by the emergence of some new problems and trends related to mercenaries or 
their activities and by the role played by private military and security companies (PMSCs), as 
evidenced by the expansion of transnational security companies&#8217; operations in the region and the 
use in some places of private security guards instead of national police or security forces. 
Against this background, the Working Group deemed it advisable to hold a consultative meeting 
in order to gain a regional perspective of these companies&#8217; practices, to discuss the transfer of the 
monopoly over the legitimate use of force to private non-State actors as part of the swelling 
international trend to outsource State functions to private military and security firms, to examine 
the potential repercussions of this practice on national sovereignty and to analyse the regulations 
and other measures for which States have opted in order to ensure that these firms respect 
international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p> The regional consultation, which was organized by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in close collaboration with the Working Group 
on the use of mercenaries, took place in Panama City, at the OHCHR regional office for 
Latin America and the Caribbean, on 17 and 18 December 2007, pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 62/145, which requests the OHCHR to hold regional consultations on this question.  
</p>
<p> In the findings from the regional consultation the Working Group points out that, in some 
circumstances, the activities of PMSCs and their personnel may result in human rights violations. 
PMSCs recruit and use &#8220;private security guards&#8221; in low-intensity armed conflicts or in 
post-conflict situations all over the world, not just in Latin America and the Caribbean. PMSCs 
operate in a grey area where human rights violations are facilitated by impunity and a lack of 
accountability. This poses serious political and military problems. PMSCs are constantly taking 
over functions that were until recently inherent to the sovereignty of States as the sole holders of 
the legitimate monopoly over the use of force. The transfer of these functions to the private 
sector and their performance by transnational companies are weakening national sovereignty and 
the United Nations collective security system. This new military and private security industry, 
which exports its services to areas of armed conflict, has expanded spectacularly in recent years. 
The large number of human rights violations reveals the inadequacy of the existing framework 
governing its activities, which rests mainly on self-regulation and voluntary codes of conduct. 
Sates have a duty to regulate these activities, because it is their responsibility to adopt the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.5 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>requisite measure to ensure the respect, fulfilment and promotion of human rights. Nevertheless, 
since these activities are transnational, they must also be regulated regionally and by the 
United Nations. 
</p>
<p> The regional consultation was attended by representatives of the Governments of Chile, 
Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and 
Paraguay, the Chairperson-Rapporteur and two members of the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries, independent experts, representatives of the Inter-American Institute of Human 
Rights (IIHR), representatives of two associations of the military and private security industry 
and representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human Rights requested the Working Group on 
the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
right of peoples to self-determination inter alia &#8220;to elaborate and present concrete proposals on 
possible new standards, general guidelines or basic principles encouraging the further protection 
of human rights, in particular the right of peoples to self-determination, while facing current and 
emergent threats posed by mercenaries or mercenary-related activities&#8221;. The Working Group was 
further instructed to &#8220;study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military 
assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment of 
human rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination, and to prepare draft 
international basic principles that encourage respect for human rights on the part of those 
companies in their activities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. During missions to Honduras, Ecuador, Peru and Chile in the period 2006-2007, the 
Working Group noted that the enjoyment and exercise of human rights in Latin America and the 
Caribbean were increasingly being impeded by the emergence of some new problems and trends 
related to mercenaries or their activities and by the role played by private military and security 
companies (PMSCs), as evidenced by the expansion of transnational security companies&#8217; 
operations in the region and the use in some places of private security guards instead of national 
police or security forces. 
</p>
<p>3. In the course of its field missions, the Working Group discovered that the monopoly over 
the legitimate use of force was being transferred more and more to private non-State actors in 
line with the international boom in the private military and security sector. These practices have 
meant an outsourcing or privatization of warfare at the international level and of security at the 
domestic level. 
</p>
<p>4. One aspect of this is the recruitment and training of personnel from Latin America and the 
Caribbean with a view to offering security services to private companies working in countries 
such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The Working Group found that governments in the region are 
often ill-equipped to come to grips with this problem by registering and licensing the PMSCs 
operating in their territory, for example or introducing effective administrative, regulatory and 
accountability arrangements so as to ensure that these firms follow standard recruitment 
procedures and offer standard working conditions. Weak or inadequate domestic legislation 
combined with few economic opportunities have made for a proliferation of PMSCs, which hire 
former soldiers and policemen and other persons from third countries so as to offer security 
services in low-intensity armed conflicts and post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group deemed it advisable to hold a consultative meeting in order to gain a 
regional perspective of the practices of PMSCs operating in the region and to analyse the 
measures adopted by States to regulate and control these firms. The regional consultation also 
studied various good practices and options for regulating PMSCs to ensure that they comply with 
international human rights standards. </p>

</p>
<p>6. The regional consultation, which was organized by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in close collaboration with the Working Group 
on the use of mercenaries, was held at the OHCHR regional office in Panama, pursuant to the 
recently adopted General Assembly resolution 62/145, which requests OHCHR to hold regional 
consultations on this question. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  PARTICIPANTS 
</b></p>
<p>7. The consultation was attended by representatives of the Governments of Chile, Costa Rica, 
Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Paraguay, 
representatives of the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights (IIHR), four experts on the 
subject, and representatives of two associations of PMSCs, the International Peace Operation 
Association (IPOA) and the British Association of Private Security Companies (BAPSC). The 
list of participants may be found in annex I.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group was represented by the Chairperson-Rapporteur Mr. Jos&#233; Luis 
G&#243;mez del Prado, Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez and Mr. Alexander Nikitin.

</p>
<p><b>III.  FINDINGS OF THE WORKING GROUP 
</b></p>
<p>11. The government representatives attending the regional consultation and the members of the 
Working Group emphasized that States have a duty to respect, implement and promote human 
rights.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.5 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>12. The regional consultation, like the Working Group&#8217;s reports, served to alert national 
authorities and international public opinion to the effects of the activities of PMSCs and their 
personnel on the enjoyment of human rights. In some situations their action could result in 
human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group considered it advisable to present the following findings based on 
statements and debates at the regional consultation. 
</p>
<p>14.  &#8220;Private security guards&#8221; were recruited all over the world, not just in Latin America and 
the Caribbean but in the world&#8217;s other four geopolitical regions, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 
Eastern Europe and Western Europe. 
</p>
<p>15. PMSCs employ &#8220;private security guards&#8221; to offer a variety of security services in 
low-intensity armed conflicts and post-conflict situations. They work in a grey area that is hard 
to distinguish from the mercenarism of the soldiers of fortune of former times. As with the 
mercenaries of the past, the actions of those &#8220;private security guards&#8221;, who work for legally 
registered transnational companies which export their services, give rise to a number of human 
rights problems. Yet although their activities have characteristics in common with mercenarism, 
save in exceptional cases they do not fit the technical definition provided in the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. That 
instrument was drafted in the 1970s and no longer matches reality. Apart from the lacunae it 
contains, the Convention is not a universal instrument since only 30 States are parties to it.  
</p>
<p>16. A number of political and military dilemmas are posed by the action of PMSCs, which 
operate in a grey zone where human rights violations are facilitated by impunity and a lack of 
accountability. In order to avoid electoral costs and having to answer to public opinion, some 
governments outsource to such firms. At the same time, the involvement of non-State actors 
fragments and complicates armed conflicts and post-conflict situations because there is no 
coordination or control over these actors, and this hampers the armed forces&#8217; freedom of action. 
</p>
<p>17. PMSCs are constantly taking over functions that were until recently inherent to the 
sovereignty of States as the sole holders of the legitimate monopoly over the use of force. The 
transfer of these functions to the private sector and their performance by transnational companies 
are weakening national sovereignty and the United Nations collective security system, which 
rests on Member States&#8217; sovereignty. In some circumstances it is even possible to speak of a 
&#8220;privatization of war&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. PMSCs which export military and security services blur the dividing line between the 
public and private sectors. Moreover, although in reality they are essentially profit-driven, they 
often present themselves as humanitarian or peacebuilding organizations, thereby also making it 
unclear where the boundaries of non-governmental humanitarian organizations&#8217; field of action 
really lie. In fact, these transnationals are neither humanitarian actors nor peacebuilders and are 
basically motivated by commercial considerations. 
</p>
<p>19. The new military and private security industry which exports its services to areas of armed 
conflict has expanded spectacularly with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the globalization of the 
world economy and the new pattern of governance. The industry has encouraged the 
establishment of associations that use the latest marketing techniques to effectively lobby </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.5 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and private industry. It 
would be illusory to think that when such companies violate human rights they will be punished 
by the invisible hand of the market as business dries up and they fade away: they are not. On the 
contrary, experience shows that, in many cases, companies reported for crimes against the 
civilian population in their theatre of action continue to receive contracts. 
</p>
<p>20. The current framework governing the activities of PMSCs, which is based mainly on 
self-regulation and voluntary codes of conduct, is inadequate as can be seen from the numerous 
instances of human rights violations. One of the most recent and most blatant incidents, which 
was not an isolated occurrence, was the killings that took place on 16 September 2007 in 
Baghdad, in which 17 civilians, among them women and children, died and a further 20 people 
were wounded as a result of indiscriminate shooting by personnel of the Blackwater company, 
which up to then had been self-regulated by the voluntary standards and codes of conduct of the 
International Peace Operation Association. 
</p>
<p>21. It falls to States to regulate these activities, but as they are transnational activities there is 
also a need for regulation at the regional level and in the framework of the United Nations. To 
that end, States must precisely define what functions are inherently governmental and cannot be 
transferred to PMSCs.  
</p>
<p>22. The wide range of activities of PMSCs poses serious problems for the international 
community and United Nations peacekeeping operations. 
</p>
<p>23. In the short term, the Working Group considers it necessary for States to accede to the 
Convention and bring their domestic legislation into line with it since, despite the fact that it is 
outdated and contains several lacunae, it is the only international instrument there is until such 
time as new provisions are drafted. In order to ease the accession of States not yet parties to the 
Convention, OHCHR, acting in close collaboration with the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries, could draft a model law based on the Convention. 
</p>
<p>24. At the same time, in the short and medium term, the activities of PMSCs  also need to be 
regulated at the national level, both by the States of registration of transnational exporters of 
military and security services and by the countries importing those services and where the 
companies operate or recruit.  
</p>
<p>25. As a priority measure, States should define the military and security functions which 
cannot be outsourced because they inherently belong to governments as holders of the monopoly 
over the legitimate use of force. Similarly it is necessary: to define and delimit functions which 
can be outsourced and for which national rules should be formulated; to adopt legislation and set 
up supervisory machinery, in respect of those activities; to establish a registration and licensing 
system and penalties; to lay down rules concerning the respect for human rights and international 
humanitarian law; to make it obligatory to provide personnel with proper training also 
encompassing human rights standards; to establish effective arrangements for selecting vetting 
applicants; and lastly to make it obligatory to present periodic reports and to introduce a 
monitoring system.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.5 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>26. States must take the necessary steps to prevent the recruitment of former soldiers and 
police officers as &#8220;private security guards&#8221; for deployment in armed conflict or post-conflict 
zones. An individual&#8217;s right to free choice of employment cannot be absolute when the State 
becomes involved, as it does when it takes part, albeit indirectly through its citizens, in an armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>27. In the medium and long term, the Working Group considers it necessary to identify the 
loopholes in the Convention that PMSCs use in order to work in armed conflict or post-conflict 
zones and to draw up standards and additional binding basic principles with a view to 
incorporating them in an additional protocol to the Convention, which would first be debated in 
the United Nations General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>28. Furthermore the United Nations could set up in its departments, offices, organizations, 
programmes and funds an effective system for selecting and vetting personnel and could 
encourage the formulation of guidelines setting out relevant criteria for regulating and 
supervising the activities of PMSCs that win contracts and operate under its authority. It should 
also demand and ensure that those guidelines comply with human rights standards and 
international humanitarian law. In particular it should introduce the requirement that companies 
or persons employed by them have not been implicated in human rights violations. </p>
