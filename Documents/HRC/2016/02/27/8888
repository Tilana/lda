<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In resolution 7/7 on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to implement the mandate given to her by the Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 2005/80 and the General Assembly in its resolution 60/158 to 
examine the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism; make general recommendations concerning the obligation of States in this 
context; provide assistance and advice to States, upon their request, as well as to the relevant 
United Nations bodies. This report is submitted in accordance with Council resolution 7/7. 
</p>
<p> This report analyses the links between counter-terrorism measures and economic, social 
and cultural rights. It examines how international treaty obligations to promote and protect these 
rights should form part of the counter-terrorism strategy of a State. It highlights the need to 
protect and promote all human rights and in particular economic, social and cultural rights, while 
at the same time taking effective counter-terrorism measures. Protecting and promoting all 
human rights while countering terrorism are complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives. 
They must be pursued in the context of the duty of States to protect, respect and fulfil all human 
rights. 
</p>
<p> Through specific examples, the report focuses on key aspects of economic, social and 
cultural rights, the legal framework in the context of countering terrorism, as well as the impact 
of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures and policies on the enjoyment of this category of 
rights. It also addresses issues related to monitoring, justiciability, remedies and impunity in this 
context. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Achieving global security objectives would be impossible without concerted efforts 
towards the realization of all human rights. In my previous reports on the protection of human 
rights while countering terrorism, I focused primarily on the impact of counter-terrorism 
measures on civil and political rights. In this report, I will focus on the issue of economic, social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>2. It is becoming clear that terrorism, and measures adopted to combat terrorist acts, are both 
influenced by and have a great impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, 
as well as on civil and political rights. The links between counter-terrorism measures and 
economic, social and cultural rights were highlighted by Member States through the adoption of 
the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and Plan of Action, by the General Assembly in 
resolution 60/288 and reaffirmed in resolution 62/272. Member States reaffirmed that the 
promotion and protection of all human rights for all, as well as respect for the rule of law are 
essential to all components of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. They recognized that 
effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of all human rights are not conflicting 
goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>3. In the Strategy, Member States also recognized the need to deal with the conditions 
conducive to the spread of terrorism. These include: &#8220;&#8230; prolonged unresolved conflicts, 
dehumanization of victims of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, lack of the rule of law 
and violations of human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, political exclusion, 
socio-economic marginalization and lack of good governance ...&#8221;.<b>1</b> This cannot be read outside 
the context of the need for States to respect, protect and fulfil their obligations regarding 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The Human Rights Council in its resolution 10/15 urged States, while countering terrorism, 
&#8220;to protect all human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that 
certain counter-terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of these rights&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
Efforts to understand and address the linkages between counter-terrorism measures and the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights must be continued.<b>3</b> 
5. This report draws on the discussions that took place during an expert seminar organized by 
my Office on &#8220;The impact of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights&#8221; in Geneva on 5-7 November 2008. The meeting took place 
in the context of the work of the Working Group on Protecting Human Rights While Countering 
Terrorism, of the Secretary General&#8217;s Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF). 
My Office chairs this Working Group.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. KEY ASPECTS OF THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF ECONOMIC,  
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT OF  
TERRORISM AND COUNTER-TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. Without doubt, terrorism has a very serious impact on all human rights - civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural - and it contributes to the creation of a climate of fear and 
insecurity. As part of their duty to protect individuals&#8217; human rights, States must therefore take 
effective measures to counter terrorism. At the same time, all such measures must respect human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>7. It is clear now that terrorism, and measures adopted by States to combat terrorist acts, are 
both influenced by and have an impact on the enjoyment of the economic, social and cultural 
rights of affected individuals, as well as on broader development objectives. To effectively work 
towards eliminating terrorism, States must pay more attention to the recognition of these rights 
and give effect to all human rights. It is only by addressing human rights issues, including 
economic, social and cultural rights, through the lens of the conditions that lead to the spread of 
terrorism, such as socio-economic marginalization and exclusion, ethnic, national and religious 
discrimination, political exclusion and lack of good governance, that this goal can be achieved. 
</p>
<p>8. The obligations of States to respect, protect and fulfil the rights enshrined in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights<b>4</b> are spelt out in article 2, 
paragraph 1, of the Covenant and further clarified in general comment No. 3 (1990) of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations. 
</p>
<p>9. Recognizing that some rights may be realized only over a period of time due to resource 
constraints, some of the obligations of States assumed under the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are defined by the concept of progressive realization. 
However, that should not be interpreted to mean that until States have sufficient resources, they 
do not have to fulfil their obligations on economic, social and cultural rights. On the contrary, the 
Covenant imposes an immediate obligation on States to take deliberate, concrete and targeted 
measures to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the full realization of all 
rights contained in the Covenant,<b>5</b> and to use the maximum available, and not just remaining, 
resources. 
</p>

</p>

refworld/docid/48abd5730.html; see also African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights,

Rights (CESR) v. Nigeria</i>, communication No. 155/96, October 2001.

</b>  See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 3 (1990) on 
</p>
<p>the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations (art. 2, para. 1, of the Covenant), para. 9. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. The Covenant also contains rights and safeguards that must be guaranteed immediately. 
One example is the obligation on States to guarantee non-discrimination, including ensuring the 
equal rights of men and women in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
Moreover, a number of rights contained in the Covenant can clearly be implemented 
immediately, irrespective of the resource constraints of a State, including the right to join and 
form trade unions, protection against forced evictions, or the freedom indispensable for scientific 
research and creative activity.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defined the minimum core 
obligations of the Covenant, which are obligations considered to be of immediate effect to meet 
the minimum essential levels of each of the rights. Where any significant number of individuals 
are deprived of enjoying them, prima facie, States parties would be considered as failing to 
discharge their obligations under the Covenant.<b>7</b> Minimum core obligations are generally 
determined by having regard to fundamental needs, particularly of the most vulnerable persons. 
The Committee holds the view that for a State to attribute failure to meet its minimum core 
obligations to a lack of resources, it must show that &#8220;every effort has been made to use all 
resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of priority, those minimum 
obligations&#8221;.<b>8</b> The Optional Protocol to the Covenant, adopted in December 2008 by the 
General Assembly, refers to the &#8220;reasonableness of the steps taken by the State party&#8221;.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>12. When allocating available resources to different programmes, due regard should be given 
to the core content of each right, with special focus on the requirements of &#8220;the vulnerable 
members of society&#8221;.<b>10</b> In the words of the Committee, &#8220;even where the available resources are 
demonstrably inadequate, the obligation remains for a State party to strive to ensure the widest 
possible enjoyment of the relevant rights under the prevailing circumstances&#8221;.<b>11</b> 
13. It should be noted that violations of economic, social and cultural rights can occur through 
the adoption of retrogressive measures that reduce the extent to which any right is already 
guaranteed.<b>12</b> Every State is obliged to ensure for everyone under its jurisdiction access to the 
minimum essential rights, and there is a strong presumption that retrogressive measures taken in

<p>relation to the minimum core obligations are not permissible under the Covenant.<b>13</b> A State party 
would have to demonstrate that these measures can be justified by reference to the totality of 
rights provided for in the Covenant,<b>14</b> i.e. that they are taken in pursuit of a pressing goal, that 
they are strictly necessary and that no less restrictive measures were available to achieve the 
same goal. The Committee recalls in general comment No. 3, paragraph 12, that even in times of 
severe resource constraints, the vulnerable members of society must be protected by the adoption 
of relatively low-cost targeted programmes. 
</p>
<p>14. Obligations under the Covenant apply to nationals and also to non-nationals, including 
refugees and asylum-seekers. Nonetheless, under article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, 
developing countries may determine, with due regard to human rights and their national 
economy, to what extent they would guarantee the rights recognized in the Covenant to 
non-nationals. Moreover, the provisions in the Covenant concerning international assistance and 
cooperation, particularly in article 2, have been interpreted to reflect an obligation to refrain from 
actions which interfere with the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in other 
countries.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Links between economic, social and cultural  
rights and civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. From the perspective of the general human rights framework, there are links between 
economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights contains a range of economic, social, civil, cultural and political rights. The 
World Conference on Human Rights in its 1993 Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action affirmed 
that &#8220;all human rights are universal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelated&#8221;, and that all 
human rights must be treated &#8220;globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with 
the same emphasis&#8221;.<b>16</b> Some regional instruments, such as the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, do not make any distinction between the two sets of rights. In addition, the 
principles of non-discrimination and equality are equally applicable to all human rights. 
</p>
<p>16. The Human Rights Committee, the body that monitors implementation of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, holds the view that when a State party takes action 
affecting economic, social and economic rights - even rights not protected by the Covenant - this 
requires that, under article 26 of the Covenant, any such action be taken in a non-discriminatory 
way, regardless of any shortage of resources. In addition, the Human Rights Committee is of the

standard of health (art. 12), para 32.

<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  Chapter I, para. 5. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>view that, under article 27 of the Covenant, the rights of persons to engage in economic and 
social activities that are part of the culture of the minority community to which they belong are 
protected.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Economic, social and cultural rights cannot be fully achieved where civil and political 
rights are curtailed. Conversely, civil and political rights cannot be fully exercised where 
economic, social and cultural rights are neglected. Counter-terrorism measures and policies that 
neglect these rights risk creating a fertile climate for poverty, unemployment, and greater 
insecurities in societies. Systematic discrimination and structural inequities may spark or 
exacerbate social and political tensions resulting in terrorist acts and counter-terrorist activities. 
</p>
<p>18. The enjoyment of civil and political rights impacts on the enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights as much as the enjoyment of the latter impacts on the enjoyment of the 
former. For example, limitations on the freedom of movement may impact on the right to 
adequate housing and/or the right to work, whilst there is a clear correlation between the 
enjoyment of the right to food and the right to life. Therefore, States have an obligation to 
incorporate international human rights norms and standards into their national legal orders, 
including the constitution and national legislation, so those rights can be fulfilled in a 
complementary form. In some jurisdictions, economic, social and cultural rights have been 
protected through the protection of civil and political rights. For example, the Supreme Court of 
India has read the right to health care, the right to adequate housing and the right to food as being 
part of the right to life which is protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>19. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights does not contain 
express provisions for derogating from economic, social and cultural rights during emergencies, 
disasters or armed conflict, while obviously such situations may affect the ability of States to 
guarantee those rights, for example the availability of resources to ensure enjoyment of them on 
an immediate basis. 
</p>
<p>20. General comment No. 14 (2000), of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (art. 12) refers to the 
non-derogability of core obligations.<b>18</b> Recalling its general comment No. 3, the Committee 
confirms that States parties have a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very 
least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights enunciated in the Covenant, including 
essential primary health care. The Committee further indicated in its general comment No. 14 
that: &#8220;... Read in conjunction with more contemporary instruments, such as the Programme of 
Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Alma-Ata 
Declaration provides compelling guidance on the core obligations arising from article 12. 
Accordingly, in the Committee&#8217;s view, these core obligations include at least the following 
obligations: 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 23 (1994) on article 27 (Rights of 
</p>
<p>minorities), para. 6.2. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 47. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (a) To ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a 
non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups; 
</p>
<p> (b) To ensure access to the minimum essential food which is nutritionally adequate and 
safe, to ensure freedom from hunger to everyone; 
</p>
<p> (c) To ensure access to basic shelter, housing and sanitation, and an adequate supply of 
safe and potable water; 
</p>
<p> (d) To provide essential drugs, as from time to time defined under the WHO Action 
Programme on Essential Drugs; 
</p>
<p> (e) To ensure equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and services; 
</p>
<p> (f) To adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action, on the 
basis of epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of the whole population; the 
strategy and plan of action shall be devised, and periodically reviewed, on the basis of a 
participatory and transparent process; they shall include methods, such as right to health 
indicators and benchmarks, by which progress can be closely monitored; the process by which 
the strategy and plan of action are devised, as well as their content, shall give particular attention 
to all vulnerable or marginalized groups&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>21. In addition, in times of emergency, it is important to protect fundamental economic, social 
and cultural rights, in particular those of the most vulnerable groups of society. It is also 
important to ensure that all counter-terrorism measures conform to the legal framework 
applicable at the time of their adoption. International human rights obligations, including 
obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, must be 
respected at all times, even when international humanitarian law applies. 
</p>
<p>22. In many countries, the justification for imposing a state of emergency has been largely 
abused since 11 September 2001, and the exceptional measures taken to counter terrorism tend to 
become permanent. Such measures usually curtail civil and political rights and affect the 
economic, social and cultural rights of entire communities. As a result, they could lead to further 
marginalization, discrimination and possibly radicalization within those communities. 
</p>
<p>23. Excluding the consideration of the impact of states of emergency on economic, social and 
cultural rights is particularly problematic in States where long-standing states of emergency have 
been imposed. In these cases, the socio-economic situation needs to be taken into account to 
determine whether the measures adopted are proportionate, which may vary over time. 
Therefore, there is a need for the concept of security to factor in such rights. In addition, if 
situations which warrant the declaration of states of emergency are considered solely within the 
framework of civil and political rights, any solution will also be framed from that perspective. 
Such a limited perspective fails to recognize the role to be played by socio-economic rights in 
any comprehensive solution.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE IMPACT OF COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES 
AND POLICIES ON THE ENJOYMENT OF ECONOMIC, 
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The inadequate fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. Because of the nature of the counter-terrorism measures adopted by States, policy priorities 
may appear to be distorted. Economic, social and cultural rights have not been among the 
priorities of the human rights discourse in the context of counter-terrorism, which has largely 
focused on civil and political rights, leaving little or no space for discussion of the impact of 
counter-terrorism measures on economic, social and cultural rights, or the positive measures that 
States need to adopt to implement them as part of any strategy to address terrorism. This has 
been reflected in public spending on counter-terrorism, which in most countries has focused on 
the military, on policing and on intelligence gathering and analysis. Allocations to areas such as 
basic social services (for example, health and education) and international development have 
largely not increased or, worse, have declined. This trend, however, appears to be changing as 
States broaden their counter-terrorism responses. 
</p>
<p>25. Classic examples of counter-terrorism measures that have an impact on economic, social 
and cultural rights are measures that affect the right to housing. This right is often subject to 
abuse through forced evictions and house demolitions, especially in high-security zones. These 
actions often lead to displacement and deepen poverty, resulting in additional human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>26. The European Court of Human Rights stated, in a case where it found that the destruction 
of a home and possessions by security forces amounted to inhuman treatment, that &#8220;even 
assuming that the acts in question were carried out without any intention of punishing the 
applicant, but instead as a discouragement to others or to prevent his home from being used by 
terrorists, this would not provide a justification for the ill-treatment&#8221;.<b>20</b> In relation to the right to 
housing, several resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights 
Council, as well as a general comment of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, have reaffirmed that forced evictions represent a violation of human rights, and provided 
clarification on the due process requirements for evictions that can be justified under 
international human rights law.<b>21</b>

</b>  See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 7 and 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/77. See also Basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement, A/HRC/18, annex I.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. General comment No. 12 (1999) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights on the right to adequate food (art. 11) calls on States to &#8220;... refrain at all times from food 
embargoes or similar measures, which endanger conditions for food production and access to 
food in other countries. Food should never be used as an instrument of political and economic 
pressure&#8221;.<b>22</b> Nor should it be used as a counter-terrorism measure. 
</p>
<p>28. General comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also 
notes that &#8220;States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining 
from denying or limiting equal access for all persons, including prisoners or detainees, 
minorities, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, curative and palliative health 
services&#8221;.<b>23 
</b></p>
<p>29. There is a need to make a clear distinction between immigration and migration laws and 
regulations, and security and counter-terrorism measures. It is neither correct nor desirable to 
consider all migration laws and policies as counter-terrorism legislation. However, it is clear that 
terrorism and security may be used as a trigger for States to take measures aimed at targeting 
ethnic minorities and migrants.<b>24</b> Measures that targeted particular minorities, for example, took 
the form of invasive surveillance of a group, fingerprinting campaigns targeting a specific ethnic 
group, the adoption of decrees stating that a particular minority was a security threat, or the 
adoption of measures to facilitate their eviction. All of these measures have a serious impact on 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>30. In addition, a number of specific human rights concerns may occur in the context of 
ensuring border security, linked to the treatment and screening of individuals when crossing an 
internationally recognized State border. 
</p>
<p>31. States are increasingly placing their immigration laws and policies at the centre of their 
counter-terrorism strategies. Terrorism and national security concerns have become a 
justification to tighten immigration and asylum regimes. There is a tendency to return 
asylum-seekers or repatriate refugees hastily without paying sufficient attention to their 
economic, social and cultural rights, with the risk that they may face persecution in their 
countries of origin. Such measures could have a disproportionate and discriminatory impact on 
asylum-seekers, refugees and immigrants and, more generally, non-citizens.

<p>32. The special impact of counter-terrorism measures on the economic, social and cultural 
rights of women and children is often disregarded. There have been impermissible effects on 
women that are often neither acknowledged nor compensated.<b>25 </b>The International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women require States to ensure that non-discrimination and equality on 
the basis of gender and sex are respected in all circumstances. Broad definitions of offences 
related to terrorism, such as those that criminalize material support, financing and association 
with terrorists, may also directly and indirectly impact women and children.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>33. The impact of counter-terrorism measures on family members has been examined at the 
international level by the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances,<b>27</b> at the 
regional level by the European Court of Human Rights<b>28</b> and by national courts. These instances 
have heard a number of cases dealing with serious human rights violations which primarily 
impact on the civil and political rights of the targeted individual, and have had an impact on 
female family members, who bear the burden of anxiety, harassment, social exclusion and 
economic hardship occasioned by the loss of the male breadwinner.<b>29</b> Similar effects ensue from 
the prolonged detention without trial of male family members. The practice of extraordinary 
rendition, and forced deportations of male family members has an adverse impact on the 
principle of equality in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to 
adequate housing, and the right to family life. 
</p>
<p>34. States have a particular responsibility for guaranteeing that women&#8217;s economic, social and 
cultural rights are not violated in the context of counter-terrorism.<b>30</b> In some cases, where women 
and children have been deprived of the source of their livelihoods, as a result of measures taken 
against husbands and fathers, it has been shown that such counter-terrorism measures can 
increase poverty and poverty-related discrimination in fulfilling economic, social and cultural

<p>rights, which can disproportionately affect women and children. In addition, counter-terrorism 
measures often lead to increased militarization and policing, which - like terrorism itself - can 
have a broader negative impact on the human rights of women and children. Any sustainable 
counter-terrorism strategy should be developed with particular attention paid to economic, social 
and cultural rights, including those of women and children.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>35. Another aspect of the impact of counter-terrorism measures on economic, social and 
cultural rights is where legislation or its application may result in the criminalization of 
legitimate social protests, and of national movements for the protection of those rights. This 
includes trade unions and human rights defenders, and movements for labour rights, land rights, 
women&#8217;s rights and indigenous peoples. Special legislation and regulations have been enacted in 
several countries to restrict the fundamental freedoms of civil society groups that seek to 
peacefully promote economic, social and cultural rights. In several countries, social activists 
have been arrested and charged under counter-terrorism legislation for their human rights-based 
claims concerning access to water or land. Groups that challenge social exclusion and unequal 
power relations by promoting human rights and development are sometimes labelled as 
extremists and suffer constraints on their ability to operate. 
</p>
<p>36. The rights of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association must be seen as a 
platform for the exercise, claims and defence of economic, social and cultural rights, as well 
as of civil and political rights. They are also often the basis for the work of human rights 
defenders, and the creation of civil society and NGOs, including those focusing on economic, 
social and cultural rights. As such, these rights are one foundation of a democratic society. Often, 
however, limitations imposed on their enjoyment go beyond the scope necessary to counter 
terrorism and can be used to limit the rights of, inter alia, trade unions and human rights 
defenders.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>37. The social stigmatization of religious, ethnic, or political groups seen as supporting 
terrorism creates a culture of fear. This limits the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights of members of those groups. The ensuing discrimination in access to employment or 
housing especially impacts on vulnerable groups, such as migrants and minorities, and has a 
direct impact on escalating poverty. Where human rights defenders are stigmatized, this 
discredits their cause and prevents them from taking it to an international forum or before 
international human rights bodies.<b>32</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. Given the negative impact that comprehensive sanctions may have on human rights, 
including on economic, social and cultural rights, the Security Council has adopted targeted 
sanctions<b>33</b> as a tool to fight terrorism. The changes brought about by Security Council 
resolution 1822 (2008) are encouraging, but they do not go far enough to provide the necessary 
safeguards to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights,<b>34</b> or provide a just assessment of the 
impact of the sanctions regime on economic, social and cultural rights.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>39. It is important that the Sanctions Committee<b>36</b> pays due attention to the impact of sanctions 
on economic, social and cultural rights when it decides to list an individual or an entity.<b>37</b> The 
sanctions regimes established under Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)<b>38</b> may raise greater 
challenges than those relating to the Taliban established in resolution 1267 (1999)<b>39</b> if economic, 
social and cultural rights are not fully considered in their implementation. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  Targeted sanctions are a tool for bringing Governments or groups in line with international 
</p>
<p>laws and norms. Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) established a sanctions regime to cover 
individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban wherever 
located. The regime has since been reaffirmed and modified by a dozen further Security Council 
resolutions. They have all been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations 
and require all States to take specified measures in connection with any individual or entity 
associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban. 
<b>34
</b></p>
<p>  Member States are required to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets of 
Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban, and individuals or entities associated with them.

on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and 
cultural rights, para 1, &#8220;... whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full 
account of the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>  The Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning 
Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;The international community should be under no illusion: these humanitarian and human 
rights policy goals cannot easily be reconciled with those of a sanctions regime. It cannot be too 
strongly emphasized that sanctions are a tool of enforcement and, like other methods of 
enforcement, they will do harm. This should be borne in mind when the decision to impose them 
is taken, and when the results are subsequently evaluated.&#8221; A/53/1, para. 64, Report of the 
Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (1998). 
<b>38
</b></p>
<p>  See paragraph 1 (c) of resolution 1373 (2001) which does not identify a consolidated list of 
specific persons whose assets must be frozen pursuant to these measures, such as Al-Qaida and 
the Taliban. 
<b>39
</b></p>
<p>  See paragraph 4 (b) of resolution 1267 (1999), which refers specifically to the Taliban or &#8220;any 
undertaking owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Taliban&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. The practice of listing and de-listing individuals and groups as terrorist and associated 
entities may seriously impact on a number of internationally protected human rights, as 
increasingly recognized by a number of regional and national courts. Following the recent 
European Court of Justice judgment in the case of Kadi and Al Barakaat International 
Foundation,<b>40</b> as well as the Views of the Human Rights Committee,<b>41</b> institutional changes to 
the sanctions regime have become necessary. 
</p>
<p>41. The freezing of assets has an impact on several human rights including the right to 
property. It impacts directly on the right to work and the right to freedom of movement 
associated with it. The impact of listing on an individual&#8217;s right to work was illustrated by a 
recent case before the Human Rights Committee. In the case of <i>Nabil Sayadi and Patricia Vinck 
v. Belgium</i>, the Human Rights Committee addressed the national implementation of the sanctions 
regime set forth in Security Council resolution 1267 (1999).<b>42 </b>The Committee noted that a travel 
ban against the complainants resulted from the transmittal by Belgium of their names to the 
Sanctions Committee. The Committee found that the travel ban constituted a violation of the 
authors&#8217; right to freedom of movement under article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, because both the dismissal of a criminal investigation and the State party 
de-listing requests showed that the restrictions were not necessary to protect national security or 
public order. The Committee indicated that because of the travel ban, the victims had not been 
able to accept an offer of employment in another country. Based on its general comment 
No. 27 (1999) on article 12 (Freedom of movement), the Committee noted that &#8220;it is not 
sufficient that the restrictions serve the permissible purposes; they must also be necessary to 
protect them&#8221; and that &#8220;restrictive measures must conform to the principle of proportionality; 
they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function&#8221;.<b>43</b> This decision was followed by 
six individual opinions from Committee members, both on admissibility and on merits. 
</p>
<p>42. Because individual listings are currently open-ended in duration, they may result in a 
temporary freeze of assets becoming permanent which, in turn, may amount to criminal 
punishment due to the severity of the sanction. This threatens to go well beyond the purpose 
of the United Nations to combat the terrorist threat posed by an individual case. In addition, 
there is no uniformity in relation to evidentiary standards and procedures. This poses serious 
human rights issues, as all punitive decisions should be either judicial or subject to judicial 
review.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Conditions conducive to terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy provides a list of conditions conducive to 
terrorism, for instance: prolonged conflicts, occupation, subjugation, absence of democracy and 
rule of law, poverty, violations of human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, 
political exclusion, socio-economic marginalization, inequality, insecurity and collective 
punishment. Due to their inherent link with human dignity, cultural rights are particularly 
important in this context. 
</p>
<p>44. Research into the conditions conducive to terrorism draws a distinction between the 
following four categories of causes: (a) structural causes, e.g. demographic imbalances, 
subjective feeling of deprivation, internal feeling of injustice; (b) facilitating causes, such as the 
existence of failed States, access to weapons, explosives, the development of mass media and the 
Internet; (c) motivational causes, including conflicts and deep-rooted historical injustices; and 
(d) so-called triggering causes - events that ultimately push an individual to carry out a terrorist 
act. Respect for human rights could be achieved by addressing all those categories effectively 
and jointly.<b>44</b> 
45. The reallocation of resources towards security and counter-terrorism can have additional 
negative consequences when allocations are drawn away from programmes that contribute to the 
implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, such as those in the health or education 
sectors. The global emphasis on counter-terrorism has accelerated a trend among donor countries 
and agencies towards incorporating security concerns into development policies. The policies of 
some States of funding security activities with official development assistance has created some 
controversy among development groups and civil society, which argue that they can have a 
negative impact on available assistance, and thus the capacity of countries to realize economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>46. Identifying the conditions conducive to terrorism could help in formulating the measures to 
counter them, without creating adverse effects on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights. The conditions will depend on whether the movements carrying out acts of terrorism are 
national movements, ethnic identity movements, minority religious movements or insurgency 
movements. Examples of human rights violations in these contexts include the denial of access 
to productive resources (including land), lack of recognition of cultural rights, which are 
depriving entire groups of their identity and dignity, destruction of their homes and property, 
lack of access to justice, impunity for human rights violations, and criminalization of the 
activities of human rights defenders and others who seek to express their needs within a 
democratic space.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. OBLIGATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY RELATING  
TO ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>47. Human rights treaty bodies are uniquely placed to monitor the implementation by States of 
counter-terrorism measures and their compliance with international human rights law, in 
particular the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Human Rights Committee. The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has examined both the impact of counter-terrorism measures in the context of 
economic, social and cultural rights<b>45</b> as well as the impact of terrorism on them.<b>46</b> The Human 
Rights Committee has also looked at the impact of individual sanctions on the economic, social 
and cultural rights of those organizations and institutions on the United Nations Sanctions 
Committee list or those benefiting from their services.<b>47</b> Challenges for such human rights 
monitoring include the fact that many States parties do not report to the treaty bodies on time and 
some do not report at all. This may result in a lack of scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures 
with potential adverse consequences on economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>48. Special procedures mandate holders examine the human rights implications of 
counter-terrorism measures. Through their country missions, thematic research, reports and 
communications, mandate holders can contribute to the protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights in this context.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>49. At the national level, the preventive role and monitoring function of the national human 
rights mechanisms of the judiciary, national human rights institutions, civil rights groups and 
human rights organizations should be emphasized, as well as the role of the legislature in 
drafting and enacting relevant legislation and in deciding on budget allocations to economic, 
social and cultural rights, while taking security concerns fully into account. Other universal and 
regional human rights mechanisms for monitoring economic, social and cultural rights in the 
context of countering terrorism are also important. These include the newly established 
Universal Periodic Review mechanism of the Human Rights Council, which brings to light the 
impact of counter-terrorism measures on economic, social and cultural rights, the African Court 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Peer Review Mechanism, the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and the European 
Committee of Social Rights.

and E/CN.4/2004/80. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. The question of access to justice and remedies for violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights is critical. A proper judicial review and reparation for the victims of violations of 
economic, social and cultural rights is crucial to ensure the accountability of States in this 
respect. An independent judicial review of the counter-terrorism measures undertaken by States, 
including those affecting economic, social and cultural rights, serves to ascertain their 
proportionality, effectiveness and legitimacy. To be truly effective, the justiciability of human 
rights needs to be secured at the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>51. In this connection, it is important to recall general comment No. 9 (1998) of the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the domestic application of the Covenant which 
states that: &#8220;It is sometimes suggested that matters involving the allocation of resources should 
be left to the political authorities rather than the courts. While the respective competences of the 
various branches of government must be respected, it is appropriate to acknowledge that courts 
are generally already involved in a considerable range of matters which have important resource 
implications. The adoption of a rigid classification of economic, social and cultural rights which 
puts them, by definition, beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible 
with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent. It would 
also drastically curtail the capacity of the courts to protect the rights of the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups in society.&#8221;<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Additional challenges include the fact that even where economic, social and cultural rights 
are subject to judicial review, the decisions of courts are often not fully implemented. This may 
call for specific mechanisms to monitor compliance with judicial decisions. In addition, the 
length of judicial proceedings can be a significant problem. In this respect, national human rights 
institutions, such as the ombudsmen in the Latin American context, and an effective 
administrative complaints system could offer swifter responses to claims regarding access to 
social services and programmes. 
</p>
<p>53. In many cases when economic, social and cultural rights are violated in the context of 
countering terrorism, issues of compensation, reparation and restitution are not examined. The 
recent adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights<b>50</b> is a major development for the justiciability of economic, social and cultural 
rights. Its approval closes a historic gap in the international human rights system. In addition to 
providing a voice to the victims of human rights violations,<b>51</b> the Optional Protocol enhances 
victims&#8217; capacity to seek justice for the violations of their economic, social and cultural rights 
after exhausting all domestic means of recourse.<b>52</b>

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Terrorism has a serious impact on all human rights, including economic, social and 
cultural rights. Counter-terrorism measures must be adopted in compliance with the 
obligations of States under international human rights law, humanitarian law and refugee 
law. These measures must be adequate, proportionate, reasonable, non-discriminatory, 
non-arbitrary, effective and justified, and they must not overly affect the enjoyment of 
human rights, particularly of groups most vulnerable to human rights violations, such as 
indigenous people, minorities, migrants, women and children. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>When adopting exceptional counter-terrorism measures, including measures in the 
framework of states of emergency, in particular long-standing ones, States must pay 
particular attention to their impact on human rights, in particular economic, social and 
cultural rights. These can have a particularly damaging effect on vulnerable communities, 
including the potential risk of leading to radicalization. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>States are encouraged to become parties to the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights once it is open for signature, and to 
develop national mechanisms to address the issue of remedies and reparations for victims 
of violations of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>In developing counter-terrorism legislation, policies and measures, States should 
examine their impact on economic, social and cultural rights in order to ensure that all the 
requirements relating to their protection are respected. Particular attention should be paid 
to allocating sufficient resources to economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The United Nations human rights system continues to address the question of the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism with a 
view to assisting Member States to abide by their international human rights obligations 
while effectively combating terrorism. My Office will continue to examine the question of 
the protection of economic, social and cultural rights while countering terrorism and to 
make general recommendations about the obligations of States in this regard.
