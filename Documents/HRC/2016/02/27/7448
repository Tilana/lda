<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Iraq was held at the 12th meeting on 
</p>
<p>3 November 2014. The delegation of Iraq was headed by Abdulkareem Abdulah Shallal Al-
</p>
<p>Janabi, Deputy Minister of Human Rights. At its 17th meeting held on 6 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group adopted the report on Iraq. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Iraq: Burkina Faso, the former Yugoslav 
</p>
<p>Republic of Macedonia and the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Iraq: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRQ/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRQ/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRQ/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Iraq through the troika. 
</p>
<p>Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation said that strictly monitored local, regional and national 
</p>
<p>elections had been held in 2013 and 2014. Their success had met with international 
</p>
<p>acclaim. Minorities were represented by means of quotas in the Council of Representatives 
</p>
<p>and in local and governorate councils. 
</p>
<p>6. A governmental committee chaired by the Ministry of Human Rights had been 
</p>
<p>established to prepare the UPR report. It was composed of representatives of the General 
</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, several ministries and the Kurdistan region. A 
</p>
<p>number of workshops and training courses had been organized for the Committee members 
</p>
<p>and ministry focal points. Consultations had been held with the High Commission for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights of Iraq, the Independent Commission for Human Rights in the Kurdistan 
</p>
<p>Region and representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Baghdad and the 
</p>
<p>Kurdistan region.  
</p>
<p>7. Since the first UPR cycle, Iraq had ratified the ICPPED, CAT and CRPD. It had 
</p>
<p>withdrawn its reservation to article 9 of CEDAW, and the Council of Representatives was 
</p>
<p>currently considering the possibility of ratifying ICRMW. Iraq had also acceded to other 
</p>
<p>international treaties which focused, inter alia, on combating terrorism, hostage-taking, 
</p>
<p>child abduction and the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms. </p>


<p>8. With regard to overdue reports to treaty bodies, CEDAW and CERD had discussed 
</p>
<p>reports from Iraq in 2014 and national committees had been set up to implement their 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>9. Iraq and the Kurdistan region had enacted a number of laws aimed at promoting and 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights since the first UPR cycle, including the Journalists&#8217; Rights Act. In 
</p>
<p>addition, strategic plans had been adopted to support education, health care and 
</p>
<p>employment and to combat poverty and corruption.  
</p>
<p>10. Iraq had established the Court of Human Rights, the Court on Publishing and the 
</p>
<p>Media and the Family Court. Four courts dealt with cases of domestic violence, and 
</p>
<p>complaints from the High Commission for Human Rights could be channelled to the Chief 
</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor through a department in the Office of the Public Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>11. Iraq had issued three reports containing statistical data and reporting on progress 
</p>
<p>towards achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. 
</p>
<p>Considerable progress had been made in combating poverty, increasing school enrolment 
</p>
<p>and lowering infant and child mortality rates. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the empowerment of women, there were currently 83 women 
</p>
<p>members of the Council of Representatives out of a total of 328 members. The fact that 22 
</p>
<p>of the women concerned had been elected without relying on the quota system reflected 
</p>
<p>increased awareness of women&#8217;s potential. Support was also provided for women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>economic empowerment, for instance through the High Commission for the Advancement 
</p>
<p>of Women in Rural Areas.  
</p>
<p>13. Iraq had adopted a National Strategy to Combat Violence against Women and a 
</p>
<p>national action plan to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, 
</p>
<p>peace and security.  
</p>
<p>14. Major challenges in the area of children&#8217;s rights included street children, child 
</p>
<p>labour, early marriage and internally displaced children. The unstable situation in the 
</p>
<p>country since 2003 made it extremely difficult to ensure the speedy implementation of 
</p>
<p>CRC, OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. However, the relevant authorities were taking 
</p>
<p>vigorous action to address the challenges by enacting legislation and establishing the 
</p>
<p>requisite institutions. The Ministry of Education offered special support to gifted students. 
</p>
<p>A law enacted in 2001 had provided for the creation of schools for gifted children in the 
</p>
<p>different governorates. The Ministry of Health had created paediatric hospitals and child 
</p>
<p>psycho-neurological centres. It had organized, with international assistance, special training 
</p>
<p>courses in the treatment of child mental and behavioural disorders for medical staff.  
</p>
<p>15. Pursuant to the Act concerning persons with disabilities, Iraq was currently 
</p>
<p>establishing an agency to support the rights of people with disabilities. They would be 
</p>
<p>allocated a quota of jobs in public institutions and measures would be taken to equip 
</p>
<p>buildings with the requisite access facilities. Support would also be provided for training 
</p>
<p>centres for persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>16. A number of measures had been taken on behalf of minorities, for instance 
</p>
<p>allocation of plots of land for the construction of new places of worship, restoration and 
</p>
<p>rebuilding of places of worship damaged by terrorist acts and compensation of members of 
</p>
<p>minority groups exposed to terrorist attacks. Minorities were also granted quotas in the 
</p>
<p>Council of Representatives and local councils. Anyone who sought to force members of 
</p>
<p>minorities to change their nationality was liable to prosecution.  
</p>
<p>17. The National Human Rights Plan was designed, inter alia, to serve as a tool for 
</p>
<p>sound public administration, good governance and the strengthening of the rule of law, to 
</p>
<p>promote a culture of tolerance of cultural and ethnic diversity, to generate awareness of </p>


<p>human rights in the Government and in society as a whole, and to mobilize local and 
</p>
<p>international resources through technical cooperation programmes.  
</p>
<p>18. The current Government&#8217;s programme was based on constitutional principles and 
</p>
<p>the National Development Plan (2013&#8211;2017). Its priorities included the promotion of 
</p>
<p>decentralized administration. The State&#8217;s civil, military and security institutions would be 
</p>
<p>reconstructed, using advanced techniques and electronic governance with a view to 
</p>
<p>increasing productivity and combating corruption. Financial resources would be increased 
</p>
<p>and used to promote equitable development. The principles of responsibility and 
</p>
<p>accountability would be promoted at all levels through the establishment of performance 
</p>
<p>indicators and standards and regular monitoring arrangements. The monitoring bodies 
</p>
<p>would also be subject to oversight. A clear distinction would be made between political and 
</p>
<p>administrative positions, and executive institutions would be free from political influence. 
</p>
<p>The scope of the social welfare and retirement systems would be expanded. Weapons 
</p>
<p>would be confined to State security institutions and the formation of non-State military 
</p>
<p>groups would be prohibited. The security forces would be required to assume full 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the protection of Iraqi citizens. The Government was committed to the 
</p>
<p>basic principles set forth in the political agreement concluded between the political blocs 
</p>
<p>constituting the national unity Government. 
</p>
<p>19. ISIL had taken advantage of the unstable security situation in a number of 
</p>
<p>governorates, threatening the right to life of their innocent and unarmed inhabitants. ISIL 
</p>
<p>had committed flagrant war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Women had 
</p>
<p>been sold as slaves, sexually exploited and forcibly married. Journalists and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders had been attacked. Persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities, 
</p>
<p>including children, had been executed. A massacre of Iraqi soldiers had been committed at 
</p>
<p>a military base. Places of worship and historical and cultural sites had been destroyed.  
</p>
<p>20. The situation in the governorates that had been exposed to the brutal terrorist 
</p>
<p>assaults called for the adoption of an emergency action plan, particularly to deal with the 
</p>
<p>problem of displacement. Displaced people required, in particular, accommodation and 
</p>
<p>educational facilities. The Ministry of Migration and Displacement had been working with 
</p>
<p>governmental and non-governmental organizations to alleviate their problems. However, 
</p>
<p>the scale of the crisis called for the involvement of the international community. The 
</p>
<p>elimination of terrorism in Iraq with international support would enable the displaced 
</p>
<p>persons to return to their homes.  
</p>
<p>21. According to the Ministry, 436,635 families had been displaced by 14 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>The High Commission for Relief and Shelter had been established to deal with the problem 
</p>
<p>and had been allocated a budget of trillion Iraqi dinars (ID). The Ministry of Migration and 
</p>
<p>Displacement would allocate a sum of ID 1 million to each displaced family. ID 33 billion 
</p>
<p>had been allocated to the Red Crescent Society and to religious endowments to assist 
</p>
<p>displaced families and ID 10 billion had been allocated to the Ministry of Health to provide 
</p>
<p>them with health care. Requests submitted by the governorates to set up camps and shelters 
</p>
<p>would be studied and referred to the relevant technical committees.  
</p>
<p>22. Iraq would establish a national task force to implement the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>second UPR cycle. It would also establish national mechanisms for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations of human rights treaty bodies following the submission of periodic 
</p>
<p>reports. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation highlighted the mass displacement caused by the ongoing war in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, and by the actions of the terrorist organization ISIL. The delegation 
</p>
<p>also referred to the violent treatment of Yazidi Kurds by ISIL, as thousands of Yazidi men 
</p>
<p>had been slaughtered and thousands of Yazidi women/girls and children had been taken as </p>


<p>sex slaves. Such acts clearly constituted crimes against humanity involving the intention to 
</p>
<p>commit ethnic cleansing and genocide.  
</p>
<p>24. The delegation said that one great challenge for the Kurdistan Regional Government 
</p>
<p>(KRG) was how to deal with the 1.5 million refugees and internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>(IDPs). The delegation noted that the KRG had displayed willingness, taken initiatives and 
</p>
<p>established benchmarks aimed at further enhancing its legal and political institutions in the 
</p>
<p>past few years.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegation stated that the Law on Combating Domestic Violence had been 
</p>
<p>enacted in 2011. The law prohibited female genital mutilation (FGM) and criminalized 
</p>
<p>forced and child marriages, verbal, physical and psychological abuse of girls and women, 
</p>
<p>child abuse and child labour. It also established four courts to deal with domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s shelters and specialized ongoing training for judges and police offers. A quota 
</p>
<p>system to ensure women&#8217;s participation in politics had been established. FGM had been 
</p>
<p>decreasing each year. 
</p>
<p>26. Provision had been made for equal political participation of minorities in the 
</p>
<p>Parliament of Kurdistan and the municipal councils. 
</p>
<p>27. On media freedom, the delegation stated that there were vibrant local media and that 
</p>
<p>criticism of government policies was common. The 2008 Press Freedom Law together with 
</p>
<p>other legislation guaranteed the balanced practical exercise of the right.  
</p>
<p>28. Government transparency was another important step forward. The draft constitution 
</p>
<p>on demonstrations enshrined international law, and public demonstrations in cities were 
</p>
<p>permitted and practiced. 
</p>
<p>29. On the detention issue, the delegation stated that the Judicial Council had set up 
</p>
<p>special courts to investigate human rights concerns in all prisons in the Kurdistan region. 
</p>
<p>Their purpose was to speed up the judicial proceedings relating to prolonged detention 
</p>
<p>issues. Conditions in detention facilities had also been improved. 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>drawn from the previous UPR by; inter alia, the establishment of the Court for Human 
</p>

</p>
<p>justice institutions. 
</p>

</p>
<p>insurgency and encouraged the investigation of alleged violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and human rights law and rebuild reconciliation.

</p>
<p>to bring about social, political and economic change within a national reconstruction and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation process.

</p>
<p>Ministry of Human Rights, and the adoption of the Social Protection Act, while noting the 
</p>
<p>brutal campaign of ISIL. 
</p>
<p>51. Norway encouraged the Government to make human rights implementation a 
</p>
<p>priority for stability and reconciliation in Iraq, particularly given the threat posed by 
</p>
<p>extremist groups, including ISIL. </p>


<p>52. Oman noted Iraqi security challenges which undermine the enjoyment of human

</p>
<p>57. Portugal was concerned by rights violations suffered by Iraqi women and the use of

</p>
<p>58. The Republic of Korea was concerned that the rule of law had not yet taken root in

</p>
<p>focus on helping displaced persons.

</p>
<p>monitor, write reports and, at the same time, submit recommendations to the Government. 
</p>
<p>The Government had issued guidelines to all ministries instructing them to cooperate with 
</p>
<p>the Commission. The Commission had already conducted many programmes and activities, 
</p>
<p>including on freedom of expression, supporting the media and civil society. It had 
</p>
<p>suggested the creation of a specialized human rights tribunal. The Government continued 
</p>
<p>providing support to the Commission, to enable it to undertake its role effectively. 
</p>
<p>76. On women&#8217;s rights, the delegation stated that a national team had been formed to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations of CEDAW. The draft Jaafari law had been withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>On violence against women, Iraq had started implementing the National Strategy against 
</p>
<p>Violence. Four areas were identified by the National Plan of Action to implement Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 1325. On early, temporary and informal marriage, the statute established 
</p>
<p>the age of marriage as 15 years for boys and girls only by judicial decision, otherwise it was 
</p>
<p>18 years. It sanctioned forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>77. The delegation emphasized that the Iraqi Constitution in its article 37, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 1 (c), banned torture and compensation to victims, while article 333 of the Penal 
</p>
<p>Law provided for the criminalization and punishment of any form of torture by public 
</p>
<p>servants. In 2008, Iraq established a committee under the Ministry of Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>harmonize Iraqi legislation with the provisions of CAT. Given the very specific 
</p>
<p>circumstances that prevailed on the security front, officials and officers might have 
</p>
<p>conducted actions that are not compatible with human rights. The officials were held 
</p>
<p>accountable and subjected to disciplinary sanctions, the most severe of which were 
</p>
<p>dismissal and referral of the case to the courts. Over 516 cases during 2008&#8211;2014 were 
</p>
<p>documented, with many of those cases having been prosecuted. A number of commissions 
</p>
<p>had been established to look into complaints of torture. The measures taken by the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights to address torture consisted of direct on-site monitoring and serious 
</p>
<p>follow-up action. The Ministry also received complaints either directly from persons 
</p>
<p>alleging torture or from their relatives. In addition, it contacted the Judicial Council (Office </p>


<p>of the Chief Public Prosecutor) to request a legal investigation and decision so that 
</p>
<p>offenders can be held to account. It also contacted the Ministry of the Interior and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Defence with a view to creating investigation boards to rule on cases involving 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture. Detention and deprivation of liberty were subject to oversight by the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of the Interior and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary to ensure human rights were being respected in places of detention. A number of 
</p>
<p>executive measures had been introduced to ensure compliance with international 
</p>
<p>commitments through training courses for persons working in the Ministry of Justice and 
</p>
<p>law enforcement. Human rights were taught in police academies and institutions. 
</p>
<p>78. The delegation stated that the Constitution of Iraq states that education is the 
</p>
<p>foundation of progress and provides that education and teaching must be free and 
</p>
<p>compulsory. The plan for 2011&#8211;2020 focused on five priorities relating to the institutional 
</p>
<p>framework, legal framework, quality education and funding of the education sector. In 2011 
</p>
<p>Iraq had adopted an act on illiteracy and established literacy centres in different 
</p>
<p>administrative areas of Iraq. Human rights training was provided through education in 
</p>
<p>different parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>79. In 2003, Iraq reviewed its legislation on the death penalty; however, exceptional 
</p>
<p>circumstances were prevailing in the country, with men and women being killed daily in 
</p>
<p>attacks. Given the circumstances, abolishing the death penalty called for a balance between 
</p>
<p>the existing attitude and the situation that prevailed. The situation at the present time meant 
</p>
<p>that human rights were not always respected. Iraq wished to review the application of death 
</p>
<p>penalty and had established a department in the Ministry of Human Rights to look into the 
</p>
<p>issue in the future. It was hoped that the penalty could be restricted to the gravest of crimes. 
</p>
<p>80. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomed Iraqi ratifications and 
</p>
<p>hoped that those commitments continued to be upheld, urged continued cooperation with all 
</p>
<p>special procedures and encouraged full cooperation with the OHCHR investigative mission 
</p>
<p>in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>81. Togo called for the perpetrators of violations of international human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law to be held to account. It welcomed efforts to achieve the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>82. Tunisia welcomed the ratification of CAT, ICCPED and CRPD, the issuing of a 
</p>
<p>standing invitation to special procedure mandate holders, and support for the empowerment 
</p>
<p>of women. 
</p>
<p>83. Turkey noted efforts to improve human rights standards despite the dire security 
</p>
<p>situation stemming from ISIL. It commended efforts to establish an inclusive, 
</p>
<p>representative and cross-sectarian Government. 
</p>
<p>84. Turkmenistan welcomed action undertaken to improve the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>Iraq, noting accession to CRPD and the introduction of national legislation aimed at 
</p>

</p>
<p>85. The United Arab Emirates noted with satisfaction the creation of a family court and 
</p>
<p>four other courts on family violence, a national human rights centre and a supreme institute 
</p>
<p>for the judiciary in Kurdistan. 
</p>
<p>86. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted with concern that 
</p>
<p>the human rights situation had deteriorated. It welcomed commitments to inclusivity, 
</p>
<p>protecting Iraqi citizens and holding those responsible for human rights violations to 
</p>
<p>account. 
</p>
<p>87. The United States of America deplored the humanitarian crisis caused by ISIL, and 
</p>
<p>urged Iraq to address past violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. </p>

</p>
<p>national strategies to tackle poverty, gender-based violence and corruption, and improving

<p>90. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that the country&#8217;s current situation 
</p>
<p>stemmed from the 2003 invasion. The country required international support to consolidate 
</p>
<p>and build its human rights capacities.

</p>
