<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report analyses the implications of States&#8217; surveillance of 
communications for the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion 
and expression. While considering the impact of significant technological advances in 
communications, the report underlines the urgent need to further study new modalities of 
surveillance and to revise national laws regulating these practices in line with human rights 
standards.  
</p>
<p>2. Innovations in technology have increased the possibilities for communication and 
protections of free expression and opinion, enabling anonymity, rapid information-sharing 
and cross-cultural dialogues. Technological changes have concurrently increased 
opportunities for State surveillance and interventions into individuals&#8217; private 
</p>
<p>communications.  
</p>
<p>3. Concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional 
use of communications surveillance technologies. However, national laws regulating what 
would constitute the necessary, legitimate and proportional State involvement in 
communications surveillance are often inadequate or non-existent. Inadequate national 
legal frameworks create a fertile ground for arbitrary and unlawful infringements of the 
right to privacy in communications and, consequently, also threaten the protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>4. In previous reports (A/HRC/17/27 and A/66/290), the Special Rapporteur has 
analysed the unprecedented impact of the Internet on expanding the possibilities of 
individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression. He expressed 
concerns at the multiple measures taken by States to prevent or restrict the flow of 
information online, and highlighted the inadequate protection of the right to privacy in the 
Internet.  
</p>
<p>5. Building on his previous analysis, the aim of this report is to identify the risks that 
the new means and modalities of communications surveillance pose to human rights, 
including the right to privacy and the freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>6. The following terms are used in this report to describe the most common modalities 
of surveillance of communications:  
</p>
<p>(a) Communications surveillance: the monitoring, interception, collection, 
preservation and retention of information that has been communicated, relayed or generated 
over communications networks;  
</p>
<p>(b) Communications data: information about an individual&#8217;s communications 
(e-mails, phone calls and text messages sent and received, social networking messages and 
posts), identity, network accounts, addresses, websites visited, books and other materials 
read, watched or listened to, searches conducted, resources used, interactions (origins and 
destinations of communications, people interacted with, friends, family, acquaintances), 
and times and locations of an individual, including proximity to others);  
</p>
<p>(c) Internet filtering: automated or manual monitoring of Internet content 
(including websites, blogs and online media sources, as well as e-mail) to restrict or 
suppress particular text, images, websites, networks, protocols, services or activities. </p>


<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur participated in multiple 
international and national events related to the issues he addressed in his previous reports 
such as freedom of expression in the Internet, prevention of hate speech, and the protection 
of journalists. He paid particular attention to national initiatives promoting the protection of 
journalists; in this regard, he participated in meetings on initiatives developed in Brazil, 
Colombia, Honduras and Mexico. He also participated in the &quot;United Nations Inter-Agency 
Meeting on the Safety of Journalists and the Issues of Impunity&quot;, held in November 2012 in 
Vienna.  
</p>
<p>8. His last report to the United Nations General Assembly focused on prevention of 
hate speech and incitement to hatred.1 The same topic was addressed in a side event to the 
General Assembly jointly organized by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Adviser on 
the Prevention of Genocide in February 2013. In the same month, he further addressed 
these issues in the launch of the &#8220;Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of 
</p>
<p>national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence&#8221; in Geneva and in the Fifth United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum 
in Vienna.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Honduras from 7 to 14 August 2012. 
His main findings and recommendations on this visit can be found in the addendum to this 
report (A/HRC/20/40/Add.1). He was invited by the Indonesian Government to visit the 
country in January 2013. Regrettably, the Government requested the visit to be postponed 
and new dates for the visit are yet to be confirmed. 
</p>
<p>10. For the preparation of this report, the Special Rapporteur revised relevant studies 
and consulted with experts on matters related to the surveillance of communications. In 
December 2012, he participated in the Workshop on Electronic Surveillance and Human 
Rights organized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In February 2013, he organized an 
expert consultation for the preparation of this report which took place in parallel to the 
activities of the &quot;World Summit on the Information Society+10 Meeting&quot; held at the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, where he also 
participated in the opening plenary panel. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The evolution of technology of surveillance 
</b></p>
<p>11. Innovations in technology have facilitated increased possibilities for communication 
and freedom of expression, enabling anonymity, rapid information sharing, and cross-
cultural dialogues. At the same time, changes in technologies have also provided new 
opportunities for State surveillance and intervention into individuals&#8217; private lives. 
</p>
<p>12. From the inception of the first form of remote communications, States have sought 
to intercept and monitor individuals&#8217; private communications to serve law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>national security interests. Through communications, the most personal and intimate 
information, including about an individual&#8217;s or group&#8217;s past or future actions, can be 
revealed. Communications represent a valuable source of evidence upon which the State 
can draw to prevent or prosecute serious crimes or forestall potential national security 
emergencies.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/67/357. </p>


<p>13. Innovations in technology throughout the twentieth century changed the nature and 
implications of communication surveillance. The means by, and frequency with which 
people are able to communicate expanded significantly. The transition from fixed-line 
telephone systems to mobile telecommunication and the declining costs of communications 
services resulted in dramatic growth in telephone usage. The advent of the Internet saw the 
birth of a number of new tools and applications to communicate at no cost, or at very 
affordable rates. These advancements have enabled greater connectivity, facilitated the 
global flow of information and ideas, and increased the opportunities for economic growth 
and societal change.  
</p>
<p>14. As information and communication technologies evolved, so did the means by 
which States sought to monitor private communications. With increased use of telephones 
came the use of wiretapping, which consists of placing a tap on a telephone wire to listen to 
private phone conversations. With the replacement of analogue telephone networks with 
fibre optics and digital switches in the 1990s, States redesigned the networking technology 
to include interception capabilities (&#8220;backdoors&#8221;) to permit State surveillance, rendering 
</p>
<p>modern telephone networks remotely accessible and controllable.  
</p>
<p>15. The dynamic nature of technology has not only changed how surveillance can be 
carried out, but also &#8220;what&#8221; can be monitored<b>. </b>In enabling the creation of various 
opportunities for communication and information-sharing, the Internet has also facilitated 
the development of large amounts of transactional data by and about individuals. This 
information, known as communications data or metadata, includes personal information on 
individuals, their location and online activities, and logs and related information about the 
e-mails and messages they send or receive. Communications data are storable, accessible 
and searchable, and their disclosure to and use by State authorities are largely unregulated. 
Analysis of this data can be both highly revelatory and invasive, particularly when data is 
combined and aggregated. As such, States are increasingly drawing on communications 
data to support law enforcement or national security investigations. States are also 
compelling the preservation and retention of communication data to enable them to conduct 
historical surveillance.  
</p>
<p>16. Changes in technology have been paralleled by changes in attitudes towards 
communications surveillance. When the practice of official wiretapping first commenced in 
the United States of America, it was conducted on a restricted basis, and was only 
reluctantly sanctioned by the courts.2 It was viewed as such a serious threat to the right to 
privacy that its use had to be restricted to detecting and prosecuting the most serious 
crimes. Over time, however, States have expanded their powers to conduct surveillance, 
lowering the threshold and increasing the justifications for such surveillance.  
</p>
<p>17. In many countries, existing legislation and practices have not been reviewed and 
updated to address the threats and challenges of communications surveillance in the digital 
age. Traditional notions of access to written correspondence, for example, have been 
imported into laws permitting access to personal computers and other information and 
communications technologies, without consideration of the expanded uses of such devices 
</p>
<p>  
 2 In the first judicial validation of wiretapping, Justice Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>wrote a scathing dissent that noted that wiretapping was a &#8220;subtler and more far-reaching means of 
invading privacy&#8221; that could not be justified under the Constitution. In a chillingly accurate forecast, 
</p>
<p>the eminent jurist predicted: &#8220;Ways may some day be developed by which the government, without 
removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to 
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrence of the home. Advances in the psychic and related 
sciences may bring means of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions.&#8221; <i>Olmstead v. 
United States</i>, 277 U.S. 438 (1928). </p>


<p>and the implications for individuals&#8217; rights. At the same time, the absence of laws to 
regulate global communications surveillance and sharing arrangements has resulted in ad 
hoc practices that are beyond the supervision of any independent authority. Today, in many 
States, access to communications data can be conducted by a wide range of public bodies 
for a wide range of purposes, often without judicial authorization and independent 
oversight. In addition, States have sought to adopt surveillance arrangements that purport to 
have extra-territorial effect.  
</p>
<p>18. Human rights mechanisms have been equally slow to assess the human rights 
implications of the Internet and new technologies on communications surveillance and 
access to communications data. The consequences of expanding States&#8217; surveillance powers 
</p>
<p>and practices for the rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
interdependence of those two rights, have yet to be comprehensively considered by the 
Human Rights Council, special procedures mandate holders or human rights treaty bodies. 
This report seeks to rectify this.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. International human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed under articles 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which affirm that everyone has the right to hold opinions without 
interference, and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through any 
media and regardless of frontiers. At the regional level, the right is protected by the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (art. 9), the American Convention on Human Rights 
(art. 13); and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (art. 10). 
</p>
<p>20. At both the international and regional levels, privacy is also unequivocally 
recognized as a fundamental human right. The right to privacy is enshrined by the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 12), the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR, art. 17), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 16), and 
the International Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families (art. 14). At the regional level, the right to privacy is protected by the 
European Convention on Human Rights (art. 8) and the American Convention on Human 
Rights (art. 11).  
</p>
<p>21. Despite the widespread recognition of the obligation to protect privacy, the specific 
content of this right was not fully developed by international human rights protection 
mechanisms at the time of its inclusion in the above-mentioned human rights instruments. 
The lack of explicit articulation of the content of this right has contributed to difficulties in 
its application and enforcement.3 As the right to privacy is a qualified right, its 
interpretation raises challenges with respect to what constitutes the private sphere and in 
establishing notions of what constitutes public interest. The rapid and monumental changes 
to communications and information technologies experienced in recent decades have also 
irreversibly affected our understandings of the boundaries between private and public 
spheres.  
</p>
<p>22. Privacy can be defined as the presumption that individuals should have an area of 
autonomous development, interaction and liberty, a &#8220;private sphere&#8221; with or without 
</p>
<p>interaction with others, free from State intervention and from excessive unsolicited 
</p>
<p>  
 3 UNESCO, Global Survey on Internet Privacy and Freedom of Expression, 2012, p. 51.  </p>


<p>intervention by other uninvited individuals.4 The right to privacy is also the ability of 
individuals to determine who holds information about them and how is that information 
used. 
</p>
<p>23. In order for individuals to exercise their right to privacy in communications, they 
must be able to ensure that these remain private, secure and, if they choose, anonymous. 
Privacy of communications infers that individuals are able to exchange information and 
ideas in a space that is beyond the reach of other members of society, the private sector, and 
ultimately the State itself. Security of communications means that individuals should be 
able to verify that their communications are received only by their intended recipients, 
without interference or alteration, and that the communications they receive are equally free 
from intrusion. Anonymity of communications is one of the most important advances 
enabled by the Internet, and allows individuals to express themselves freely without fear of 
retribution or condemnation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Interrelations between the rights to privacy to freedom of opinion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression  
</b></p>
<p>24. The right to privacy is often understood as an essential requirement for the 
realization of the right to freedom of expression. Undue interference with individuals&#8217; 
privacy can both directly and indirectly limit the free development and exchange of ideas. 
Restrictions of anonymity in communication, for example, have an evident chilling effect 
on victims of all forms of violence and abuse, who may be reluctant to report for fear of 
double victimization. In this regard, article 17 of ICCPR refers directly to the protection 
from interference with &#8220;correspondence&#8221;, a term that should be interpreted to encompass all 
forms of communication, both online and offline.5 As the Special Rapporteur noted in a 
previous report,6 the right to private correspondence gives rise to a comprehensive 
obligation of the State to ensure that e-mails and other forms of online communication are 
actually delivered to the desired recipient without the interference or inspection by State 
organs or by third parties.7  
</p>
<p>25. The Human Rights Committee analysed the content of the right to privacy (art. 17) 
in its General Comment No. 16 (1988), according to which article 17 aims to protect 
individuals from any unlawful and arbitrary interferences with their privacy, family, home, 
or correspondence, and national legal frameworks must provide for the protection of this 
right. This provision imposes specific obligations relating to the protection of privacy in 
communications, underlining that &#8220;correspondence should be delivered to the addressee 
without interception and without being opened or otherwise read. &#8220;Surveillance, whether 
</p>
<p>electronic or otherwise, interceptions of telephonic, telegraphic and other forms of 
communication, wire-tapping and recording of conversations, should be prohibited.&#8221;8 The 
General Comment also indicates that &#8220;the gathering and holding of personal information on 
</p>
<p>computers, data banks and other devices, whether by public authorities or private 
individuals or bodies, must be regulated by law.&#8221;9 At the time this General Comment was

<p>adopted, the impact of advances in information and communications technologies on the 
right to privacy was barely understood.  
</p>
<p>26. In its General Comment No. 34 (2011) on the right to freedom of expression, the 
Human Rights Committee indicated that States parties should take account of the extent to 
which developments in information and communication technologies have substantially 
changed communication practices. The Committee also called on States parties to take all 
necessary steps to foster the independence of these new media. The General Comment also 
analyses the relationship between the protection of privacy and freedom of expression, and 
recommends that States parties respect that element of the right of freedom of expression 
that embraces the limited journalistic privilege not to disclose information sources.10 
</p>
<p>27. Tensions also exist between the right to privacy and the right to freedom of 
expression, for example, when information considered to be private is disseminated through 
the media. In this sense, article 19 (3) provides for restrictions on freedom of expression 
and information to protect the rights of others. However, as it happens for all permissible 
limitations to the right to freedom of expression (see below), the principle of 
proportionality must be strictly observed, since there is otherwise danger that freedom of 
expression would be undermined. Particularly in the political arena, not every attack on the 
good reputation of politicians must be permitted, since freedom of expression and 
information would otherwise be stripped of their crucial importance for the process of 
forming political opinions,11 advocating for transparency and combating corruption The 
international jurisprudence at regional level indicates that in situations of conflict between 
privacy and freedom of expression, reference should be made to the overall public interest 
on the matters reported.12  
</p>
<p><b> B. Permissible limitations to privacy and freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>28. The framework of article 17 of the ICCPR enables necessary, legitimate and 
proportionate restrictions to the right to privacy by means of permissible limitations. In 
contrast with the provisions of article 19, paragraph 3, which spell out elements of a test for 
permissible limitations,13 the formulation of article 17 does not contain a limitation clause. 
Despite these differences in wording, it is understood that article 17 of the Covenant should 
also be interpreted as containing elements of a permissible limitations test already described 
in other General Comments of the Human Rights Committee.14  
</p>
<p>29. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur takes the position that the right to privacy 
should be subject to the same permissible limitations test as the right to freedom of 
movement, as elucidated in General Comment 27.15 The test as expressed in the comment 
includes, inter alia, the following elements: 
</p>
<p>(a) Any restrictions must be provided by the law (paras. 11-12); 
</p>
<p>(b) The essence of a human right is not subject to restrictions (para. 13);

 12 UNESCO, Global Survey on Internet Privacy and Freedom of Expression, 2012, pp. 53 and 99. 
 13 Lists of permissible limitations are also included in art. 12, (3), on the right to liberty of movement 
</p>
<p>and freedom to choose his residence; art. 18, (3), on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion; art. 21, on the right of peaceful assembly; and art. 22, (2), on the right to freedom of 
association.

<p>(c) Restrictions must be necessary in a democratic society (para. 11); 
</p>
<p>(d) Any discretion exercised when implementing the restrictions must not be 
unfettered (para. 13); 
</p>
<p>(e)  For a restriction to be permissible, it is not enough that it serves one of the 
enumerated legitimate aims. It must be necessary for reaching the legitimate aim (para. 14); 
</p>
<p>(f)  Restrictive measures must conform to the principle of proportionality, they 
must be appropriate to achieve their protective function, they must be the least intrusive 
instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result, and they must be 
proportionate to the interest to be protected (paras. 14-15). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Recent considerations by international mechanisms for the protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>30. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur has assessed the impact of the Internet 
on the realization of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (A/HRC/17/27 and 
A/66/290). He noted that, while Internet users can enjoy relative anonymity on the Internet, 
States and private actors also have access to new technologies to monitor and collect 
information about individuals&#8217; communications and activities. Such technologies have the 
</p>
<p>potential to violate the right to privacy, thereby undermining people&#8217;s confidence and 
security on the Internet and impeding the free flow of information and ideas online. The 
Special Rapporteur urged States to adopt effective privacy and data protection laws in 
accordance with human rights standards, and to adopt all appropriate measures to ensure 
that individuals can express themselves anonymously online.16  
</p>
<p>31. Other Special Procedures mandate holders considered the issue of interferences with 
the right to privacy. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism studied developments in 
surveillance practices and technologies that have adversely affected the right to privacy 
using the justification of combating terrorism.17 The Special Rapporteur underscored that 
these measures have not only led to violations of the right to privacy, but have also had an 
impact on due process rights and the rights to freedom of movement, freedom of 
association and freedom of expression. He urged Governments to articulate in detail how 
their surveillance policies uphold the principles of proportionality and necessity, in 
accordance with international human rights standards, and what measures have been taken 
to protect against abuse. The Special Rapporteur also called for the adoption of 
comprehensive data protection and privacy laws and the establishment of strong 
independent oversight bodies mandated to review the use of intrusive surveillance 
techniques and the processing of personal information. He further called for research and 
development resources to be devoted to privacy-enhancing technologies. 
</p>
<p>32. Other human rights protection mechanisms have also recently paid attention to the 
impact of the surveillance of communications on the protection of the rights to privacy and 
freedom of expression. The Human Rights Committee voiced concerns, for example, at 
allegations of State monitoring the use of the Internet and blocking access to some 
websites18 and recommended the review of legislation providing the executive with wide 
powers of surveillance in respect of electronic communications.19 The Universal Periodic

 17 A/HRC/13/37. 
 18 CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3. 
 19 CCPR/C/SWE/CO/6. </p>


<p>Review has also included recommendations to ensure, for example, that legislation relating 
to the Internet and other new communication technologies respects international human 
rights obligations.20  
</p>
<p><b> V. Modalities of communications surveillance  
</b></p>
<p>33. Modern surveillance technologies and arrangements that enable States to intrude 
into an individual&#8217;s private life threaten to blur the divide between the private and the 
public spheres. They facilitate invasive and arbitrary monitoring of individuals, who may 
not be able to even know they have been subjected to such surveillance, let alone challenge 
it. Technological advancements mean that the State&#8217;s effectiveness in conducting 
surveillance is no longer limited by scale or duration. Declining costs of technology and 
data storage have eradicated financial or practical disincentives to conducting surveillance. 
As such, the State now has a greater capability to conduct simultaneous, invasive, targeted 
and broad-scale surveillance than ever before. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Targeted communications surveillance  
</b></p>
<p>34. States have access to a number of different techniques and technologies to conduct 
communications surveillance of a targeted individual&#8217;s private communications. Real-time 
interception capabilities allow States to listen to and record the phone calls of any 
individual using a fixed line or mobile telephone, through the use of interception 
capabilities for State surveillance that all communications networks are required to build 
into their systems.21 An individual&#8217;s location can be ascertained, and their text messages 
read and recorded. By placing a tap on an Internet cable relating to a certain location or 
person, State authorities can also monitor an individual&#8217;s online activity, including the 
websites he or she visits. 
</p>
<p>35. Access to the stored content of an individual&#8217;s e-mails and messages, in addition to 
other related communications data, can be obtained through Internet companies and service 
providers. The initiative of the European standards-setting authority, the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute, to compel cloud providers22 to build &#8220;lawful 
interception capabilities&#8221; into cloud technology to enable State authorities to have direct 
access to content stored by these providers, including e-mails, messages and voicemails, 
raises concerns.23  
</p>
<p>36. States can track the movements of specific mobile phones, identify all individuals 
with a mobile phone within a designated area, and intercept calls and text messages, 
through various methods. Some States use off-the-air mobile monitoring devices called 
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, which can be installed in a 
location temporarily (such as at a protest or march) or permanently (such as at an airport or 
other border crossings). These catchers imitate a mobile phone tower by sending and

<p>responding to mobile phone signals in order to extract the unique subscriber identification 
module (SIM) card number of all mobile phones within a certain territory.  
</p>
<p>37. States are also increasingly acquiring software that can be used to infiltrate an 
individual&#8217;s computer, mobile phone or other digital device.24 Offensive intrusion software, 
including so-called &#8220;Trojans&#8221; (also known as spyware or malware), can be used to turn on 
the microphone or camera of a device, to track the activity conducted on the device, and to 
access, alter or delete any information stored on the device. Such software enables a State 
to have complete control of the device infiltrated, and is virtually undetectable. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Mass communications surveillance 
</b></p>
<p>38. Costs and logistical hurdles to conduct surveillance on a mass scale continue to 
decline rapidly, as technologies allowing for broad interception, monitoring and analysis of 
communications proliferate. Today, some States have the capability to track and record 
Internet and telephone communications on a national scale. By placing taps on the fibre-
optic cables, through which the majority of digital communication information flows, and 
applying word, voice and speech recognition, States can achieve almost complete control of 
tele- and online communications. Such systems were reportedly adopted, for example, by 
the Egyptian and Libyan Governments in the lead-up to the Arab Spring.25 
</p>
<p>39. In many States, mandatory data retention is facilitating massive collection of 
communications data that can later be filtered and analysed. Technologies enable the State 
to scan phone calls and text messages to identify the use of certain words, voices or 
phrases, or filter Internet activity to determine when an individual visits certain websites or 
accesses particular online resources. &#8220;Black boxes&#8221; can be designed to inspect the data 
</p>
<p>flowing through the Internet in order to filter through and deconstruct all information about 
online activity. This method, called &#8220;deep-packet inspection&#8221;, allows the State to go beyond 
gaining simple knowledge about the sites that individuals visit, and instead analyse the 
content of websites visited. Deep-packed inspection, for example, has been reportedly 
employed by States confronted with recent popular uprisings in the Middle East and North 
Africa region.26 
</p>
<p>40. Another tool used regularly by States today is social media monitoring. States have 
the capacity physically to monitor activities on social networking sites, blogs and media 
outlets to map connections and relationships, opinions and associations, and even locations. 
States can also apply highly sophisticated data mining technologies to publicly available 
information or to communications data provided by third party service providers. At a more 
basic level, States have also acquired technical means to obtain usernames and passwords 
from social networking sites such as Facebook.27 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to communications data 
</b></p>
<p>41. In addition to intercepting and tracking the content of individuals&#8217; communications, 
States may also seek access to communications data held by third party service providers 
and Internet companies. As the private sector collects progressively larger amounts of

<p>varied data that reveal sensitive information about peoples&#8217; daily lives, and individuals and 
</p>
<p>businesses choose to store the content of their communications, such as voicemails, e-mails 
and documents, with third party service providers, access to communications data is an 
increasingly valuable surveillance technique employed by States. 
</p>
<p>42. The communications data collected by third party service providers, including large 
Internet companies, can be used by the State to compose an extensive profile of concerned 
individuals. When accessed and analysed, even seemingly innocuous transactional records 
about communications can collectively create a profile of individual's private life, including 
medical conditions, political and religious viewpoints and/or affiliation, interactions and 
interests, disclosing as much detail as, or even greater detail than would be discernible from 
the content of communications alone.28 By combining information about relationships, 
location, identity and activity, States are able to track the movement of individuals and their 
activities across a range of different areas, from where they travel to where they study, what 
they read or whom they interact with.  
</p>
<p>43. Instances of access to communications data by States are growing rapidly. In the 
three years that Google has been reporting the numbers of requests for communications 
data it receives, such requests have almost doubled, from 12,539 in the last six months of 
2009, to 21,389 in the last six months of 2012.29 In the United Kingdom, where law 
enforcement authorities are empowered to self-authorize their own requests for 
communications information, approximately 500,000 such requests were reported every 
year.30 In the Republic of Korea, a country of nearly 50 million people, there are 
approximately 37 million requests for communications data reported every year.31 
</p>
<p><b> D. Internet filtering and censorship 
</b></p>
<p>44. Advances in technology have not only facilitated interception of and access to 
communications in specific cases, but have also enabled States to conduct widespread, even 
nationwide, filtering of online activity. In many countries, Internet filtering is conducted 
under the guise of maintaining social harmony or eradicating hate speech, but is in fact used 
to eradicate dissent, criticism or activism.  
</p>
<p>45. Filtering technologies mentioned above also facilitate the monitoring of web activity 
in order to enable the State to detect forbidden images, words, site addresses or other 
content, and censor or alter it. States can use such technologies to detect the use of specific 
words and phrases, in order to censor or regulate their use, or identify the individuals using 
them. In countries with high levels of Internet penetration, Internet filtering reportedly 
enables the censorship of website content and communications and facilitates the 
surveillance of human rights defenders and activists.32  
</p>
<p>46. In addition to technologies that facilitate filtering and censorship, many States are 
conducting manual Internet filtering, by creating online police forces and inspectors in 
order to physically monitor the content of websites, social networks, blogs and other forms

<p>of media. In some States, &#8220;cyber police forces&#8221; are tasked with inspecting and controlling 
the Internet, searching websites and critical nodes within websites (particularly online 
discussion forums) with a view to block or shut down websites whenever they contain 
content the Government disapproves of, including or criticism of the country&#8217;s leadership. 
The burden of such policing is transferred to private intermediaries, such as search engines 
and social network platforms, through laws that widen liability for proscribed content from 
the original speaker to all intermediaries.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Restrictions on anonymity 
</b></p>
<p>47. One of the most important advances facilitated by the advent of the Internet was the 
ability to anonymously access and impart information, and to communicate securely 
without having to be identified. Initially, this was possible given that there was no &#8220;identity 
layer&#8221; to the Internet; originally, it was not possible to know who was behind a specific 
communication, e-mail address, or even a given computer. However, in the name of 
security and law enforcement, gradually States have been eradicating the opportunities for 
anonymous communication. In many States, individuals must identify themselves at 
cybercaf&#233;s and have their transactions on public computers recorded. Increasingly, 
identification and registration are also required when buying a SIM card or mobile 
telephone device, for visiting certain major websites, or for making comments on media 
sites or blogs.  
</p>
<p>48. Restrictions on anonymity facilitate State communications surveillance by 
simplifying the identification of individuals accessing or disseminating prohibited content, 
making such individuals more vulnerable to other forms of State surveillance.  
</p>
<p>49. In this sense, restrictions on anonymity have a chilling effect, dissuading the free 
expression of information and ideas. They can also result in individuals&#8217; de facto exclusion 
from vital social spheres, undermining their rights to expression and information, and 
exacerbating social inequalities. Furthermore, restrictions on anonymity allow for the 
collection and compilation of large amounts of data by the private sector, placing a 
significant burden and responsibility on corporate actors to protect the privacy and security 
of such data. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concerns on national legal standards  
</b></p>
<p>50. Generally, legislation has not kept pace with the changes in technology. In most 
States, legal standards are either non-existent or inadequate to deal with the modern 
communications surveillance environment. As a result, States are increasingly seeking to 
justify the use of new technologies within the ambits of old legal frameworks, without 
recognizing that the expanded capabilities they now possess go far beyond what such 
frameworks envisaged. In many countries, this means that vague and broadly conceived 
legal provisions are being invoked to legitimize and sanction the use of seriously intrusive 
techniques. Without explicit laws authorizing such technologies and techniques, and 
defining the scope of their use, individuals are not able to foresee &#8211; or even know about &#8211; 
their application. At the same time, laws are being adopted to broaden the breadth of 
national security exceptions, providing for the legitimization of intrusive surveillance 
techniques without oversight or independent review.  
</p>
<p>51. Inadequate legal standards increase the risk of individuals being exposed to violation 
of their human rights, including the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression. 
They also have an adverse impact on certain groups of individuals &#8211; for example, members 
of certain political parties, trade unionists or national, ethnic and linguistic minorities &#8211; who </p>


<p>may be more vulnerable to State communications surveillance. Without strong legal 
protections in place, journalists, human rights defenders and political activists risk being 
subjected to arbitrary surveillance activities. 
</p>
<p>52. Surveillance of human rights defenders in many countries has been well 
documented. On these occasions, human rights defenders and political activists report 
having their phone calls and e-mails monitored, and their movements tracked. Journalists 
are also particularly vulnerable to becoming targets of communications surveillance 
because of their reliance on online communication. In order to receive and pursue 
information from confidential sources, including whistleblowers, journalists must be able to 
rely on the privacy, security and anonymity of their communications. An environment 
where surveillance is widespread, and unlimited by due process or judicial oversight, 
cannot sustain the presumption of protection of sources. Even a narrow, non-transparent, 
undocumented, executive use of surveillance may have a chilling effect without careful and 
public documentation of its use, and known checks and balances to prevent its misuse. 
</p>
<p>53. The following subsections list common concerns regarding laws that allow State 
surveillance of communications surveillance in circumstances that threaten the rights to 
freedom of expression and privacy.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Lack of judicial oversight  
</b></p>
<p>54. Whereas traditionally communications surveillance was required to be authorized by 
the judiciary, increasingly this requirement is being weakened or removed. In some 
countries, interception of communications can be authorized by a governmental minister, 
their delegate, or a committee. In the United Kingdom, for example, interception of 
communications is authorized by the Secretary of State;33 in Zimbabwe, interception of 
communications is authorized by the Minister for Transport and Communication.34 
Progressively, communications surveillance can also be authorized on a broad and 
indiscriminate basis, without the need for law enforcement authorities to establish the 
factual basis for the surveillance on a case-by-case basis.  
</p>
<p>55. Many States have dispensed with the need for law enforcement agencies to return to 
the court for ongoing supervision after an interception order is issued. Under the Kenyan 
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2012, for example, interception of communications can be 
conducted over an indefinite period of time, without any requirement that law enforcement 
agencies report back to a court or seek an extension. Some States impose time limits on the 
execution of interception orders but enable law enforcement authorities to renew such 
orders repeatedly and indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>56. Even when judicial authorization is required by law, often it is de facto an arbitrary 
approval of law enforcement requests. This is particularly the case where the threshold 
required to be established by law enforcement is low. For example, the Ugandan Regulation 
of Interception of Communications Act 2010 only requires law enforcement authorities to 
demonstrate that &#8220;reasonable&#8221; grounds exist to allow the interception to take place. In such 
</p>
<p>instances, the burden of proof to establish the necessity for surveillance is extremely low, 
given the potential for surveillance to result in investigation, discrimination or violations of 
human rights. In other countries, a complex array of laws authorizes access to and 
surveillance of communications under a range of different circumstances. In Indonesia, for 
example, the Psychotropic Law, Narcotics Law, Electronic Information and Transaction 
</p>
<p>  
 33 Section 5, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. 
 34 Section 5, Interception of Communications Act 2006. </p>


<p>Law, Telecommunications Law and the Corruption Law all contain communications 
surveillance components. In the United Kingdom, over 200 agencies, police forces and 
prison authorities are authorized to acquire communications data under the Regulation of 
Investigatory Powers Act, 2000. As a result, it is difficult for individuals to foresee when 
and by which State agency they might be subjected to surveillance.  
</p>
<p>57. In many States, communication service providers are being compelled to modify 
their infrastructure to enable direct surveillance, eliminating the opportunity for judicial 
oversight. For example, in 2012 the Colombian Ministries of Justice, and Information and 
Communication Technologies, issued a decree that required telecommunication service 
providers to put in place infrastructure allowing direct access to communications by judicial 
police, without an order from the Attorney General.35 The above-mentioned Uganda&#8217;s 
Regulation of Interception of Communications Act 2010 (s3) provides for the establishment 
of a monitoring centre and mandates that telecommunications providers ensure that 
intercepted communications are transmitted to the monitoring centre (s8(1)(f)). The 
Government of India is proposing to install a Centralized Monitoring System that will route 
all communications to the central Government, allowing security agencies to bypass 
interaction with the service provider.36 Such arrangements take communications 
surveillance out of the realm of judicial authorization and allow unregulated, secret 
surveillance, eliminating any transparency or accountability on the part of the State.<b> </b></p>
<p><b> B. National security exceptions 
</b></p>
<p>58. Vague and unspecified notions of &#8220;national security&#8221; have become an acceptable 
justification for the interception of and access to communications in many countries. In 
India, for example, the Information Technology Act of 2008 allows interception of 
communications in the interest of, <i>inter alia</i>, &#8220;the sovereignty, integrity, or defense of India, 
friendly relations with foreign States, public order and the investigation of any offence&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(section 69).  
</p>
<p>59. In many cases, national intelligence agencies also enjoy blanket exceptions to the 
requirement for judicial authorization. For example, in the United States, the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act empowers the National Security Agency to intercept 
communications without judicial authorization where one party to the communication is 
located outside the United States, and one participant is reasonably believed to a member of 
a State-designated terrorist organization. German law allows warrantless automated 
wiretaps of domestic and international communications by the State&#8217;s intelligence services 
</p>
<p>for the purposes of protecting the free democratic order, existence or security of the State.37 
In Sweden, the Law on Signals Intelligence in Defense Operations authorizes the Swedish 
intelligence agency to intercept without any warrant or court order all telephone and 
Internet traffic that take place within Sweden&#8217;s borders. In the United Republic of 
Tanzania, the Intelligence and Security Service Act 1996 enables the country&#8217;s intelligence 
</p>
<p>services to conduct any investigations and investigate any person or body which it has 
reasonable cause to consider a risk or a source of risk or a threat to the State security.  
</p>
<p>60. The use of an amorphous concept of national security to justify invasive limitations 
on the enjoyment of human rights is of serious concern.38 The concept is broadly defined

<p>and is thus vulnerable to manipulation by the State as a means of justifying actions that 
target vulnerable groups such as human rights defenders, journalists or activists. It also acts 
to warrant often unnecessary secrecy around investigations or law enforcement activities, 
undermining the principles of transparency and accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Unregulated access to communications data 
</b></p>
<p>61. Access to communications data held by domestic communications service providers 
is often mandated by legislation or a condition upon which licences are issued. As a result, 
States are generally provided with <i>carte blanche</i> access to communications data with little 
oversight or regulation. For example, a 2012 Brazilian law on money laundering gives 
police the power to access registration information from Internet and communication 
providers without a court order.39 At the international level, the provision of access to 
communications data is regulated by bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties. However, 
this cooperation also often occurs outside of the law on the basis of the voluntary 
compliance of the service provider or Internet company. As such, access to 
communications data can be obtained in many States without independent authorization and 
with limited oversight.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Extra-legal surveillance 
</b></p>
<p>62. A number of the surveillance capabilities listed above fall outside of existing legal 
frameworks, but have nevertheless been widely adopted by States. Offensive intrusion 
software such as Trojans, or mass interception capabilities, constitute such serious 
challenges to traditional notions of surveillance that they cannot be reconciled with existing 
laws on surveillance and access to private information. These are not just new methods for 
conducting surveillance; they are new forms of surveillance. From a human rights 
perspective, the use of such technologies is extremely disturbing. Trojans, for example, not 
only enable a State to access devices, but also enable them to alter &#8211; inadvertently or 
purposefully &#8211; the information contained therein. This threatens not only the right to 
privacy and procedural fairness rights with respect to the use of such evidence in legal 
proceedings. Mass interception technology eradicates any considerations of proportionality, 
enabling indiscriminate surveillance. It enables the State to copy and monitor every single 
act of communication in a particular country or area, without gaining authorization for each 
individual case of interception. 
</p>
<p>63. Governments often do not acknowledge the use of such technologies to conduct 
surveillance, or argue that such technologies are being legitimately employed under the 
ambit of existing surveillance legislation. Although it is clear that many States possess 
offensive intrusion software, such as Trojan technology, the legal basis for its use has not 
been publicly debated in any State, with the exception of Germany. In that context, the 
province of North Rhine-Westphalia passed legislation in 2006 authorizing the &#8220;secret 
access to an information technology system&#8221; (&#167; 5.2 no. 11, North Rhine-Westphalia 
Constitution Protection Act), which was understood to be technical infiltration which is 
effected either by installing a spy programme or taking advantage of the security loopholes 
of the system. The German Federal Constitutional Court quashed the law in February 2008, 
ruling that such measures would only be in conformity with human rights if they were

<p>subject to judicial authorization and review, and occurred only in situations where there 
might be a concrete danger to a predominantly important legal interest.40 
</p>
<p><b> E. Extra-territorial application of surveillance laws 
</b></p>
<p>64. In response to the increased data flows across borders and the fact the majority of 
communications are stored with foreign third party service providers, a number of States 
have begun to adopt laws that purport to authorize them to conduct extra-territorial 
surveillance or to intercept communications in foreign jurisdictions. This raises serious 
concern with regard to the extra-territorial commission of human rights violations and the 
inability of individuals to know that they might be subject to foreign surveillance, challenge 
decisions with respect to foreign surveillance, or seek remedies. In South Africa, for 
example, the General Intelligence Laws Amendment Bill allows for surveillance of foreign 
communications outside of South Africa or passing through South Africa.41 In October 
2012, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security proposed legislative amendments to the 
Dutch Parliament that would allow the police to break into computers and mobile phones 
both within the Netherlands and abroad in order to install spyware and search and destroy 
data.42 In December 2012, Pakistan&#8217;s National Assembly passed the Fair Trial Act of 2012, 
paragraph 31 of which provides for the execution of surveillance warrants in foreign 
jurisdictions. Later that month, the United States renewed the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Amendment Act of 2008 extending the Government&#8217;s power to conduct 
</p>
<p>surveillance of non-American persons locate outside the United States (&#167;1881a), including 
any foreign individual whose communications are hosted by cloud services located in the 
United States (such as Google and other large Internet companies).43 Also in 2012, the 
European Telecommunications Standards Institute created draft standards for interception 
of foreign cloud-based services by European Governments.44 These developments suggest 
an alarming trend towards the extension of surveillance powers beyond territorial borders, 
increasing the risk of cooperative agreements between State law enforcement and security 
agencies to enable the evasion of domestic legal restrictions. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Mandatory data retention 
</b></p>
<p>65. In order to increase the storage of communications data that they are able to access, 
some States are adopting mandatory data retention laws requiring Internet and telecom 
service providers (collectively, &#8220;communications service providers&#8221;) continuously to 
collect and preserve communications content and information about users&#8217; online activities. 
</p>
<p>Such laws enable the compilation of historical records about individuals&#8217; e-mails and 
messages, locations, interactions with friends and family, etc.

<p>66. In delivering services to their users, communications service providers give 
subscribers&#8217; devices or network an Internet Protocol (IP) address45 that changes 
periodically. Information about an IP address can be used to ascertain the identity and 
location of an individual and track their online activity. Mandatory data retention laws force 
communications service providers to keep records of their IP address allocations for a 
certain period of time, allowing the State greater ability to require communications service 
providers to identify an individual on the basis of who had a given IP address at a particular 
date and time. Some States are also now seeking to compel third party service providers to 
collect and retain information that they would not normally collect. 
</p>
<p>67. National data retention laws are invasive and costly, and threaten the rights to 
privacy and free expression. By compelling communications service providers to create 
large databases of information about who communicates with whom via a telephone or the 
Internet, the duration of the exchange, and the users&#8217; location, and to keep such information 
</p>
<p>(sometimes for years), mandatory data retention laws greatly increase the scope of State 
surveillance, and thus the scope for infringements upon human rights. Databases of 
communications data become vulnerable to theft, fraud and accidental disclosure. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Identity disclosure laws 
</b></p>
<p>68. In many States, laws require the provision of identification at cybercaf&#233;s. Such laws 
are particularly problematic in countries where personal computer ownership is low and 
individuals rely heavily on publicly available computers. In India, for example, the 
Information Technology (Guidelines for Cyber Cafes) Rules 2011 require that cybercaf&#233; 
owners obtain identification documents from any individual visiting the cybercaf&#233;, which 
records must be kept for at least one year (Rule 4(2)). The cybercaf&#233; must maintain a log- 
register, containing, among other information, log in time and log out time, and computer 
terminal identification for a minimum period of one year (Rule 5(1) &amp; 5(2)); store and 
maintain backups of log records of each access or login by any user for at least one year 
(Rule 5(4)).

<p>69. Individuals are now also required to use their real names online in many States, and 
to provide official identification in order to establish their identity. In the Republic of 
Korea, the Information Communications Law, adopted in 2007, required users to register 
their real names before accessing websites with more than 100,000 visitors per day, 
ostensibly in order to reduce online bullying and hate speech. The law was recently 
overturned by the Constitutional Court on the basis that it restricted freedom of speech and 
undermined democracy.46 China recently adopted the Decision to Strengthen the Protection 
of Online Information, requiring Internet and telecommunications providers to collect 
personal information about users when they sign up for Internet access, landline, or mobile 
phone service. Service providers allowing users to publish online are required to be able to 
link screen names and real identities. These real name registration requirements allow 
authorities to more easily identify online commentators or tie mobile use to specific 
individuals, eradicating anonymous expression.47

<p>70. A further initiative preventing communications anonymity is the gradual adoption of 
policies that require the registration of SIM cards with a subscriber's real name or 
government-issued identity document. In 48 countries in Africa, laws requiring individuals 
to register their personal information with their network provider prior to activation of pre-
paid SIM cards are reportedly facilitating the establishment of extensive databases of user 
information, eradicating the potential for anonymity of communications, enabling location-
tracking, and simplifying communications surveillance.48 In the absence of data protection 
legislation, SIM users' information can be shared with Government departments and 
matched with other private and public databases, enabling the State to create 
comprehensive profiles of individual citizens. Individuals are also at risk of being excluded 
from use of mobile phone services (which may enable not only communication but also 
access to financial services) if they are unable or unwilling to provide identification to 
register.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Restrictions on encryption and key disclosure laws 
</b></p>
<p>71. The security and anonymity of communications are also undermined by laws that 
limit the use of privacy-enhancing tools that can be used to protect communications, such 
as encryption. Many States have now adopted laws that mandate an individual enable 
decryption when so ordered. The South African Regulation of Interception of 
Communications and Provisions of Communication-Related Information Act of 2002 
requires decryption assistance from any person who possesses the decryption key.49 Similar 
laws exist in Finland (Section 4(4)(a) Coercive Measures Act 1987/450), Belgium (Art. 9, 
Law on computer crime of 28 November 2000), and Australia (Sections 12 and 28 
Cybercrime Act 2001). 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The roles and responsibilities of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>72. The vital developments in technology that have enabled new and dynamic forms of 
communication have been occurred primarily in the private sector. In this sense, many of 
the changes in the way we communicate, receive and impart information are based on the 
research and innovations of corporate actors. 
</p>
<p>73. The private sector has also played a key role in facilitating State surveillance of 
individuals, in a number of ways. Corporate actors have had to respond to requirements that 
digital networks and communications infrastructure be designed to enable intrusion by the 
State. Such requirements were originally adopted by States in the 1990s and are becoming 
compulsory for all communications services providers. Increasingly, States are adopting 
legislation requiring that communications service providers allow States direct access to 
communications data or modify infrastructure to facilitate new forms of State intrusion. 
</p>
<p>74. In developing and deploying new technologies and communications tools in specific 
ways, corporate actors have also voluntarily taken measures that facilitate State surveillance 
of communications. In its simplest manifestation, this collaboration has taken the form of 
decisions on how corporate actors collect and process information, which allows them to

<p>become massive repositories of personal information that are then accessible to States upon 
demand. Corporate actors have adopted specifications that enable State access or intrusion, 
collect excessive and revelatory information, or restrict the application of encryption and 
other techniques that could limit access to information by both the companies and 
governments. The private sector has also often failed to deploy privacy-enhancing 
technologies, or has implemented them less than secure ways that do not represent the state 
of the art. 
</p>
<p>75. In the most serious circumstances, the private sector has been complicit in 
developing technologies that enable mass or invasive surveillance in contravention of 
existing legal standards.50 The corporate sector has generated a global industry focused on 
the exchange of surveillance technologies. Such technologies are often sold to countries in 
which there is a serious risk that they will be used to violate human rights, particularly 
those of human rights defenders, journalists or other vulnerable groups. This industry is 
virtually unregulated as States have failed to keep pace with technological and political 
developments. 
</p>
<p>76. States' human rights obligations require that they not only respect and promote the 
rights to freedom of expression and privacy, but protect individuals from violations of 
human rights perpetrated by corporate actors. In addition, States should exercise adequate 
oversight in order to meet their international human rights obligations when they contract 
with, or legislate for, corporate actors where there may be an impact upon the enjoyment of 
human rights.51 Human rights obligations in this regard apply when corporate actors are 
operating abroad.52  
</p>
<p>77. States must ensure that the private sector is able to carry out its functions 
independently in a manner that promotes individuals&#8217; human rights. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>corporate actors cannot be allowed to participate in activities that infringe upon human 
rights, and States have a responsibility to hold companies accountable in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Communications techniques and technologies have evolved significantly, 
changing the way in which communications surveillance is conducted by States. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>must therefore update their understandings and regulation of communications 
</b></p>
<p>surveillance and modify their practices in order to ensure that individuals&#8217; human 
</p>
<p><b>rights are respected and protected.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> States cannot ensure that individuals are able to freely seek and receive 
information or express themselves without respecting, protecting and promoting their 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to privacy. Privacy and freedom of expression are interlinked and mutually 
</b></p>
<p><b>dependent; an infringement upon one can be both the cause and consequence of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>infringement upon the other. Without adequate legislation and legal standards to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the privacy, security and anonymity of communications, journalists, human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders and whistleblowers, for example, cannot be assured that their 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications will not b</b>e subject to States&#8217;<b> scrutiny.

<p>80.<b> In order to meet their human rights obligations, States must ensure that the 
rights to freedom of expression and privacy are at the heart of their communications 
</b></p>
<p><b>surveillance frameworks. To this end, the Special Rapporteur recommends the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following: 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Updating and strengthening laws and legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Communications surveillance should be regarded as a highly intrusive act that 
potentially interferes with the rights to freedom of expression and privacy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>threatens the foundations of a democratic society. Legislation must stipulate that State 
</b></p>
<p><b>surveillance of communications must only occur under the most exceptional 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances and exclusively under the supervision of an independent judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority. Safeguards must be articulated in law relating to the nature, scope and 
</b></p>
<p><b>duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities competent to authorize, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy provided by the national law. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Individuals should have a legal right to be notified that they have been 
subjected to communications surveillance or that their communications data has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessed by the State. Recognizing that advance or concurrent notification might 
</b></p>
<p><b>jeopardize the effectiveness of the surveillance, individuals should nevertheless be 
</b></p>
<p><b>notified once surveillance has been completed and have the possibility to seek redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>in respect of the use of communications surveillance measures in their aftermath. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Legal frameworks must ensure that communications surveillance measures: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Are prescribed by law, meeting a standard of clarity and precision that 
</b></p>
<p><b>is sufficient to ensure that individuals have advance notice of and can foresee their 
</b></p>
<p><b>application; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Are strictly and demonstrably necessary to achieve a legitimate aim; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Adhere to the principle of proportionality, and are not employed when 
</b></p>
<p><b>less invasive techniques are available or have not yet been exhausted. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> States should criminalize illegal surveillance by public or private actors. Such 
laws must not be used to target whistleblowers or other individuals seeking to expose 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations, nor should they hamper the legitimate oversight of 
</b></p>
<p><b>government action by citizens. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The provision of communications data by the private sector to States should be 
</b>sufficiently regulated to ensure that individuals&#8217; human rights are prioritized at all 
</p>
<p><b>times. Access to communications data held by domestic corporate actors should only 
</b></p>
<p><b>be sought in circumstances where other available less invasive techniques have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>exhausted. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The provision of communications data to the State should be monitored by an 
independent authority, such as a court or oversight mechanism. At the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>level, States should enact Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties to regulate access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications data held by foreign corporate actors.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Surveillance techniques and practices that are employed outside of the rule of 
law must be brought under legislative control. Their extra-legal usage undermines 
</b></p>
<p><b>basic principles of democracy and is likely to have harmful political and social effects.  </b></p>


<p><b> B. Facilitating private, secure and anonymous communications 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> States should refrain from compelling the identification of users as a 
precondition for access to communications, including online services, cybercaf&#233;s or 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobile telephony.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Individuals should be free to use whatever technology they choose to secure 
their communications. States should not interfere with the use of encryption 
</b></p>
<p><b>technologies, nor compel the provision of encryption keys. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> States should not retain or require the retention of particular information 
purely for surveillance purposes. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Increasing public access to information, understanding and awareness 
</b></p>
<p><b>of threats to privacy 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> States should be completely transparent about the use and scope of 
communications surveillance techniques and powers. They should publish, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimum, aggregate information on the number of requests approved and rejected, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregation of the requests by service provider and by investigation and purpose.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> States should provide individuals with sufficient information to enable them to 
fully comprehend the scope, nature and application of the laws permitting 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications surveillance. States should enable service providers to publish the 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures they apply when dealing with State communications surveillance, adhere 
</b></p>
<p><b>to those procedures, and publish records of State communications surveillance.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> States should establish independent oversight mechanisms capable to ensure 
transparency and accountability of State surveillance of communications. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> States should raise public awareness on the uses of new communication 
technologies in order to support individuals in properly assessing, managing, 
</b></p>
<p><b>mitigating and making informed decisions on communications-related risks. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Regulating the commercialization of surveillance technology  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> States should ensure that communications data collected by corporate actors in 
the provision of communications services meets the highest standards of data 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> States must refrain from forcing the private sector to implement measures 
compromising the privacy, security and anonymity of communications services, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including requiring the construction of interception capabilities for State surveillance 
</b></p>
<p><b>purposes or prohibiting the use of encryption. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> States must take measures to prevent the commercialization of surveillance 
technologies, paying particular attention to research, development, trade, export and 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of these technologies considering their ability to facilitate systematic human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations. </b></p>


<p><b> E. Furthering the assessment of relevant international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> There is a significant need to advance international understanding on the 
protection of the right to privacy in light of technological advancements. The Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Committee should consider issuing a new General Comment on the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>privacy, to replace General Comment No. 16 (1988).  </b></p>
<p>99.<b> Human rights mechanisms should further assess the obligations of private 
actors developing and supplying surveillance technologies.  
</b></p>
