during the reporting period as a result of various forms of violence. By 29 November 2012, 
130 civilians, including 40 children and 14 women, had been killed due to conflict-related 
violence in Gaza, such as air strikes, bombardments, incursions and levelling operations, as 
well as the use of live ammunition to enforce the access-restricted areas both on land and at 
sea. Of these, 101 civilians, including 33 children and 13 women, were killed in the crisis 
from 14 to 22 November. Excluding Palestinians injured during the crisis &#8211; as this 
information was not yet verified at the time of writing &#8211; 369 civilians, including 114 
children and 39 women, were injured in Gaza as a result of conflict-related violence during 
the reporting period.5

October 2012, eight civilians, including a woman and four children, were injured when an 
Israeli airplane fired a missile that resulted in the killing of two alleged members of armed 
groups travelling on a motorbike in Rafah. Similarly, on 10 November, following an attack 
by armed groups that injured four Israeli soldiers, at the fence east of Al-Shojayaa, IDF 
launched attacks on different targets in Gaza that lasted for several days. In one such attack, 
on 10 November, at approximately 4 p.m., four blasts occurred in a sand dune located a 
short distance from residential buildings that are located approximately 1,000 metres from 
the Israeli fence between Gaza and Israel. Four civilians, including two children, were 
killed and 42 injured. OHCHR received information indicating that some of the victims

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the fifth periodic report on the human rights situation in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory submitted by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.1 The report covers the period from 16 November 2011 to 29 November 
2012. The information in the report is based primarily on human rights monitoring carried 
out by the field presence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OHCHR-OPT). Monitoring activities 
are implemented within the framework of General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 1993 and 
Human Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 of 2009.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the High Commissioner highlights issues of concern with 
regard to each of the main duty bearers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely the 
Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities in Gaza. The 
issues addressed do not exhaustively cover all human rights concerns in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. The report focuses on areas requiring priority attention by duty 
bearers, and should be read in conjunction with two recent reports by the Secretary-General 
(A/67/372 and A/67/375), which address additional issues not dealt with in the present 
report.  
</p>
<p>3. The addendum to the present report (A/HRC/22/35/Add.1) covers issues of concern 
arising from the escalation in hostilities in Gaza and southern Israel between 14 and 21 
November 2012, referred to by Israel as Operation Pillar of Defence, and referred to in the 
present report as &#8220;the crisis&#8221;. During the crisis, according to information available to 
OHCHR, a total of 174 Palestinians were killed. At least 168 of them were killed by Israeli 
military action; of those, 101 are believed to be civilians, including 33 children and 13 
women. Hundreds of Palestinians were injured.<footnote name="2">8  Information provided by OCHA.

 30  Ibid., and Israel, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, &#8220;Israel under fire&#8221; (footnote 4 above). </footnote> Palestinian armed groups fired over 1,<footnote name="5">Information provided by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). </footnote>00 
rockets at Israel, reportedly killing three soldiers and four Israeli civilians.<footnote name="3">4. The resort to live ammunition by ISF to disperse protesters during the week of 14 to 
21 November is unprecedented in recent years. There is concern that this may indicate a 
worrying change in the IDF riot control policies and/or a lack of appropriate training for 
soldiers deployed in response to public demonstrations.  
</footnote> According to 
the Government of Israel, 239 others, including 219 civilians, were injured.<footnote name="4">4  PCHR, press release of 25 March 2012,

&amp;catid=36:pchrpressreleases&amp;Itemid=194. 
</footnote> OHCHR 
closely monitored the situation and noted, on numerous occasions, the failure of both 
parties to respect the laws of war, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and 
precautions. 
</p>
<p>4. It should be noted that in March 2012 the Government of Israel announced in the 
media that its relations with the Human Rights Council and with OHCHR would be 
suspended following the adoption of Council resolution 19/17, in which the Council

 2 Figure varies according to source. The numbers cited refer to the Protection Cluster database on 
</p>
<p>casualties, for which Palestinian and Israeli organizations provided data. The Israeli Defense Forces 
(IDF), according to media, estimate the number of Palestinians killed at 177, including 120 
combatants, and the number of injuries (including an unspecified number of civilians) at 900. Gaza&#8217;s 
Ministry of Health estimates the number of Palestinians killed at 189, and injuries at 1,526. No details 
on casualties of civilians are provided by that Ministry. For IDF figures, see <i>Times of Israel</i>,

</p>
<p> 3  According to the Government of Israel, one Israeli civilian was located at a legitimate military 
objective. See the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-
+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2012/GazaNov2012/Alayaan_Salem_al-Nabari.htm.

<p>decided to establish a fact-finding mission on Israeli settlements. This decision was 
confirmed in letters of 14 May 2012 from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the 
United Nations in Geneva to the High Commissioner and the President of the Council. The 
High Commissioner responded noting her surprise at this unprecedented decision, urging 
the Government to reconsider its position and reaffirming the readiness of OHCHR to 
engage with Israel. There was no formal change in the position of Israel during the 
remainder of the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>5. International human rights law and international humanitarian law are applicable in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory. A detailed analysis of the applicable legal framework 
and the basis for the obligations of the different duty bearers, namely the State of Israel as 
the occupying Power, the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities in Gaza, can be 
found in the High Commissioner&#8217;s first periodic report on the situation of human rights in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/12/37, paras. 5-9). This analysis remains valid.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights violations by all duty bearers  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The Government of Israel

</i></p>

<p>were sitting on the sand dune when the first two blasts occurred, while others were hit by 
the third and fourth blasts as they were trying to climb up the sand dune to see what was 
happening.  
</p>
<p>8. Local human rights groups documented further cases of attacks that resulted in 
civilian casualties. On 20 June 2012, a Palestinian child and his blind father were killed and 
three other children were injured by an Israeli air strike in Tal al-Hawa in Gaza City.6 On 
23 June 2012, one civilian was killed and seven others were injured in an Israeli air strike 
targeting two alleged members of armed groups travelling on a motorbike in Al-Nasser in 
Gaza City.7 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Access-restricted areas 
</i></p>
<p>9. Israel continued to use live ammunition to enforce the access-restricted areas near 
the Israeli fence between Gaza and Israel, as well as at sea.8 Though the number of such 
incidents decreased in comparison to previous years, the life and security of civilians 
continued to be at risk. According to information obtained from the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during the reporting period 12 civilians, 
including 1 woman and 2 children, were killed, and a further 123, including 11 women and 
25 children, were injured in the access-restricted areas. These figures do not include figures 
relating to the crisis in November, as these were not verified at the time of writing. With 
respect to the recommendation of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict in paragraph 1968 (d) of its report (A/HRC/12/48), as stated in the first progress 
report of the Secretary-General on the status of implementation of the recommendations of 
the Mission (A/HRC/13/55, paras. 9-10), the Human Rights Council, in resolution S-12/1, 
recommended that the General Assembly should consider the report during its sixty-fourth 
session. In its resolution 16/32, the Council recommended that the General Assembly 
reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session. The Secretary-General observed that the 
Human Rights Council has implemented the recommendation in paragraph 1968 (d) of the 
report of the Mission.  
</p>
<p>10. On 30 March 2012, Israeli soldiers stationed at the Erez crossing between Gaza and 
Israel used live ammunition against civilians assembled to mark &#8220;Land Day&#8221;. Dozens of 
civilians approached the fence at Erez and threw stones at the Israeli soldiers. While the 
soldiers initially responded with aerial shootings, they later resorted to live ammunition in 
response to continued stone throwing. As a result, a 19-year-old Palestinian civilian was 
killed and 35 others were injured, including 17 children.

2012&amp;catid=84:weekly-2009&amp;Itemid=183. 
</p>

<p>11. On 4 November 2012, a 23-year-old man suffering from epilepsy was shot and 
killed by IDF about 10 metres from the fence, east of El Borueij camp. IDF had requested 
the victim several times &#8211; in Arabic, by microphone &#8211; to leave the area, but the victim had 
not responded. OHCHR received information indicating that the victim was known to IDF, 
due to his detention in mid-September, when he had previously approached the fence. IDF 
called the victim by his name prior to opening fire. Information received by OHCHR 
indicates that IDF allowed the victim to be evacuated only three hours after having been 
shot. 
</p>
<p>12. On 8 November 2012, a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed by IDF, as he played 
football with three friends next to his home about 1,000 metres from the fence, in Abasan 
al-Kabira, Khan Younis. Eyewitnesses reported that several incursions by IDF took place in 
the area on the same day. 
</p>
<p>13. On 11 August 2012, a 17-year-old male farmer cultivating his land, located about 
600 metres from the fence, was shot twice, in his left hand and right thigh, east of Khan 
Younis. In another case, on 29 August , a 42-year-old female farmer was shot three times, 
in her hand, abdomen and back, in Wadi El Salqa, central Gaza Strip, about 700 metres 
from the fence. Information gathered by OHCHR indicates that the farmers posed no 
apparent risk to IDF, and that no armed activities had been or were being conducted from 
the site of the incident or from the surrounding area at the time when the incidents took 
place. 
</p>
<p>14. On 28 September 2012, IDF opened fire on about 30 fishermen from Beit Lahia, 
who were on the beach, killing one of them, a 23-year-old, and injuring another. IDF 
sources, through media, denied that IDF had attacked any fishermen that day. The same 
sources admitted that Israeli soldiers at the Gaza-Israel northern fence had shot and injured 
two Palestinians approaching the fence after they had disregarded the verbal warnings.9 
OHCHR was informed that the fishermen were fishing on the shore with nets about 300-
400 metres from the fence when the incident occurred. 
</p>
<p>15. On 23 November 2012, dozens of Palestinians celebrating the ceasefire headed 
toward the fence east of Khan Younis, attempting to cross it. IDF responded with live fire, 
leaving one civilian dead and 18 others, including 3 children, injured.10 OHCHR does not 
have any information regarding whether the civilians in the cases mentioned above were 
warned in advance. 
</p>
<p>16. In terms of positive developments, the Israeli Navy appeared to change operating 
procedures and resorted to more systematic use of warning fire, rather than directly 
targeting fishermen with live ammunition, as had previously often been the case. However, 
fisherman continued to be detained and their equipment confiscated and/or destroyed. A 
local human rights group documented the arrest of 68 fishermen, and the confiscation of 20 
boats by the Israeli Navy during the reporting period.11 In October 2012, OHCHR 
documented the detention of eight fishermen and the confiscation of their boats by the 
Israeli Navy in two separate incidents. These occurred at 2 to 2.5 nautical miles from shore, 
west of Beit Lahia, on 7 and 22 October.

</p>
<p>www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9072:weekly-report-

</p>
<p> 11 According to Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights, e-mail to OHCHR, 4 November 2012 (period  </p>
<p>covering 15 November 2011 to 4 November 2012). </p>


<p>17. As part of the 21 November ceasefire, Israel expanded the fishing zone to 6 nautical 
miles. Still, fishermen continued to be detained within this area. OHCHR received 
information regarding the detention of at least 18 fishermen, reportedly fishing within the 6 
nautical mile limit, between 23 and 29 November 2012. 
</p>
<p>18. The use of live ammunition against civilians to enforce the access-restricted areas is 
not in conformity with international law regarding the right to life and security. It does not 
respect the rules on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials, and when 
taking place in the context of hostilities it violates the principle of distinction, which 
prohibits the targeting of civilians not directly participating in hostilities. Mere presence in 
a restricted area cannot be construed as participation in hostilities. As the occupying Power, 
Israel has the obligation to protect civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The blockade of Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>19. In September 2012, Israel permitted the first commercial export of Gaza-made 
furniture into the West Bank since the imposition of the blockade in 2007. Apart from this, 
and the export of negligible amounts of agricultural produce to Europe, Gaza&#8217;s exports 
remained severely restricted.12 Continued restrictions on Gaza&#8217;s exports and imports have 
stalled the private sector and minimized prospects for economic growth. By August 2012, 
44 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s population was suffering from food insecurity, 39 per cent lived in 
</p>
<p>poverty, and 80 per cent relied on food assistance from humanitarian agencies.13 
</p>
<p>20. Restrictions on the import of construction material for private and public use 
continued to create serious challenges for the education sector. By August 2012, the 
education sector was in need of 230 new schools to meet the growing demand following 
from demographic growth. The shortage of educational facilities in Gaza forced an 
estimated 80 per cent of government and 93 per cent of United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools to operate on double 
shifts, diminishing the quality of education.14 
</p>
<p>21. Since June 2010, Israel has permitted the import into Gaza of construction materials 
for the particular United Nations projects it has approved. In September 2012, Israel, after a 
19-month process, approved 11 United Nations projects related to water, sanitation, 
education, housing and electricity. However, Israel rejected 18 other projects, stating 
security concerns related to the locations of these projects.15 The United Nations remains 
hindered from effectively responding to the population&#8217;s rapidly increasing demand for 
services.16  
</p>
<p>22. Though the tunnel economy between Gaza and Egypt has facilitated the entry of 
some construction material for private use, by the end of June 2012 approximately 71,000 
housing units were needed to fulfil shelter needs.17 Gazans continued to face electricity cuts

<p>of up to 12 hours per day18 and limited access to clean water.19 An estimated 75 per cent of 
Gaza&#8217;s waste water remains untreated, and 90 million litres of Gaza&#8217;s raw sewage is 
</p>
<p>pumped into the Mediterranean daily.<footnote name="2">5  Zitun, &#8220;Soldier dismissed&#8221;. </footnote>0 In sum, the blockade of Gaza has a significant 
negative impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in Gaza. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Excessive use of force in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem  
</b></p>
<p>23. The use of force by Israeli Security Forces (ISF), including IDF and the Israeli 
Border Police, led to seven Palestinian deaths and 3,036 injuries in the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem. Many of these instances raised concerns regarding the excessive 
use of force by ISF.<footnote name="2">4 Autopsy report for Rashad Deeb Hassan Shoukha dated 24 June 2012 issued by the Palestine 
Authority, Ministry of Justice, Palestinian Medico-Legal Institute.  
</footnote>1  
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR received several reports of excessive force being used by ISF in East 
Jerusalem. On 5 October 2012, at around 1 p.m., the Israeli Border Police engaged with 
Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa compound. Eyewitnesses reported that Border Police fired stun 
grenades at Palestinians in various locations of the compound, and in surrounding narrow 
streets, including near Bab el-Selsela where 16-year-old Hassan Afif Afifi and his family 
live. A dozen Border Police randomly engaged with Palestinians, including Mr. Afifi&#8217;s 
parents. The victim came to assist his parents, who were both on the ground. Mr. Afifi was 
reportedly grabbed by at least three Border Police, who punched and kicked him all over 
his body, including in his genitals, before dragging him into the Al-Aqsa compound. There 
they reportedly beat him for almost 60 minutes before taking him to a police station and 
then, due to his injuries, a hospital. The family filed a complaint but had not yet received 
any information from Israeli authorities regarding an investigation as of the finalization of 
the present report.  
</p>
<p>25. On 6 October 2012, at around 12.30 p.m., 32-year-old Hani Mohammad Abul Hawa 
witnessed an altercation between Palestinian teenagers and Border Police in the 
neighbourhood of Mount of Olives. Mr. Abul Hawa saw a Border Police officer violently 
grab a young boy. He intervened and asked the officer to release the boy. At least four 
Border Police approached Mr. Abul Hawa and punched him all over his body, wrestled him 
to the ground and dragged him, before violently pushing him into a police vehicle. Three 
Border Police entered the back of the vehicle and continued to beat Mr. Abul Hawa, 
including by punching him in the face. One officer hit him on his head with the butt of a 
rifle, leading him to bleed profusely. This officer also repeatedly stepped on the victim&#8217;s 
hand with her boots, causing a fracture to his hand. Mr. Abul Hawa was taken to a hospital 
at around 2 p.m., where he alleges the three Border Police continued to beat him. Mr. Abul 
Hawa was checked into the emergency room while handcuffed and with his feet shackled. 
He filed a complaint a few days after the incident, but had not yet received any information 
from Israeli authorities regarding an investigation as of the submission of the present report.

<p>26. On 8 March 2012, at approximately 3 p.m., IDF entered Yatta to carry out an arrest. 
Some Palestinian youths gathered. The situation remained calm, until one youth stabbed a 
soldier with a box cutter. The youths immediately fled. The injured soldier opened fire, 
injuring his assailant, who was about 5 metres away. About 30 seconds later the soldier 
again opened fire. Sixteen-year-old Zakaria Jamal Mohammad Abu Arram, who was 
standing at a distance of 45 metres from the soldier, was shot in the face and killed. A

<p>Palestinian ambulance arrived but was prevented from assisting Mr. Abu Arram until IDF 
departed. The distance between Mr. Abu Arram and the soldier brings into question 
whether an imminent threat to life or serious injury existed, when the soldier opened fire 
the second time.<footnote name="2">3 On 18 April Israeli media reported that the unit involved in the incident was the &#8220;Duvdevan&#8221; unit 
(known for undercover operations) and that they were on a training mission when two undercover 
soldiers were attacked by four men. According to OHCHR information, the incident involved three 
Palestinian men. See Yoav Zitun, &#8220;Soldier dismissed after kicking bound Palestinian&#8221;,

</p>
<p>27. On 27 March 2012, three brothers in the village of Rammun noticed two unknown 
men on their neighbour&#8217;s car. Thinking they may be thieves, the brothers went out to check, 
</p>
<p>and asked the two men to identify themselves. They responded in Arabic but did not 
identify themselves. A confrontation ensued and the two unidentified men opened fire at 
the three brothers. One brother was shot in the leg, another was shot in the neck, and the 
third was shot in the abdomen. Several dozen uniformed IDF soldiers suddenly appeared. 
Two of the brothers were shot by uniformed soldiers, with one being struck seven times at 
close range. The soldiers checked the two men, who it later transpired were undercover IDF 
soldiers, for injuries and then departed.23 Palestinian ambulances were prohibited by IDF 
soldiers from providing medical assistance to the wounded. After approximately 40 
minutes, the wounded were put in IDF jeeps and transported to Taybeh junction. Crews 
from two Palestinian ambulances requested to be allowed to assist the wounded, but the 
IDF soldiers refused. Israeli ambulances eventually took the wounded to a hospital in 
Jerusalem. The man who had been shot seven times at close range died of his injuries. An 
autopsy report obtained by OHCHR confirmed that the victim died as a result of &#8220;live fire 
</p>
<p>shot from close range&#8221;.24 The two other brothers were released from the hospital several 
days later. According to media reports, IDF subsequently relieved from duty one of the 
soldiers involved, for having kicked one of the injured brothers in the head, and ordered the 
opening of a Military Police investigation into the incident.25 
</p>
<p>28. On 29 July 2012, 14 Palestinian workers without entry permits were being smuggled 
into Israel in a van driven by an Israeli citizen. As the van approached the Az Za&#8217;ayyem 
checkpoint, a friend called to advise the driver not to cross, since soldiers there were 
actively searching vehicles. The van&#8217;s engine stalled, which prompted two private security 
guards to approach the vehicle. The driver turned away from the checkpoint towards Az 
Za&#8217;ayyem village. The guards shot at the van, with assault rifles, even though it had 
</p>
<p>diverted away from the checkpoint and was heading toward the village. Three workers were 
hit by bullets, one to the leg and shoulder, one to the head and another to the leg. All three 
were taken to the hospital, where one died the next day.  
</p>
<p>29. During the reporting period, the use of force by ISF during demonstrations resulted 
in the death of four Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>30. On 9 December 2011, during clashes between Palestinians and ISF in Nabi Saleh, 
following the weekly demonstrations that take place in the village, an Israeli soldier in the 
back of a moving armoured vehicle fired a tear gas canister directly at Mustafa Tamimi, 
who was approximately 5 metres behind the vehicle and throwing stones at it. The tear gas 
canister hit Mr. Tamimi below his right eye. He immediately fell and was taken to a

<p>hospital in Israel, where he died the following morning of injuries sustained from this 
incident. Statements by IDF indicated that two separate investigations had been initiated by 
Israeli authorities, one of which was to be concluded by 20 December 2011. In a letter 
dated 19 January 2012 to the Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations in Geneva, 
OHCHR requested information on the status of the two investigations. At the time of 
drafting, no response had been received from the Israeli authorities. 
</p>
<p>31. While the use of live ammunition to disperse demonstrations was limited for most of 
the reporting period, IDF made widespread use of it in response to demonstrations against 
Israeli military operations in Gaza during the crisis of 14 to 21 November 2012, including 
in Nabi Saleh, Hebron, Huwwara checkpoint, Ofer, Tuqu&#8217; and Bethlehem. Such incidents 
resulted in the killing of two and the injury of 16 Palestinians. At the entrance of Ofer 
military camp, ISF responded to stone throwing by Palestinians with live fire on 15, 16 and 
17 November, injuring at least five protesters, who were mostly shot in their legs. Several 
demonstrators were hit in the head and/or chest by tear gas canisters and rubber-coated 
metal bullets. 
</p>
<p>32. On 19 November 2012, students clashed with IDF in Tuqu&#8217; village. The students 
threw stones and the soldiers initially responded by firing tear gas canisters. One of two 
soldiers standing on higher ground then fired live ammunition at the students around 50 
metres away, hitting 17-year-old Mohammad Ahmad al-Badan in the abdomen. Mr. Ahmad 
al-Badan suffered internal bleeding, damage to his intestines and severe damage to his hip.  
</p>
<p>33. On 17 November 2012, several boys from the village of Nabi Saleh gathered on a 
nearby hill overlooking a main road used by Israeli settlers, in order to burn a tire on the 
road. They were spotted by IDF soldiers, seven of whom climbed the hill and fired tear gas 
canisters and rubber-coated metal bullets. Adults from the village headed to the hill and 
clashes continued. Several villagers were hit by rubber-coated metal bullets, including 31-
year-old Rushdi Tamimi. He then turned to flee and was hit from behind by live 
ammunition. The projectile made its way into Mr. Tamimi&#8217;s stomach, causing internal 
</p>
<p>injuries that resulted in death in the hospital two days later.  
</p>

<p>They are therefore entitled to protection against all acts of violence and threats thereof.26 
Additionally, Israel has the duty to ensure that all persons wounded, including those 
wounded by the action of its security forces, receive the medical attention required by their 
condition with the least possible delay.27 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Settler violence  
</b></p>
<p>36. Israeli settlers continued to perpetrate acts of violence against Palestinians and their 
property. A total of 383 incidents were registered during the reporting period, which 
resulted in injury to 169 Palestinians, destruction or damage to 8,054 trees, and other types 
of damage to property. Lack of accountability for these acts remains a concern. This 
phenomenon is analysed in detail in the 2012 report of the Secretary-General to the General 
Assembly on Israeli settlements (A/67/375).  
</p>
<p>37. Many incidents of settler violence occur during the olive harvest period. Incidents 
during the 2012 harvest included: damages to olive trees, theft of olives before or after the 
harvest, settlers trespassing onto private Palestinian land, physical attacks by Israeli settlers 
against Palestinians, and harassment by settlers of Palestinians attempting to access their 
land to harvest their groves. According to OCHA, the 2012 olive harvest saw a decrease in 
the overall number of incidents of settler violence compared to the same period in 2011. 
While the number of trees damaged during the olive harvest in 2012 was lower,28 damage 
to trees by settlers is ongoing throughout the year and particularly intensive before the olive 
harvest, and the impact on the livelihoods of farmers is cumulative. In the words of a 
Palestinian farmer: &#8220;There is nothing left to burn or cut.&#8221; The efforts of Israeli authorities to 
improve coordinated access of Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest are welcomed. 
However, the main issue remains regular and unimpeded access of Palestinians to their 
agricultural lands throughout the year, in addition to the effective prevention of and 
protection from settler violence and a general culture of impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The de facto authorities in Gaza and Palestinian armed groups   
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Rocket and mortar shells firing from Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>38. Palestinian armed groups continued firing rockets and mortar shells at Israel. A total 
of 1,605 home-made rockets, 906 Grad rockets, and 436 mortar shells were fired during the 
reporting period. Of these, 765 home-made rockets, 741 Grad rockets and approximately 
135 mortar shells were fired during the crisis from 14 to 21 November 2012.29 The 
projectiles fired from Gaza towards Israel resulted in the death of six Israelis, including four 
civilians. According to Israeli sources, a further 239 Israelis, including 219 civilians, were 
injured.30 While the majority of injuries seem to be among civilians, verified figures were 
unavailable at the time of drafting. A significant number of these rockets landed in civilian 
areas within Israel. Some projectiles appear to have been directed at military objectives in 
</p>
<p>  
 26  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 2.  
 27 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i>, vol. 
</p>
<p>I, Jean-Marie Henkaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, eds. (Cambridge University Press, 2009), rule 
110, and the 1977 Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to 
the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, art. 10. Israel must also respect its 
obligations regarding the right to health, namely article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>

<p>Israel, yet the indiscriminate nature of the overwhelming majority of these projectiles 
makes it impossible to determine whether they were directed at military objectives.  
</p>
<p>39. In some cases Palestinian armed groups continued to fail to uphold the principle of 
distinction when launching attacks on Israel, by targeting areas populated by civilians. On 9 
March 2012, eight Israeli civilians were injured, one of them seriously, as a result of 
rockets fired at Israel.31 Five Israeli civilians were injured as a result of rocket firing on 
Israel on 24 October 2012.32 On 12 November, four Israeli civilians were injured when a 
Grad rocket hit a home in Netivot city.33  
</p>
<p>40. During the reporting period at least 237 rockets and mortar shells aimed at Israel fell 
short and exploded in Gaza, causing Palestinian casualties. Of these, 138 occurred before 
13 November34 and 99 fell short and exploded in the period from 14 to 19 November 
2012.35 Two Palestinian civilians were killed and 12 were injured before 13 November 
2012.36 A further three Palestinian civilians, including a woman and an 11-month-old 
infant, were killed in Al-Zaitoun on 14 November. OHCHR received reports related to a 
case involving the death of two additional civilians, including a child, and the injury of five 
others, including three children, as a result of what seemed to be a rocket fired by 
Palestinian armed groups that hit a house in Jabalya on 16 November 2012. 
</p>
<p>41. Targeting civilian areas and using weapons that cannot be directed accurately at a 
military objective, such as the home-made rockets and Grad rockets, are contrary to the 
rules of international humanitarian law prohibiting the targeting of civilians and 
indiscriminate attacks. OHCHR has received information that such rockets are often fired 
from densely populated areas. It has been alleged by the Government of Israel that these 
weapons are often stockpiled in structures that appear to be civilian in nature. Should this 
be the case, this would also violate the rules of international humanitarian law requiring 
parties to a conflict to protect the civilian population and objects under their control from 
the effects of attacks, including by avoiding locating military objectives within or near 
densely populated areas.37 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to life, including the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>42. The de facto authorities in Gaza continued to pass death sentences and carry out 
executions in violation of the right to life. During the reporting period, six persons were 
executed by the de facto authorities. Five were sentenced by civil courts and one by a 
military court. All death sentences were executed without the approval of the president of 
the Palestinian Authority, which is a requirement under the Palestinian Basic Law. 
</p>
<p>43. The de facto authorities&#8217; courts passed three new death sentences, two of which 
were imposed on civilians by military courts for treason and murder. The trial of civilians 
in military courts is prima facie inconsistent with international human rights standards, in 
particular with regard to procedural guarantees pertaining to fair trial. In general, concerns 
remained with regard to due process and fair trial guarantees.

<p>44. On 17 October 2012, a 27-year-old civilian died while in the custody of the criminal 
investigation unit of the de facto authorities in Khan Younis. OHCHR was informed by 
family members that the victim was arrested by the unit without a warrant, allegedly in 
relation to a dispute with his uncle. OHCHR received information that the de facto 
authorities had committed to launching an investigation into the incident. However, at the 
time of writing no information was available regarding such an investigation  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Treatment in detention and civil liberties 
</b></p>
<p>45. Arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment remained issues of concern. These 
practices typically targeted members and supporters of Fatah in relation to their political 
affiliation or opinion.38 Fatah detainees were reportedly blindfolded and handcuffed at the 
time of detention or shortly after arrival at a designated security location. During 
interrogations, in some cases while detainees were blindfolded, questions were asked about 
social affiliations, professions, family members, and connections to Fatah and the 
Palestinian Authority. 
</p>
<p>46. On 3 July 2012, the internal security agency arrested a 33-year-old Fatah member 
from Khan Younis and detained him for nearly a month. The victim was questioned about 
his Fatah-related activities, subjected to <i>shabeh</i>39, slapped, intimidated and solitarily 
confined.  
</p>
<p>47. The de facto authorities continued to curtail freedom of expression, opinion and 
assembly. Journalists were detained and ill-treated in relation to their perceived political 
affiliation or alleged lack of objectivity; in other cases, security forces of the de facto 
authorities used excessive force to disperse peaceful assemblies. In one case monitored by 
OHCHR, on 11 June 2012, a freelance journalist from Al-Shojayea was arrested by ISA 
and detained until 4 July. During his detention he claims to have been questioned about his 
media-related work, and accused of establishing ties with the Palestinian Authority. During 
his detention he was intimidated, ill-treated and tortured, including through beatings of 
different parts of his body and the use of shabeh. 
</p>
<p>48. Others not linked to the media were harassed in relation to their opinion. In July 
2012, for instance, the de facto authorities banned the travel of the director of the 
Palestinian Contractors Union, in reference to a statement he had made voicing concerns 
over the quality of cement smuggled via tunnels.40   
</p>
<p>49. OHCHR documented cases in which the de facto authorities violated the right to 
peaceful assembly, sometimes by using force to disperse participants. The de facto 
authorities presented justifications for these violations. In some cases the need to ensure 
public order was invoked, in other cases the de facto authorities&#8217; Ministry of Interior 
blamed individual police personnel for taking inappropriate action. On 18 July 2012, the de 
facto authorities&#8217; police detained two women participating in a peaceful protest against the

female police.  
</p>
<p>50. In an incident on 26 September 2012, a demonstration blaming the de facto 
authorities for extreme poverty and unemployment was forcibly dispersed by the de facto 
authorities&#8217; security forces in El-Boureij refugee camp. 
</p>
<p>51. In an incident on 6 November 2012, around 50 people, mostly women, organized a 
peaceful gathering in Gaza City, to protest the continued stalemate in national 
reconciliation. Information received by OHCHR indicates that the de facto authorities&#8217; 
police forcibly dispersed the gathering by beating several participants with sticks. The de 
facto authorities&#8217; Ministry of Interior claimed that the demonstration could not take place 
for reasons of public order, but also regretted the &#8220;wrong acts by policemen&#8221;. The Ministry 
announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate the incident.41  
</p>
<p>52. Incidents of intervention in the work of civil society organizations were reported. In 
July 2012, the deputy director of the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, a West Bank-based 
non-governmental organization, and seven of the Gaza-based board members were 
prevented from travelling abroad in relation to the syndicate&#8217;s elections. Reportedly, the 
deputy director of the syndicate disclosed that he was summoned by the de facto 
authorities&#8217; Attorney-General and questioned about the syndicate&#8217;s elections in the West 
Bank. He noted that he was asked to sign an oath to not work for the syndicate any more, 
which he refused to do.42 
</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>Women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. Local human rights organizations estimated that four women were killed in the name 
of honour. On 23 December 2011, a 45-year-old woman from Al-Sheikh Radwan was 
killed by her nephew by strangulation, allegedly to &#8220;maintain the family&#8217;s honour&#8221;.43 
Similarly, on 22 March 2012, a 22-year-old girl from Khan Younis was admitted to Al-
Nasser hospital suffering serious health complications due to poison, allegedly because she 
had attempted to commit suicide. Although she received medication on the same day, 
resulting in a significant improvement of her health, one of her relatives came to the 
hospital and shot and killed her.44 The information available to OHCHR indicates that the 
de facto authorities have not made serious efforts to investigate these cases.45 
</p>
<p><b> C. The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  The ending of security vetting based on political belief or affiliation 
</b></p>
<p>54. In September 2007, the Palestinian Authority Cabinet issued a decision requiring 
&#8220;security vetting&#8221; by the Palestinian Authority security services for public sector 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>employment. Thus, the security services made recommendations to the Palestinian 
Authority ministries regarding the hiring, continuation and/or termination of contracts 
based on political affiliations. Since then, hundreds of school teachers, for example, have 
been dismissed on the basis of interventions by the two security agencies. According to 
information available to OHCHR, since 2008 such practices had adversely affected at least 
640 people who were excluded from public sector employment on the basis of their 
political beliefs or affiliations. 
</p>
<p>55. In positive developments, the Palestinian Authority Cabinet, on 24 April 2012, 
suspended this decision. Further, on 4 September 2012, the Palestinian High Court ruled in 
favour of teachers who had been dismissed from their positions due to negative reports by 
security agencies. Following the court order, the Palestinian Ministry of Education and 
Higher Education announced that it would comply with the court ruling and rehire the 
dismissed teachers. 
</p>
<p>56. OHCHR continued to monitor detention by Palestinian law enforcement agencies, as 
well as engage with and provide technical assistance on human rights to relevant 
Palestinian authorities and institutions. The number of complaints of arbitrary detention by 
the Palestinian Authority received by OHCHR in 2011 decreased significantly, as did the 
number of complaints received by the Independent Commission for Human Rights and 
other Palestinian human rights organizations. The Commission reported 755 complaints in 
2011, compared with 1,559 in 2010. However, the first half of 2012 witnessed a 
considerable increase of allegations of arbitrary detention by the Palestinian Authority 
security forces.  
</p>
<p>57. OHCHR documented cases that indicate that the security services are still arbitrarily 
detaining Palestinians, especially persons affiliated with Islamist parties, demonstrators 
supporting the Arab Spring and national reconciliation efforts, and media professionals and 
bloggers critical of the Palestinian Authority. The cases documented include detention of 
individuals without warrants, not informing the individuals detained of the charges against 
them or the reasons for their detention, prolonged detention without presenting the detainee 
before a competent court, and non-implementation of judicial decisions ordering the release 
of individuals.  
</p>
<p>58. Journalists were targeted by security services during the reporting period. In early 
2012, OHCHR monitored the detention of Youssef al-Shayeb, a Palestinian journalist for 
various local and regional newspapers. On 30 January, Mr. al-Shayeb published a report in 
the Jordan-based <i>Al-Ghad</i> newspaper, where he criticized corruption at the Palestinian 
diplomatic mission in Paris. On 31 January, Mr. al-Shayeb was summoned and interrogated 
by the general intelligence service in Ramallah. On 25 February, Mr. al-Shayeb was 
informed that he had been fired from his position with <i>Al-Ghad</i>. On 22 March, he was 
summoned by the police and was detained for 48 hours. On 28 March, he was taken to 
court where the prosecutor accused him of incitement against the Palestinian Authority and 
falsely accusing people of spying, among other things. The judge ordered the extension of 
his detention for 15 days, whereupon Mr. al-Shayeb declared that he was starting a hunger 
strike. On 2 April, however, a court ordered his release on a 10,000 Jordanian dinar bail. 
After his release, he was in a hospital for two days because of his medical condition. The 
court denied the prosecution&#8217;s request that he be returned to prison. On 2 May, OHCHR 
sent a letter to President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad outlining its 
concerns with regard to the detention of journalists. OHCHR has yet to receive a response. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Ill-treatment by Palestinian Authority security forces 
</b></p>

<p>60. In April 2012, OHCHR interviewed a person who had been detained by the 
Palestinian Preventive Security Service in the south of the West Bank. The person stated 
that he had been ill-treated by Service officers, who informed him that he had to spend the 
45-day interrogation period in solitary confinement. He was brought to a small, cold cell; 
forced to hold his hands up for several hours during the night without break; forced to take 
off his clothes during interrogation; forced to sleep naked on the ground without a blanket 
or mattress; and beaten and kicked several times. He was often slapped on the face and hit 
with a water-filled plastic bottle on the left ear. He received no medical treatment. Another 
detainee interviewed by OHCHR in June 2012 reported that he was subjected to daily 
interrogation and occasional shabeh during the first few weeks of his detention. He spent 22 
days without being allowed to shower. He explained that shabeh usually started Thursday 
afternoon and lasted until early Sunday, when neither the International Committee of the 
Red Cross nor human rights organizations conduct visits. He noted that shabeh often lasted 
for extremely long periods, even through the night, during which he was not allowed to 
sleep. He was also beaten once while handcuffed. 
</p>
<p>61. According to information gathered by OHCHR, ill-treatment, including shabeh and 
beatings, among others, has also been used during interrogations in civil, i.e., non-security 
related, cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil liberties, including freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>62. During a peaceful protest against a meeting between the Palestinian Authority 
president and an Israeli official at the end of June 2012, Palestinian security forces 
physically assaulted journalists and protesters. One of several journalists covering the 
demonstration, Muhammad Jaradat, was beaten, detained, and had his camera confiscated 
by four security officers in civilian uniform while covering the protest on 30 June 2012. Mr. 
Jaradat was taken to the police station, where he was again assaulted by police officers in 
civilian uniform with a baton, in the presence of fellow officers, who took no action. Mr. 
Jaradat was released a few hours later. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Serious violations of international law continued to be committed in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory throughout the reporting period. The general human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights situation remains of heightened concern and needs to be addressed as a matter 
</b></p>
<p><b>of urgency.

<p>64. <b>OHCHR is especially concerned by the recurrence of violations highlighted in 
several previous reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Secretary-General. Most such violations could have been avoided, should the 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant duty bearers have taken the necessary preventive and corrective actions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are highlighted in the recommendations below.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The lack of accountability for violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law remains a fundamental concern. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Government of Israel must take all possible measures to ensure full respect 
of its obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>distinction, proportionality and precautions, and international human rights law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the conduct of hostilities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  </b></p>


<p>67.<b> Israel must review the methods and mechanisms used to enforce the access-
restricted areas in Gaza, in order to ensure full compliance with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights law and international humanitarian law. In situations other than hostilities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>these methods should be in line with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Government of Israel must fully lift the blockade of Gaza, with due regard 
to legitimate security concerns. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Government of Israel must take the necessary measures to prevent 
incidents of excessive use of force during law enforcement operations. These measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should include a reassessment of the regulations allowing the use of live ammunition; 
</b></p>
<p><b>the adoption of adequate disciplinary and penal sanctions for members of the security 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces who do not respect these regulations; and the provision of adequate riot-control 
</b></p>
<p><b>training to all police and troops deployed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.   
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Government of Israel must initiate thorough, prompt, independent and 
impartial investigations into all instances in which firearms are used by its law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement personnel, including members of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) 
</b></p>
<p><b>operating in that capacity and private security personnel contracted by Israeli 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities.   
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Israel must ensure that all wounded persons receive the required medical 
attention with the least possible delay. To this effect, IDF should issue clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>instructions that the wounded must receive immediate attention, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, and staff must refrain from obstructing the work of medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>personnel, including Palestinian ambulance crews.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Government of Israel must take measures to prevent attacks by settlers 
against Palestinians and their property. Attacks must be thoroughly, promptly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>independently and impartially investigated, perpetrators held accountable, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims compensated.  
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Government of Israel must ensure full accountability for violations of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>thorough, prompt, independent and impartial investigations into all instances of 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged violations and the prosecution of those allegedly responsible, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate. Civilian oversight of investigations and prosecutions should be positively 
</b></p>
<p><b>considered. All victims of violations must be provided with adequate, effective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt reparation for the harm suffered. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to the de facto authorities and Palestinian armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The de facto authorities should impose an immediate moratorium on the use of 
the death penalty, and cease the use of military tribunals to try civilians.  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The de facto authorities and Palestinian armed groups must respect 
international humanitarian law, and the de facto authorities must also ensure respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>for international humanitarian law by all members or other armed actors under their 
</b></p>
<p><b>control, especially in relation to the principles of distinction and proportionality. In all 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances, they must avoid targeting civilians. The de facto authorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian armed groups must avoid locating military assets in densely populated 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas and launching attacks from these areas. Accountability for any violations or 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the killing of civilians, must be delivered.   </b></p>


<p>76.<b> There is a need for thorough, prompt, independent and impartial investigations 
into all types of criminal acts, including killings related to honour, and for prosecution 
</b></p>
<p><b>of those responsible for such acts. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> There is a need for all necessary measures to be taken to ensure that detentions 
are in line with international human rights principles, bring an immediate end to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of ill-treatment and torture by members of its security forces, impartially and 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughly investigate all allegations of ill-treatment and torture, and impose 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate disciplinary and penal sanctions against those responsible. All victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations must be provided with adequate, effective and prompt reparation for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>harm suffered. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The de facto authorities must respect the rights to freedom of opinion, 
expression, peaceful assembly and association.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to the Government of the State of Palestine</b>46<b> 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The Government of the State of Palestine must adopt measures to ensure the 
restitution or compensation of persons who have been removed or excluded from 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment on the basis of security vetting.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Government of the State of Palestine must ensure that any person 
detained, including those detained by security forces or agencies, is referred without 
</b></p>
<p><b>delay to the appropriate courts.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Government of the State of Palestine must ensure that all judicial decisions 
are complied with promptly by Palestinian law enforcement agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Government of the State of Palestine must issue clear instructions to law 
enforcement officials to refrain from arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Government must create an effective mechanism to ensure that any complaint of 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, or torture is investigated in a thorough, prompt, 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and impartial manner. Officials found responsible must be held to 
</b></p>
<p><b>account, including through appropriate penal or disciplinary sanctions. All victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations must be provided with adequate, effective and prompt reparation for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>harm suffered. 
</b></p>

<p>  
 46  In a letter dated 12 December 2012, the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations informed the Secretary-General that, in line with General Assembly resolution 69/17 of 29 
November 2012, the designation &#8220;State of Palestine&#8221; should be used in all official documents of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations. On 3 January 2013, Mahmoud Abbas, President, State of Palestine, issued a decree 
instructing that &#8220;official documents, seals, signs and letterheads of the Palestinian National Authority 
official and national institutions, shall be amended, by replacing the name &#8216;Palestinian National 
Authority&#8217; whenever it appears by the name &#8216;State of Palestine&#8217;, and by adopting the emblem of the 
State of Palestine. The relevant authorities shall be in charge of monitoring the implementation of this 
Decree, taking into account the requirements of use&#8221;. </p>
