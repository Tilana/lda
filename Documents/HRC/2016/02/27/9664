including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> at the continued violation by the occupying Power, Israel, of the 
human rights of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the Israeli military incursions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the recent incursion in northern Gaza and the assault on Beit Hanoun, constitute a 
collective punishment of the civilians therein and exacerbate the severe humanitarian crisis in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the sense of shock expressed by the Secretary-General on the Israeli 
military operations carried out in Beit Hanoun on 8 November 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the Israeli wilful killing of Palestinian civilians, including women and 
children, constitutes a gross violation of human rights law and international humanitarian law,  
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that, under international humanitarian law, the medical personnel and means of 
transport of the Palestine Red Crescent Society must be protected and respected in all 
circumstances, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses its shock</i> at the horror of Israeli killing of Palestinian civilians in 
Beit Hanoun while asleep and other civilians fleeing earlier Israeli bombardment; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> the Israeli killing of Palestinian civilians, including women and 
children, as well as of medics in Beit Hanoun and other Palestinian towns and villages, and calls 
for bringing the perpetrators thereof to justice;

Palestinian Territory in compliance with human rights law and international humanitarian law; </p>

law, to refrain from violence against the civilian population and to treat under all circumstances 
all detained combatants and civilians in accordance with the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to dispatch urgently a high-level fact-finding mission, to be appointed by 
the President of the Human Rights Council, to travel to Beit Hanoun to, inter alia:  (a) assess the 
situation of victims; (b) address the needs of survivors; and (c) make recommendations on ways 
and means to protect Palestinian civilians against any further Israeli assaults;

</b></p>
<p>ANNEX I 
</p>
<p><b>Administrative and programme budget implications of the resolution 
adopted by the Council at its third special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>Statement on programme budget implications (PBI) 
</b>1. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/S-3/L.1, 
the Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Decide to dispatch a high-level fact-finding mission urgently to Beit Hanoun to 
investigate human rights violations resulting from the recent Israeli assaults including the 
killings of civilians and destruction of property and infrastructure therein; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Request the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to provide all administrative, technical and logistical assistance required to enable 
the fact-finding mission to fulfil its mandate promptly and efficiently; and 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Request the fact-finding mission to report to the Council no later than the middle 
of December 2006 on progress made towards the fulfilment of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. The terms of the draft resolution require analysis and review of the level of resources 
required to implement the related activities.  Owing to the one-day duration of the third special 
session of the Council, there is not sufficient time for the Secretariat to prepare and present a 
related statement of administrative and financial implications of the draft resolution.  This oral 
statement is presented to inform the Council that the resources required to implement the draft 
resolution would, to the extent possible, be met from resources approved by the 
General Assembly under section 23, Human rights, for the programme budget in the 
biennium 2006-2007.  
</p>
<p>3. However, the Secretariat expects to carry out a thorough review of the implications of the 
draft resolution and, in accordance with established budgetary procedures, prepare a written 
statement containing a detailed analysis of the programme budget implications of the draft 
resolution which would be submitted to the General Assembly at the time it considers this 
resolution.  It should be recalled that, under the procedures established by the General Assembly 
in its resolutions 41/213 and 42/211, a contingency fund is established for each biennium to 
accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the 
programme budget.  Under this procedure, if additional expenditures are proposed that exceed 
the resources available from the contingency fund, the activities concerned can be implemented 
only through the redeployment of resources from low-priority areas or the modification of 
existing activities.  Otherwise, such additional activities must be deferred to a later biennium. </p>
