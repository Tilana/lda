<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report focuses on certain forms of abuses in health-care settings that 
may cross a threshold of mistreatment that is tantamount to torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. It identifies the policies that promote these practices 
and existing protection gaps.  
</p>
<p> By illustrating some of these abusive practices in health-care settings, the report 
sheds light on often undetected forms of abusive practices that occur under the auspices of 
health-care policies, and emphasizes how certain treatments run afoul of the prohibition on 
torture and ill-treatment. It identifies the scope of State&#8223;s obligations to regulate, control 
and supervise health-care practices with a view to preventing mistreatment under any 
pretext.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur examines a number of the abusive practices commonly 
reported in health-care settings and describes how the torture and ill-treatment framework 
applies in this context. The examples of torture and ill-treatment in health settings 
discussed likely represent a small fraction of this global problem.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with 
Council resolution 16/23.  
</p>
<p>2. Reports of country visits to Tajikistan and Morocco are contained in documents 
A/HRC/22/53/Add.1 and Add.2, respectively. A/HRC/22/53/Add.3 contains an update on 
follow-up measures and A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 contains observations made by the Special 
Rapporteur on some of the cases reflected in the communication reports A/HRC/20/30, 
A/HRC/21/49 and A/HRC/22/67. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Upcoming country visits and pending requests 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur plans to visit Bahrain in May 2013 and Guatemala in the 
second half of 2013 and is engaged with the respective Governments to find mutually 
agreeable dates. The Special Rapporteur has accepted an invitation to visit Thailand in 
February 2014. He also notes with appreciation an outstanding invitation to visit Iraq.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur has reiterated his interest to conduct country visits to a 
number of States where there are pending requests for invitations: Cuba; Ethiopia; Ghana; 
Kenya; United States of America; Uzbekistan; Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and 
Zimbabwe. The Special Rapporteur has also recently requested to visit Chad, C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, 
Dominican Republic, Georgia, Mexico and Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Highlights of key presentations and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 10 September 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in a Chatham House 
event in London hosted by REDRESS on &#8220;Enforcing the absolute prohibition against 
torture&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>6. On 26 September 2012, the Special Rapporteur met the Director General of the 
National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea, who was visiting 
Washington D.C. 
</p>
<p>7. Between 22 and 24 October 2012, the Special Rapporteur presented his interim 
report (A/67/279) to the General Assembly and participated in two side events: one, held at 
the Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations in New York, on &#8220;Reprisals 
against victims of torture and other ill-treatment&#8221; and the other organized jointly with the 
World Organisation Against Torture, Penal Reform International, the Centre for 
Constitutional Rights and Human Rights Watch on &#8220;The death penalty and human rights: 
the way forward&#8221;. He also met with representatives of the Permanent Missions of 
Guatemala and Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>8. On 17 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in a symposium 
organized by New York University on the practice of solitary confinement, entitled 
&#8220;Solitary: wry fancies and stark realities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>9. From 2 to 6 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur conducted a follow-up visit to 
Uruguay (A/HRC/22/53/Add.3), at the invitation of the Government, to assess 
improvements and identify remaining challenges regarding torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment.  </p>


<p>10. From 13 to 14 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert meeting 
on &#8220;Torture and ill-treatment in healthcare settings&#8221; at the Center for Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Law, American University in Washington, DC.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Applying the torture and ill-treatment protection framework 
in health-care settings 
</b></p>
<p>11. Mistreatment in health-care settings1 has received little specific attention by the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as the denial of health-care has often been understood 
as essentially interfering with the &#8220;right to health&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>12. While different aspects of torture and ill-treatment in health-care settings have been 
previously explored by the rapporteurship and other United Nations mechanisms, the 
Special Rapporteur feels that there is a need to highlight the specific dimension and 
intensity of the problem, which often goes undetected; identify abuses that exceed the scope 
of violations of the right to health and could amount to torture and ill-treatment; and 
strengthen accountability and redress mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that there are unique challenges to stopping 
torture and ill-treatment in health-care settings due, among other things, to a perception 
that, while never justified, certain practices in health-care may be defended by the 
authorities on grounds of administrative efficiency, behaviour modification or medical 
necessity. The intention of the present report is to analyse all forms of mistreatment 
premised on or attempted to be justified on the basis of health-care policies, under the 
common rubric of their purported justification as &#8220;health-care treatment&#8221;, and to find cross-
cutting issues that apply to all or most of these practices.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Evolving interpretation of the definition of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>14. Both the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights have stated that the definition of torture is subject to ongoing reassessment 
in light of present-day conditions and the changing values of democratic societies.2 
</p>
<p>15. The conceptualization of abuses in health-care settings as torture or ill-treatment is a 
relatively recent phenomenon. In the present section, the Special Rapporteur embraces this 
ongoing paradigm shift, which increasingly encompasses various forms of abuse in health-
care settings within the discourse on torture. He demonstrates that, while the prohibition of 
torture may have originally applied primarily in the context of interrogation, punishment or 
intimidation of a detainee, the international community has begun to recognize that torture 
may also occur in other contexts. 
</p>
<p>16. The analysis of abuse in health-care settings through the lens of torture and ill-
treatment is based on the definition of these violations provided by the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its 
authoritative interpretations. In order to demonstrate how abusive practices in health-care

</p>
<p>health-care is delivered.

<p>settings meet the definition of torture, the following section provides an overview of the 
main elements of the definition of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Applicability of the torture and ill-treatment framework in health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>settings 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Overview of key elements of the definition of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>17. At least four essential elements are reflected in the definition of torture provided in 
article 1, paragraph 1, of the Convention against Torture: an act inflicting severe pain or 
suffering, whether physical or mental; the element of intent; the specific purpose; and the 
involvement of a State official, at least by acquiescence (A/HRC/13/39/Add.5, para. 30). 
Acts falling short of this definition may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment under article 16 of the Convention (A/63/175, para. 46). The previous Special 
Rapporteurs have covered in great detail the main components of the definition of torture. 
Nevertheless, there are a few salient points worth elaborating for the purpose of the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>18. The jurisprudence and authoritative interpretations of international human rights 
bodies provide useful guidance on how the four criteria of the definition of torture apply in 
the context of health-care settings. ECHR has noted that a violation of article 3 may occur 
where the purpose or intention of the State&#8223;s action or inaction was not to degrade, 
</p>
<p>humiliate or punish the victim, but where this nevertheless was the result.3 
</p>
<p>19. The application of the criteria of severe pain or suffering, intent, and involvement of 
a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, by consent or acquiescence to 
abuses in health-care settings, is relatively straightforward. The criterion of the specific 
purpose warrants some analysis.4  
</p>
<p>20. The mandate has stated previously that intent, required in article 1 of the 
Convention, can be effectively implied where a person has been discriminated against on 
the basis of disability. This is particularly relevant in the context of medical treatment, 
where serious violations and discrimination against persons with disabilities may be 
defended as &#8220;well intended&#8221; on the part of health-care professionals. Purely negligent 
conduct lacks the intent required under article 1, but may constitute ill-treatment if it leads 
to severe pain and suffering (A/63/175, para. 49).  
</p>
<p>21. Furthermore, article 1 explicitly names several purposes for which torture can be 
inflicted: extraction of a confession; obtaining information from a victim or a third person; 
punishment, intimidation and coercion; and discrimination. However, there is a general 
acceptance that these stated purposes are only of an indicative nature and not exhaustive. At 
the same time, only purposes which have &#8220;something in common with the purposes 
</p>
<p>expressly listed&#8221; are sufficient (A/HRC/13/39/Add.5, para. 35).  
</p>
<p>22. Although it may be challenging to satisfy the required purpose of discrimination in 
some cases, as most likely it will be claimed that the treatment is intended to benefit the 
&#8220;patient&#8221;, this may be met in a number of ways.5 Specifically, the description of abuses 
</p>
<p>  
 3  See <i>Peers v. Greece</i>, Application No. 28524/95 (2001), paras. 68, 74; <i>Grori v. Albania</i>, Application 
</p>
<p>No. 25336/04 (2009), para. 125.

</i></p>
<p><i>Drug Detention Centers </i>(2011), p. 10. 
 5  Ibid., p. 12. </p>


<p>outlined below demonstrates that the explicit or implicit aim of inflicting punishment, or 
the objective of intimidation, often exist alongside ostensibly therapeutic aims. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The scope of State core obligations under the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Committee against Torture interprets State obligations to prevent torture as 
indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent with the obligation to prevent cruel, inhuman, 
or degrading treatment or punishment (ill-treatment) because &#8220;conditions that give rise to 
ill-treatment frequently facilitate torture&#8221;.6 It has established that &#8220;each State party should 
prohibit, prevent and redress torture and ill-treatment in all contexts of custody or control, 
for example, in prisons, hospitals, schools, institutions that engage in the care of children, 
the aged, the mentally ill or disabled, in military service, and other institutions as well as 
contexts where the failure of the State to intervene encourages and enhances the danger of 
privately inflicted harm&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>24. Indeed, the State&#8223;s obligation to prevent torture applies not only to public officials, 
such as law enforcement agents, but also to doctors, health-care professionals and social 
workers, including those working in private hospitals, other institutions and detention 
centres (A/63/175, para. 51). As underlined by the Committee against Torture, the 
prohibition of torture must be enforced in all types of institutions and States must exercise 
due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish violations by non-State officials 
or private actors.8  
</p>
<p>25. In <i>da Silva Pimentel </i>v<i>. Brazil</i>, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women observed that &#8220;the State is directly responsible for the action of private 
institutions when it outsources its medical services&#8221; and &#8220;always maintains the duty to 
regulate and monitor private health-care institutions&#8221;.9 The Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights addressed State responsibility for actions of private actors in the context of health-
care delivery in <i>Ximenes Lopes </i>v.<i> Brazil</i>.10  
</p>
<p>26. Ensuring special protection of minority and marginalized groups and individuals is a 
critical component of the obligation to prevent torture and ill-treatment. Both the 
Committee against Torture and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights have confirmed 
that States have a heightened obligation to protect vulnerable and/or marginalized 
individuals from torture, as such individuals are generally more at risk of experiencing 
torture and ill-treatment.11  
</p>
<p><b> C. Interpretative and guiding principles 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal capacity and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>27. In all legal systems, capacity is a condition assigned to agents that exercise free will 
and choice and whose actions are attributed legal effects. Capacity is a rebuttable

comment No. 20 (1992), para. 2.

(1992), para. 9.

<p>presumption; therefore, &#8220;incapacity&#8221; has to be proven before a person can be designated as 
incapable of making decisions. Once a determination of incapacity is made, the person&#8223;s 
expressed choices cease to be treated meaningfully. One of the core principles of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is &#8220;respect for inherent dignity, 
</p>
<p>individual autonomy including the freedom to make one&#8223;s own choices, and independence 
</p>
<p>of persons&#8221; (art. 3 (a)). The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has 
interpreted the core requirement of article 12 to be the replacement of substituted decision-
making regimes by supported decision-making, which respects the person&#8223;s autonomy, will 
and preferences.12 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health observed that informed consent is not 
mere acceptance of a medical intervention, but a voluntary and sufficiently informed 
decision. Guaranteeing informed consent is a fundamental feature of respecting an 
individual&#8223;s autonomy, self-determination and human dignity in an appropriate continuum 
of voluntary health-care services (A/64/272, para. 18). 
</p>
<p>29. As the Special Rapporteur on the right to health observed, while informed consent is 
commonly enshrined in the legal framework at the national level, it is frequently 
compromised in the health-care setting. Structural inequalities, such as the power imbalance 
between doctors and patients, exacerbated by stigma and discrimination, result in 
individuals from certain groups being disproportionately vulnerable to having informed 
consent compromised (ibid., para. 92). 
</p>
<p>30. The intimate link between forced medical interventions based on discrimination and 
the deprivation of legal capacity has been emphasized both by the Committee on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and the previous Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture.13 
</p>
<p><b> 2. </b>Powerlessness and the doctrine of &#8220;medical necessity&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. Patients in health-care settings are reliant on health-care workers who provide them 
services. As the previous Special Rapporteur stated: &#8220;Torture, as the most serious violation 
of the human right to personal integrity and dignity, presupposes a situation of 
powerlessness, whereby the victim is under the total control of another person.&#8221;14 
Deprivation of legal capacity, when a person&#8223;s exercise of decision-making is taken away 
and given to others, is one such circumstance, along with deprivation of liberty in prisons or 
other places (A/63/175, para. 50). 
</p>
<p>32. The mandate has recognized that medical treatments of an intrusive and irreversible 
nature, when lacking a therapeutic purpose, may constitute torture or ill-treatment when 
enforced or administered without the free and informed consent of the person concerned 
(ibid., paras. 40, 47). This is particularly the case when intrusive and irreversible, non-
consensual treatments are performed on patients from marginalized groups, such as persons 
with disabilities, notwithstanding claims of good intentions or medical necessity. For 
example, the mandate has held that the discriminatory character of forced psychiatric 
interventions, when committed against persons with psychosocial disabilities, satisfies both 
intent and purpose required under the article 1 of the Convention against Torture, 
notwithstanding claims of &#8220;good intentions&#8221; by medical professionals (ibid., paras. 47, 48). 
In other examples, the administration of non-consensual medication or involuntary 
</p>

 13  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 25 (d); see also CRPD/C/CHN/CO/1 and 
</p>
<p>Corr.1, para. 38; A/63/175, paras. 47, 74. 
 14  A/63/175, para. 50. </p>


<p>sterilization is often claimed as being a necessary treatment for the so-called best interest of 
the person concerned.   
</p>
<p>33. However, in response to reports of sterilizations of women in 2011, the International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics emphasized that &#8220;sterilization for prevention of 
future pregnancy cannot be ethically justified on grounds of medical emergency. Even if a 
future pregnancy may endanger a woman&#8223;s life or health, she &#8230; must be given the time and 
support she needs to consider her choice. Her informed decision must be respected, even if 
it is considered liable to be harmful to her health.&#8221;15 
</p>
<p>34. In those cases, dubious grounds of medical necessity were used to justify intrusive 
and irreversible procedures performed on patients without full free and informed consent. 
In this light, it is therefore appropriate to question the doctrine of &#8220;medical necessity&#8221; 
</p>
<p>established by the ECHR in the case of <i>Herczegfalvy</i> v. <i>Austria</i> (1992),16 where the Court 
held that continuously sedating and administering forcible feeding to a patient who was 
physically restrained by being tied to a bed for a period of two weeks was nonetheless 
consistent with article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms because the treatment in question was medically necessary and 
in line with accepted psychiatric practice at that time. 
</p>
<p>35. The doctrine of medical necessity continues to be an obstacle to protection from 
arbitrary abuses in health-care settings. It is therefore important to clarify that treatment 
provided in violation of the terms of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities &#8211; either through coercion or discrimination &#8211; cannot be legitimate or justified 
under the medical necessity doctrine. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Stigmatized identities 
</b></p>
<p>36. In a 2011 report (A/HRC/19/41), the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights examined discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity in health-care settings. She observed that a 
pattern of human rights violations emerged that demanded a response. With the adoption in 
June 2011 of resolution 17/19, the Human Rights Council formally expressed its &#8220;grave 
concern&#8221; regarding violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender 
</p>
<p>identity. 
</p>
<p>37. Many policies and practices that lead to abuse in health-care settings are due to 
discrimination targeted at persons who are marginalized. Discrimination plays a prominent 
role in an analysis of reproductive rights violations as forms of torture or ill-treatment 
because sex and gender bias commonly underlie such violations. The mandate has stated, 
with regard to a gender-sensitive definition of torture, that the purpose element is always 
fulfilled when it comes to gender-specific violence against women, in that such violence is 
inherently discriminatory and one of the possible purposes enumerated in the Convention is 
discrimination (A/HRC/7/3, para. 68). 
</p>
<p>38. In the context of prioritizing informed consent as a critical element of a voluntary 
counselling, testing and treatment continuum, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health 
has also observed that special attention should be paid to vulnerable groups. Principles 17 
and 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles, for instance, highlight the importance of safeguarding 
informed consent of sexual minorities. Health-care providers must be cognizant of, and 
adapt to, the specific needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons 
(A/64/272, para. 46). The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
</p>
<p>  
 15  <i>Ethical Issues in Obstetrics and Gynecology</i> (2012), pp. 123&#8211;124.  
 16 Application No. 10533/83, paras. 27, 83.  </p>


<p>indicated that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
proscribes any discrimination in access to health-care and the underlying determinants of 
health, as well as to means and entitlements for their procurement, on the grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity.17  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Emerging recognition of different forms of abuses in health-
care settings 
</b></p>
<p>39. Numerous reports have documented a wide range of abuses against patients and 
individuals under medical supervision. Health providers allegedly withhold care or perform 
treatments that intentionally or negligently inflict severe pain or suffering for no legitimate 
medical purpose. Medical care that causes severe suffering for no justifiable reason can be 
considered cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if there is State 
involvement and specific intent, it is torture. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Compulsory detention for medical conditions 
</b></p>
<p>40. Compulsory detention for drug users is common in so-called rehabilitation centres. 
Sometimes referred to as drug treatment centres or &#8220;reeducation through labor&#8221; centres or 
</p>
<p>camps, these are institutions commonly run by military or paramilitary, police or security 
forces, or private companies. Persons who use, or are suspected of using, drugs and who do 
not voluntarily opt for drug treatment and rehabilitation are confined in such centres and 
compelled to undergo diverse interventions.18 In some countries, a wide range of other 
marginalized groups, including street children, persons with psychosocial disabilities, sex 
workers, homeless individuals and tuberculosis patients, are reportedly detained in these 
centres.19 
</p>
<p>41. Numerous reports document that users of illicit drugs who are detained in such 
centres undergo painful withdrawal from drug dependence without medical assistance, 
administration of unknown or experimental medications, State-sanctioned beatings, caning 
or whipping, forced labour, sexual abuse and intentional humiliation.20 Other reported 
abuses included &#8220;flogging therapy&#8221;, &#8220;bread and water therapy&#8221;, and electroshock resulting 
in seizures, all in the guise of rehabilitation. In such settings, medical professionals trained 
to manage drug dependence disorders as medical illnesses21 are often unavailable. 
</p>
<p>42. Compulsory treatment programmes that consist primarily of physical disciplinary 
exercises, often including military-style drills, disregard medical evidence (A/65/255,

<p>without medical evaluation, judicial review or right of appeal &#8211; offers no evidence-based23 
or effective treatment. Detention and forced labour programmes therefore violate 
international human rights law and are illegitimate substitutes for evidence-based measures, 
such as substitution therapy, psychological interventions and other forms of treatment given 
with full, informed consent (A/65/255, para. 31). The evidence shows that this arbitrary and 
unjustified detention is frequently accompanied by &#8211; and is the setting for &#8211; egregious 
physical and mental abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>  Overview of developments to date 
</b></p>
<p>43. The numerous calls by various international and regional organizations to close 
compulsory drug detention centres,24 as well as the numerous injunctions and 
recommendations contained in the recently released guidelines by WHO on 
pharmacotherapy for opiate dependence,25 the UNODC policy guidance on the 
organization&#8223;s human rights responsibilities in drug detention centres,26 and resolutions by 
the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,27 are routinely ignored.28 These centres continue to 
operate often with direct or indirect support and assistance from international donors 
without any adequate human rights oversight.29 
</p>
<p>44. Notwithstanding the commitment to scale-up methadone treatment and evidence-
based treatment as opposed to punitive approaches, those remanded to compulsory 
treatment in the punitive drug-free centres continue to exceed, exponentially, the number 
receiving evidence-based treatment for drug dependence.30  
</p>
<p><b> B. Reproductive rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur has, on numerous occasions, responded to various initiatives 
in the area of gender mainstreaming and combating violence against women, by, inter alia, 
examining gender-specific forms of torture with a view to ensure that the torture protection 
framework is applied in a gender-inclusive manner.31 The Special Rapporteur seeks to 
complement these efforts by identifying the reproductive rights practices in health-care 
settings that he believes amount to torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>46. International and regional human rights bodies have begun to recognize that abuse 
and mistreatment of women seeking reproductive health services can cause tremendous and 
lasting physical and emotional suffering, inflicted on the basis of gender.32 Examples of 
such violations include abusive treatment and humiliation in institutional settings;33

<p>involuntary sterilization; denial of legally available health services34 such as abortion and 
post-abortion care; forced abortions and sterilizations;35 female genital mutilation;36 
violations of medical secrecy and confidentiality in health-care settings, such as 
denunciations of women by medical personnel when evidence of illegal abortion is found; 
and the practice of attempting to obtain confessions as a condition of potentially life-saving 
medical treatment after abortion.37  
</p>
<p>47. In the case of <i>R.R. </i>v.<i> Poland</i>, for instance, ECHR found a violation of article 3 in the 
case of a woman who was denied access to prenatal genetic testing when an ultrasound 
revealed a potential foetal abnormality. The Court recognized &#8220;that the applicant was in a 
situation of great vulnerability&#8221;38 and that R.R.&#8223;s access to genetic testing was &#8220;marred by 
procrastination, confusion and lack of proper counselling and information given to the 
applicant&#8221;.39 Access to information about reproductive health is imperative to a woman&#8223;s 
ability to exercise reproductive autonomy, and the rights to health and to physical integrity.  
</p>
<p>48. Some women may experience multiple forms of discrimination on the basis of their 
sex and other status or identity. Targeting ethnic and racial minorities, women from 
marginalized communities40 and women with disabilities41 for involuntary sterilization42 
because of discriminatory notions that they are &#8220;unfit&#8221; to bear children43 is an increasingly 
global problem. Forced sterilization is an act of violence,44 a form of social control, and a 
violation of the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment or punishment.45 The mandate has asserted that &#8220;forced abortions or sterilizations 
carried out by State officials in accordance with coercive family planning laws or policies 
may amount to torture&#8221;.46 
</p>
<p>49. For many rape survivors, access to a safe abortion procedure is made virtually 
impossible by a maze of administrative hurdles, and by official negligence and obstruction. 
In the landmark decision of <i>K.N.L.H. </i>v.<i> Peru</i>, the Human Rights Committee deemed the 
denial of a therapeutic abortion a violation of the individual&#8223;s right to be free from ill-
treatment.47 In the case of <i>P. and S. </i>v.<i> Poland</i>, ECHR stated that &#8220;the general stigma 
attached to abortion and to sexual violence &#8230;, caus[ed] much distress and suffering, both 
</p>
<p>physically and mentally&#8221;.48  
</p>
<p>50. The Committee against Torture has repeatedly expressed concerns about restrictions 
on access to abortion and about absolute bans on abortion as violating the prohibition of 
torture and ill-treatment.49 On numerous occasions United Nations bodies have expressed

<p>concern about the denial of or conditional access to post-abortion care.50 often for the 
impermissible purposes of punishment or to elicit confession.51 The Human Rights 
Committee explicitly stated that breaches of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights include forced abortion, as well as denial of access to safe abortions to 
women who have become pregnant as a result of rape52 and raised concerns about obstacles 
to abortion where it is legal.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Denial of pain treatment 
</b></p>
<p>51. In 2012, WHO estimated that 5.5 billion people live in countries with low or no 
access to controlled medicines and have no or insufficient access to treatment for moderate 
to severe pain.53 Despite the repeated reminders made by the Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs to States of their obligations,54 83 per cent of the world population has either no or 
inadequate access to treatment for moderate to severe pain. Tens of millions of people, 
including around 5.5 million terminal cancer patients and 1 million end-stage HIV/AIDS 
patients, suffer from moderate to severe pain each year without treatment.55  
</p>
<p>52. Many countries fail to make adequate arrangements for the supply of these 
medications.56 Low- and middle-income countries account for 6 per cent of morphine use 
worldwide while having about half of all cancer patients and 95 per cent of all new HIV 
infections.57 Thirty-two countries in Africa have almost no morphine available at all.58 In 
the United States, over a third of patients are not adequately treated for pain.59 In France, a 
study found that doctors underestimated pain in over half of their AIDS patients.60 In India, 
more than half of the country&#8223;s regional cancer centres do not have morphine or doctors 
</p>
<p>trained in using it. This is despite the fact that 70 per cent or more of their patients have 
advanced cancer and are likely to require pain treatment.61  
</p>
<p>53. Although relatively inexpensive and highly effective medications such as morphine 
and other narcotic drugs have proven essential &#8220;for the relief of pain and suffering&#8221;62, these 
types of medications are virtually unavailable in more than 150 countries.63 Obstacles that 
unnecessarily impede access to morphine and adversely affect its availability include overly 
restrictive drug control regulations64 and, more frequently, misinterpretation of otherwise 
appropriate regulations;65 deficiency in drug supply management; inadequate 
infrastructure;66 lack of prioritization of palliative care67; ingrained prejudices about using

<p>opioids for medical purposes;68 and the absence of pain management policies or guidelines 
for practitioners.69  
</p>
<p><b>  Applicability of torture and ill-treatment framework   
</b></p>
<p>54. Generally, denial of pain treatment involves acts of omission rather than 
commission,70 and results from neglect and poor Government policies, rather than from an 
intention to inflict suffering. However, not every case where a person suffers from severe 
pain but has no access to appropriate treatment will constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment or punishment. This will only be the case when the suffering is severe and meets 
the minimum threshold under the prohibition against torture and ill-treatment; when the 
State is, or should be, aware of the suffering, including when no appropriate treatment was 
offered; and when the Government failed to take all reasonable steps71 to protect 
individuals&#8223; physical and mental integrity.72 
</p>
<p>55. Ensuring the availability and accessibility of medications included in the WHO 
Model List of Essential Medicines is not just a reasonable step but a legal obligation under 
the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. When the failure of States to take positive 
steps, or to refrain from interfering with health-care services, condemns patients to 
unnecessary suffering from pain, States not only fall foul of the right to health but may also 
violate an affirmative obligation under the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment 
(A/HRC/10/44 and Corr.1, para. 72).  
</p>
<p>56. In a statement issued jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture reaffirmed that the failure to ensure access to 
controlled medicines for the relief of pain and suffering threatens fundamental rights to 
health and to protection against cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Governments must 
guarantee essential medicines &#8211; which include, among others, opioid analgesics &#8211; as part of 
their minimum core obligations under the right to health, and take measures to protect 
people under their jurisdiction from inhuman and degrading treatment.73  
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with psychosocial disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>57. Under article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, persons 
with disabilities include those who have long-term intellectual or sensory impairments, 
which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation 
in society on an equal basis with others. These are individuals who have been either 
neglected or detained in psychiatric and social care institutions, psychiatric wards, prayer

<p>camps, secular and religious-based therapeutic boarding schools, boot camps, private 
residential treatment centres or traditional healing centres.74  
</p>
<p>58. In 2008 the mandate made significant strides in the development of norms for the 
abolition of forced psychiatric interventions on the basis of disability alone as a form of 
torture and ill-treatment (see A/63/175). The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities also provides authoritative guidance on the rights of persons with disabilities 
and prohibits involuntary treatment and involuntary confinement on the grounds of 
disability, superseding earlier standards such as the 1991 Principles for the Protection of 
Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care (1991 
Principles). 
</p>
<p>59. Severe abuses, such as neglect, mental and physical abuse and sexual violence, 
continue to be committed against people with psychosocial disabilities and people with 
intellectual disabilities in health-care settings.75 
</p>
<p>60. There are several areas in which the Special Rapporteur would like to suggest steps 
beyond what has already been proposed by the mandate in its efforts to promote the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as the new normative paradigm and 
call for measures to combat impunity.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. A new normative paradigm   
</b></p>
<p>61. Numerous calls by the mandate to review the anti-torture framework in relation to 
persons with disabilities76 remain to be addressed. It is therefore necessary to reaffirm that 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities offers the most comprehensive 
set of standards on the rights of persons with disabilities, inter alia, in the context of health 
care, where choices by people with disabilities are often overridden based on their supposed 
&#8220;best interests&#8221;, and where serious violations and discrimination against persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities may be masked as &#8220;good intentions&#8221; of health professionals (A/63/175, para. 
49). 
</p>
<p>62. It is necessary to highlight additional measures needed to prevent torture and ill-
treatment against people with disabilities, by synthesizing standards and coordinating 
actions in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.77 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Absolute ban on restraints and seclusion  
</b></p>
<p>63. The mandate has previously declared that there can be no therapeutic justification 
for the use of solitary confinement and prolonged restraint of persons with disabilities in 
psychiatric institutions; both prolonged seclusion and restraint may constitute torture and 
ill-treatment (A/63/175, paras. 55-56). The Special Rapporteur has addressed the issue of 
solitary confinement and stated that its imposition, of any duration, on persons with mental 
disabilities is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (A/66/268, paras. 67-68, 78). 
Moreover, any restraint on people with mental disabilities for even a short period of time 
</p>
<p>  
 74  See HRW, &#8220;Like a Death Sentence&#8221;: Abuses against Persons with Mental Disabilities in Ghana 
</p>
<p>(2012).   75  In November 2012, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights approved precautionary 
</p>
<p>measures to protect 300 individuals in Guatemala City&#8223;s psychiatric facility, where unspeakable 
</p>
<p>forms of abuses were documented. 
 76  See A/58/120; A/63/175, para. 41. 
 77  See for example Organization of American States, Committee for the Elimination of all Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities, resolution CEDDIS/RES.1 (I-E/11) (2011), annex. </p>


<p>may constitute torture and ill-treatment.78 It is essential that an absolute ban on all coercive 
and non-consensual measures, including restraint and solitary confinement of people with 
psychological or intellectual disabilities, should apply in all places of deprivation of liberty, 
including in psychiatric and social care institutions. The environment of patient 
powerlessness and abusive treatment of persons with disabilities in which restraint and 
seclusion is used can lead to other non-consensual treatment, such as forced medication and 
electroshock procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Domestic legislation allowing forced interventions  
</b></p>
<p>64. The mandate continues to receive reports of the systematic use of forced 
interventions worldwide. Both this mandate and United Nations treaty bodies have 
established that involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in health-care 
facilities are forms of torture and ill-treatment.79 Forced interventions, often wrongfully 
justified by theories of incapacity and therapeutic necessity inconsistent with the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are legitimized under national laws, 
and may enjoy wide public support as being in the alleged &#8220;best interest&#8221; of the person 
</p>
<p>concerned. Nevertheless, to the extent that they inflict severe pain and suffering, they 
violate the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
(A/63/175, paras. 38, 40, 41). Concern for the autonomy and dignity of persons with 
disabilities leads the Special Rapporteur to urge revision of domestic legislation allowing 
for forced interventions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Fully resp</b>ecting each person&#8217;s legal capacity is a first step in the prevention of torture 
</p>
<p><b>and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p>65. Millions of people with disabilities are stripped of their legal capacity worldwide, 
due to stigma and discrimination, through judicial declaration of incompetency or merely 
by a doctor&#8223;s decision that the person &#8220;lacks capacity&#8221; to make a decision. Deprived of 
</p>
<p>legal capacity, people are assigned a guardian or other substitute decision maker, whose 
consent will be deemed sufficient to justify forced treatment (E/CN.4/2005/51, para. 79). 
</p>
<p>66. As earlier stated by the mandate, criteria that determine the grounds upon which 
treatment can be administered in the absence of free and informed consent should be 
clarified in the law, and no distinction between persons with or without disabilities should 
be made.80 Only in a life-threatening emergency in which there is no disagreement 
regarding absence of legal capacity may a health-care provider proceed without informed 
consent to perform a life-saving procedure.81 From this perspective, several of the 1991 
Principles may require reconsideration as running counter to the provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (A/63/175, para. 44). 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Involuntary commitment in psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>67. In many countries where mental health policies and laws do exist, they focus on 
confinement of people with mental disabilities in psychiatric institutions but fail to 
effectively safeguard their human rights.82 
</p>
<p>

<p>68. Involuntary commitment to psychiatric institutions has been well documented.83 
There are well-documented examples of people living their whole lives in such psychiatric 
or social care institutions.84 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has 
been very explicit in calling for the prohibition of disability-based detention, i.e. civil 
commitment and compulsory institutionalization or confinement based on disability.85 It 
establishes that community living, with support, is no longer a favourable policy 
development but an internationally recognized right.86 The Convention radically departs 
from this approach by forbidding deprivation of liberty based on the existence of any 
disability, including mental or intellectual, as discriminatory. Article 14, paragraph 1 (b), of 
the Convention unambiguously states that &#8220;the existence of a disability shall in no case 
justify a deprivation of liberty&#8221;. Legislation authorizing the institutionalization of persons 
with disabilities on the grounds of their disability without their free and informed consent 
must be abolished. This must include the repeal of provisions authorizing 
institutionalization of persons with disabilities for their care and treatment without their free 
and informed consent, as well as provisions authorizing the preventive detention of persons 
with disabilities on grounds such as the likelihood of them posing a danger to themselves or 
others, in all cases in which such grounds of care, treatment and public security are linked 
in legislation to an apparent or diagnosed mental illness (A/HRC/10/48, paras. 48, 49). 
</p>
<p>69. Deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental illness is unjustified if its basis is 
discrimination or prejudice against persons with disabilities. Under the European 
Convention on Human Rights, mental disorder must be of a certain severity in order to 
justify detention.87 The Special Rapporteur believes that the severity of the mental illness is 
not by itself sufficient to justify detention; the State must also show that detention is 
necessary to protect the safety of the person or of others. Except in emergency cases, the 
individual concerned should not be deprived of his liberty unless he has been reliably 
shown to be of &#8220;unsound mind&#8221;.88 As detention in a psychiatric context may lead to non-
consensual psychiatric treatment,89 the mandate has stated that deprivation of liberty that is 
based on the grounds of a disability and that inflicts severe pain or suffering could fall 
under the scope of the Convention against Torture (A/63/175, para. 65). In making such an 
assessment, factors such as fear and anxiety produced by indefinite detention, the infliction 
of forced medication or electroshock, the use of restraints and seclusion, the segregation 
from family and community, etc., should be taken into account.90 
</p>
<p>70. Moreover, the effects of institutionalization of individuals who do not meet 
appropriate admission criteria, as is the case in most institutions which are off the 
monitoring radar and lack appropriate admission oversight,91 raise particular questions 
under prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. Inappropriate or unnecessary non-consensual

<p>institutionalization of individuals may amount to torture or ill-treatment as use of force 
beyond that which is strictly necessary.92  
</p>
<p><b> E. Marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Persons living with HIV/AIDS  
</b></p>
<p>71. Numerous reports have documented mistreatment of or denial of treatment to people 
living with HIV/AIDS by health providers.93 They are reportedly turned away from 
hospitals, summarily discharged, denied access to medical services unless they consent to 
sterilization,94 and provided poor quality care that is both dehumanizing and damaging to 
their already fragile health status.95 Forced or compulsory HIV testing is also a common 
abuse that may constitute degrading treatment if it is &#8220;done on a discriminatory basis 
without respecting consent and necessity requirements&#8221; (A/HRC/10/44 and Corr.1, para. 
65). Unauthorized disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners, family members, employers 
and other health workers is a frequent abuse against people living with HIV that may lead 
to physical violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Persons who use drugs  
</b></p>
<p>72. People who use drugs are a highly stigmatized and criminalized population whose 
experience of health-care is often one of humiliation, punishment and cruelty. Drug users 
living with HIV are often denied emergency medical treatment.96 In some cases the laws 
specifically single out the status of a drug user as a stand-alone basis for depriving someone 
of custody or other parental rights. Use of drug registries &#8211; where people who use drugs are 
identified and listed by police and health-care workers, and their civil rights curtailed &#8211; are 
violations of patient confidentiality97 that lead to further ill-treatment by health providers. 
</p>
<p>73. A particular form of ill-treatment and possibly torture of drug users is the denial of 
opiate substitution treatment, including as a way of eliciting criminal confessions through 
inducing painful withdrawal symptoms (A/HRC/10/44 and Corr.1, para. 57). The denial of 
methadone treatment in custodial settings has been declared to be a violation of the right to 
be free from torture and ill-treatment in certain circumstances (ibid., para. 71). Similar 
reasoning should apply to the non-custodial context, particularly in instances where 
Governments impose a complete ban on substitution treatment and harm reduction 
measures.98 The common practice of withholding anti-retroviral treatment from HIV-
positive people who use drugs, on the assumption that they will not be capable of adhering 
to treatment, amounts to cruel and inhuman treatment, given the physical and psychological 
suffering as the disease progresses; it also constitutes abusive treatment based on 
unjustified discrimination solely related to health status.

<p>74. By denying effective drug treatment, State drug policies intentionally subject a large 
group of people to severe physical pain, suffering and humiliation, effectively punishing 
them for using drugs and trying to coerce them into abstinence, in complete disregard of the 
chronic nature of dependency and of the scientific evidence pointing to the ineffectiveness 
of punitive measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sex workers  
</b></p>
<p>75. A report on sex workers documented negative and obstructive attitudes on the part 
of medical workers, including denial of necessary health-care services.99 Public health 
rationales have in some instances led to mandatory HIV testing and exposure of their HIV 
status, accompanied by punitive measures.100 Breaches of privacy and confidentiality are a 
further indignity experienced by sex workers in health settings.101 Most recently, the 
Committee against Torture noted &#8220;reports of alleged lack of privacy and humiliating 
circumstances amounting to degrading treatment during medical examinations&#8221;.102 The 
mandate has observed that acts aimed at humiliating the victim, regardless of whether 
severe pain has been inflicted, may constitute degrading treatment or punishment because 
of the incumbent mental suffering (E/CN.4/2006/6, para. 35).  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons  
</b></p>
<p>76. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has concluded that homophobic ill-
treatment on the part of health professionals is unacceptable and should be proscribed and 
denounced.103 There is an abundance of accounts and testimonies of persons being denied 
medical treatment, subjected to verbal abuse and public humiliation, psychiatric evaluation, 
a variety of forced procedures such as sterilization, State-sponsored forcible anal 
examinations for the prosecution of suspected homosexual activities, and invasive virginity 
examinations conducted by health-care providers,104 hormone therapy and genital-
normalizing surgeries under the guise of so called &#8220;reparative therapies&#8221;.105 These 
procedures are rarely medically necessary,106 can cause scarring, loss of sexual sensation, 
pain, incontinence and lifelong depression and have also been criticized as being 
unscientific, potentially harmful and contributing to stigma (A/HRC/14/20, para. 23). The 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern about 
lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex women as &#8220;victims of abuses and mistreatment 
by health service providers&#8221; (A/HRC/19/41, para. 56). 
</p>
<p>77. Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to 
irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing 
surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, &#8220;in an attempt to

<p>fix their sex&#8221;,107 leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe 
mental suffering.  
</p>
<p>78. In many countries transgender persons are required to undergo often unwanted 
sterilization surgeries as a prerequisite to enjoy legal recognition of their preferred gender. 
In Europe, 29 States require sterilization procedures to recognize the legal gender of 
transgender persons. In 11 States where there is no legislation regulating legal recognition 
of gender,108 enforced sterilization is still practised. As at 2008, in the United States of 
America, 20 states required a transgender person to undergo &#8220;gender-confirming surgery&#8221; 
or &#8220;gender reassignment surgery&#8221; before being able to change their legal sex.109 In Canada, 
only the province of Ontario does not enforce &#8220;transsexual surgery&#8221; in order to rectify the 
recorded sex on birth certificates.110 Some domestic courts have found that not only does 
enforced surgery result in permanent sterility and irreversible changes to the body, and 
interfere in family and reproductive life, it also amounts to a severe and irreversible 
intrusion into a person&#8223;s physical integrity. In 2012, the Swedish Administrative Court of 
</p>
<p>Appeals ruled that a forced sterilization requirement to intrude into someone&#8223;s physical 
integrity could not be seen as voluntary.111 In 2011, the Constitutional Court in Germany 
ruled that the requirement of gender reassignment surgery violated the right to physical 
integrity and self-determination.112 In 2009, the Austrian Administrative High Court also 
held that mandatory gender reassignment, as a condition for legal recognition of gender 
identity, was unlawful.113 In 2009, the former Commissioner for Human Rights of the 
Council of Europe observed that &#8220;[the involuntary sterilization] requirements clearly run 
counter to the respect for the physical integrity of the person&#8221;.114  
</p>
<p>79. The mandate has noted that &#8220;members of sexual minorities are disproportionately 
subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment because they fail to conform to socially 
constructed gender expectations. Indeed, discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or 
gender identity may often contribute to the process of the dehumanization of the victim, 
which is often a necessary condition for torture and ill-treatment to take place.&#8221;115 
&#8220;Medically worthless&#8221; practices of subjecting men suspected of homosexual conduct to 
</p>
<p>non-consensual anal examinations to &#8220;prove&#8221; their homosexuality116 have been condemned 
by the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which have held that the practice contravenes the 
prohibition of torture and ill-treatment (A/HRC/19/41, para. 37).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>80. Persons with disabilities are particularly affected by forced medical interventions, 
and continue to be exposed to non-consensual medical practices (A/63/175, para. 40). In the 
case of children in health-care settings, an actual or perceived disability may diminish the

<p>weight given to the child&#8223;s views117 in determining their best interests, or may be taken as 
the basis of substitution of determination and decision-making by parents, guardians, carers 
or public authorities.118 Women living with disabilities, with psychiatric labels in particular, 
are at risk of multiple forms of discrimination and abuse in health-care settings. Forced 
sterilization of girls and women with disabilities has been widely documented.119 National 
law in Spain, among other countries,120 allows for the sterilization of minors who are found 
to have severe intellectual disabilities. The Egyptian Parliament failed to include a 
provision banning the use of sterilization as a &#8220;treatment&#8221; for mental illness in its patient 
</p>
<p>protection law. In the United States, 15 states have laws that fail to protect women with 
disabilities from involuntary sterilization.121  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Significance of categorizing abuses in health-care settings as torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The preceding examples of torture and ill-treatment in health-care settings 
likely represent a small fraction of this global problem. Such interventions always 
</b></p>
<p><b>amount at least to inhuman and degrading treatment, often they arguably meet the 
</b></p>
<p><b>criteria for torture, and they are always prohibited by international law. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The prohibition of torture is one of the few absolute and non-derogable human 
rights,</b>122 <b>a matter of <i>jus cogens</i>,</b>123<b> a peremptory norm of customary international law. 
Examining abuses in health-care settings from a torture protection framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>provides the opportunity to solidify an understanding of these violations and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlight the positive obligations that States have to prevent, prosecute and redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>such violations. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The right to an adequate standard </b>of health care (&#8220;right to health&#8221;) determines 
the States&#8217; obligations towards persons suffering from illness. In turn, the absolute 
</p>
<p><b>and non-derogable nature of the right to protection from torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishes objective restrictions on certain therapies. In the context of health-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses, the focus on the prohibition of torture strengthens the call for accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>and strikes a proper balance between individual freedom and dignity and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>health concerns. In that fashion, attention to the torture framework ensures that 
</b></p>
<p><b>system inadequacies, lack of resources or services will not justify ill-treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Although resource constraints may justify only partial fulfilment of some aspects of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to health, a State cannot justify its non-compliance with core obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as the absolute prohibition of torture, under any circumstances.</b>124<b>  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>By reframing violence and abuses in health-care settings as prohibited ill-
treatment, victims and advocates are afforded stronger legal protection and redress

<p><b>for violations of human rights. In this respect, the recent general comment No. 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>(2012) of the Committee against Torture on the right to a remedy and reparation 
</b></p>
<p><b>offers valuable guidance regarding proactive measures required to prevent forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>interventions. Notably, the Committee considers that the duty to provide remedy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation extends to all acts of ill-treatment,</b>125<b> so that it is immaterial for this 
</b></p>
<p><b>purpose whether abuses in health-care settings meet the criteria for torture per se. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This framework opens new possibilities for holistic social processes that foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>appreciation of the lived experiences of persons, including measures of satisfaction 
</b></p>
<p><b>and guarantees of non-repetition, and the repeal of inconsistent legal provisions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Enforce the prohibition of torture in all health-care institutions, both 
</b></p>
<p><b>public and private, by, inter alia, declaring that abuses committed in the context of 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-care can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</b></p>
<p><b>punishment; regulating health-care practices with a view to preventing mistreatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>under any pretext; and integrating the provisions of prevention of torture and ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment into health-care policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Promote accountability for torture and ill-treatment in health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>settings by identifying laws, policies and practices that lead to abuse; and enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>national preventive mechanisms to systematically monitor, receive complaints and 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiate prosecutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Conduct prompt, impartial and thorough investigations into all 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegations of torture and ill-treatment in health-care settings; where the evidence 
</b></p>
<p><b>warrants it, prosecute and take action against perpetrators; and provide victims with 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective remedy and redress, including measures of reparation, satisfaction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees of non-repetition as well as restitution, compensation and rehabilitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Provide appropriate human rights education and information to health-
</b></p>
<p><b>care personnel on the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment and the existence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>extent, severity and consequences of various situations amounting to torture and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and promote a culture of 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect for human integrity and dignity, respect for diversity and the elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>attitudes of pathologizaton and homophobia. Train doctors, judges, prosecutors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>police on the standards regarding free and informed consent; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Safeguard free and informed consent on an equal basis for all 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals without any exception, through legal framework and judicial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative mechanisms, including through policies and practices to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>against abuses. Any legal provisions to the contrary, such as provisions allowing 
</b></p>
<p><b>confinement or compulsory treatment in mental health settings, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>guardianship and other substituted decision-making, must be revised. Adopt policies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and protocols that uphold autonomy, self-determination and human dignity. Ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that information on health is fully available, acceptable, accessible and of good 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality;</b> <b>and that it is imparted and comprehended by means of supportive and 
protective measures such as a wide range of community-based services and supports 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/64/272, para. 93). Instances of treatment without informed consent should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated; redress to victims of such treatment should be provided; 
</b></p>
<p>  
 125 General comment No. 3, para. 1. </p>


<p><b> (f) Ensure special protection of minority and marginalized groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals as a critical component of the obligation to prevent torture and ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment</b>126<b> by, inter alia, investing in and offering marginalized individuals a wide 
</b></p>
<p><b>range of voluntary supports that enable them to exercise their legal capacity and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully respect their individual autonomy, will and preferences.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Denial of pain relief  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopt a human rights-based approach to drug control as a matter of 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority to prevent the continuing violations of rights stemming from the current 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches to curtailing supply and demand (A/65/255, para. 48). Ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>national drug control laws recognize the indispensible nature of narcotic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychotropic drugs for the relief of pain and suffering; review national legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative procedures to guarantee adequate availability of those medicines for 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate medical uses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure full access to palliative care and overcome current regulatory, 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational and attitudinal obstacles that restrict availability to essential palliative 
</b></p>
<p><b>care medications, especially oral morphine. States should devise and implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies that promote widespread understanding about the therapeutic usefulness of 
</b></p>
<p><b>controlled substances and their rational use; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Develop and integrate palliative care into the public health system by 
</b></p>
<p><b>including it in all national health plans and policies, curricula and training programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and developing the necessary standards, guidelines and clinical protocols. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Compulsory detention for medical reasons  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Close compulsory drug detention and </b>&#8220;<b>rehabilitation</b>&#8221;<b> centres without 
</b></p>
<p><b>delay and implement voluntary, evidence-based and rights-based health and social 
</b></p>
<p><b>services in the community. Undertake investigations to ensure that abuses, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, are not taking place in privately-
</b></p>
<p><b>run centres for the treatment of drug dependence;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Cease support for the operation of existing drug detention centres or the 
</b></p>
<p><b>creation of new centres. Any decision to provide funding should be made only 
</b></p>
<p><b>following careful risk assessment. If provided, any such funds should be clearly time-
</b></p>
<p><b>limited and provided only on the conditions that the authorities (a) commit to a rapid 
</b></p>
<p><b>process for closing drug detention centres and reallocating said resources to scaling up 
</b></p>
<p><b>voluntary, community-based, evidence-based services for treatment of drug 
</b></p>
<p><b>dependence; and (b) replace punitive approaches and compulsory elements to drug 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment with other, evidence-based efforts to prevent HIV and other drug-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>harms. Such centres, while still operating as the authorities move to close them, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to fully independent monitoring;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Establish an effective mechanism for monitoring dependence treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices and compliance with international norms;  
</b></p>
<p>  
 126  See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 14, para. 43 (a)-(f). </p>


<p><b>(d) Ensure that all harm-reduction measures and drug-dependence treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>services, particularly opioid substitution therapy, are available to people who use drugs, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in particular those among incarcerated populations (A/65/255, para. 76).  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to repeal any law allowing 
intrusive and irreversible treatments, including forced genital-normalizing surgery, 
</b></p>
<p><b>involuntary sterilization, unethical experimentation, medical display, </b>&#8220;reparative<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>therapies</b>&#8221; or &#8220;conversion therapies&#8221;<b>, when enforced or administered without the free 
</b></p>
<p><b>and informed consent of the person concerned. He also calls upon them to outlaw 
</b></p>
<p><b>forced or coerced sterilization in all circumstances and provide special protection to 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals belonging to marginalized groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Persons with psychosocial disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Review the anti-torture framework in relation to persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as 
</b></p>
<p><b>authoritative guidance regarding their rights in the context of health-care;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Impose an absolute ban on all forced and non-consensual medical
