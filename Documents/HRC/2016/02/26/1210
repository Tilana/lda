</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and all 
relevant human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since 2010, in 
particular its resolutions 65/123 of 13 December 2010 and 66/261 of 29 May 2012, in 
which the Assembly recognized the importance of the provision of continued parliamentary 
support for the work of the Human Rights Council, in particular its universal periodic 
review,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human 
Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolution 22/15 of 21 March 2013 on the contribution of 
parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal periodic review, and 
taking note with appreciation of the summary report of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights of the panel discussion on the theme, &#8220;Contribution of 
parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal periodic review&#8221;, 
held on 29 May 2013,1  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to contribute to the work of 
the United Nations, and in particular its contribution to the work of the Human Rights 
Council and United Nations human rights treaty bodies,  
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the Human Rights Council and parliaments stand to gain 
considerably from exploring possible synergies to ensure that the universal periodic review 
has the greatest impact at the national level,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the crucial role that parliaments play in, inter alia, translating 
international commitments into national policies and laws and hence in contributing to the 
fulfilment by each State Member of the United Nations of its human rights obligations and 
commitments and to the strengthening of the rule of law,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> the leading role that parliaments could play in ensuring the 
implementation of recommendations made at the sessions of the universal periodic review 
and by other human rights mechanisms at the national level,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Encourages</i> States, in accordance with their national legislation, to promote 
the involvement of parliaments in all stages of the universal periodic review reporting 
process, in particular through the inclusion of the national parliament as a relevant 
stakeholder in the consultation process of the national report and in the implementation of 
recommendations, and to report on such involvement in their national report and voluntary 
mid-term reports or during the interactive dialogue session of the universal periodic review;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Welcomes</i> the growing practice by States under review of including 
parliamentarians in their national delegations to the universal periodic review, and 
encourages States, as appropriate, to continue this practice;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the recent efforts by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the 
parliamentary and other authorities of Member States to organize, in collaboration with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, regional seminars 
aimed at raising awareness of the work of the Human Rights Council, in particular its 
universal periodic review, and to build capacities of parliaments to contribute to its work;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Further welcomes</i> in that regard the recent regional seminar held in Romania 
for parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe, and invites States, with the support of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Office of the High Commissioner, to continue to 
contribute to such activities;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Invites</i> the High Commissioner to provide the Human Rights Council with 
regular updates on the activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on parliamentary 
capacity-building, as well as on its activities with regard to the work of the Council and its 
universal periodic review;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant stakeholders to promote and enhance cooperation 
between their national parliaments and national human rights institutions and civil society 
in the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the issue under the same agenda item. 
</p>
<p><i>40th meeting 
27 June 2014

<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
