<p><b>  29</b>/&#8230;  <b>Elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy 
 and their family members 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 on institution-
</p>
<p>building of the Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 8/13 of 18 June 2008, 12/7 of 1 
</p>
<p>October 2009 and 15/10 of 30 September 2010, and General Assembly resolution 65/215 of 
</p>
<p>21 December 2010, 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling further</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and 
</p>
<p>interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that leprosy is curable and that the human rights of persons with leprosy 
</p>
<p>could be better protected by treatment provided in the early stages that can prevent 
</p>
<p>disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, in various parts of the world, persons affected by leprosy and 
</p>
<p>their family members continue to face barriers to their participation as equal members of 
</p>
<p>society and violations and abuses of their human rights, and conscious that greater attention 
</p>
<p>is needed to address these challenges, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members, including 
</p>
<p>women and children, should be treated with dignity and are entitled to enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms under customary international law, relevant 
</p>
<p>conventions and national constitutions and laws, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members still face 
</p>
<p>multiple forms of prejudice and discrimination stemming from misinformation about and 
</p>
<p>misunderstanding of the disease throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that specific attention is needed to address all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy, and their family members, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of prejudice and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy, and their family members, throughout 
</p>
<p>the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the importance</i> of implementing the principles and guidelines for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
</p>
<p>submitted by the Advisory Committee in 2010,1 to which Governments, relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations bodies, specialized agencies, funds and programmes, other intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and national human rights institutions were encouraged to give due 
</p>
<p>consideration in Council resolution 15/10 and General Assembly resolution 65/215 
</p>
<p>respectively, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee, from within existing resources, to 
</p>
<p>undertake a study which reviews the implementation of the principles and guidelines for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
</p>
<p>together with the obstacles thereto, and to submit a report containing practical suggestions 
</p>
<p>for the wider dissemination and more effective implementation of the principles and 
</p>
<p>guidelines in order to eliminate discrimination and the stigma associated with leprosy and 
</p>
<p>to promote, protect and respect the human rights of those affected by leprosy, and their 
</p>
<p>family members, to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-fifth session; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Encourages</i> the Advisory Committee, when elaborating the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>report, to take into account the views of Member States, as appropriate, relevant 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations, including the World Health Organization, the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, as well 
</p>
<p>as the work done on the issue by relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>funds and programmes within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> Governments, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes, other intergovernmental organizations, national human 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with the study of the 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
