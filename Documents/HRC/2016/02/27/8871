<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component 
of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context, receives a large number of communications alleging violations of the right to adequate 
housing and related rights worldwide. Such communications are received from national, regional 
and international non-governmental organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations 
and other United Nations procedures concerned with the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the annual report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to 
States, responses received from States, observations of the Special Rapporteur, and follow-up 
communications and activities relating to earlier communications, from the period of 
6 December 2008 to 22 December 2009 and replies received for the period of 3 February 2009 to 
3 February 2010.  
</p>
<p>3. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters with one 
or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the allegations raised concerned 
the right to adequate housing as well as rights addressed under other mandates. 
</p>
<p>4. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of <b>49 communications</b> 
concerning the right to adequate housing to <b>32 States</b>. Of these <b>49 communications</b> transmitted, 
<b>18 replies were received from 13 Governments</b>. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur appreciates and thanks the concerned States for these replies. 
However, she regrets that several Governments have failed to respond, or when they have, have 
done so in a selective manner that does not respond to all the questions arising from the 
communication. These communications remain outstanding and the Special Rapporteur 
encourages Governments to respond to every communication, and all concerns raised in each 
communication. 
</p>
<p>6. A large number of the communications in the period under review are related to cases of 
forced evictions. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under 
exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that the in the majority of the cases, state authorities carrying out 
evictions appear completely unaware of the state&#8217;s human rights obligations, in particular the 
need for assessing the impact of evictions on individual and communities, the need to consider 
eviction only as a last resort after having envisaged all other options, meaningful consultation 
with affected communities, adequate prior notification, adequate relocation and compensation. 
The Special Rapporteur reminds all states that eviction should never result in rendering people 
homeless and putting them in a vulnerable situation. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reminds all Governments of the Basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
and displacement that can be used as a tool to prevent human rights violations in cases where 
evictions are unavoidable1.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the reports that the mandate continue to receive 
in regards to threats, harassment, and imprisonment of human rights defenders, community 
representatives and activists working on the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur believes in the importance of engaging in a constructive dialogue 
with States aimed at implementing and realizing the right to adequate housing. The 
communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have to be understood in this context. In a spirit 
of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur urges all States and other actors to respond promptly to 
the communications, to immediately take appropriate measures, to investigate allegations of the 
violation of the right to adequate housing and related rights and to take all steps necessary to 
redress the situation.  
</p>
<p>9. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply has 
been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where questions 
remain outstanding. The Special Rapporteur also invites the sources that have reported the 
alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this report, and send, when 
appropriate, follow-up information for further consideration of the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF COMMUNICATIONS SENT TO GOVERNMENTS 
      AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 16 September 2009, the Government of Bangladesh replied to a joint allegation letter 
sent on 3 April 2008, contained in report A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 paragraph 14. The Government 
informed that it was inaccurate to allege that lease and transfer of land of CHT was being done 
without approval of CHT Council. Rather, the Government formed the CHT Land Dispute 
Resolution Commission empowered to take necessary steps as per law and social customs 
prevailing locally. Furthermore, a Court of District judges was established in three Hill Districts 
to resolve disputes of civil nature. In addition, upon signature of CHT Peace Accords in 1997, 
200 army camps were withdrawn from rural areas of CHT. Concerning Khagrachari Hill District, 
the Government informed that it was inaccurate to say that about 4.500 acres of land had been 
taken away from Jumana communities. Rather, they informed that different disputes relating to 
land were prevailing amongst indigenous and settlers and that no incident existed in which 
support from the army or local administration had been provided. With regards to Bandarban 
Hill Distrcit, the Government informed that according to the CHT Peace Accords, one army 
garrison was to be located in Ruma Upazilla of Bandarban, which entailed the acquisition of land 
</p>
<p>                                                 
1 The Basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement are contained in report 
A/HRC/4/18. See also the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s web page on forced eviction:

measuring 7570 acres. 266 families were living in 899 acres of private land in this area and have 
been sustaining meetings with the local army commander with a view to reach an amicable 
solution. The inhabitants were agreeable to leave their residence if due compensation and 
alternative residential accommodation were provided by the Government. According to the 
information, there was no incident of land acquisition or posing possession of land by indigenous 
people found in the Bandarban District, except for the case of the Garrison at Ruma Upazila. 
Regarding this land, the owners have not lodged any complaints to the authority.  
</p>
<p><b>Brazil 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 14 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Brazil inquiring about the reported forced eviction in the area of Curitiba, Goiania, Rio de 
Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo. According to the information received a significant segment of the 
population of Brazil lives in unplanned and unserviced settlements. In S&#227;o Paulo, urban reforms 
aimed at beautification in down town areas led to the displacement of hundreds poor urban 
dwellers to the peripheries. The majority of evictions were executed pursuant to judicial orders, 
in re-possession actions, or in ownership disputes and/or demands. However, these decisions 
reportedly ignored the international and constitutional framework that guarantees the right to 
housing. Since 15 July 2009, about 480 families have been threatened with eviction from an area 
named Favela do Sapo. The families were not offered adequate alternative housing. On 16 June 
2009, over 400 families were allegedly forcibly evicted from a government building and more 
than 200 families were encamped in extremely precarious conditions in an enclosed space under 
a viaduct in the centre of S&#227;o Paulo. They were not provided with adequate alternative housing 
by the authorities. The occupants were served with an eviction order but were not given adequate 
notice and there was no consultation or attempts to identify alternatives to the eviction. On 16 
February 2009, 250 families were evicted from the area of Parque Cocaia I, Graja&#250;, and received 
a compensation of USD 4,000 each. They received only 10-day notice from the City Hall and the 
State Government of S&#227;o Paulo. The project affects more than two thousand families living in 80 
communities, who shall be evicted by 2012. On 11 February 2009, 35 families were evicted from 
the building Merc&#250;rio. The families were not offered an adequate alternative housing solution. 
Since December 2008, other families living in the 144 apartments were obliged to leave the 
building and to accept a compensation of USD 1,200. Most of the families were still looking for 
alternative accommodation. About 80.000 people have been living in the community named 
Paraisopolis, located in the south of S&#227;o Paulo. Since 2005, when the urbanization process 
started, many families have been threatened or removed from this area without being offered an 
adequate alternative solution. The Municipal Law 13.430/02 approved the urbanization of the 
area and the municipality offered US 3.647,00 to the inhabitants to move, which did not allow 
them to find alternative adequate housing. In Curitiba, 1.000 families (approximately 6.000 
persons) were allegedly forcibly evicted from a private urban area named Fazendinha, following 
a judicial order, on October 2008. The forced eviction was violently implemented by 1000 
military police who used bombs and rubber bullets against the community, including children. 
More than fifteen people were injured; no alternative accommodation was offered to the 
families. On 31 October the Municipality of Curitiba filled an injunction with the local court to 
evict the remaining families from the sidewalk. In Goiania, in February 2005, four thousand 
families were forcibly evicted from the Sonho Real settlement, located in a private area at Parque 
Oeste of Goiania. In the course of implementing the evictions, two people were shot to death, </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
hundreds were injured and 800 hundred were arrested. After the eviction, the State Government 
lodged the families in Setor Graja&#250;. The area lacked public facilities, access to infrastructure 
services, and is located far away from their jobs. Finally, in Rio de Janeiro, the Government 
decided to build walls around a number of slums in order to limit their uncontrolled growth. The 
construction of the wall is expected to cause the displacement of hundreds of families. In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on what alternative solutions other than forced eviction were 
considered in the targeted settlements; whether the affected communities and their 
representatives had been appropriately consulted; on the exact dates for the allegedly planned 
evictions; on the legal basis and reasons for the alleged forced evictions; on the measures taken 
to ensure that the allegedly forced evictions were in accordance with Brazil&#8217;s obligations under 
international human rights law; on the situation of the evictees; and on whether there had been 
any complaint lodged concerning the alleged forced evictions and the allegedly excessive use of 
force. 
</p>
<p><b>Observation 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to this communication.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 14 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms or racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government 
of Bulgaria inquiring about the reported forced eviction and housing demolition of 40 Romani 
households in the Gorno Ezerovo district of Bourgas, as well as the threatened forced eviction of 
many others from Gomo Ezerovo and the Meden Rudnik community, also situated in Bourgas. 
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur, the Regional Agency for the 
Control of Unlawful Building has issued eviction orders against the communities of Gorno 
Ezerovo and Meden Rudnik in the Municipality of Bourgas, Bulgaria. The eviction orders cite 
Art. 225, para 1 of the Territory Law which allows for demolition of housing built without the 
proper permits. It has been reported that the eviction orders were intended to remedy a property 
rights claim by private individuals over the land on which these long-standing communities 
reside. In the Gomo Ezerovo community, 52 Romani households received eviction orders in 
</p><p>2007. On 8 September 2009, Bourgas municipal authorities forcibly evicted 27 Romani 
households and demolished their houses. The demolitions were carried out with the assistance of 
the local police. In the Meden Rudnik community, approximately 32 houses out of 300 were 
allegedly under imminent threat of forced eviction, after originally receiving eviction orders in 
2007. According to allegations, no meaningful consultation has taken place with the 
communities prior to the evictions and none of the affected families have been offered 
alternative housing. The Gorno Ezerovo and the Meden Rudnik communities are settlements 
inhabited by impoverished Roma citizens of Bulgaria. Both communities have been in existence 
for over 50 years. During this time, the communities were reportedly recognized by public 
authorities, including being provided with individual mail service and publically regulated 
services such as water, sanitation and electricity. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
page 8 
 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether any 
complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; on the legal basis for the 
evictions and housing demolitions; on what measures have been taken to ensure that evictions 
are in accordance with Bugaria&#8217;s obligations under international law; on whether the affected 
community and its representatives been appropriately consulted; on whether the affected 
populations were given adequate and reasonable prior notifications before the evictions and 
housing demolitions as well as adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their belongings before 
the destruction of their residences; on whether the affected persons were offered compensation or 
alternative housing for the loss of their houses and livelihood; and on what measures have been 
foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the housing demolition, do not become homeless 
as well as in terms of relocation.  
</p>
<p><b>Observation 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to this communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 20 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia inquiring about the alleged housing demolition and forced eviction of 
about 60 families living in the Reak Reay community, located in Group 46A in Phum 8, Sangkat 
Tonle Bassac, Kham Chamkarmon in Phnom Penh. According to the information received the 
families concerned had been residing in this location since the 1990s, and they had possession 
rights under national law. Since 2005, two companies - Bassac Garden City and Canadia Bank - 
had been disputing this land to the Reak Reavy community, with the intention to transform it in a 
high residential area. Out of the 200 families who lived in Reak Reay at the beginning of the 
dispute, by March 2009 only 60 families were living in the area, allegedly as a result of previous 
eviction attempts and intimidation. In July 2007, the Municipality of Phnom Penh ordered the 
community to leave the &#8216;company land&#8217;. In November 2007, the community was again ordered 
to leave the land and to relocate to a site in Trapeang Anh Chanh in Khan Dangkhor, without 
being offered any financial compensation. The community refused to be relocated to Trapeang 
Anh Chanh. On 30 January 2009, the Council of Ministers issued Notice No. 157 informing the 
community that they had a choice either to be relocated to Damnak Trayeung site and be 
compensated up to 10,000 USD (9,000 USD from Canadia Bank and 1,000 USD from the 
Municipality of Phnom Penh) or stay on-site, during the proposed upgrading of the site through 
the construction of apartment blocks. Since receipt of the notice, the families concerned have 
indicated that they would prefer the onsite upgrading option. At the beginning of March 2009, 
and despite of Notice No. 157, construction workers allegedly began to build a fence around the 
community&#8217;s houses and to demolish some houses. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the legal 
basis for the housing demolitions and fencing; on whether appropriate consultation took place 
with the communities and affected persons, particularly after the issuance of Notice Number 157 
and since the housing demolition started on 15 March; on whether the community and affected 
persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before the housing demolition; on 
whether the affected persons were given adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
belongings before the destruction of their residences as well as offered compensation for the loss 
of their houses and livelihood; on whether any complaints were lodged; on the measures 
foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the housing demolition, as well as those 
threatened to be imminently forcibly evicted, do not result homeless; and on measures 
concerning their relocation and the details of its exact location, including on the area and quality 
of land and access to public services and livelihood. 
</p>
<p>16. On 1 May 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia expressing her deep concern at the lack of response received from the 
Government to her recent letters concerning cases of alleged forced evictions in Phnom Penh as 
well as inquiring about an alleged forced eviction which might have affected between 66 to 86 
families known as Group 78 and living near Basak River in group 14 of Tonle Basak commune, 
Phnom Penh&#8217;s Chamkar Mon district. According to the information received the families 
concerned had been reportedly residing at that location since 1983 and they had strong evidence 
to show &#8220;unambiguous, non-violent, notorious to the public, continuous, and in good faith&#8221; 
possession of the property for more than five years to fulfill the possession right requirements 
under Chapter 4 of the Land Law 2001. In 2004, residents of Group 78 submitted applications 
for title of ownership of their individual piece of land but competent authorities allegedly refused 
to process them. Since 2006, residents of Group 78 had received six eviction notices. Allegedly, 
none was issued or complemented by an order from a Court, as required under Article 35 of the 
Land Law. The last administrative notice was issued on 20 April by the Phnom Penh 
Municipality (MPP). Reportedly, in the notice the Municipality was calling on the people to 
negotiate with MPP and accept &#8216;the offers&#8217; within 15 days. It is also said that in case of refusal, 
MPP would implement &#8216;administrative measures&#8217;. The notice did not identify any relocation site. 
The resident of Group 78 requested an injunction order to stop the eviction but the Municipal 
Court responded that it would hold an investigation trial on a date subsequent to the eviction. 
While in the past the Municipality referred to the land as a land owned by the State, in the 20 
April notice it is said that the Group 78 residents are living on land belonging to Sour Srun 
Company. Group 78 residents have never been presented with any evidence of Sour Srun&#8217;s 
alleged ownership of the land. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the legal basis for the 20 
April administrative notice and if it was complemented by any order from a Court; on the reason 
for which the eviction should take place; on whether the competent authorities started any 
investigation concerning the refusal by the Tonle Bassac commune authorities to process the 
Group of 78 applications for title of ownership of their individual piece of land, in accordance 
with Article 30 of Land Law; on any consultation with the persons threatened with imminent 
eviction; on the measures foreseen to ensure that the persons threatened with imminent eviction, 
will not become homeless and in terms of relocation and the details on its exact location, 
including details on the area and quality of land, access to public services and livelihood sources; 
and on measures foreseen in terms of compensation for the persons affected. 
</p>
<p>17. On 15 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the right 
of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the alleged eviction of families affected by and living with HIV from the &#8216;green 
shed&#8217; location (as it was commonly known) in the Borei Keila community in Phnom Penh to the 
relocation site of Toul Sambor, Dangkor district. According to the information received, due to 
the particular status of Borei Keila (recognized as a &#8220;social land concession&#8221; in 2003) an 
agreement was stipulated in 2003 between a private developer, the Municipality of Phnom Penh </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
page 10 
 
and the residents of Borei Keila. Reportedly, it was decided that 2,6 hectares of this land would 
be given to the private developer in exchange of the construction of new housing for the original 
residents (over 1,700 families). By virtue of this agreement, which also recognized the eligibility 
of long-term renters to flats, a number of families living with HIV and residing in Borei Keila 
were reportedly eligible for flats. In March 2007, 31 families living with HIV were reportedly 
resettled in temporary metal shelters &#8211; the &#8216;green shed&#8217; - to make way for the construction of the 
new residential buildings. Following requests by families for some support, the Municipality 
allegedly offered all 31 families living in the green shed a plot of land in Toul Sambor. In May 
2009, 12 families among the 31 families were nonetheless called for an interview by the local 
screening committee. 11 families were ultimately found eligible for a flat in situ. On 18 June 
2009, law enforcement officials reportedly evicted 20 families affected by and living with HIV 
from their homes in the green shed. On 21 June, the remaining 11 HIV families from Borei Keila 
community &#8211;the ones deemed eligible for new flats at Borei Keila- were also allegedly evicted. 
Reportedly, the Municipality was also planning to relocate to Toul Sambor, another 24 families 
living elsewhere in Borei Keila, and also affected by or living with HIV. The families relocated 
at Toul Sambor have no adequate housing and limited access to basic services, such as clean 
drinking water, primary health care and antiretrovirals treatment. It was also alleged that 
relocation has resulted in families losing their employment. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the  
measures taken, and what health services provided to ensure that those people in Toul Sambor 
living with HIV have access to primary health care at an affordable cost, and are guaranteed 
immediate, uninterrupted, long-term access to ARVs; on the measures taken to improve the 
housing infrastructure in Toul Sambor in order to guarantee adequate housing to the families; on 
the measures taken to provide the families relocated from Borei Keila to Toul Sambo with flats 
similar of those of families living in the buildings next to them; on the measures taken to ensure 
that families living with HIV were not stigmatized and discriminated against at Toul Sambor; on 
the reasons why the evicted families have allegedly not been considered eligible for flats in the 
new buildings currently under construction at Borei Keila; if the families could participate in an 
adequate screening process, as all other inhabitants of Borei Keila; and on the situation of the 
remaining eleven families living with HIV and if they had been given written confirmation of the 
date and location of their respective flats. 
</p>
<p>18. On 27 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable of physical and mental health, sent 
an allegation letter to the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia concerning additional 
information received with respect to the alleged eviction of families affected by and living with 
HIV from the &#8216;green shed&#8217; location  in the Borei Keila community in Phnom Penh. According to 
the information received, another 20 families living in Borei Keila, and also affected by or living 
with HIV had been evicted to Toul Sambor on 23 July 2009. Previous concerns raised with the 
Government regarding the living conditions and access to health services for the families in the 
Tuol Sambor settlement reportedly had not been addressed, and the limited health care access 
and sub-optimal conditions persisted. The relocation of the 20 additional families on 23 July 
might have further hindered efforts to improve the housing conditions of the families evicted on 
18 June and reinforced the perception that those sheds in Toul Sambor are used as an HIV 
colony. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested further information on the measures taken for people in Toul Sambor in 
regards to the lack of adequate sanitation, drinking water, nutrition and the heat of the buildings, </p>

as well as to improve the housing infrastructure; on the measures taken to prevent eviction and 
discrimination of more families from Borei Keila on the basis of HIV status; and on the 
measures taken to ensure that families living with HIV were not stigmatized and discriminated 
against. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses received 
</b></p>
<p>19. On 30 June 2009, the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia replied to the urgent 
appeal sent on 20 March 2009 (see para. 15). The Government informed that upon the receipt of 
the letter of the Council of Minister (letter no 157 dated 30 January 2009), the Municipality 
addressed the cases above in cooperation with the Garden Bassac City through a mutual 
resolution. As a result, the majority of the residents involved in the cases voluntarily agreed to 
the MPP's solution by accepting the offers for the resettlement at other places. Only 50 families 
remained in their place. For those 50 families, the Garden Bassac City agreed with the 
community to develop a project of building a multi-storey building at the site to be reserved for 
their relocation as an exchange of ownership. The Garden Bassac City provided the residents 
with temporary shelters nearby, while the construction of the project takes place. No measures 
were taken by the competent authorities, including the Garden Bassac City, to affect or hamper 
the interest of the community of 50 families in connection with their temporary lodging and 
resettlement. The Phnom Penh Municipality and the Garden of Bassac City remained committed 
to coordinate with the community in order to address their request through a peaceful resolution. 
</p>
<p>20. On 16 July 2009, the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia sent a reply to the urgent 
appeal sent on 1 May 2009 (see para. 16) in which it transmitted the responses from the 
Municipality Office of Phnom Penh. The Government informed that initially only 10 families 
have illegally resided in Group 78, but the figure subsequently reached 172. Since the 
Municipality had not been able to identify new settlements for them, the status quo was then 
prolonged. The Government insisted that this did not imply the recognition of their legal 
settlement since one part of the disputed land belonged to the Sour Srun's company and the other 
part was a public area where a road was planned to be built. In an attempt to avoid legal actions 
against the residents of Group 78 (village 14), the Phnom Penh Municipality together with the 
Sour Srun's company sought a solution of compromise with the residents. The Municipality 
addressed the concern of the residents. As a result, over 50% of the Group 78 families reportedly 
accepted the offer. The Municipality issued an ultimate notice encouraging the remaining 86 
families to accept the offer, which some accepted and others did not.  The remaining 86 families 
(G78) had fully exercised their rights to resolve the dispute either through a legal process or by 
other means of settlement. In this connection, the residents lodged a complaint to the court 
requesting it to nullify the Phnom Penh municipality's administrative notice. In response to the 
questions of the special Rapporteur, the government informed that the families were not a party 
entitled with legal rights to occupy the land. It also stated that the issuance of the Phnom Penh 
Municipality's administrative notice No 19 (notification act) was based on the national Law and 
that the parties to the conflict were entitled to file a complaint to courts. With regards to the 
reasons for the eviction, the Government insisted on them not being evictions but relocations of 
residents and that, as of early 2009, 41 poor communities had been provided through an 
arrangement of distribution of 255 hectares of land. Concerning consultations with the persons 
threatened, the government informed that they were still in the process of negotiation and 
resolution of a compromise with the families through the work of task forces and local 
authorities that had been established to find mutually acceptable solutions. Regarding the </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
page 12 
 
possession rights of Group 78 residents, it was stated that the families were not entitled to the 
possession of land in accordance with the Land Law of 2001. As of relocation, the Government 
informed that families were allowed to select from a number of comprehensive relocation 
options.

<p>22. Le 2 fevrier 2009, la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale sur le droit au logement a adress&#233; une lettre 
d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement en r&#233;ponse &#224; la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation du 18 septembre 2008 relative &#224; 
des cas d&#8217;expulsions forc&#233;es dans le quartier Ntaba-Nlongkak, dans la Commune de Yaound&#233; 
1er., pour partager avec les autorit&#233;s certaines r&#233;flexions et commentaires en lien avec cette 
r&#233;ponse. D&#8217;apr&#232;s quelques allusions au caract&#232;re universel et inali&#233;nable du droit au logement 
par des trait&#233;s internationaux, elle a apport&#233; des commentaires plus pr&#233;cis sur la r&#233;ponse des 
autorit&#233;s camerounaises en lien avec les &#233;victions &#224; Yaound&#233;. En premier lieu, la Rapporteuse a 
adress&#233; la question des &#233;tudes d&#8217;impact pr&#233;alables et projets alternatifs &#224; l&#8217;expulsion (question 1 
de sa premi&#232;re lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation). Selon la r&#233;ponse des autorit&#233;s, l&#8217;&#233;tude a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;e par la 
Communaut&#233; Urbaine de Yaound&#233;, et a observ&#233; que les pancartes informant de l&#8217;ill&#233;galit&#233; 
d&#8217;occupation du quartier n&#8217;avait pas eu d&#8217;effet dissuasif sur les habitants. N&#233;anmoins, selon la 
Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale, il semblerait que l&#8217;&#233;tude men&#233;e a &#233;t&#233; insuffisante pour &#233;valuer les 
cons&#233;quences des expulsions sur les habitants du quartier Ntaba-Nlongkak. L&#8217;&#233;tude pr&#233;alable &#224; 
l&#8217;expulsion devrait d&#8217;ailleurs, permettre au Gouvernement d&#8217;&#233;valuer la capacit&#233; des habitants &#224; 
acc&#233;der &#224; un nouveau logement et, en fonction, allouer les ressources n&#233;cessaires pour r&#233;pondre 
aux besoins des habitants expuls&#233;s. Deuxi&#232;mement, concernant la r&#233;ponse &#224; la question 2 de la 
premi&#232;re lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation, aucune information sur d&#8217;&#233;ventuelles consultations avec les 
r&#233;sidents du quartier avant les expulsions n'&#233;tait fournie. De plus, il semblerait qu&#8217;aucunes 
alternatives aux expulsions n&#8217;auraient &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233;es. Dans le cas o&#249; il serait impossible de 
parvenir &#224; un accord entre les parties concern&#233;es sur une solution de remplacement, la 
Rapporteuse faisait r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; un organe ind&#233;pendant ayant une autorit&#233; constitutionnelle, tel 
qu&#8217;une cour de justice, un tribunal ou un ombudsman, qui devrait &#234;tre charg&#233; de la m&#233;diation, de 
l&#8217;arbitrage ou de la d&#233;cision, selon les besoins. La Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale prenait note aussi des 
indications apport&#233;es en r&#233;ponse &#224; la question 3 concernant les moyens de notification des 
expulsions aux habitants du quartier, et elle aurait souhait&#233; recevoir une copie de la notification 
adress&#233;e aux habitants concern&#233;s. En r&#233;f&#233;rence aux moyens de recours disponibles au Cameroun, 
la Rapporteuse a not&#233; avec satisfaction l'existence d'une assistance judiciaire pour les personnes 
d&#233;munies. N&#233;anmoins, elle a aussi d&#233;pos&#233; que les autorit&#233;s ont la charge d&#8217;informer les habitants 
de l&#8217;existence de ces moyens de recours et de leur garantir l&#8217;acc&#232;s. En outre, l&#8217;existence de ce 
m&#233;canisme n&#8217;exon&#233;rait pas le Gouvernement de son obligation de prendre des mesures 
appropri&#233;es pour faire respecter les droits de l&#8217;homme. La Rapporteuse a adress&#233; les mesures de 
relogement ou de compensation selon les indications du droit international, d'apr&#232;s la

<p>24. On 12 February 2009 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China regarding Liu Yao, lawyer in Shenzhen. According to the information 
received; in June 2008, Mr. Liu was sentenced to four years in prison by the Dongyuan County 
People&#8217;s Court for &quot;intentional destruction of properties&#8221;. The Heyuan Municipal Intermediate 
Court in Guangdong revoked the judgment for unclear facts and insufficient evidence and 
referred it back to the lower court. On 17 December 2008, the Dongyuan County People&#8217;s Court, 
reportedly without any explanation, sentenced Mr. Liu to two years imprisonment, even though 
no new facts or additional evidence were presented during the retrial. Liu Yao has appealed the 
sentence to the Heyuan Municipal Intermediate Court. Mr. Liu represented peasants in Paitou 
Village, located in Dongyuan County, Heyuan City, Guangdong Province, whose land was 
expropriated at the end of 2006 by the local government to make way for a new power station 
planned by the Fuyuan Industrial Group. In December 2007, Liu Yao went with peasants to the 
hydroelectric plant construction site to try to stop work at the construction site, which had 
continued in spite of an order issued by the State Land Bureau in Dongyuan County to halt the 
construction. A dispute ensued between the peasants and Mr. Liu on the one side and the staff of 
the Fuyuan Industrial Group on the other, which resulted in the destruction of some items at the 
construction site. On 17 January 2008, the Dongyuan County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office authorized Mr. 
Liu's arrest. The Special Rapporteur requested further information on the accuracy of the facts 
alleged, if a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim; on the details, and 
where available the results, of any investigation, judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation 
to this case; on how procedural protection and due process guarantees were applied in the case of 
the expropriated peasants in Paitou Village, located in Dongyuan County, Heyuan City, 
Guangdong Province; on the merits of the judgment adopted by the Dongyuan County People&#8217;s 
Court on 17 December 2008; and if Mr. Liu been granted appeal by the Heyuan Municipal

independencia de magistrados y abogados, el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a 
la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores

con las amenazas contra las se&#241;oras Blanca Irene L&#243;pez y Claudia Erazo y el Sr. Rigoberto

objeto de una comunicaci&#243;n de la entonces Representante Especial del Secretario General sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de derechos humanos enviada el 4 de diciembre de 2007. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida el 26 de marzo de 2009, la CJYC habr&#237;a  recibido una amenaza de muerte 
por correo electr&#243;nico enviada a Blanca Irene L&#243;pez y Claudia Erazo por el AUC Bloque Capital 
de las &#193;guilas Negras, una rama del grupo paramilitar autodenominado las &#193;guilas Negras. Este 
correo electr&#243;nico habr&#237;a sido el octavo de una serie de amenazas id&#233;nticas enviadas a la CJYC 
desde 2007. Asimismo, el 4 de febrero de 2009, habr&#237;a llegado al correo electr&#243;nico de la CJYC

<p>27. El 13 de julio de 2009, la Relatora Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n al gobierno de 
Colombia en relaci&#243;n a la demanda de inconstitucionalidad que la Sala Plena de la Honorable 
Corte Constitucional habr&#237;a considerado en contra de dos normas relativas a las viviendas de 
inter&#233;s social: el art&#237;culo 15 de la ley 388 de 1997 y el art&#237;culo 40 de la ley 3 de 1991. En este 
sentido, la Relatora Especial transmiti&#243; sus consideraciones acerca de las normas mencionadas a 
la luz del marco normativo internacional relativo al derecho a una vivienda digna. Con relaci&#243;n 
al art&#237;culo 15 de la ley 388 de 1997, la Relatora Especial consider&#243; que el problema fundamental 
con esta norma parece ser que al establecer las condiciones de precio de la vivienda de inter&#233;s 
social como el &#250;nico criterio relevante para las especificaciones o caracter&#237;sticas de loteos y 
&#225;reas construidas de urbanizaciones y construcciones, otras caracter&#237;sticas fundamentales para </p>

garantizar el derecho a una vivienda adecuada no ser&#237;an tomadas en consideraci&#243;n al momento 
de planear y construir viviendas de inter&#233;s social (VIS). Dicho art&#237;culo podr&#237;a constituir un grave 
obst&#225;culo a la realizaci&#243;n del derecho a una vivienda adecuada para los beneficiarios de las VIS 
en Colombia y podr&#237;a afectar cuatro de los atributos esenciales para garantizar una vivienda 
adecuada: la disponibilidad de servicios, materiales, facilidades e infraestructura; habitabilidad; 
lugar; y adecuaci&#243;n cultural. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, ya se ha evidenciado c&#243;mo, por 
ejemplo, la habitabilidad de las VIS ser&#237;a vulnerada por dicha Ley, y en particular por el Decreto 
2060 de 2004. Dicho Decreto, basado en el art&#237;culo 15 de la Ley 388 de 1997, establece unas 
normas relativas a las &#225;reas m&#237;nimas de tama&#241;o de lotes para la construcci&#243;n de las VIS que 
permiten espacios muy reducidos, lo que impedir&#237;a cumplir con las condiciones m&#237;nimas de 
habitabilidad interior de la vivienda. El art&#237;culo 15 de la Ley 388 podr&#237;a adem&#225;s vulnerar el 
art&#237;culo 2 p&#225;rrafo 2 del PIDESC, en virtud del cual Colombia se ha comprometido a garantizar el 
ejercicio de los derechos sin discriminaci&#243;n alguna. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la sujeci&#243;n de 
las cesiones urban&#237;sticas &#250;nicamente al criterio del precio, tiene por objetivo la viabilidad 
financiera de los proyectos de vivienda de inter&#233;s social. Aunque esta medida pueda considerarse 
una forma de discriminaci&#243;n positiva permitida en principio por el PIDESC, la misma permite 
que los beneficiarios de las VIS sean discriminados en t&#233;rminos de acceso al espacio p&#250;blico y a 
los servicios.  Con relaci&#243;n al art&#237;culo 40 de la ley 3 de 1991, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, esta 
norma otorgar&#237;a al Gobierno nacional competencias que eran anteriormente compartidas con las 
entidades territoriales en materia de regulaci&#243;n del uso del suelo, as&#237; como de regulaci&#243;n de las 
caracter&#237;sticas de las VIS. Asimismo, la norma en cuesti&#243;n permitir&#237;a tomar medidas regresivas 
en materia de derecho a una vivienda adecuada, puesto que existir&#237;an reglamentaciones, en varias 
ciudades del pa&#237;s, sobre m&#237;nimos de calidad de la vivienda de inter&#233;s social que protegen en 
mayor medida el derecho a la vivienda adecuada. La Relatora Especial consider&#243; que las normas 
arriba mencionadas podr&#237;an no ser compatibles con las obligaciones internacionales de 
Colombia, en materia de protecci&#243;n de los derechos econ&#243;micos, sociales y culturales, en 
particular el derecho a una vivienda adecuada, y solicit&#243; a la Honorable Corte Constitucional 
tener en cuenta dichas obligaciones al momento de examinar la constitucionalidad de las normas 
demandadas. Asimismo, solicit&#243; al Gobierno informaci&#243;n adicional sobre su perspectiva 
respecto de la compatibilidad de los art&#237;culos 15 de la Ley 388 de 1997 y  40 de la Ley 3 de 1991 
y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales, as&#237; como la 
jurisprudencia desarrollada por el Comit&#233; de Derechos Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales.

<p>28. El 14 de agosto de 2009, la Relatora Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n al gobierno de Colombia en relaci&#243;n con 
el supuesto desalojo forzoso del que fueron objeto 120 familias residentes en la Hacienda las 
Pavas en el municipio del Pe&#241;&#243;n, sur de Bol&#237;var. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 14 de julio de 
2009, miembros de la Polic&#237;a Nacional y del Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios habr&#237;an desalojado 
120 familias de sus casas all&#237; ubicadas. Los miembros de la Polic&#237;a habr&#237;an saqueado las 
viviendas desalojadas. El desalojo forzoso se habr&#237;a realizado a pesar de que representantes del 
Ministerio P&#250;blico presentes en el momento del desalojo se opusieron al mismo y solicitaron la 
suspensi&#243;n de la operaci&#243;n.  Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, solo 3 familias permanec&#237;an en el 
predio de la hacienda las Pavas, gracias a una decisi&#243;n judicial obtenida v&#237;a  tutela, la cual les 
reconoci&#243; su derecho de posesi&#243;n. Las restantes 120 familias, supuestamente desalojadas 
forzosamente, tambi&#233;n ser&#237;an poseedoras de buena fe de las tierras de la hacienda las Pavas en 
las que estaban ubicadas sus viviendas. Su propietario, Sr. Jes&#250;s Emilio Escobar Fern&#225;ndez, </p>

habr&#237;a abandonado el predio en 1997, momento a partir del cual las 123 familias vecinas de la 
vereda de Buenos Aires habr&#237;an iniciado actos dominativos de posesi&#243;n, incluyendo la 
explotaci&#243;n econ&#243;mica del predio y mejoras para optimizar su rendimiento agr&#237;cola. En el a&#241;o 
2008, se habr&#237;a dictado una resoluci&#243;n por parte de la Unidad Nacional de Tierras (Resoluci&#243;n 
1473 de 11 de Noviembre de 2008), en la que se habr&#237;a dispuesto iniciar las diligencias 
administrativas para declarar extinguido el dominio sobre varios predios rurales, incluyendo las 
Pavas. Dicho procedimiento se encontrar&#237;a a&#250;n en curso. Sin embargo, las sociedades Aportes 
San Isidro S.A. y C.I. Tequendama, quienes figurar&#237;an como adquirientes parciales de mejoras y 
dominio del predio desde el a&#241;o 2007, habr&#237;an iniciado una acci&#243;n policiva, la cual es el origen 
del desalojo forzoso del 14 de julio de 2009. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la decisi&#243;n de 
desalojo desconocer&#237;a la normatividad vigente en la materia, en particular, en lo referente al 
procedimiento de extinci&#243;n de dominio que est&#225; en curso. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, las 123 
familias han visto gravemente afectado su derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n desde el desalojo, puesto 
que han visto interrumpido su acceso a los medios productivos que pose&#237;an. Asimismo, las 3 
familias que permanecen en el predio estar&#237;an siendo el objeto de presiones por parte del 
apoderado de Aportes San Isidro S.A. y C.I. Tequendama. Adem&#225;s de los comentarios sobre la 
veracidad y exactitud de las alegaciones presentadas, los Relatores Especiales solicitaron mayor 
informaci&#243;n sobre base legal en que se habr&#237;a fundamentado el supuesto desalojo forzado; si se 
dio un plazo suficiente y razonable de notificaci&#243;n a las familias afectadas por el desalojo y un 
plazo suficiente para que las comunidades afectadas pudieran sacar sus bienes antes del desalojo; 
sobre las acciones tomadas para investigar el supuesto saqueo de las viviendas desalojadas por 
parte de miembros de la fuerza p&#250;blica; si se ofreci&#243; una compensaci&#243;n adecuada a los afectados 
por la perdida de sus viviendas y bienes; sobre las medidas tomadas para garantizar el derecho a 
la alimentaci&#243;n de las familias desalojadas, para garantizar que el desalojo no genere personas

alegaci&#243;n de fecha 13 de julio de 2009 (ver para. 27). Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n del Gobierno, la 
Corte Constitucional fall&#243; mediante sentencia C-351 de 20 de mayo de 2009 sobre la 
constitucionalidad de los art&#237;culos 15 de la Ley 388 de 1997 y 40 de la Ley 3 de 1991. En tal 
sentido, se inform&#243; que la Corte decidi&#243; inhibirse para pronunciarse sobre la inconstitucionalidad 
de las expresiones &#8220;de precio&#8221; y &#8220;cesiones&#8221;, contenidas en el p&#225;rrafo primero del art&#237;culo 15 de

la Corte se inhibi&#243; de emitir un fallo de fondo en relaci&#243;n con los cargos formulados contra los 
vocablos precio y cesiones en el art&#237;culo 15 de la Ley 388, por ineptitud sustantiva de la

<p>30. El 11 de enero de 2010, el Gobierno contest&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n de los Relatores datada 14 
de agosto de 2009 (ver para. 28). Respecto a la situaci&#243;n de la Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221; el Gobierno 
inform&#243; que las sociedades comerciales &#8220;Aportes San Isidro&#8221; y &#8220;Tequendama C.I.&#8221; solicitaron a 
trav&#233;s de una acci&#243;n policiva el amparo a la posesi&#243;n detentada desde el a&#241;o 2007, en calidad de 
adquirentes parciales de mejoras y dominio del predio en cuesti&#243;n. En este sentido, el Gobierno 
precis&#243; que los hechos ocurridos el d&#237;a 14 de julio de 2009 no se encuentran dentro de una 
diligencia de desalojo propiamente dicha (en raz&#243;n de que &#233;sta ocurre cuando el lugar ocupado 
es un espacio publico) sino dentro de una diligencia de lanzamiento por ocupaci&#243;n de hecho, a 
saber, un proceso a trav&#233;s del cual se pone fin a la ocupaci&#243;n arbitraria de un inmueble y se 
restituye su tenencia a favor del tenedor legitimo. El Gobierno inform&#243; que esta diligencia de 
lanzamiento tuvo como fundamento una sentencia proferida por el Juzgado Primero Promiscuo 
del municipio de Mompox. El gobierno tambi&#233;n inform&#243; que la Fiscal&#237;a 1&#176; de la Estructura de 
Apoyo (EDA) de la Unidad de Asuntos Humanitarios-Seccional Cartagena se encuentra 
adelantando la correspondiente investigaci&#243;n penal por el presunto delito de desplazamiento 
forzado del que dicen haber sido victimas ciento veinte familias y que la presente investigaci&#243;n 
se encuentra en etapa de indagaci&#243;n en averiguaci&#243;n de responsables. El gobierno tambi&#233;n 
se&#241;al&#243; que las familias presuntamente v&#237;ctimas de desalojo no habr&#237;as sido desprovistas de su 
vivienda puesto que su residencia no era la Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221; sino que esta se encuentra 
ubicada en la cabecera del corregimiento Buenos Aires, ubicado a treinta minutos de camino de 
la Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221;. El Gobierno finalmente precis&#243; que una vez recabe mayor informaci&#243;n 
sobre este caso, la remitir&#225; a los Relatores Especiales. En relaci&#243;n con las medidas tomadas para 
garantizar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las familias desalojadas, el Gobierno inform&#243; que el 
Gobierno est&#225; adelantando las gestiones pertinentes con la Entidad competente a fin de brindar 
informaci&#243;n completa sobre el particular. En este sentido, el Gobierno solicit&#243; una prorroga de

<p>32. Le 1 mai 2009, la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale sur le droit au logement a adress&#233; une lettre 
d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement au sujet d&#8217;expulsions forc&#233;es et de destructions d'habitations dans 
la commune de Kasa Vubu &#224; Kinshasa. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, entre le 14 et le 18 mars 
2009, la police a proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l'expulsion de 315 familles de leur logement dans la commune de 
Kasa Vubu en vue de leur d&#233;molition imm&#233;diate, suite &#224; une d&#233;cision d'expropriation &#233;manant du

datant du 25 novembre 2008, et aucune d'entre elles n'aurait dispos&#233; d'un d&#233;lai n&#233;cessaire pour

signature de l'arr&#234;t d'expulsion. Suite &#224; l'expulsion, nombreuses familles &#233;taient r&#233;fugi&#233;es dans 
une cath&#233;drale et d'autres chez des parents, mais la majorit&#233; s&#8217;aurait retrouv&#233; &#224; la rue. Il apparait

<p>34. On 19 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to food, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Independent Expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights sent a joint allegation letter to the 
Government of Ghana regarding the potential impacts that the establishment of an open pit gold 
mine in Akyem, more precisely within the Ajenua-Bepo Forest Reserve in the Birim North 
District of Ghana's Eastern Region, may have on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights of the affected communities. According to the information received, permits for the mine 
in Akyem have already been issued. Reportedly, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) is a 
branch of the US-based Newmont Mining Corporation, one of the biggest gold mining 
companies worldwide. In 2006, Newmont Mining Coporation's application to exploit the Akyem 
site was reportedly turned down by the Environmental Protection Agency, which expressed 
concern about the serious impact that mine's rock dump waste could have on the biodiversity of 
the forest. Despite this, in early 2009 the Ministry of Mines, Land and Forestry's reportedly 
granted a permit to the NGGL. According to the information, despite a decision to postpone the 
commencement of works in February 2009, NGGL was planning to start operating.  The 
allegations received claim that, in addition to considerable environmental damage within the </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
forest reserve the project could have severe impacts on the livelihood of an estimated 7,900 to 
10,000 people. Up to 1,500 persons, most of them small-scale farmers, may be evicted and no 
plans were developed either by the company or the authorities to do so in a fair and equitable 
manner. According to information received, farmers who would not be provided with alternative 
land on which to resume their agricultural activities and would not receive adequate 
compensation. Moreover, by losing access to the forest reserve for hunting and fruit picking, the 
local communities would lose a significant part of their food supplies. Reports also indicate that 
dust generated by the exploitation of the mine may affect the production of crops and that the 
digging of pits and dams, and their subsequent exploitation, were expected to have severe impact 
on the access of the local population to water from rivers and streams. Moreover, the 
environmental impact assessment was allegedly not carried out in conformity with international 
standards, and that local communities were not adequately involved in the decision-making 
process affecting them. There are allegations that during 2008, NGGL may have fraudulently 
enticed local village elders into acquiescing to the projects by paying them large amounts of 
money. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested further information on whether any study on social, environmental and 
health impact of the open mine project was realized; on the measures taken to ensure that the 
open mine project does not have disproportionate negative impacts on the environment and on 
the livelihoods of neighboring communities; on the measures taken to ensure that water 
resources will be protected from risks of leakages, and to ensure that mining wastes will be 
disposed of appropriately;  if the concerned communities were allowed to participate in the 
planning to open the mine; if the land subject to expropriation were duly evaluated; if measures 
of compensation were put in place for all concerned persons, with a due assessment of the loss of 
their farming activity; on the measures taken to ensure that those who may lose their land are 
offered alternative sustainable means to access sufficient and adequate food; if there was any 
consultation with the persons threatened with eviction; on the measures foreseen to ensure that 
the persons threatened with eviction will not become homeless; and on the measures foreseen in 
terms of relocation.

<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>35. On 14 August 2009 and 25 August 2009, the Government of Ghana replied to the joint 
allegation letter of 19 June 2009 (see para. 34). The Government informed that the company 
carried out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental Impact Statement 
which were accepted and led to the issuance of an Environmental Permit to the Company. The 
Company was also required to prepare and submit an Environmental Management Plan within 
eighteen months after commencement of mining operations for approval and thereafter every 
three years. The conclusions of the studies stated that the company followed the EIA process; 
that appropriate consultations were held with the public and with government institution; that 
mitigation actions had been identified to address the significant impacts; that the most substantial 
long-term environmental effect of the project would be the presence of an open pit and the 
company proposed to place waste rock in the open pit to fill approximately half of this void; that 
the company has been active in continuing dialogue with project-affected people since 2003; and 
that the broader impact of the project is anticipated to be beneficial to the economy of the local 
area. With regards to the disproportionate negative impacts on the environment and livelihood of 
neighboring communities, according to the information received, to ensure judicious exploitation 
of the mineral resources in the production forest reserves, the Government of Ghana produced 
the Environmental Guidelines for Mining in Production Forest Reserves, which recommend the </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1

establishment of a Liaison Group to evaluate Environmental Impact Statements of projects 
located in forest reserves and also monitor and enforce environmental compliance. With regards 
to measures to ensure that water resources will be protected from risks of leakages and that 
mining wastes will be disposed of appropriately, the government informed that a combination of 
under-drain piping network, collection basin, and pump-back systems was established to collect 
seepages. Regarding community participation, the affected people had been adequately informed 
and were aware of the project. A number of stakeholder consultations were held with community 
engagement. With regards to compensation, affected persons are considered eligible for 
resettlement assistance and a broad range of compensation and assistance was proposed by the 
company. The company will also implement a range of programs to assist affected population to 
continue engaging in agricultural activities and to provide training opportunities and businesses 
when no land is available. As of relocation, an estimated 242 households and 25 businesses 
would be physically displaced by the project. In addition to the compensation measures stated 
above, the company has reportedly developed a Guide to Land Acquisition and Compensation 
for its project development activities. The EPA has also requested the Company to submit a 
Resettlement Action Plan containing the specific commitments, procedures and actions which 
would be taken to resettle and compensate people. Finally, the company conducted a Health 
Impact Assessment to identify the activities associated with the operation, which may affect 
community health and safety as wwell as to record baseline conditions associated with individual 
health, health trends, infrastructure and health care capacity in the area.

<p>36. On 27 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
India concerning forced evictions in the areas of Davidpuram, Kalvaikarai, Pumping Station and 
Samidosspuram, in the city of Chennai, State of Tamil Nadu, India. According to information 
received, on 13 February 2009, the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board ordered the clearance of 
the four above-mentioned sites, where nearly 9000 families were residing. The families had 
reportedly been settled in these areas for more than 50 years and were in possession of various 
documents. The decision on the eviction from the four areas was preceded by dweller complaints 
about their poor access to drinking water. During the trial, the Water Board Department 
reportedly declared that since the water pipe lines had been laid under the slum areas, the only 
solution was to clear out the area. The Chennai High Court ordered the relocation of all slum 
dwellers in alternative locations by 13 February 2009. Relocation was reportedly offered only to 
families having a ration card. The slum dwellers were mostly Dalit and minority communities. In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur 
requested further information on weather measures of consultation and dialogue were taken 
between the tenants of Davidpuram, Kalvaikarai, Pumping Station and Samidosspuram areas and 
the public authorities; on information on what alternative solutions were considered by the Water 
Board Department of Tamil Nadu &#8211; before the decision to resort to evictions was taken and if 
relocation sites within the limits of the city of Chennai were considered; on compensation 
provided to those evicted; on the measures taken to protect the more vulnerable groups, 
including women and children; and on the legal process which opposed slum dwellers to the 
Water Board Department and on whether legal assistance and information about their rights was 
provided to slum dwellers. </p>

37. On 20 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
India regarding alleged forced evictions in the area of Netaji Nagar Basti, Ghatkopar, in the city 
of Mumbai, State of Maharashtra. According to the information received, on 28 May 2009, 
officials of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai carried out the eviction of 
approximately 250 families in the above-mentioned site, with the assistance of the Pant Nagar 
Police. The police reportedly used violent means. A number of protestors reportedly remained in 
custody for one night. Reportedly, the Public Works Department of the Government of 
Maharashtra, to which the concerned land belonged, recently decided to lease 60 acres of this 
land to a private developer, M. Vimal Shah. The affected families were allegedly evicted without 
prior notice, compensation, alternative housing or adequate time to withdraw their belongings. 
Although the concerned families had reportedly no title deeds and the settlement was informal, 
the authorities allegedly neglected several requirements under national policy, particularly the 
Government of Maharashtra Slum Redevelopment and Relocation Scheme, which grants 
protection to all residents that have started living in Mumbai prior to January 1995, including in 
informal settlements. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteur requested further information on the legal basis for the alleged forced 
evictions; on the reasons for not applying the relevant policies; if any consultation took place 
with the affected families; on the measures foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the eviction 
would not result in homelessness of the affected persons; on what has been foreseen in terms of 
alternatives for those affected and if relocation sites have been designated; if compensation was 
provided to the evictees; on the measures taken to provide the evictees with effective legal 
recourse; if the affected families were given adequate prior notice before the evictions and 
adequate time to withdraw their belongings; if any complaint was lodged concerning the alleged 
forced evictions or the alleged excessive use of force by the police officers; and on the results, of 
any investigation, judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case.  
</p>
<p>38. On 9 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
India regarding<b> </b>forced evictions along the Cooum River in the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. 
According to the allegations, around 430 families living along the Cooum River in Chennai, 
Tamil Nadu, were forcibly evicted and their homes destroyed in actions starting on 13 November 
2009. The forced evictions were reportedly carried out by the Public Works Department and the 
Slum Clearance Board in order to clear land that the National Highways Authority of India 
(NHAI) plans to use to build an elevated highway. During the evictions, a force of over 200 
police officers was reportedly deployed and bulldozers demolished the huts of the families in 
question. It was alleged that the families had not been issued an appropriate advance notice of 
the eviction. Reportedly, 150 families had not been offered alternative housing and had been left 
homeless by the evictions. The relocation offered to the rest of the families was allegedly not the 
product of proper consultation processes. The housing alternatives offered were far removed 
from their places of work and educational facilities. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the legal 
basis upon which the alleged forced evictions were carried out, if any consultation was 
undertaken with the affected families; on the measures foreseen by the authorities to ensure that 
the alleged forced eviction do not result in homelessness of the affected persons; on the measures 
foreseen in terms of alternatives for those affected; if relocation sites have been designated; if 
compensation was provided to the evictees; if measures were taken to provide the evictees with 
effective legal recourse; if the affected families were given adequate prior notice and adequate 
time to withdraw their belongings before the eviction; if any complaint was lodged on the </p>

right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health and the Representative of the Secretary General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons sent a joint allegation letter concerning violations of the right to health, the 
right to adequate housing, and other human rights of victims of the ongoing mudflow disaster in 
Sidoarjo, Indonesia. According to the information received, in the aftermath of a gas eruption at 
a drilling site operated by PT Lapindo Brantas on 28 May 2006, at least 60&#8217;000 people lost their 
homes. Many of the currently estimated 15&#8217;000 affected households were victims of the first 
mudflow in May 2006 and of the break of a dam built to retain the mudflow, in March 2009. 
According to information received, 573 families have sought refuge in Pasar Porong, where they 
were either housed in small windowless shops or in open halls. Essential services have been 
reportedly discontinued. This resulted in forced second relocations. The mudflow allegedly led 
to large-scale pollution of the ground water and the air. According to information received, a 
compensation scheme to the benefit of those affected by the initial mudflow of May 2006 was 
ordered by Presidential decree in 2007. People from the submerged area holding valid property 
documents were deemed eligible for compensation from PT Lapindo Brantas. However, this 
scheme reportedly had yet to be fully implemented. A second decree, issued in 2008 after a dam 
break submerged three villages, allegedly faced similar difficulties in its implementation. In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on the steps taken in the interim to improve the health and living 
conditions of the affected persons; on the steps taken to improve the safety and security of those 
persons living in areas, and whether a monitoring and early warning system was set up; on the 
steps taken in the long term to ensure permanent relocation and alternative livelihood for 
displaced persons; on the measures put in place as alternatives to the dumping of mud in the 
River Porong; on the measures taken to ensure that the compensation schemes for displaced 
people, ordered by Presidential decrees, are realized to their full potential; and if similar </p>

compensation schemes were foreseen for mudflow victims of areas not covered by existing 
schemes.

<p>42. On 14 august 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Independent Expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and the Special 
Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment on human rights sent a joint allegation letter to the 
Government of Indonesia regarding the potential impacts that gold and copper mining activities 
in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, may have on the enjoyment of the right human 
rights of Lembata communities. According to the information received, in 2005 the Indonesian 
mining company PT Merukh Lembata Copper was permitted by the local government to carry 
out exploration activities for gold and copper on Lembata. The company reportedly holds 
exploration rights for at least two thirds of the island. This planned mining project would concern 
as much as 75% of the entire island, and would result in the forced eviction of at least 60,000 
local people. Reportedly, the local government has not shared any information concerning a 
possible relocation plan.  Reportedly, the agreement between the local Regent and PT Merukh 
Lembata Copper was signed without any discussion or consultation with the concerned 
communities. In order to gain people&#8217;s agreement after the contract signing, the Regent of 
Lambata reportedly resorted to ambiguous means. Reportedly, no environmental impact 
assessment was carried out in conformity with international standards and local communities 
were not adequately involved in the decision-making process affecting them. In addition to 
comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested 
further information on whether a study on social, environmental and health impact of the open 
mine project was realized; on the measures taken to ensure that the mining project does not have 
disproportionate negative impacts on the environment and on the livelihoods of neighboring 
communities; if the concerned communities were allowed to participate in decision-making; if 
measures of compensation were put in place; on the measures taken to ensure that those who

of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government of Israel inquiring about the on-going demolitions of houses and 
forced evictions carried out by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the West Bank, specifically in 
East Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley. According to the information received on 4 June 2009, the </p>

IDF reportedly destroyed the houses of 18 Palestinian families in the hamlet of Ras al-Ahmar in 
the Jordan Valley. It is also reported that the Israeli military forces demolished animal pens and 
confiscated the water storage tank. In all, 128 people were reportedly displaced. In the nearby 
hamlet of Hadidiya, 5 families were under threat of imminently forced eviction, while 12 other 
were fighting eviction and demolition orders before an Israeli military court. In this case more 
than 150 people, most of them children, risked being evicted. Concerning East Jerusalem, on 11 
June, residents of 20 homes in the Bustan neighbourhood of Silwan received demolition orders. 
More than 1,000 Palestinians reportedly risked losing their homes. On 10 June, the residents of a 
four storey building in Al Abbasiya were reportedly ordered to report to the Jerusalem 
municipality for building without the requisite building permits. A demolition order was also 
allegedly issued on a five storey building with 13 apartments (where 95 people reside) in Beit 
Hanina. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested further information on the grounds for the demolitions and evictions; on 
the legal framework governing these decisions; if the affected persons were given adequate prior 
notice; if the affected persons were given adequate time to withdraw their belongings before the 
demolition; on the measures foreseen to ensure that the affected persons will not become

<p>46. On 23 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issue sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Italy regarding alleged evictions 
in Milan. According to allegations, on 31 March 2009 a community of about 140 Roma people 
living under the overpass Bacula in the north of the city of Milano was evicted. The community 
was living in an &#8220;unauthorized camp&#8221; in extremely precarious conditions, without any basic 
infrastructure. It was informed that the majority of the evictees had been previously evicted from 
other locations in the city. Reportedly, the community was not notified prior to the eviction and 
no adequate alternatives have been offered. While about five families were given temporary 
shelter at the &#8220;Casa della carit&#224;&#8221;, the fate of the other evictees was unknown. Reports indicate 
that since the signing on 19 May 2007 of the Milan &#8220;Pact for Security&#8221; seven evictions of Roma 
communities have been carried out in Milan. Allegedly, because of the nature of the camps -even 
some of the &#8220;authorized camps&#8221;- Roma immigrants are often denied local resident permits. In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on the legal basis for the eviction; on any consultation undertaken 
with those affected; on measures foreseen to ensure that the eviction does not result in 
homelessness of the affected persons; if measures were adopted in terms of relocation; on any 
assistance, financial or otherwise provided in relation to the evictions; on the situation of the 
families affected by the eviction; if the affected persons were given a prior notice before the </p>

the eviction; and on the measures taken to upgrade housing and accommodations of Roma 
people in camps and to guarantee their right to adequate housing .

<p><b>Response received

<p>47. On 1 July 2009, the Government of Italy replied to the urgent appeal sent on 23 April 
</p><p>2009. The Government informed that the camp where the Roma community was living belonged 
to the Municipality of Milan and it was very unsafe due to the normal passage of trains. It was 
deemed necessary to remove the people living there to protect the members of the community 
and the railway infrastructure. The removal of the Roma community was carried out in full 
compliance with the Italian Criminal Code, according to which illegal occupation of land or 
buildings, whether public or private, constitutes an offence and punishable by law. The removal 
did not require any previous communication or administrative procedure since it had the purpose 
to address a dangerous and degrading situation and to curb a criminal behaviour. On the day of 
the evictions, the community was composed of 90 EU citizens from Romania without regular 
Italian residence permit. They were all given the possibility and the time to collect their personal 
belongings before being removed. With regard to the housing alternatives foreseen, the 
Municipality of Milan offered temporary accommodation in Municipality centres and women 
and children were offered accommodation in reception centres. However, only few members of 
the community accepted the offer.

<p>48. On 3 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Keny regarding alleged forced evictions in Githogoro village in Nairobi. According to the 
information received, approximately 3.000 people from about 100 households were forcibly on 
22 July. Allegedly, the police gave them 72 hours to dismantle their homes, before the bulldozers 
moved in. The evictions appear to have been carried out as a part of the Government&#8217;s plans to 
build a new road. Some of the evictees have reportedly left the settlement to look for alternative 
accommodation, and others are camped next to the settlement. However, a many of them stayed 
in the rubble of their former homes and were sleeping in the open. In addition to comments on 
the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information 
on the legal basis for the forced eviction; if alternatives to the demolition were considered and if 
residents were consulted at any stage; if the affected persons were given adequate prior notice of

<p>50. On 1 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint allegation letter regarding 
violent forced evictions and death of protestors as a consequence in Yongsan, Republic of Korea. 
According to the information received, on 20 January 2009 in Zone 4, in Yongsan, a district of 
Seoul, five protestors were killed during a protest against forced eviction and the police 
crackdown to stop it. These events resulted from the implementation of an urban redevelopment 
project which had led to alleged massive forced evictions with no plan for resettlement. Yongsan 
was designated as a redevelopment project area in 2006. The families residing there only found 
out about it at the end of 2007 and one month before the eviction took place. The tenants had no 
opportunities to challenge the authorities&#8217; decision, to file a legal complaint, to present 
alternative proposals, or to articulate their demands. It is reported that previous to April 2008, 
construction workers were stationed at Yongsan, and harassed people in various ways. For these 
reasons, some of the tenants moved out without any adequate resettlement. Reportedly, the 
Yongsan residents asked for police protection, but neither investigation nor action was carried 
out. In March 2008, the inhabitants asking for comprehensive resettlement plan joined the 
Federation Against House Demolition (Jun Chul Yun) and decided to prepare a demonstration, 
as a last resort. On the morning of 9 January 2009, approximately 50 people started a sit-in 
protest on the rooftop of a five-story temporary building. In order to disperse the protesters, 
approximately 1.600 police officers as well as 49 SWAT officers trained for counterterrorism 
operations were dispatched around the area. During the police crackdown, a fire broke out. Five 
protesters and one SWAT officer died as a consequence. The authorities carried out 
investigations on the events which resulted in the arrest of a number of protesters, and no charges 
were filed against the police.  In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on how tenants of Yongsan 
were informed of their eviction and on the measures of consultation and dialogue with the 
tenants; if alternative solutions were considered before the decision to resort to evictions; if a 
prior impact assessment of the redevelopment project was carried out; if compensation was 
offered to evicted people; if the Government considered the principle of necessity and 
proportionality in its decision to resort to compulsory measures to stop the protest that took place 
on 20 January 2009; on the measures taken to guarantee freedom of assembly and association in 
the framework of urban redevelopment projects and housing policies&#8217; implementation; if any 
complaints had been lodged on behalf of the alleged victims of the police crackdown on 20 
January 2009; and on the details of any investigation, judicial or other inquiries carried out.<b>

<p>51. On 6 July 2009, the Government of Korea sent a reply to the joint allegation letter sent on 
1 April 2009. The Government informed that on December 2002, the Republic of Korea enacted 
the Act on the Maintenance and Improvement of Urban Zones and Dwelling Conditions for 
Residents, which requires companies responsible for the Urban Environment Improvement 
Project to formulate a project implementation plan that includes measures for the relocation of 
tenants. According to the Act, the provincial government is required to undertake a prior impact 
assessment of the Urban Environment Improvement Project, draw up an improvement plan and </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
designate the Urban Environment Improvement Zone. Subsequently, the interested companies 
are required to conduct impact assessments that must be reviewed and approved by the 
provincial government in order to receive an authorization for the project&#8217;s implementation. The 
Government also informed that the partnership of landowners in Yongsan Zone 4 carried out the 
aforementioned process. The Seoul Metropolitan Government informed the public of the 
designation of Yongsan as an Urban Environment Improvement Zone on 1 December 2003, 15 
September 2005 and 20 April 2006. The partnership of landowners in Yongsan Zone 4 notified 
individual tenants of compensation in March, August and October 2007, and put up a 
compensation and eviction notice in April 2008 (the time limit for the eviction was August 
2008). Concerning compensation, residential tenants were provided with compensation for 
relocation of residence and movable property, and given entitlement to a rental house, whereas 
commercial tenants were offered with deposit money and compensation for the business 
suspension. In Yongsan Zone 4, 821 out of 904 tenants received complete compensation, and 37 
residential tenants were selected as eligible to move into rental housing. Appeal procedures, civil 
complaints mechanisms, and negotiation opportunities were provided to the affected persons. 
Concerning the demonstrations in Yongsan, the Government informed that on 19 January 2009, 
members of Jun Chul Yun hold a violent demonstration and illegally occupied a building in the 
city center from where they indiscriminately threw Molotov cocktails, bricks and bottles of 
hydrochloric acid, golf balls and glass beads, as well as caused considerable damage by setting 
fire to nearby buildings. The police, including SWAT officers, responded with a law 
enforcement operation. The fire allegedly set by the protestors may have led to the unexpected 
death of five people. The Prosecutors' Office has been investigating whether the police acted 
illegally, and whether there was a connection between the police crackdown and the deaths of 
protestors. Twenty-seven protestors were allegedly arrested on charges of unlawful entry into a 
private building, arson and assault against the police. Also, seven construction workers were 
prosecuted without detention on charges of using violence during the crackdown. The 
Government informed that the police sought to achieve a peaceful settlement by trying to 
mediate amongst the interested parties and that it fully guarantees the freedom of peaceful 
assembly.

<p>53. El 18 de septiembre de 2009, la Relatora Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas enviaron un 
llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n con el supuesto desalojo forzoso de 
pobladores mayas de la comunidad de San Antonio Ebul&#225;, Estado de Campeche. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, el 13 de agosto de 2009 un centenar de guardias privados al servicio del 
Sr. Escalante entraron a la comunidad alrededor de las seis de la ma&#241;ana. Los guardias, apoyados 
por tres tractores y camionetas, desalojaron violentamente a las 109 familias que viv&#237;an ah&#237;, la 
mayor&#237;a de ellas de etnia Maya, destruyendo la totalidad de las m&#225;s de 60 viviendas de la 
poblaci&#243;n. Supuestamente, elementos de la Polic&#237;a Estatal Preventiva de Campeche habr&#237;an 
resguardado la operaci&#243;n ejecutada por los guardias privados. El desalojo forzoso se llev&#243; a cabo 
sin que mediara una resoluci&#243;n judicial. Las familias desalojadas se encontrar&#237;an sin acceso a 
una vivienda adecuada y sin que se les hubiera indemnizado por la p&#233;rdida de sus pertenencias. 
El desalojo forzoso del 13 de agosto fue el tercer intento de desalojo de la comunidad en a&#241;os 
recientes. El desalojo forzoso del 13 de agosto de 2009 y los intentos anteriores estar&#237;an 
relacionados con un conflicto de tierras entre los pobladores de San Antonio Ebul&#225; y un 
empresario, Eduardo Escalante, quien tiene varios contratos para la construcci&#243;n de carreteras en 
Campeche y reclama el territorio que conforma San Antonio Ebul&#225;. Hasta la fecha. El Gobierno 
no ha tomado pasos para investigar los presuntos responsables de los desalojos, aunque los 
pobladores han presentado denuncias ante la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos del Estado de 
Campeche y la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos. Hasta a&#241;os recientes, las autoridades 
estatales reconoc&#237;an la existencia de la comunidad. En a&#241;os recientes, la comunidad de San

<p>56. On 30 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Nigeria regarding a trend of forced evictions affecting low-income families living in Port 
Harcourt, Rivers State, in buildings and informal settlements. According to information received, 
the demolition of homes, particularly in the waterfront settlements where approximately 40 
percent of the population of Port Harcourt live resulting in an alarming increase in homelessness. 
Reports received indicate that evictions were being conducted by the Rivers State Urban 
Development Ministry, with the assistance of the Joint Military Task Force. Reports further 
alleged that the evictions were conducted without providing adequate time for the affected </p>

families to relocate, nor alternative accommodation or compensation. Allegedly, the Government 
has disregarded appeals to cease these demolitions by tenants organizations, the African 
Commission for Human and People&#8217;s Rights, the National Human Rights Commission and the 
Federal High Court. Reportedly, between June and October of 2008, the Rivers State Urban 
Development Ministry proceeded to demolish a series of buildings and settlements in low-
income areas in or around Port Harcourt, impacting the livelihood of approximately 200,000 
people.  In June of 2008, the Government allegedly proceeded to demolish over 5,000 structures 
of buildings located opposite the Integrated Cultural Centre on Abonnema Wharf Road, 
rendering approximately 30,000 people homeless, and providing no adequate prior notice, 
alternative accommodation or compensation. A pattern of disregard for the existence of judicial 
proceedings and resulting court orders that established injunctions against threats or actual 
demolitions has also been reported.  In November 2008, 25,000 people who previously lived on 
Bonny Street and Creek Road were reportedly rendered homeless by new evictions. Despite a 
stay against further demolitions granted by the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Port Harcourt 
Judicial Division Holden (Suit # FHC/PH/CS/563/2008) on 29 October 2008, reports alleged that 
in January 2009, signs were placed on the buildings along Azikiwe Road in Port Harcourt 
announcing plans for further demolitions to begin on 26 January 2009. It is alleged that the 
150,000 people residing in the Abonnema Wharf and Njemanze waterfront affected by new 
evictions had not been consulted, and that there were no plans to provide them with alternative 
accommodation.  It is estimated that by the end of January 2009, approximately 400,000 or about 
30 percent of Port Harcourt inner-city population would have been rendered homeless if 
demolitions continued as announced. The Special Rapporteur requested information on the 
number of people affected by the demolition of homes in the waterfronts in and around Port 
Harcourt; if alternatives to demolition were considered by the governments of Rivers State; if 
impact assessments were conducted; if the affected communities were appropriately consulted; if 
the Federal or State-level governments took any action in response to orders by Nigerian courts 
calling for a stay of further demolitions; if the residents were given adequate prior notice; on the 
measures taken to prevent people from becoming homeless as a result of evictions; if 
compensation was provided to people affected by demolitions; and if any independent body was 
monitoring the manner in which evictions and demolitions were taking place. 
</p>
<p>57. On 24 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Nigeria in follow up to a previous communication dated 30 January 2009 concerning alleged 
forced evictions and demolitions in Port Harcourt, River State. According to the information 
received, since the previous communication the River State Government has reportedly 
continued to implement and plan large scale forced evictions and demolitions in different sectors 
of the city, affecting particularly waterfront settlements. In February 2009, the River State 
Government reportedly announced its decision to demolish all the waterfront settlements in Port 
Harcourt. Because of the lack of a census of the area concerned, there were no accurate figures 
concerning the number of people who had already been affected and were threatened to be 
affected by the demolitions. Different sources presented figures ranging from 200.000 to 900.000 
possible affected persons. Since 10 February 2009, the authorities had reportedly resumed 
carrying out demolitions in the former Obi Wali Cultural Centre on Abonnema Wharf Road, 
Mile One &#8211;Diobu. These demolitions were ordered by the Commissioner of Urban Development, 
in violation of a stay order issued by the Federal High Court of Nigeria. It has been alleged that 
in most of the cases, the evictions were conducted without providing affected persons with prior 
notice, alternative accommodation, or adequate compensation. In addition to comments on the </p>

<p>58. On 27 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Nigeria in follow up to a previous communication dated 30 January 2009 and 24 June 2009 
regarding alleged forced evictions and demolitions in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, now affecting 
Njemanze Street. According to the information received, since the previous communication the 
River State Government has reportedly continued to implement and plan large scale forced 
evictions and demolitions in different sectors of the city, affecting particularly waterfront 
settlements in Port Harcourt. On 25 October 2009, the Rivers State Government had reportedly 
started executing a plan to demolish Njemanze Street in its entirety by pulling out the roofs, 
doors and windows of the occupied apartments in order to subsequently evict their current 
inhabitants, which would reportedly amount to thousands of residents. The affected residents, 
mostly belonging to the Okrika ethnic group, received no previous notice, nor offers of 
alternative accommodation or compensation. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the legal basis 
for the evictions and demolitions on Njemanze Street; if the Federal or the Rivers State 
governments took any action in response to orders by Nigerian courts calling for a stay of further 
demolitions; if alternatives to demolition were considered by the government; if any social 
impact assessment was conducted prior to the alleged demolitions; on the number of people 
affected by the alleged demolition; if appropriate consultations took place with the affected 
persons; if the affected persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notifications before the 
evictions and demolitions as well as adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their belongings; 
on the measures foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the housing demolition do not 
become homeless; if the affected persons were offered compensation for the loss of their houses 
and livelihood; on the measures foreseen in terms of relocation; and if any assistance, financial 
or otherwise, was provided to the affected persons.

<p>64. On 28 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Papua new Guinea concerning the evictions in the Tete Settlement on the outskirts of Gerehu, 
Port Moresby between 18 and 19 December 2008, and threats of evictions in other settlements 
such as Kipo, Garden Hills, Eight-Mile and Two-Mile. According to the information received, on 
16 December 2008, evictions and widespread demolition of shanty homes allegedly occurred in 
Tete Settlement, in response to police investigations of the murder of businessman Sir George 
Constantinou in its vicinity. On 16 December, the police gave Tete Settlement occupants a 24-
hour ultimatum to hand over those involved in the killing of Sir George Constantinou. 
Reportedly, on 17 December 2008, Mr Yakasa, the National Capital District Police Chief stated 
that the residents of Tete would be evicted if the land they were living on was found to be State 
owned, as opposed to customary land. He also said that since Papua New Guinea was 
experiencing an economic boom, Gerehu needed to be cleaned up so that potential investors 
could set up businesses. Despite responding to the police ultimatum and the reported arrests of 
several suspects, on 18 and 19 December 2008, the police reportedly used bulldozers and axes to 
demolish the homes of about 300 people in the settlement. The government did not provide 
alternative accommodation or prior notice. The destruction of the Settlement was allegedly 
supported by the Police Chief and the Deputy Prime Minister, but criticized by the Chief 
Ombudsman as &#8220;inhuman&#8221;. Police reported that other settlements with a similar reputation 
including Kipo, Garden Hills, Eight-Mile, Two-Mile, among others, would be next on the list if 
residents continued illegal activities. On 22 December 2008, the Waigani National Court granted 
an order in favor of residents being allowed to move back to their homes and restraining the 
police from causing further destruction to the properties. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on 
whether other alternatives to demolition and relocation had been considered; if the residents were </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1

consulted at any stage; if the residents were given adequate prior notice and if they were 
informed about their legal rights; on the measures taken to prevent people from becoming 
homeless or from being inadequately housed as a consequence of the evictions; if the affected 
communities were appropriately consulted at all stages of the eviction procedure; and, in the case 
that evictions were unavoidable, on the measures foreseen for them to be impartially and 
independently monitored and to provide adequate and fair compensation and rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>65. On 17 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Papua 
New Guinea concerning numerous police raids of settlements in Port Moresby that all resulted in 
forced evictions, namely at the Five-Mile settlement on 26 June, at Four-Mile on 13-15 July and 
at Hohola hillside on 15 July 2009. According to the information received, early morning on 
Thursday 25 June 2009, three men were killed at Five-Mile settlement, Hubert Murray Drive, 
Port Moresby. The deaths occurred as the result of drunken violence. After being stabbed with a 
knife, one man from Enga Province escaped and fled home. His relatives, upon seeing his 
condition, went to the scene and attacked the two perpetrators from Mount Hagen, Western 
Highlands. All three men died. According to information provided, police raided the settlement 
on Friday afternoon 26 June. At least 16 homes, shops, gardens, and power lines were 
purportedly destroyed. Many families appear to have been rendered homeless as a result. The 
police reportedly used violence and raided homes confiscating goods. Reportedly, no prior notice 
was provided of the raid. The police reportedly threatened to return to Five-Mile Settlement and 
continue raiding. Similar police raids were allegedly carried out at the Four-Mile settlement on 
Monday 13 July and Wednesday 15 July 2009. Also on 15 July 2009 police allegedly raided a 
Hohola hillside settlement and left 20 families homeless as a result. Policemen are said to have 
arrived unannounced in three cars. Not only were houses and gardens supplying the settlers with 
food destroyed, but goods and an undisclosed sum of money were allegedly confiscated. 
Furthermore, on Wednesday 1st July 2009, the National Capital District (NCD) Metropolitan 
Chief Supt Commander, Fred Yakasa, had issued a final warning to the residents of yet another 
settlement in Port Moresby, namely Two-Mile Hill. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the legal 
basis for the police raids of Five-Mile, Four-Mile and Hohola hillside settlements carried out; if 
alternatives to demolitions had been considered; if the residents were consulted; if residents of 
the settlements were given adequate prior notice of the forced eviction; on the measures taken to 
prevent people from becoming homeless as a consequence of the evictions; if the affected 
persons were offered compensation for the loss of their homes, personal belongings and 
livelihood; if the threat to forcibly enter and demolish the Two-Mile Hill settlement had been 
acted upon in any way.

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
Grand Mosque at the reclamation site in Baclaran, Pasay City. According to the information 
received, the community living around the Grand Mosque received a Memorandum from the 
Executive Secretary dated 26 May 2009 ordering their eviction. This notice reportedly follows 
numerous forced eviction attempts by authorities in the course of the last decade. The land where 
this Muslim community has been living since 1992 is earmarked for the development of 
infrastructure, commercial space, luxury housing and a casino. The memorandum states that the 
entire Mosque structure, including the housing where 370 families live, shall be relocated to &#8220;a 
proposed relocation site&#8221;, which has not yet been identified.  Reportedly, the affected community 
is negotiating with relevant authorities for a halt to the announced evictions. In addition to 
comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested 
further information on whether alternative solutions to the demolition were considered; if the 
affected community and its representatives were appropriately consulted when considering these 
alternatives; if an appropriate relocation site for the affected community was determined; if the 
community was given adequate prior notice; and on the measures foreseen, in case the evictions 
were unavoidable, to provide for impartial and independent monitoring, as well as adequate and

</p>
<p>68. On 22 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Philippines regarding an eviction on a contested piece of land housing an urban poor 
community in North Fairview, Quezon City that resulted in the death of two residents. 
According to the information received, the incident occurred on 9 October 2009 on a contested 
2.4 hectare property located in Pechayan, Barangay village, North Fairview, Quezon City. Over 
1&#8217;000 urban poor were reportedly been living in this area for over 20 years. Prior to the incident, 
the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) Branch 38 in Quezon City had allegedly granted a writ of 
execution for the eviction of the Domingo family. The claim of other families over different 
sections of the same property had been sustained by the court. The owner of the areas occupied 
by the Domingo family was said to have employed 15 security guards to carry out the eviction. 
Reportedly, these guards began fencing the property on 9 October 2009. However, rather than 
fencing only the land which the Domingo family occupied the guards allegedly proceeded to 
fence in the entire 2.4 hectare property. Members of the urban poor community, seeing 
themselves as potential victims of an unlawful forced eviction, attempted to halt the actions of 
the security guards. Reportedly, the protesters were lead by Mrs Maria Myrna Porcare, leader of 
Samahan ng Magkakapitbahay sa Pechayan (SAMASAPE). Mrs Porcare and her son were shot 
in the stomach with a shot gun whilst attempting to halt the guards. Charged with two county of 
homicide, the perpetrators were reportedly arrested and taken to the Crime Investigation 
Detection Unit (CIDU) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Camp General Toomas 
Karingal in Quezon City. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, 
the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the details of any investigation and 
judicial or other proceedings carried out in relation to this case; if penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions were imposed on  the alleged perpetrators; if the evictions were carried 
out and, if yes, on what legal basis and which residents were affected by this decision; if the 
security guards were acting within their mandate when fencing in the 2.4 hectare property; if 
appropriate consultations took place with the affected persons and if they were given adequate 
and reasonable prior notifications concerning the eviction as well as adequate and reasonable 
time to withdraw their belongings; on the measures foreseen to ensure that the persons affected 
by the eviction will not become homeless; if the affected persons were offered compensation for </p>

<p>70. On 31 December 2008, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the joint 
urgent appeal sent on 29 January 2008, contained in report A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 paragraph 72. 
The Government informed that the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation, together 
with the Government of the Chechen Republic in the Russian Federation, had done extensive 
work to implement Presidential Instruction No Pr-1277 of 1 July 2001 on the creation of 
conditions for the return to their former places of residence of Russian citizens who were forced 
to leave the Chechen Republic during the settlement of the crisis. Their combined efforts made it 
possible to close all tent cities in the Republic of Ingushetia and in the Russian Federation and to 
facilitate the return of over 209,000 persons to their former places of residence. The measures to 
return internally displaced persons to the Chechen Republic were allegedly implemented on a 
strictly voluntary basis. Efforts have focused chiefly on providing economic incentives, social 
assistance and housing with basic services for returnees. Monetary compensation in the amount 
of 4,028,000,255 roubles has been paid to 37,935 families. Furthermore, the Government took 
over the responsibility for supporting returnees and for providing them with housing. As of 5 
December 2008, 236 families have been assigned housing, 579 families have received 
compensation for lost housing and property, 290 families have returned to refurbished housing, 
and 195 families are living in dormitories. Forced evictions, where no other decent housing is 
provided, are prohibited. Concerning the internally displaced people living in a dormitory at 4 
Vyborgskaya Street in Grozny, 678 people were living there as of 16 December 2008.

urgent appeal sent on 21 November 2008, contained in report A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 paragraph 73. 
The Government informed that on 14 November 2008, the investigative authority of the Internal 
Affairs Department of the Khimki district in Moscow Province instituted criminal proceedings 
on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 111, paragraph 1 (intentional causing of 
serious harm to health, endangering a person&#8217;s life), of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation in connection with the bodily harm inflicted on Mr. Beketov, the editor-in-chief of 
the Khimkinskaia Pravda newspaper. The criminal case was referred for further examination to 
the investigation department of the investigative committee under the Office of the Procurator of 
the Russian Federation for Moscow Province. The case was being monitored by the head of the 
Criminal Investigation Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. With regards to 
Mr. Fedotov, the Government informed following verification by the investigation office of the 
Lotoshinsk Municipal District Department of Internal Affairs, on 19 November 2008 criminal 
proceedings were instituted on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 116, 
paragraph 2 (a), of the Criminal Code (battery with criminal intent) in connection with the bodily 
harm inflicted on Mr. Fedotov by unknown individuals. The investigative authorities are </p>

possibility of an assault having been committed with criminal intent. With regards to Ms. 
Cl&#233;ment, the Government informed that the investigation office in the Department of Internal 
Affairs of the Basmanny municipal district in Moscow instituted criminal proceedings on the 
basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code

d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement au sujet d&#8217;expulsions forc&#233;es de populations d&#233;favoris&#233;es de la 
ville de Kigali, dans le contexte de transformations urbaines. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, la 
politique d&#8217;urbanisation du Gouvernement, notamment dans le cadre du Plan Directeur de la 
Ville de Kigali, et le r&#233;gime foncier d&#233;coulant des r&#233;centes r&#233;formes l&#233;gislatives dont la &#171; Loi 
organique portant r&#233;gime foncier &#187; actuellement en vigueur et la &#171; Loi sur l&#8217;expropriation pour 
cause d&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t public &#187;, auraient port&#233; lourdement atteinte &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; d&#8217;occupation des 
logements des individus vivant dans les quartiers pauvres et les quartiers informels de Kigali et 
auraient conduit ces personnes &#224; se retrouver &#224; la rue et d&#233;munis. Ainsi, la loi autorisant les 
expulsions &#171; pour cause d&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t public &#187; aurait rendu les habitants des quartiers informels tr&#232;s 
vuln&#233;rables car ne disposant pas de titres de propri&#233;t&#233; ni de ressources pour lutter contre leur 
expulsion. D&#8217;autre part la mise en place de nouvelles normes de construction  et d&#8217;organisation 
urbaine, visant au d&#233;veloppement d&#8217;un secteur priv&#233; comp&#233;titif, aurait emp&#234;ch&#233; les groupes les 
plus pauvres d&#8217;acqu&#233;rir des terres en entrainant une tr&#232;s forte hausse des prix immobiliers. 
L&#8217;inscription obligatoire de tout d&#233;veloppement urbain dans le Plan Directeur approuv&#233; par la 
Ville de Kigali aurait conduit de nombreux foyers pauvres &#224; se tourner vers le march&#233; du 
logement informel. Ce march&#233; spontan&#233; &#233;chappant &#224; toute norme car ne s&#8217;inscrivant dans aucun 
plan de d&#233;veloppement, les populations pauvres auraient &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;cipit&#233;es dans l&#8217;ill&#233;galit&#233; et 
l&#8217;ins&#233;curit&#233;, et auraient &#233;t&#233; expos&#233;es aux expulsions forc&#233;es d&#233;crites pr&#233;c&#233;demment. Les 
restrictions impos&#233;es dans le cadre des nouvelles normes de construction et de d&#233;veloppement 
urbain &#224; Kigali seraient &#224; l&#8217;origine de l&#8217;exclusion de 75 &#224; 80% des foyers de la capitale de l&#8217;acc&#232;s 
l&#233;gal au logement et &#224; la terre. Les informations re&#231;ues ont fait &#233;tat de tr&#232;s rares mesures de 
relogement par rapport au nombre d&#8217;expulsions. De plus ces mesures de relogement n&#8217;auraient 
correspondu pas aux besoins des populations en termes de proximit&#233; avec leur lieu de travail et 
d&#8217;acc&#232;s aux services qui leur sont n&#233;cessaires. Les compensations financi&#232;res allou&#233;es aux foyers 
ayant subi une expulsion auraient &#233;t&#233; &#233;galement tr&#232;s insuffisantes. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, 
les compensations vers&#233;es aux populations expuls&#233;es du logement dont elles &#233;taient propri&#233;taires

<p>74. On 6 May 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on Minority 
Issues and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance sent a joint communication letter to the Government of 
Serbia concerning alleged forced evictions in Belgrade. According to the information received, 
on 3 April 2009, a community of about 47 Roma families living in informal homes in Yuri 
Gagarin Street-New Belgrade and identified as &#8220;Roma settlement in block 67&#8221; were forcibly 
evicted, allegedly with the intention to transform the site in view of the World University Games 
which will take place in Belgrade in July 2009. On 2 April 2009, the community was reportedly 
notified of a decision taken by the Communal Inspector of the City Administration and told that 
they had one hour to remove all their belongings and their shelters from the location. Reportedly, 
on 3 April 2009 the police carried out the eviction, demolishing the informal homes of the 
inhabitants of the settlement. The affected families were told that they could have found 
accommodation in containers in the Boljevci settlement-Municipality of Surcin, but allegedly 
residents in Boljevci made it impossible for the evictees to access the containers, forming a 
cordon around the settlement, smashing some containers as well as setting one container on fire. 
Following these events, women, children and the elderly were reportedly offered shelter 
accommodation in social care institutions, but families refused this offer to avoid being 
separated. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteur requested further information on the legal basis for the eviction; if any consultation 
was undertaken with those affected; on the measures foreseen by the authorities to ensure that 
the forced eviction did not result in homelessness of the affected persons; on the steps foreseen in 
terms of alternatives for those affected and if relocation sites had been designated; if any 
assistance, financial or otherwise was provided to the affected persons; if the affected persons 
were given adequate prior notice before the eviction and reasonable time to withdraw their 
belongings; and on the right of those affected to appeal the decision prior to its being executed. </p>

75. On 18 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Serbia regarding the alleged imminent eviction of inhabitants living under the Gazela Bridge. 
Subsequent to the communication jointly sent on 6 May 2009, reports continued to arrive of 
foreseen evictions of informal Roma settlements in Belgrade. According to the allegations, 
inhabitants living under the Gazela Bridge had received a notification of their imminent eviction. 
The eviction was reportedly planned to make way for a project aiming at the reparation of the 
Gazela Bridge, a project financed by European bank for reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD). While this project had been planned for a number of years, no adequate alternative 
solution for those residents was allegedly put in place by the City authorities, who were in charge 
of implementing the project. Updated information in regard to the eviction carried out on 3 April 
2009 in Yuri Gagarin Street-New Belgrade (&#8220;Roma settlement in block 67&#8221;) indicated that only 
some of the affected persons had been relocated in a remote location in containers, a solution that 
in no circumstances could be envisaged as adequate and permanent housing and living 
conditions. It was further reported that people in the relocation site have little or no access to 
livelihood, school and employment. Copies of the notification received by the inhabitants of the 
Gazela settlement did not appear to meet basic international standards, particularly in regard of 
timeliness of notice and access to effective legal recourse. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
that a relocation plan was recently prepared by the City of Belgrade. Yet, reportedly this plan 
was not publicly available and was prepared without consultation with the affected communities. 
The Special Rapporteur requested further information on the alternatives for relocation of 
population envisaged in the design stage of the project for the reconstruction of the Gazela 
Bridge; if the project include appropriate relocation of affected people; if an eviction impact-
assessment was conducted; if consultations were undertaken with those affected; on the 
measures foreseen to ensure that evictions do not result in homelessness; on the measures taken 
to avoid further impoverishment of these communities, in particular their access to livelihood; 
and on the access of the affected persons to effective legal recourse.

<p>77. On 20 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
South Africa regarding<b> </b>imminent forced evictions which would affect about 61 families living in 
the Tumbleweed settlement, Howick. According to the information the Special Rapporteur 
received, the Tumbleweed settlement in Howick is home to 61 families who have allegedly been 
threatened with imminent and unlawful eviction by their municipality and local Inkosi, which 
would render them homeless. The residents of the Tumbleweed settlement reportedly need to be 
displaced as the land has changed ownership. As the new owner, the Department of Education 
wishes to build a school on the site. The earliest residents of the Tumbleweed settlement in 
Howick first built shacks on the land in 1994. Each household paid an average of R700 for a site 
and some residents paid an additional R200 for a title deed. In 2002 the land was officially 
transferred to the Inkosi, who ordered and numbered the shacks. By 2007 a total of 120 shacks 
made up the Tumbleweed settlement. Of these 120 shacks, 102 were allegedly demolished in </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
page 40 
 
March 2007. The above outlined eviction threats are therefore not the first to have been received 
by Tumbleweed settlement residents. On 29 July 2009 a representative of the municipality and 
three armed police officers allegedly entered the settlement and informed the community that 
they had 24 hours to vacate the area. An eviction of the Tumbleweed settlement was not carried 
out on 30 July 2009, as initially threatened. However, municipal official Mr Delani Madondo 
reportedly informed residents that they could be removed from the land at any time. On 9 August 
2009, Mr Delani Madondo allegedly returned to the site with a bulldozer and three police 
vehicles. Residents of the settlement are said to have prevented the destruction of their homes 
through providing physical obstacles and singing protest songs. Information received indicates 
that the municipality and the Inkosi had yet to secure a Prevention of Illegal Evictions and 
Occupation of Land Act (PIE) notice through the courts. Such a notice is required by law in 
South Africa in order for an eviction to be carried out legally. In addition to prior notice, the PIE 
Act requires for affected persons to be consulted prior to an eviction and for adequate alternative 
accommodation to be provided for. Residents of the Tumbleweed settlement sustained that they 
received no such notice prior to the actions taken by municipal officials in July and August 2009. 
Furthermore, although a designated relocation site was reportedly identified on 6 August 2009, 
this site appears to be inadequate. It allegedly consists of open vacant land in the immediate 
proximity of a power line, which is considered to present health and safety risks to potential 
residents. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteur requested further information on whether alternative solutions to the eviction of the 
61 families were considered or if in the case that evictions are unavoidable, an appropriate 
relocation site was determined; if the affected community were appropriately consulted; if the 
community was given adequate prior notice; and on the measures foreseen to provide for 
impartial and independent monitoring, as well as adequate and fair compensation in the case that 
evictions are unavoidable. 
</p>
<p>78. On 12 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of South Africa 
to inquire about reports alleging attacks against residents and homes at the Kenney Road shack 
settlement in Durban. According to the information the Special Rapporteur received, on 26 
September, a group of about 30 to 40 heavily armed men reportedly attacked the inhabitants of 
the Kennedy Road informal settlement and subjected them to the forced eviction and demolition 
of their homes. The attacks appeared to have been particularly targeted at members of the 
Kennedy Road Development Committee (KRDC) and the Abahlali baseMjondolo Movement 
(AbM), two community-based organizations working for the realization of the right to housing. 
As a consequence of the attacks, at least two people were reported dead and many others 
seriously injured. In addition, the houses of around 30 members of KRDC and AbM were burnt 
and destroyed, rendering them and their families homeless. Many other houses were reportedly 
looted. Furthermore, it is estimated that around 1000 people had to leave their homes and flee the 
area as a result of the intimidations and attacks. According to allegations, members of the 
Sydenham Police Station and public officials were present at the scene but did not intervene to 
stop the assault. It is further reported that the police detained a number of victims of the attacks 
but none of the assailants. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, 
the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether any complaint has been lodged 
by or on behalf of the alleged victims; on the details of any investigation, medical examinations, 
and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; on any penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrators; on whether the affected persons </p>

<p>80. On 8 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of Sri 
Lanka concerning alleged imminent forced evictions from tsunami shelters in the Moratuwa and 
Ratmalana DS Divisions and alleged unequal application of the Tsunami Housing Policy in 
regards to the needs of certain groups, including extended families and tenants. According to the 
information received, transitional shelter scheme under the Tsunami Housing Policy is an 
effective and widely used mean of providing temporary shelter and other basic services to 
families impacted upon by the devastating effects of the Tsunami in Sri Lanka in December 
</p><p>2004. The information received indicates that the Tsunami Housing Policy entitles everyone who 
lost a house in the disaster to receive a ready built house or a cash grant to build a house, 
regardless of the shelter they had in the past. However, the Tsunami Housing Policy allegedly 
states that tenants are not eligible to receive housing assistance. The Tsunami (Special 
Provisions) Act (2005) reportedly states that rent agreements between landlord and tenant remain 
valid even if that house was completely destroyed during the Tsunami disaster. The information 
provided indicates that tenants are disqualified from housing assistance because of their old 
agreements. In this context, families that were still living in transitional shelters in late 2008 
reportedly received a first eviction notice from the Government dated 10 September 2008, which 
ordered them to vacate the camps by 25 September 2008. In addition to this notice, access to 
basic facilities and services was cut off in all camps. A fundamental rights petition was 
reportedly filled with the Supreme Court. On 10 October 2008, during the first hearing of the 
Court, representatives of the communities reportedly sought an order for the provision of 
housing assistance to all camp residents. A second hearing was reportedly held on 20 October 
2008, in which the Government continued to claim that camp residents were not qualified for 
compensation under the tsunami housing policy. While judges reportedly agreed that residents 
would have to leave the camps, they also stated that residents would have to be given more time 
&#8211; between 3 to 6 months &#8211; as well as compensation before they can be evicted. Three months 
time and 25,000 Rupees compensation as a solution was accepted by the Court, who ordered 
people to leave the camps by 28 February 2009. By this decision, the Court reportedly upheld 
previous decisions and confirmed the Tsunami Housing Policy, based on which tenants and 
extended family members are not eligible for housing assistance under the tsunami assistance 
scheme. The District Court held an additional hearing on 22 May 2009 ordering the families to 
vacate the camps by 5 June 2009, when a fifth hearing would have been held. It was alleged that 
an eviction order would be issued by the Court rapidly and that the around 500 families 
threatened to be imminently evicted would become homeless. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on 
the measures taken to ensure that the allocation of grants under the Tsunami Housing Policy is </p>

<p>82. On 24 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on the 
issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government of Sudan regarding the revocation of licenses of 16 non-governmental 
organizations working in the region of Darfur, in Northern Sudan and in the Transitional Areas, 
which would have devastating consequences on the human rights of 4.7 million people affected 
by the conflict, particularly in the sectors of food, health, water, sanitation, adequate housing and 
education. Of this population 2.7 million are internally displaced persons living in camps across 
the country.  According to the information received, on 5 March 2009, following the issuance of 
an arrest warrant against President Omar Bashir by the International Criminal Court, it was 
announced that the operations related to humanitarian assistance and human rights work of these 
organizations were suspended. These organizations include 13 international non-governmental 
organizations. In addition, the activities of three national organizations were also terminated. 
These 16 organizations employed nearly 6,500 national and international personnel, constituting 
close to half of the workforce in Darfur. Eviction orders have reportedly been appealed 
(according to Sudanese law) by relief and humanitarian NGOs, while the close down of local 
NGOs cannot be appealed according to the Humanitarian Act of 2006. Incidents of threats 
against NGO personnel were reported as well as systematic confiscation and seizure of property. 
The impact would not only be limited to Darfur, but also the Three Transitional Areas and 
Eastern Sudan. According to estimates, 1.5 million beneficiaries no longer have access to health 
and nutrition services. Host and IDP populations are particularly affected. Water supply, 
sanitation and hygiene services provided by these NGOs to 1.16 million people have been 
interrupted (Blue Nile &#8211; 102,000; Eastern States &#8211; 50,000; and Darfur &#8211; 1,007,000). Some 1.1 
million people have stopped receiving general food distribution and the treatment of some 4,000 
children for severe and moderate malnutrition could be interrupted. In the Non-Food Item (NFI) 
and Emergency Shelter (ES) sector, 670,000 individuals are to be affected. Distributions of Non-
Food Relief Items and emergency shelter ceased in 19 camps and locations in Darfur. Finally, 
disturbing reports of censorship, temporary newspaper suspensions, threats and arbitrary arrest </p>

and detention to prevent human rights defenders, journalists and members of opposition parties 
from freely expressing their opinions, were reported. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the legal 
basis of the suspension of the aforementioned 16 non-governmental organizations as well as the 
seizure of their property; on the measures taken by local and central authorities to ensure that the 
economic and social rights of the inhabitants in the region of Darfur, in Northern Sudan and in 
the Transitional Areas, are respected and protected, especially those related to health, housing,

contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; and 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
sent a joint urgent appeal regarding Mr. <b>Mohammad Saed Hossein Al-Omar, </b>Syrian national 
of Kurdish origin. Mr. Al-Omar has already been the subject of a joint urgent appeal addressed 
to the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; the Independent Expert on Minority Issues; 
and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression on 2 February 2009. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention drew the attention of the Government to the case of Mr. Al-Omar pursuant 
to its regular procedure leading to the adoption of an Opinion in a separate communication dated 
16 March 2009. The Special Rapporteurs thanked the Government for its response dated 18 
August 2009 to the above-mentioned joint urgent appeal and for a further communication dated 
17 March 2009. According to the new allegations received by the Special Rapporteurs, in 
September 2009, Mr. Al-Omar&#8217;s family was evicted from its home in Rameilan. This house had 
been provided by the State-owned Syrian Petroleum Company, where Mr. Al-Omar was 
employed.  Following his arrest Mr. Al-Omar was suspended from employment without pay and 
stripped of all benefits, including his pension rights. It is reported that these measures have been 
imposed upon him and his family because of his political activities and in connection with the 
charges laid against him. However, according to Syrian laws, any such decision requires judicial 
authorization, which has not been issued. Earlier, on 24 April 2009, Mr. Al-Omar suffered a 
stroke at Adra prison, Damascus, and was treated three hours later at the Ibn al-Nafees military 
hospital. On 6 May 2009, he was returned to Adra prison, where he was detained in a cell of 40-
50 sqm that he shared with 20 co-inmates. The medication he required for continuous treatment 
needed to be provided by his family, who was allowed to visit him once a week. There were 
concerns that Mr. Al-Omar was not receiving all necessary treatment for stroke victims including 
physiotherapy. The final verdict in the criminal trial against Mr. Al-Omar was expected for 15 
November 2009. Concerns had been expressed that the eviction of Mr. Al Omar&#8217;s family from 
its house, as well as the lack of adequate health treatment provided to Mr. Al-Omar were due to </p>

the political and cultural activities in favor of Kurdish people undertaken by Mr. Al-Omar before 
his arrest. The Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the accuracy of the facts of 
the allegations; if a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Al-Omar and members of 
his family; on the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical

<p>86. On 13 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Turkmenistan regarding the alleged forced eviction of Ms. Amanzhakhan Ataeva and her family, 
including four adults and three children. According to the information received, Ms. 
Amanzhakhan Ataeva and her family had been residing in their current home in Ashgabad since 
</p><p>1988. On 6 December 1989, Ms. Ataeva was granted right to reside in this home by a Decision 
of the Local Executive Committee which also granted her the House Book (&#8220;Domovaja Kniga&#8221;).  
No Inventory File was issued to her name, since apparently this was not a current practice for the 
type of housing she was receiving at the time. On 16 July 2009, Ms. Amanzhakhan Ataeva 
received a letter (Reference n&#176; 1016) from the Local Executive Body of Kopetdag Municipal 
Unit (&#8220;Kopetdagskij etrap&#8221;) informing her that on 1st October 2009 her family was going to be 
evicted and their home destroyed. However, the municipal decision did not indicate any 
compensation or alternative housing to be provided to the affected family. On 11 August 2009, 
the decision of the municipal body was upheld by the decision of the District Court (Kazyet) of 
Kopetdag Municipal Unit.  Both the Local Executive Body and the District Court allegedly 
based their decision on the fact that the family hade no Inventory File (Inventarnoe delo) for 
their residence but only the House Book (Domovaja kniga), where all members of the family 
were duly registered. Both bodies also referred to decision No. 842 of the Executive Body of 
Ashgabad (9 October 2004), which allegedly gave right to the authorities to demolish the 
building without providing alternative housing to the dwellers.  Reportedly, the decision of the 
municipal body was based on a number of outdated secondary legislative acts (or by-laws) and 
decrees of various state bodies that existed during Soviet times, which may not be in compliance 
with the legislation currently in force in Turkmenistan. Furthermore, Ms. Amanzhakhan Ataeva 
allegedly informed her situation to the President of Turkmenistan, the District Court, the 
Prosecutors Office, and the Institute for Democracy and Human Rights -under the President of 
Turkmenistan- requesting their intervention in the case. However, she had received no reply 
from the relevant authorities at the time this letter was sent. The Special Rapporteur requested 
information on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, if a complaint was lodged by or on 
behalf of the alleged victims; if the eviction and house demolition were effectively carried out; if 
appropriate consultations with the affected persons were undertaken; if, following the decisions 
of the Local Executive Body and District Court of Kopetdag Municipal Unit, the affected family

<p>88. On 14 may 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Representative of the Secretary-
General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Uganda 
regarding the living conditions of the Benet community living in the Kapchorwa District of 
Eastern Uganda, on the edges of the Mount Elgon National Park. According to the information 
received, the Benet community, who had been living in the area that had been now formally 
referred to as the Mount Elgon National Park since the mid-1800s, traditionally sustained 
themselves through pastoral and agricultural activities, hunting, bee-keeping, and making 
handicrafts. In the 1980s, the Benet community was resettled to an area just outside the formal 
forest reserve. The Benet people were supposed to be resettled in an area of 6000 hectares; 
however, it had been reported that the Government did not survey the land at that time, and the 
Benet in fact received 7500 hectares, referred to as the Benet Resettlement Area. According to 
the information received, the Government surveyed the Benet Resettlement Area in 1993. 
Following this, it declared the extra 1500 acres as part of the Mount Elgon National Park. Six 
thousand people who had been living on the additional 1500 hectares were declared 
&#8220;encroachers&#8221; and were evicted with no alternate land allocation. They were not consulted about 
their sudden loss of rights to their farms and homes and they received no compensation. For 
years, Government authorities reportedly carried out measures to attempt to evict families of the 
Benet community living in the area. On 27 October 2005, in a Consent Judgment and Decree 
before the High Court of Uganda at Mbale, the Uganda Land Alliance, representing the Benet 
community (applicants), and the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) and the Attorney General 
(respondents) agreed that the &#8220;members of the Benet community residing in the Benet 
Subcounty, including those residing in the Yatui Parish and the Kabsekek Village of Keen 
County and in Kwoti Parish of Tingey County&#8221; (communities within the 1500 acre area), are 
&#8220;indigenous inhabitants of the said areas which were declared a Wildlife Protected area or 
National Park&#8221;. The Consent Judgment held that the Benet community was entitled to stay 
within the area undisturbed and carry out agricultural activities. Despite this judgment, since 
2005, Kapchorwa District authorities and the UWA have allegedly continued to attempt to 
remove the Benet communities from their lands. According to the information received, in 
response, the Uganda Human Rights Commission appealed to the Attorney General on 25 April 
2009 to implement the Consent Judgment. In February 2008, the UWA reportedly forcefully </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
page 46 
 
evicted 1,400 Benet from their lands within the area formally declared a National Park, but 
which the Consent Judgment had ordered to be de-gazetted, leaving them seeking shelter in 
caves and trees. In April 2008, the Minister for Tourism intervened and ordered the resettlement 
of those evicted in two temporary settlements. Allegedly, the temporary resettlement areas were 
wholly inadequate for the Benet to sustain traditional agricultural practices and to maintain their 
traditional livelihoods. Finally, it was alleged that the UWA and the Ugandan Police frequently 
arrest community members and that community members have been subjected to beatings by 
UWA officials. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the measures taken to implement the 
Consent Judgment before of the High Court of Uganda in Mbale; on the measures taken to 
ensure that representatives of the UWA, the Police and district administration did not forcefully 
evict the Benet community from their lands; on the measures taken to develop education, 
infrastructure, health and social services, as instructed in the High Court&#8217;s Consent Judgment; on 
the measures taken to ensure the human rights to an adequate standard of living of the Benet; and 
if the affected community was consulted by the authorities at any stage.

<p>90. On 1 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
the United States of America regarding imminent forced evictions of the residents of the Villas 
del Sol in the municipality of Toa Baja in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. According to the 
information received by the Special Rapporteur, Villas del Sol is a squatter community housing 
an estimated 211 families, most of whom are of Dominican descent and many of whom are poor, 
female-headed households with children. For almost twenty years, prior to August 2009, this 
settlement had been tolerated by the Puerto Rican government. Following Hurricane Georges in 
September 1998 and the subsequent alleged identification of the area as a flood risk zone, many 
families left the area. However, over time, new families moved to the area. Most of the current 
squatters reportedly had no options for relocation to housing elsewhere. On Monday August 3, 
2009, allegedly following orders given by the Puerto Rico Land Authority, construction crews 
began erecting concrete barriers around the community&#8217;s homes. It is reported that residents 
received no prior warning and peacefully wished to express their fear of losing their homes by 
forming a human shield. Bayam&#243;n riot police officers on call nearby allegedly responded with 
the use of taser guns, pepper spray and batons. A number of residents were hurt, including a 
pregnant woman and her young son. Criminal charges were also filed against some members of 
the Villas del Sol community. The incident is said to have lasted over seven hours. Furthermore, 
information received indicated that water and electricity services were cut off from Villas del Sol 
on Friday August 7, 2009. Disease was reportedly spreading following poor sanitation 
conditions. A fortnight after the latter of these two incidents, eviction notices were reportedly 
filed by the government. Court testimonies by high ranking government officials allegedly 
justified the above-described proceedings based on the area&#8217;s alleged classification as a flood 
zone. An agreement between the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
Puerto Rican Government agreement allegedly required the community of Villas del Sol to be 
relocated by December 2009. A failure to do so would allegedly have resulted in the loss of 
millions of dollars of FEMA funding. An appropriate relocation site remained unidentified by 
government authorities. A solution aiming to guarantee an orderly and appropriate relocation of 
the Villas del Sol residents had reportedly been offered by local donors. A nearby plot of land 
donated for the purpose by a doctor would be used for constructing adequate housing within an 
estimated time period of six months. However, according to information received, this solution 
has been rejected by government officials primarily because they deem the delay to be too long. 
In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on whether the affected community was appropriately consulted in 
advance of both the fencing in and cutting off of basic services to Villas del Sol; on the legal 
bases for the attempted fencing in of the Villas del Sol community; if the affected persons were 
given adequate advanced notice; if the responsible authorities identified an appropriate relocation 
site for the affected communities to be available immediately following the eviction; if local 
authorities envisaged restoring water and electricity supplies to the Villas del Sol community; on 
the content of the alleged agreement between FEMA and the Government of Puerto Rico used to 
justify the action taken, the reasons why concerned parties have allegedly been unable to access 
it; on the classification of Villas del Sol as a flood zone, particularly concerning the history of 
this classification, the physical parameters of the zone and whether such a classification is of 
permanent or temporary nature; on the measures foreseen, in the case that evictions were 
unavoidable, to provide for impartial and independent monitoring, as well as adequate and fair 
compensation.

<p>92. On 30 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Uzbekistan after receiving information that the authorities of Tashkent had undertaken 
demolition of houses and beautification projects in relation to the preparations of the 2,200th 
anniversary of the city's founding. According to the information received, evictions and 
demolitions also took place to permit the sale of land in Tashkent to private companies. 
Reportedly, residents of houses that had already been demolished were relocated to the outskirts 
of the city without being offered adequate compensation or housing of equal value. Allegations 
also stated that the evicted residents have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the situation. 
Other demolitions seemed to have been planned and it was feared that residents were to be 
relocated under the same conditions. The Special Rapporteur requested further information on 
the number of persons affected by the beautification and other renovation plans in Tashkent; if an 
impact assessments had been carried out before undertaking the demolitions and relocations; if 
other alternatives to demolition and relocation had been considered; if the affected people were 
appropriately consulted and participated in the renovation projects, if they were appropriately 
notified of the administrative decisions concerning demolitions; on the legal recourses available 
to the affected people, especially the poorest; on the measures taken by the authorities to prevent </p>

<p>94. On 25 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of 
Vietnam concerning the recent eviction of monks and nuns from Bat Nha monastery and their 
future eviction from Phuoc Hue temple, which was due to take place on 30 November 2009.  
According to the allegations, on 27 September 2009, about 150 people armed with sticks and 
hammers attacked the Bat Nha monastery. Plain-clothes police officers were reportedly amongst 
the mob and police officers in uniform blocked the roads leading to the monastery. The mob 
violently proceeded to the eviction of 379 monks and nuns from the monastery. Some monks and 
nuns were beaten up and four of them were sexually assaulted. According to the reports, the 
monks did not attempt to defend themselves, but they sat down and started to chant in order to 
respond in a non-violent manner to the attacks. Two senior brothers, Mr. Phap Hoi and Mr. Phap 
Sy, were beaten and were held under house arrest without proper charges in Hanoi and Nha 
Trang. After being evicted, the monks and nuns were offered refuge by Mr. Thai Thuan, the 
abbot of Phuoc Hue temple in Bao Loc. On 28 September 2009, the police threatened the abbot, 
claiming he had no right to offer refuge to the Bat Nha monks and nuns. The police then 
surrounded the temple and they started an intimidation campaign. Flyers were distributed in Bao 
Loc in order to damage the reputation of the abbot and he was denounced through loudspeakers 
in schools and in the streets. Police officers threatened to undertake similar attacks on Phuoc Hue 
temple, than the ones undertaken against the Bat Nha monastery on 27 September 2009. The 
intimidation campaign culminated with the demand that the abbot surrendered fifteen monks and 
nuns. Under this extreme pressure, the abbot acceded to the demand and surrendered fifteen 
monks and nuns, who were taken into police custody and were driven more than 200 km away 
from Ho Chi Minh city. The other Bat Nha monks and nuns who remained in Phuoc Hue temple 
were reportedly undergoing pressure and threats from the authorities to leave the temple. They 
were living under strict control of the police. The police harassed and obstructed people who 
were bringing food and clothing to the temple. Anyone who stopped in the vicinity of the temple 
was being stopped and questioned. Concerns were expressed that the crackdown on the Bat Nha 
Buddhist community was due to the teachings of Mr. Thich Nhat Hanh, leader of Bat Nha 
Buddhist community. Mr. Thich Nhat Hanh would have made public recommendations in 2007 
in order to improve religious freedom, including a request to disband the country's religious 
police. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special </p>

details, and where available the results, of any judicial investigation, or any criminal charges and 
other inquires carried out in relation to this case.

<p>95. On 3 February 2009, the Government of Vietnam replied to the joint allegation letter sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 25 November 2009. Following the Mission&#8217;s note verbale No. 028 
dated 2 February 2010, the Government informed on the updated report from the Government of 
Viet Nam stating that after visiting Lam Dong Province from 8-10 December 2009, the 
Counselor from the EU Mission allegedly confirmed that no acts of destruction took place at 
Phuoc Hue Temple and agreed that if Lang Mai and any Buddhist organization wished to carry 
out its activities, it should abide by laws and the Charter of the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha.

<p>96. On 31 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Zimbabwe regarding the threat of forced evictions in settlements in the Harare suburbs of 
Gunhill and Borrowdale, and along Harare&#8217;s watercourses. According to the information 
received, in July 2009 the Harare City Council announced proposals for an alleged urban clean-
up programme. The Deputy Mayor of the Harare City Council, Emmanuel Chiroto, has 
reportedly declared that informal settlements, consisting of both stalls and homes, in the suburbs 
of Gunhill and Borrowdale, as well as along Harare&#8217;s watercourses needed to be removed and 
hence would be target of mass evictions. Health and safety concerns were cited to justify the 
planned actions. The city&#8217;s officials allegedly feared that poor water and sanitation facilities may 
result in another cholera epidemic and also wished to take measures to clamp down on illegal 
trade that is reportedly taking place in the targeted settlements. The exact numbers of people 
living in the targeted settlements were not available. However, information received suggests 
that thousands of people, consisting to a large part of informal vendors and their families, would 
be affected across Harare. The announced evictions in Gunhill alone are reportedly expected to 
affect an estimated 200 people. The alleged planned demolition of vending markets and other 
informal structures will reportedly leave these communities without shelter, as well as without a 
means by which to earn their livelihood. Notice of the mass forced evictions was reportedly 
given at short notice and communicated only indirectly to affected communities. According to 
information received, community consultation did not take place and due process was not been 
guaranteed. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested further information on whether alternative solutions other than 
demolitions and subsequent forced eviction were considered to address possible health and 
safety concerns in the targeted settlements; if the affected communities and their representatives 
were appropriately consulted both when considering these alternatives and at all stages of the 
subsequent planned eviction procedure; if the exact dates for the allegedly planned urban clean-
up action had been determined; if communities were given adequate prior notice; on the 
measures taken by the authorities to prevent people from becoming homeless or from being 
inadequately housed as a consequence of the evictions; on the measures foreseen, in the case that 
evictions are unavoidable, to provide for impartial and independent monitoring, as well as 
adequate and fair compensation. </p>

<p>98. On 19 June 2009 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the European Bank for 
Reconstructions and Development concerning persistent reports of forced evictions of informal 
settlements, mainly inhabited by Roma communities, in Belgrade. One of these evictions 
concerned communities living under the Gazela Bridge to make way for the reparation of the 
bridge, a project financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur expressed her wish to share with the Bank the concerns that she 
raised with the Government of the Republic of Serbia earlier on, which is reproduced further 
below. In view of the role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 
financing the reconstruction of the Gazela Bridge, the Special Rapporteur deemed important to 
receive information from this institution. Thus, the Special Rapporteur requested further 
information on whether the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has guidelines 
for implementation of projects where no other solution to displacement exist, asked to be provide 
with these guidelines if they exist; and requested explanations on how the Bank ensures that 
these guidelines are implemented by the actors involved in the project. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur inquired if the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had been in 
contact with the City of Belgrade in regard to the foreseen eviction and, if yes, what measures 
were demanded so that the evictions were carried out in full compliance with international norms 
and human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>99. On 2 July 2009, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) replied 
to the urgent appeal of 19 June 2009. The EBRD informed that the rehabilitation of the Gazela 
Bridge is being financed by the European Investment Bank, whilst EBRD is financing the 
section of the R251 Belgrade Ring Road between Lestane and Zeleznik and the inner city 
sections of the E70 and E75 highways which provide access to the Gazela Bridge. The project is 
governed by the EBRD's 2003 Environment Policy which makes specific reference to the IFC 
policy on involuntary resettlement and the World Bank Group's O.D. 4.30. The disbursement of 
both the EIB and the EBRD loans for this Project is dependent on the approval and 
implementation of a Resettlement Action Plan for all families living under Gazela Bridge who 
are considered to be Project Affected People. EIB and EBRD are in regular contact with the City 
Administration with the objective of reaching a satisfactory solution for the project affected 
community. The City was informed by the banks that resettlement that involves forced evictions 
would not be acceptable. The banks have been assured by the City of Belgrade that the families 
living below the Gazela Bridge will not be forcefully evicted. All Serbian government officials 
have been informed that no disbursement will take place without a satisfactory resettlement 
action plan. Provisions for reporting and monitoring the implementation of the RAP, as well as </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.1

acceptable grievance procedures for the affected families must be incorporated into the final 
document, if it is to be approved. The Belgrade City Administration has accepted responsibility 
for resettlement of those families that would be eligible under the City's Action Plan for the 
Resettlement of Unhygienic Settlements on the Territory of Belgrade in 2009. Of the 175 
families living under the bridge, 114 would be eligible, referred to as Component A of the 
Gazela Resettlement Action Plan. The City Administration did not accept responsibility for the 
resettlement of the remaining 61 families, who are migrants and temporary workers that have 
come to Belgrade from other parts of Serbia (Component B). However, the disbursement of the 
EIB and EBRD loans is dependent on the approval of a Resettlement Plan encompassing 
components A and B of the families living under Gazela Bridge. A completed Resettlement 
Action plan has not been presented yet. The most recent proposal from the City Administration 
was reportedly designed to deal with all Unhygienic Settlements on the Territory of Belgrade 
and foresees to provide mobile housing units for the families with Belgrade residency. These 
units would not be acceptable to the banks unless they meet certain standards. Finally, the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Policy of the Republic of Serbia assumed responsibility for 
resettling the remaining 61 families, assist them to return to their municipalities of origin and 
provide them with appropriate shelter and support to find employment.

establishment by Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) of an open pit gold mine in Akyem, 
more precisely within the Ajenua-Bepo Forest Reserve in the Birim North District of Ghana's 
Eastern Region may have on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights of the 
affected communities. The Special Rapporteurs shared the concerns that they had had raised with 
the Government of Ghana, which and drew the company's attention to the relevant provisions of 
international human rights law. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the allegations, they 
Special Rapporteurs requested further information on whether any study on social, 
environmental and health impact of the open mine project had been realized by NGGL and the 
conclusions of the studies; on the measures taken by NGGL to ensure that the open mine project 
does not have disproportionate negative impacts on the environment and on the livelihoods of 
neighboring communities; on the measures been taken by NGGL to ensure that water resources 
would be protected from risks of leakages, and to ensure that mining wastes would be disposed

<p>101. On1 July 2009, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) replied to the allegation letter sent 
on 1 July 2009. NGGL informed their committement to implement the best possible practices in 
the areas of Social and Environmental management and impact mitigation at the Akyem project. 
Newmont's Akyem project has been studied extensively by international and national 
environmental experts, members of the communities living in the area, and by Ghana's 
government, as well as the International Finance Corporation (IFC). It has been the subject of a 
thorough environmental impact study, public consultation processes, an independent review 
process, and an overall regulatory review. Newmont project leaders have engaged with 
numerous community representatives, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and 
international organizations on many occasions. 600 meetings and events between 2004 and early 
2009 were held with different local and regional stakeholders. The Akyem communities 
demonstrated overwhelming support for the project at three public hearings. In addition, more 
than 150 Ghanaian community leaders issued statements in support of the Akyem project. 
Concerns raised by NGOs during the EIS process were discussed with local communities and the 
results presented in an environmental impact study that was reviewed by the Ghana EPA. The 
analyses of the company were also reportedly reviewed by national and international 
environmental experts. The Ghana EPA was granted Newmont an environmental permit to 
operate at Akyem.
