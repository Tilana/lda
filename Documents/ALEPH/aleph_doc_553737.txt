the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as
appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect the amount of any increase or
decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee, in
accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 2.06 hereof or, in the case of an increase
resulting from the payment of PIK Interest, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
The terms and provisions contained in the Notes will constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and the
Issuer, the Note Guarantor and the Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby. However, to the extent any provision of any Note conflicts with the express provisions of
this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture shall govern and be controlling.

registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee thereof, duly executed by the Issuer and authenticated by the Trustee
as hereinafter provided, to the extent such Notes at that time are DTC-eligible securities. The aggregate principal amount of the
Global Notes may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the
Depositary as hereinafter provided. The Issuer initially appoints DTC to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.
(b) Global Notes in General. Each Global Note shall represent such of the outstanding Securities as shall be specified therein
and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and

appropriate, to reflect the payment of PIK Interest, exchanges, redemptions and conversions.

Exhibit A attached hereto, and in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Global Notes but without the Global Note
legend thereon and without the “Schedule of Exchanges of Interests or Increases/Decreases in the Global Note” attached
thereto.
Section 2.02 Execution and Authentication.
At least one Officer of the Issuer shall sign the Notes for the Issuer by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose
signature is on a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Note is authenticated, the Note shall nevertheless be valid.
19
A Note signed by the Issuer in accordance with this Section 2.02 shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature
of the Trustee. The signature of the Trustee shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this
Indenture. The form of Trustee’s certificate of authentication to be borne by the Notes shall be substantially as set forth in Exhibit
A attached hereto.
The Trustee shall, (a) upon receipt of an Issuer Order, requesting authentication pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof (an

the Trustee. The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
The Issuer shall be responsible for making all calculations and determinations with respect to accrued interest payable,
including with respect to any PIK Notes or the increase of principal amount of any Global Note as a result of a PIK Payment
contemplated hereby. The Issuer shall make all such calculations and determinations in good faith and, absent manifest error,
the Issuer’s calculations shall be final and binding on Holders. Upon written request, the Issuer shall promptly provide a
schedule of its calculations to the Trustee.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate Notes. Unless limited by
the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each
reference in this Indenture to authenticating by the Trustee includes authenticating by such agent. An authenticating agent has
the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer.
The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered
as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to the provisions of this Indenture

Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.
Section 2.03 Registrar, Paying Agent and Depositary.
The Issuer shall maintain (i) an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange
(“Registrar”) and (ii) an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (“Paying Agent”). The Issuer initially
appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent for which it is entitled to appropriate compensation. The Registrar shall
keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange.
The Issuer may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term “Registrar” includes any
co-registrar and the term “Paying Agent” includes any additional paying agent. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of
the name and address of each such agent or registrar. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to
any Holder. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the
Issuer fails to appoint or maintain another entity as
20
Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar, except that for purposes of Article 3 and Article 8 and Section 4.09, neither the Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
act as Paying Agent.
The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate
the provisions of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent.
The Issuer initially appoints DTC to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes. The Trustee shall act as custodian for
the Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.
Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.
The Issuer shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for
the benefit of the Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Issuer in making any such payment. While any
such default continues, the Paying Agent shall be required to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Issuer at any time may
require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other
than the Issuer or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. If the Issuer or a Subsidiary
acts as Paying Agent (subject to Section 2.03 hereof), it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the
Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization related to the Issuer, the Trustee shall
serve as Paying Agent for the Notes.
Section 2.05 Holder Lists.
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and
addresses of all Holders and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuer shall
furnish to the Trustee at least seven (7) Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee
may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and
addresses of the Holders, including the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by each such Holder, and the Issuer shall
otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a).
Section 2.06 Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes.
(a) A Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of
the Depositary to the Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a
successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Notes will be exchanged by the Issuer for
Definitive Notes if:
(1) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee written notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor
Depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days after the date of such written notice from the Depositary;
21
(2) the Issuer in its sole discretion determines that the Global Notes (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for Definitive
Notes and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee; or
(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
Upon the occurrence of either of the preceding events in clause (1) or (2) above, Definitive Notes shall be issued in such names
as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in
Section 2.07 and Section 2.10 hereof. Every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Note or
any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.06 or Section 2.07 or Section 2.10 hereof, shall be authenticated and delivered in
the form of, and shall be, a Global Note. A Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note other than as provided in this
Section 2.06(a), however, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be transferred and exchanged as provided in Sections
2.06(b) and (c) hereof.
(b) Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in the Global Notes. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Applicable
Procedures. Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes also will require compliance with either subparagraph (1) or
(2) below, as applicable, as well as one or more of the other following subparagraphs, as applicable:
(1) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Note. Beneficial interests in any Global Note may be transferred to
Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Note. No written orders or instructions shall be
required to be delivered to the Registrar to effect the transfers described in this Section 2.06(b)(1).
(2) All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial Interests in Global Notes. In connection with all transfers and exchanges of
beneficial interests that are not subject to Section 2.06(b)(1) above, the transferor of such beneficial interest must deliver to the
Registrar either:

(A) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures directing the Depositary to credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in another Global Note in an amount
equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged; and
22
(B) instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the Participant account to
be credited with such increase; or
(b) both:
(A) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures directing the Depositary to cause to be issued a Definitive Note in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be
transferred or exchanged; and
(B) instructions given by the Depositary to the Registrar containing information regarding the Person in whose name such
Definitive Note shall be registered to effect the transfer or exchange referred to in subparagraph (1) above.
(c) Additional Legends. The following legends will appear on the face of all Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued under this
Indenture unless specifically stated otherwise in the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

ANY RELATED SECURITY DOCUMENT, THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY WITH RESPECT THERETO, AND
CERTAIN OF THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER HEREOF ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERCREDITOR
AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE). IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND,
THE TERMS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS NOTE, THE INDENTURE OR
ANY SECURITY DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO, THE TERMS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL
GOVERN AND CONTROL. EACH HOLDER OF THIS NOTE, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, IRREVOCABLY AGREES
TO BE BOUND BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.”
23
(d) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes. At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been
exchanged for Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or canceled in whole and not in
part, each such Global Note will be returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof.
At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who
will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive Notes, the principal amount of
Notes represented by such Global Note will be reduced accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such Global Note by
the Trustee upon written notice to the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if
the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial
interest in another Global Note, such other Global Note will be increased accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such
Global Note by the Trustee upon written notice to the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such
increase.
(e) Other. The following provisions shall also apply to transfers and exchanges of the Notes:
(1) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Issuer will execute and the Trustee will authenticate Global Notes
and Definitive Notes upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof or at the Registrar’s
request.
(2) No service charge will be made to a Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note for any
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar
governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge
payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06 and 9.05 hereof).
(3) The Registrar will not be required to register the transfer of or exchange of any Note selected for redemption in whole or in
part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.
(4) All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive
Notes will be the valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
(5) Neither the Registrar nor the Issuer will be required:
(A) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen
(15) days before the day of any selection of Notes for redemption under Section 3.02 hereof and ending at the close of business
on the day of selection;
24
(B) to register the transfer of or to exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion
of any Note being redeemed in part; or

treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment
of principal of and interest on such Notes and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Issuer shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.
(7) The Trustee will authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof.
(8) All certifications, certificates and Opinions of Counsel required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06
to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile.
Section 2.07 Replacement Notes.
If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or the Issuer and the Trustee each receive evidence to their satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note if the
Trustee’s requirements for replacements of Notes are met. If required by the Trustee or the Issuer, an indemnity bond must be
supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of (i) the Trustee to protect the Trustee and (ii) the Issuer to protect the
Issuer, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The
Issuer or the Trustee may charge for their expenses in replacing a Note.
Every replacement Note is an obligation of the Issuer and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
Section 2.08 Outstanding Notes.
The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those
delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the
provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding.
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, the replaced Note ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives
proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it
ceases to accrue.
25
Subject to Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer holds the
Note; provided, however, Notes held by the Trustee shall not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of Section 3.07 hereof.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Issuer, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, in its capacity as Paying Agent, on a
redemption date or Maturity Date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes
shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue interest.
Section 2.09 Treasury Notes.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent,
Notes owned by the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer shall be considered as though not outstanding, except that for purposes
of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows to be so owned shall be considered as not outstanding.
Section 2.10 Temporary Notes.
Pending the preparation of Definitive Notes, the Issuer (and the Note Guarantor) may execute, and upon receipt of an
Authentication Order the Trustee shall, within a reasonable time period, authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes that are
printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise reproduced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the
tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the Officers executing such Notes may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such
Notes.
If temporary Notes are issued, the Issuer (and the Note Guarantor) shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. The Definitive Notes shall be printed, lithographed or engraved, or provided by any combination thereof, or
in any other manner permitted by the rules and regulations of any principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed, all as determined by the Officers executing such Definitive Notes. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the
temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency
maintained by the Issuer for such purpose pursuant to Section 4.02 hereof, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer (and the Note Guarantor) shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, within a reasonable time period, in exchange therefor the same aggregate principal amount of
Definitive Notes of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Notes.
Section 2.11 Cancellation.
The Issuer at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the
Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, redemption, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one
else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, redemption, exchange, payment, replacement or
26
cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act and the
Trustee). Certification of confirmation of the cancellation of all cancelled Notes shall be delivered to the Issuer upon its written
request therefor. The Issuer may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that have been redeemed or paid or that have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. All cancelled Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its
customary manner.
Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest.
If the Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, the Issuer shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus,
to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record
date, which date shall be at the earliest practicable date but in all events at least five (5) Business Days prior to the payment
date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Issuer shall fix or cause to be fixed each
such special record date and payment date. At least fifteen (15) days before the special record date, the Issuer (or, upon the
written request of the Issuer, the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Issuer) shall mail to the Holders a notice that
states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.
Section 2.13 Deposit of Moneys.
Subject to Section 3.05 hereof, prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each date on which the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes are due, the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee or Paying Agent in immediately available funds,
money sufficient to make cash payments, if any, due on such date in a timely manner that permits the Trustee or the Paying
Agent to remit payment to the Holders on such date.
Section 2.14 CUSIP Numbers.
The Issuer may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in notices of
redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that, any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may
be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any
defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the “CUSIP”
numbers.
Section 2.15 Agreement to Subordinate the Notes.
The Issuer agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is subordinated
in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 2, to the prior payment in full of all Issuer Senior Debt
(whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for
the benefit of and enforceable by holders of Issuer Senior Debt. The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall in all respects
rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Issuer
Senior Debt) and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness
27
of the Issuer; and only Indebtedness that is Issuer Senior Debt shall rank senior to the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes in
accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article 2 shall be subject to Section 2.25 hereof.
Section 2.16 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy.
Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Issuer to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial
dissolution of the Issuer or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership of or similar proceeding relating to the
Issuer or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or in any marshaling of the Issuer’s assets and liabilities:
(1) holders of Issuer Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Issuer Senior Debt (including interest
accruing after, or which would accrue but for, the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable
Issuer Senior Debt, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed) before the Holders of Notes shall be entitled to
receive any payment with respect to the Notes; and
(2) until all Obligations with respect to the Issuer Senior Debt (as provided in clause (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any
payment or distribution to which Holders of Notes would be entitled but for this Article 2 shall be made to holders of Issuer
Senior Debt as their interests may appear.
Section 2.17 Default on Issuer Senior Debt.
(a) The Issuer may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or any Holder in respect of Obligations with respect to
the Notes and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property until all principal and other
Obligations with respect to the Issuer Senior Debt have been paid in full if:
(1) a payment default on Issuer Senior Debt occurs and is continuing; or
(2) any other default occurs and is continuing on any Issuer Senior Debt that permits the holders of such Issuer Senior Debt to
accelerate its maturity, or otherwise demand its payment, and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a “Notes Payment
Blockage Notice”) from the Issuer or the holders of such Issuer Senior Debt.
(b) The Issuer may and will resume payments or any distributions in respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon the earlier
of:
(1) in the case of a payment default with respect to any Issuer Senior Debt, the date upon which such default is cured or waived,
and
(2) in the case of a nonpayment default with respect to any Issuer Senior Debt, upon the earlier of the date on which such
nonpayment default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Notes Payment Blockage Notice is
received, unless in the case of this clause (2), the maturity of any Issuer Senior Debt has been accelerated or demand for
payment of such Issuer Senior Debt made, and such acceleration or demand for payment has not been waived or cancelled, if
this Article 2 otherwise permits such payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment, distribution or acquisition.
28
Section 2.18 Demand for Payment.
If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Issuer or the Trustee will promptly notify holders of the
Issuer Senior Debt, of the acceleration; provided that any failure to give such notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the
provisions of this Article 2. If any Issuer Senior Debt is outstanding, the Issuer may not make a payment of the Notes until ten
(10) Business Days after holders of such Issuer Senior Debt receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may make a
payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes only if this Indenture and Federal law otherwise permits payment at that
time.
Section 2.19 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.
In the event that the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes receives any payment of, or any distributions with respect to, any
Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the payment is prohibited by Section 2.17 hereof and the Trustee or the
Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that the payment is prohibited by Section 2.17 hereof, such payment will be held by
the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and will be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to,
holders of Issuer Senior Debt as their interests may appear under the agreement, indenture or other document (if any) pursuant
to which any Issuer Senior Debt may have been issued or incurred, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect
to Issuer Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Issuer Senior Debt.
Section 2.20 Subrogation.
After all Issuer Senior Debt has been Discharged and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders of Notes will be subrogated to the
rights of the holders of Issuer Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to such Issuer Senior Debt to the extent that
distributions otherwise payable to the Holders of Notes have been applied to the payment of such Issuer Senior Debt. A
distribution made under this Article 2 to the holders of Issuer Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of
Notes is not, as between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on the Notes.
Section 2.21 Relative Rights.
This Article 2 defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and holders of Issuer Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture will:
(1) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders of Notes, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay
principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the Notes in accordance with their terms;
(2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and creditors of the Issuer other than their rights in relation to holders of Issuer
Senior Debt; or
(3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject
to the rights of holders of Issuer Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Notes and
such other rights of holders of Issuer Senior Debt as set forth herein.
29
Section 2.22 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Issuer.
No right of the holders of Issuer Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes may be
impaired by any act or failure to act by the Issuer or any Holder or by the failure of the Issuer or any Holder to comply with this
Indenture.
Section 2.23 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 2 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee will not be charged with
knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the
Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee has received at its Corporate
Trust Office at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the
payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 2. Only the Issuer or holders of Issuer Senior Debt
may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 2 will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to
Section 7.07 hereof.
(b) The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Note, a member of, or a participant
in, DTC or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC or its nominee or of any participant or member
thereof, with respect to any ownership interest in the Notes or with respect to the delivery to any participant, member, beneficial
owner or other Person (other than DTC) of any notice (including any notice of redemption or purchase) or the payment of any
amount or delivery of any Notes (or other security or property) under or with respect to such Notes.
All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders in respect of the Notes shall
be given or made only to the registered Holders (which shall be DTC or its nominee in the case of a Global Note). The rights of
beneficial owners in any Global Note shall be exercised only through DTC subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
DTC. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by DTC with respect to its
members, participants and any beneficial owners.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer
imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any
transfers between or among DTC participants, members or beneficial owners in any Global Note) other than to require delivery
of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly
required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the
express requirements hereof.
30
Section 2.24 Article 2 Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment.
The failure of the Issuer to make a payment on the Notes by reason of any provision in this Article 2 shall not be construed as
preventing the occurrence of a Default by the Issuer. Nothing in this Article 2 shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or
the Trustee to make a demand for payment on the Notes pursuant to this Article 2.
Section 2.25 Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of Government Securities
held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes pursuant to Article 8 or Article 12 hereof shall
not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Issuer Senior Debt or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 2, and
none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Issuer or holders of Issuer Senior Debt or any other
creditor of the Issuer, provided that, the subordination provisions of this Article 2 were not violated at the time the applicable
amounts were deposited in trust pursuant to Article 8 or Article 12 hereof, as the case may be.
Section 2.26 Trustee Entitled to Rely.
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this Article 2, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes will be
entitled to rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in
Section 2.26 hereof are pending or upon any certificate of such representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other
Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of Issuer Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Issuer, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this
Article 2. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of the holders
of Issuer Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 2, the Trustee shall be entitled to
request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Issuer Senior
Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other
facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 2 and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled
to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The
provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 hereof shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee
pursuant to this Article 2.
Section 2.27 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
Each Holder of Notes, by the Holder’s acceptance thereof, authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on such Holder’s behalf
to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 2, and appoints
the Trustee to act as such Holder’s attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
31
Section 2.28 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Issuer Senior Debt.
The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Issuer Senior Debt and shall not be liable to any
such holder if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders or any other Person, money or assets to which
holders of Issuer Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 2 or otherwise, except if such payment is made as a result
of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
Section 2.29 Reliance by Holders of Senior Debt on Subordinated Provisions.
Each Holder, by accepting a Note, acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Section 2.15 through Section 2.30 hereof
are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to holders of Issuer Senior Debt, whether such Issuer Senior
Debt was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold,
such Issuer Senior Debt and holders of such Issuer Senior Debt shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such
subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Issuer Senior Debt. If requested by a
holder of Issuer Senior Debt, or a representative of such a holder, the Trustee shall execute the Note Subordination Agreement.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, holders of Issuer Senior Debt may, at any time and from
time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring liability to the Trustee or the Holders
and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 2 or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to
holders of Issuer Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend
the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any Issuer Senior Debt, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner any Issuer
Senior Debt, or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which any Issuer Senior Debt is outstanding;
(ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing any Issuer Senior
Debt; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of any Issuer Senior Debt; and (iv) exercise or
refrain from exercising any rights against the Issuer and any other Person.
Section 2.30 Amendments.
The provisions of Section 2.15 through Section 2.30 hereof may not be amended or modified without the written consent of
holders of Issuer Senior Debt.
ARTICLE 3
REDEMPTION
Section 3.01 Notices to Trustee.
If the Issuer elects to redeem Notes pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee, at least thirty (30)
days but not more than sixty (60) days before a redemption date, an Officers’ Certificate setting forth (i) that the redemption shall
occur pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and (iv) that
the redemption price shall equal one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date.
32
Section 3.02 Selection of Notes to be Redeemed.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be
redeemed in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are
listed (and such listing is known to the Trustee), or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis or by such other method that
most nearly approximates a pro rata selection to the extent practicable, in each case with respect to any Global Notes, the
procedures of the Depositary.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected
for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in
denominations of $1.00 and integral multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof (or if a PIK Payment has been made, in denominations
of $1.00 and any integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof with respect to a PIK Note or the portion of a Global Note
constituting PIK Interest). Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes
called for redemption.
Section 3.03 Notice of Redemption.
At least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days before a redemption date, the Issuer shall mail a notice of redemption
by first class mail (and, to the extent permitted by applicable procedures or regulations, electronically) to the Trustee and each
Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at such Holder’s registered address.
The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the redemption date;
(2) the redemption price;
(3) if any Note is being redeemed in part only, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the
redemption date, upon cancellation of the original Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion shall be issued;
(4) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(5) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;
(6) that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;
33
(7) the paragraph of the Notes and/or the section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being
redeemed; and
(8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed
on the Notes.
At the Issuer’s written request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the name of the Issuer and at the Issuer’s
expense; provided that the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, at least fifteen (15) days (unless a shorter period is acceptable to
the Trustee) prior to the date such notice is to be given, an Officers’ Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and a
copy of the notice to be provided to the Holders. The notice mailed or distributed electronically in the manner herein provided
shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not a Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to
give such notice by mail or electronic distribution or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Note shall not affect the validity
of the proceeding for the redemption of any other Note.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of redemption may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes pursuant to Article 8 hereof or a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
pursuant to Article 12 hereof.
Section 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption has been mailed or distributed electronically to the Holders in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof,
Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. At any time prior to the
mailing of a notice of redemption to the Holders pursuant to Section 3.03 hereof, the Issuer may withdraw, revoke or rescind any
notice of redemption delivered to the Trustee without any continuing obligation to redeem the Notes as contemplated by such
notice of redemption.
Section 3.05 Deposit of Redemption Price.
At or before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the redemption date, the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee (to the extent not
already held by the Trustee) or with the Paying Agent money in immediately available funds sufficient to pay the redemption
price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Notes to be redeemed on that date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall
promptly return to the Issuer any money deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Issuer in excess of the amounts
necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all Notes to be redeemed.
Interest on the Notes to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on the applicable redemption date, whether or not such Notes are
presented for payment, if the Issuer makes or deposits the redemption payment in accordance with this Section 3.05. If a Note is
redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid
interest should be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If
any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Issuer to comply
with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is
paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes
and in Section 4.01 hereof.
Section 3.06 Notes Redeemed in Part.
34
Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Issuer shall issue, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication
Order, shall authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Issuer, a new Note equal in principal amount to the unredeemed
portion of the Note surrendered; provided that, each new Note will be in a principal amount of $1.00 or an integral multiple of
$1.00 in excess thereof (or if a PIK Payment has been made, in denominations of $1.00 and any integral multiple of $1.00 in
excess thereof with respect to a PIK Note or the portion of a Global Note constituting PIK Interest).
Section 3.07 Optional Redemption.
The Notes shall be subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, at any time, at a price equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to,
but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant interest record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date).
Section 3.08 No Mandatory Redemption.
The Issuer shall not be required to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Notes. The Notes shall not have
the benefit of any sinking fund.
ARTICLE 4
COVENANTS
Section 4.01 Payment of Notes.
The Issuer shall pay the principal and premium, if any, of, and interest on, the Notes on the dates and in the manner provided in
the Notes. With respect to the Initial Interest Period, the Issuer has, pursuant hereto, elected to pay 3.0% per annum of interest
due for such period in the form of a PIK Payment (the “Initial PIK Election”). After the Initial Interest Period, in the event that the
Issuer shall determine to pay any interest in the form of a PIK Payment, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent (if other than the Trustee), with respect to each interest period subsequent to the Initial Interest Period, no later than one
(1) Business Day prior to the beginning of the relevant interest period, a written notice (the “PIK Notice”) setting forth whether the
Issuer has elected to pay any portion of the interest payment for such period in the form of a PIK Payment and, if so, the
percentage of interest to be paid in the form of a PIK Payment. The Trustee shall promptly deliver a corresponding notice to the
Holders. In the absence of an election for any interest payment date, interest on the Notes shall be payable according to the
method of payment set forth in the PIK Notice for the previous interest payment date, or, if no prior PIK Notice was delivered to
the Trustee for the previous interest payment date, the Issuer shall be deemed to have elected to pay interest due on such
interest payment date in the form of a PIK Payment at the maximum percentage permitted hereunder and under the Notes.
35
Principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be considered paid on the date due:
(a) if the Paying Agent, other than the Issuer or a Subsidiary, holds as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on such date money
deposited by the Issuer in immediately available funds and designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and
interest then due; or
(b) only to the extent the Issuer has elected to pay any part of the interest then due in the form of a PIK Payment or PIK Notes, if
on such date the Trustee has received (i) an Issuer Order, pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof, to increase the balance of any Global
Note to reflect such PIK Payment or (ii) PIK Notes duly executed by the Issuer together with an Authentication Order.
Such Paying Agent shall return to the Issuer, no later than three (3) Business Days following the date of payment, any money
that exceeds such amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest then due and payable on the Notes.
To the extent lawful, the Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Code)
on overdue principal in cash at the rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the then applicable interest rate on the
Notes; the Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Code) on overdue
installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate to the extent lawful and in the same
method of payment as the previous interest period.
In order for the Maturity Date to be the Extended Maturity Date, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee a Maturity Date Extension
Notice no later than the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business Days prior to the Initial Maturity Date and (y) five (5) Business Days after
the Funding Condition has been satisfied. Upon receiving such Maturity Date Extension Notice, the Trustee shall promptly
deliver a corresponding notice to Holders. If the Maturity Date Extension Notice is not delivered within the time periods specified
in the preceding sentence (whether or not the Funding Condition has been satisfied), the Maturity Date shall be the Initial
Maturity Date.
Section 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Issuer shall maintain an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where Notes may
be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the
Notes and this Indenture may be served. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency,
or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made
or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Issuer may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided that, no such
designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such
purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in
the location of any such other office or agency.
36
The Issuer hereby designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as one such office or agency of the Issuer in accordance
with Section 2.03 hereof (and not as an agent or office for the service of legal process).
Section 4.03 Reports.
(a) Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules
and regulations promulgated by the Commission, the Issuer shall file with the Commission (and provide the Trustee and holders
with copies thereof, without cost to each holder, and to the Trustee, within fifteen (15) days after it files them with the
Commission),

period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations), such other reports on Form 8-K (or any successor or comparable form), and
(4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the Commission if it were
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the Commission if the Commission does not
permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to each prospective purchaser, market maker
or securities analyst that provides its email address to the Issuer and certifies that it is a prospective purchaser, market maker (or
intends to be a market maker) or securities analyst, as the case may be, of the Notes in addition to providing such information in
writing to the Trustee and the Holders, in each case within fifteen (15) days after the time the Issuer would be required to file
such information with the Commission if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(b) In addition, the Issuer will make such information available to prospective investors, market makers and securities analysts
that request such information by providing their email address to the Issuer and certifying that they are a prospective purchaser,
market maker (or intend to be a market maker) or securities analyst, as the case may be. In addition, the Issuer has agreed that,

or otherwise permitted to furnish the Commission with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, it will
furnish to the holders of the Notes and to prospective investors, market makers and securities analysts upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) of the Securities Act.
37
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the
Holders if the Issuer has filed such reports with the Commission via the EDGAR filing system and such reports are publicly
available. In addition, the requirements of this Section 4.03 shall be deemed satisfied by the posting of reports that would be
required to be provided to the Trustee and the Holders on the Issuer’s public website.
(c) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to
rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates).
Section 4.04 Compliance Certificate.
(a) The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officers’ Certificate (provided that,
one of the signatories to such Officers’ Certificate shall be the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal
accounting officer of the Issuer) stating that, as to each such Officer signing such certificate, to the best of his or her knowledge,
the Issuer and the Note Guarantor are not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and
conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of
which he or she may have knowledge and what action the Issuer or the Note Guarantor, as applicable, is taking or proposes to
take with respect thereto).
(b) So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee forthwith upon any Officer becoming

however, that the Issuer shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment,
charge, levy or claim (a) whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
for which reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP or (b) where the failure to effect such payment is not
adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.
38
Section 4.06 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws.
The Issuer (and the Note Guarantor) covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon,
plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension, usury or other law, wherever

good faith that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuer and the Note Guarantor
taken as a whole and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders and (B) in connection with or
related to the Paducah Transition or any ACP Termination.
Section 4.08 Limitation on Liens.
The Note Guarantor shall not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset (including,

any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, except Permitted Liens.
Section 4.09 Repurchase Upon Change of Control.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall offer to repurchase all of the Notes then outstanding (the “Change
of Control Offer”) at a purchase price equal to one hundred one percent (101%) of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of repurchase, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date (the “Change of Control Payment”), provided, however, that
notwithstanding the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Notes pursuant to

(j) the Note Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under this Indenture or any Guarantee and such Default continues for
ten (10) days.
45
The Issuer shall, upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, deliver to the Trustee a written notice specifying such
Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or propose to take with respect thereto.
Section 6.02 Acceleration.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01(h) or (i) hereof) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least
twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may
declare the unpaid principal of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such
declaration the principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(h) or
(i) hereof occurs with respect to the Issuer or the Note Guarantor, all outstanding Notes shall ipso facto become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
Section 6.03 Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may pursue any
available remedy (under this Indenture or otherwise) to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Notes or to enforce the
performance of any provision of the Notes, this Indenture or the Security Documents.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of
Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults.
Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Trustee, may on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default
and its consequences under this Indenture if such waiver, rescission or cancellation would not conflict with any judgment or
decree except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, any Note or an Event of
Default with respect to any covenant or provision which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each outstanding Note affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
46
In the event of an Event of Default arising from Section 6.01(e) hereof, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof
(excluding, however, any resulting payment default) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any
action by the Trustee or the Holders, if prior to twenty (20) days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuer delivers an Officers’
Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness that is the basis of such Event of Default has been discharged or
(y) the Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such
Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis of such Event of Default has been cured.
Section 6.05 Control by Majority.
Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to
the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with law or this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents that the Trustee determines may be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Section 6.06 Limitation on Suits.
Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, a Holder may pursue a remedy with respect to this
Indenture, the Notes or the Security Documents only if all of the following conditions are met:
(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
(b) the Holders of at least twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written
request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(c) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense;
(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within sixty (60) days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested,
the provision of security or indemnity; and
(e) during such sixty (60)-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another
Holder.
Section 6.07 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal and
interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder; provided
47
that a Holder shall not have the right to institute any such suit for the enforcement of payment if and to the extent that the
institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender,
impairment, waiver or loss of the Lien of this Indenture or the Security Documents upon any property subject to such Lien.
Section 6.08 Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover
judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuer or the Note Guarantor for the whole amount of
principal and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent
lawful, interest on overdue interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,
including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Section 6.09 Trustee may File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order
to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer (or
any other obligor under the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and
distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the
estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be
paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders of the Notes may be
entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder
thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.10 Priorities.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall
pay out the money or property in the following order:
First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation,
expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
48
Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of
any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal and interest, respectively;
Third: without duplication, to Holders for any other Obligations owing to the Holders under the Notes or this Indenture; and
Fourth: to the Issuer or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and
payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.
Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken
or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by
the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or
a suit by Holders of more than ten percent (10%) in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

Within sixty (60) days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to
the Holders a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (but if no event described in TIA
Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve (12) months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The
Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA
Section 313(c).
Commencing at the time this Indenture is qualified under the TIA, a copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders
shall be filed with the Commission and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed. The Issuer shall promptly notify the
Trustee in writing when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or any delisting thereof.
Section 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity.
The Issuer shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services
hereunder and under the Security Documents as the Issuer and the Trustee may from time to time agree in writing. The
Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuer shall
reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to
the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee’s
agents and counsel, except such disbursements, advances and expenses as shall be determined to have been caused by its
own negligence or willful misconduct.
Except as set forth below, the Issuer and the Note Guarantor jointly and severally shall indemnify the Trustee and its officers,
directors and employees against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by it without negligence
or bad faith on its part arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture and
the Security Documents, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture or the Security Documents against the
Issuer and defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Issuer and the Note Guarantor promptly of any claim of which it has received
written notice for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Issuer and the Note Guarantor shall not
relieve the Issuer or the Note Guarantor of its obligations hereunder. The Issuer shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall
cooperate in the defense. In the event that, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee, a conflict of interest or conflicting defenses
would arise in connection with the representation of the Issuer and the Trustee by the same counsel, the Trustee may have
separate counsel and the Issuer shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. Neither the Issuer nor the Note
Guarantor shall be obligated to pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
53
The obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantor under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
To secure the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantor’s payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to
the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that money or property held in trust to pay principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(h) or (i) hereof occurs,
the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy
Code.
The Trustee will comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.
Section 7.08 Replacement of Trustee.
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor
Trustee’s acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08, provided that costs have been paid to the Trustee prior to
effectiveness of such removal or resignation.
The Trustee may resign at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuer in writing. The
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and
the Issuer in writing. The Issuer may remove the Trustee if:
(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;
(b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any
Bankruptcy Code;
(c) a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Issuer shall promptly appoint
a successor Trustee. Within one (1) year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within sixty (60) days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring
Trustee, the Issuer or the Holders of at least ten percent (10%) in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition, at
the Issuer’s expense, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
54
If the Trustee after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six (6) months fails to comply with
Section 7.10 hereof, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the
appointment of a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuer. Thereupon,
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights,
powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the
Holders. Upon payment of its charges hereunder, the retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to
the successor Trustee, provided that, all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided
for in Section 7.07 hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Issuer’s obligations
under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee, and the Issuer shall pay to any such replaced or
removed Trustee all amounts owed under Section 7.07 hereof upon such replacement or removal.
Section 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another
corporation or banking association, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
Section 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification.
There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that shall (a) be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of
the United States of America or of any state thereof or of the District of Columbia authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trustee power, (b) be subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state or the District of Columbia authority,
and (c) have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of
condition.
This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1), 310(a)(2) and 310(a)(5).
The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 310(b); provided that, there shall be excluded from the operations of TIA Section 310(b)(1)
any indenture or indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of the
Issuer are outstanding, if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA Section 310(b)(1) are met.
Section 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Issuer.
The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has
resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. The provisions of TIA
Section 311 shall apply to the Issuer, as obligor on the Notes.
55
Section 7.12 Electronic Communication.
The Trustee agrees to accept and act upon instructions or directions pursuant to this Indenture sent by e-mail, pdf or facsimile
transmission. If the Issuer elects to provide the Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic
method) and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, the Trustee’s reasonable understanding of such
instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or
indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon, and compliance with, such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflict or
are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The Issuer agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such
electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation, the risk of the Trustee acting
on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties.

forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or
by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, but, except as specified

result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that the
Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and

defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and
(g) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating, subject to
certain factual assumptions and bankruptcy and insolvency exceptions, that all conditions precedent provided for in this
Indenture relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
Section 8.05 Deposited Cash and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all cash and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the
Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05) pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of
the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Paying Agent, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes
and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any other Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the
Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest.

an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
58
(b) Subject to any applicable unclaimed property laws, any cash and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds
thereof) deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer, in trust for the payment of the principal of,

restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, or if any event occurs at any time in the period ending on the ninety-first
(91st) day after the date of deposit pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 hereof which event would constitute an Event of
Default under Section 6.01(h) or (i) hereof had Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, not occurred,
then the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantor’s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as
though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent
is permitted to apply such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided that, if
the Issuer makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its

the Intercreditor Agreement shall be permitted to be effected without the consent of the Collateral Agent and of any
Representative for any Designated Senior Claims as may be required thereunder.
Upon the request of the Issuer, accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such
supplemental indenture or amendment, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06 hereof
required or requested by the Trustee, the Trustee shall join with the Issuer in the execution of any supplemental indenture or
amendment authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such
supplemental indenture or amendment that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
Section 9.02 With Consent of Holders.
(a) Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuer, the Note Guarantor (to the extent any amendment or supplement
relates to the Guarantee) and the Trustee may amend or

aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Section 2.08 hereof shall determine
which Notes are considered to be “outstanding” for purposes of this Section 9.02.

amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent
of the Holders of Notes as contemplated in this Section 9.02 and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in
Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Issuer and the Note Guarantor in the execution of such amended or
supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter
into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
(c) It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
(d) After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuer will mail to the Holders of
Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuer to mail such
notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental
indenture or waiver.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this
Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of, or the premium (including, without limitation, redemption premium) on, or change the fixed maturity of
any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the payment on redemption of the Notes; or alter the price at which repurchases

Guarantee or make any change to any subordination provisions of this Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any Holder
of Notes.
(f) Unless otherwise provided in this Indenture, without the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2⁄3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, the Issuer, the Note Guarantor and the Trustee may not amend or supplement the
Security Documents to release Collateral from the Liens created by the Security Documents if the Fair Market Value of such
Collateral exceeds $5,000,000.
Section 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
If, at the time of an amendment to this Indenture or the Notes, this Indenture shall be qualified under the TIA, every amendment
to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until a supplemental indenture, an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing
consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the
consenting Holder’s Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. A supplemental indenture, amendment or
waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Issuer may fix a record date for determining which Holders must consent to such supplemental indenture, amendment or
waiver. If the Issuer fixes a record date, the record date shall be fixed at (i) the later of thirty (30) days prior to the first solicitation
of such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation pursuant to
Section 2.05 hereof, or (ii) such other date as the Issuer shall designate.
62
Section 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about a supplemental indenture, amendment or waiver on any Note thereafter
authenticated. The Issuer in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the
amendment or waiver.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment or waiver.
Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or
supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. In executing any
amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully
protected in relying upon, the documents required by Section 13.04 hereof, an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
stating that the execution of such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized and permitted by this Indenture. Neither
the Issuer nor the Note Guarantor may sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors of the Issuer
(in the case of an amendment or supplemental indenture being signed by the Issuer) or of the Note Guarantor (in the case of an
amendment or supplemental indenture being signed by the Note Guarantor) approves it.
ARTICLE 10
COLLATERAL AND SECURITY
Section 10.01 Security Documents.
The due and punctual payment of the principal and premium, if any, of, and interest on, the Notes when and as the same shall
be due and payable, whether on an interest payment date, at the Maturity Date, by acceleration, repurchase, redemption or
otherwise, interest on the overdue principal of and interest (to the extent permitted by law), if any, by the Note Guarantor
pursuant to its Guarantee, and the payment and performance of all other Obligations of the Note Guarantor under this Indenture
and the Security Documents (the “Secured Obligations”), shall be secured as provided in the Security Documents, which the
Note Guarantor has entered into simultaneously with the execution of this Indenture and will be secured as provided in the
Security Documents hereafter determined as required or permitted by this Indenture.
Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Note, consents and agrees to the terms of each Security Document (including, without
limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure, the provisions providing for release of collateral and the provisions providing
for the automatic amendment or waiver of the Security Documents, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement), as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its respective terms, and
authorizes and directs the Collateral Agent and the Trustee to enter into this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and, to the
extent applicable, the Security Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder
in accordance therewith. The Collateral Agent hereunder shall have only such duties and responsibilities as are explicitly set
forth herein, in the Intercreditor Agreement and in the
63
respective Security Documents and no others; provided that the Collateral Agent hereunder shall only take action with respect to
or under the Security Documents in accordance with the written instructions of the Trustee acting on behalf of the Holders, and
shall apply any proceeds from the enforcement of any security as set forth therein subject in all cases to the Intercreditor
Agreement. The provisions of Article 7 hereof relating to the Trustee acting in such capacity shall apply to the Collateral Agent
hereunder to the extent applicable. In addition, the Issuer and the Note Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby agree to
indemnify the Collateral Agent hereunder on the same basis as their indemnity to the Trustee in Article 7 hereof with respect to
actions taken or not taken by it in accordance with this Indenture and the Security Documents.
The Note Guarantor shall do or cause to be done, and the Issuer shall cause the Note Guarantor to do or cause to be done, all
such acts and things as may be necessary or proper, or as may be required by the provisions of the Security Documents or the

and by the Security Documents, as from time to time constituted, so as to render the same available for the security and benefit
of the Secured Obligations secured hereby, according to the intent and purposes herein and therein expressed. The Note
Guarantor shall, and the Issuer shall cause the Note Guarantor to, take any and all actions reasonably required to cause the
Security Documents to create and maintain, as security for the Secured Obligations, valid and enforceable, perfected (except as
expressly provided herein or in the Security Documents) Liens in and on all the Collateral, in favor of the Collateral Agent,
superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, and subject to no other Liens, other than Permitted Liens as provided
herein and therein; provided that, the Collateral Agent’s Lien securing the Secured Obligations shall be subordinated to the
extent and pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and, if applicable, the Intercreditor Agreement.
Section 10.02 Collateral Agent.
Subject to Section 10.09, the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to ensure that the Collateral exists or is
owned by the Issuer or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Collateral Agent’s Liens have
been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular
priority. Upon the receipt by the Collateral Agent of a written request of the Issuer signed by two Officers (a “Security Document
Order”), the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to execute and enter into, and shall execute and enter into, without the further
consent of any Holder or the Trustee, any Security Document to be executed after the Issue Date. Any such execution of a
Security Document shall be at the direction and expense of the Issuer, upon delivery to the Collateral Agent of an Officers’
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of the Security Document
have been satisfied. The Holders, by their acceptance of the Notes, hereby authorize and direct the Security Agent to execute
such Security Documents.
Section 10.03 Opinions.
The Issuer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee within three (3) months after each anniversary of the Issue Date,
an Opinion of Counsel, dated as of such date, stating either that (i) in the opinion of such counsel, all action has been taken with
respect to the
64
recording, registering, filing, re-recording, re-registering and refiling of all supplemental indentures, financing statements,
continuation statements or other instruments of further assurance as is necessary to maintain the Liens of the Security
Documents and reciting the details of such action, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions or (ii) in the opinion of such
Counsel, no such action is necessary to maintain such Liens, which Opinion of Counsel also shall state what actions it then
believes are necessary to maintain the effectiveness of such liens during the next year, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions.
Section 10.04 Release of Collateral.
(a) Subject to compliance with Section 10.05 hereof, Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by the Security
Documents and the rights of the Holders of such Secured Obligations to the benefits and proceeds of the Liens on the
Collateral, and the obligations of the Note Guarantor under the Security Documents (or, in the case of clauses (2) through
(4) below, such obligations with respect to such released Collateral), will automatically terminate and be discharged:
(1) upon payment in full of the Notes and all other Obligations under this Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents then
due and owing,
(2) upon the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of such Collateral made in accordance with Section 4.10,
(3) pursuant to an amendment or waiver in accordance with Article 9 hereof,
(4) as permitted or required pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement,
(5) upon satisfaction and discharge of the Notes pursuant to Article 12 hereof or upon a Legal Defeasance or Covenant

Upon release of the Collateral, or any portion thereof, from the Subordinated Liens, in each case in accordance with
Section 10.04(a)(2) or 10.04(a)(4), all rights, title and interest of the Collateral Agent therein shall thereupon cease and, at the
written request of the Note Guarantor and at the cost and expense the Note Guarantor, the Collateral Agent (i) shall execute
such instruments as the Note Guarantor may reasonably request to evidence such release of record and (ii) if the Collateral so
released is in possession of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall
65
deliver such Collateral to the Note Guarantor as directed in such written request. Upon release of the Collateral, or any portion
thereof, from the Subordinated Liens in accordance with this Section 10.04 (other than Section 10.04(a)(2) or 10.04(a)(4)), the
Trustee shall not direct the Collateral Agent to release any Subordinated Lien on any Collateral unless and until the Trustee
shall have received an Officers’ Certificate certifying that all conditions precedent hereunder have been met and such other
documents required by Section 10.05 hereof. Upon compliance with the above provisions, the Trustee shall direct the Collateral
Agent to, at the request and expense of the Issuer, execute and deliver the release of any Collateral permitted to be released
pursuant to this Indenture or the Security Documents.
(b) The release of any Collateral from the terms of the Security Documents shall not be deemed to impair the security under this
Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof and of the Security Documents if and to the extent the Collateral is released
pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and the Security Documents.
Section 10.05 Certificates of the Issuer.
The Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee, prior to each proposed release of Collateral, all documents required by TIA
Section 314(d). The Trustee may, to the extent permitted by Section 7.01 hereof, accept as conclusive evidence of compliance
with the foregoing provisions the appropriate statements contained in such instruments. Any certificate or opinion required by
TIA Section 314(d) may be made by an Officer of the Issuer, except in cases where TIA Section 314(d) requires that such
certificate or opinion be made by an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert within the meaning of TIA Section 314(d).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.05, the Issuer will not be required to comply with all or any portion of
TIA Section 314(d) if it determines, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of the TIA Section 314(d)
and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including “no action” letters or exemptive
orders, all or any portion of TIA Section 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released Collateral, including in connection
with the sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of inventory by, or of damaged, worn out, scrap or other obsolete property
of, the Note Guarantor in the ordinary course of business.
Section 10.06 Certificates to the Trustee.
In the event that the Note Guarantor wishes to release Collateral in accordance with the Security Documents, the Issuer or the
Note Guarantor shall deliver to Trustee the certificates required by Section 10.04 and Section 10.05 hereof, together with an
Opinion of Counsel stating that such documents satisfy the documentary requirements of TIA Section 314(d), in connection with
such release and, based on such determination, will deliver a certificate to the Collateral Agent setting forth such determination.
Section 10.07 Authorization of Actions to be Taken by Trustee Under Security Documents.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may, without the consent of the Holders, on behalf of the
Holders, take or direct the Collateral Agent to take all actions the Trustee deems necessary or appropriate in order to (a) enforce
any of the terms of the Security
66
Documents and (b) collect and receive any and all amounts payable in respect of the Secured Obligations of the Note
Guarantor. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall have the power to institute and to maintain such
suits and proceedings to prevent any impairment of the Collateral by any acts that may be unlawful or in violation of the Security
Documents or this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings to preserve or protect its interest and the interests of the Holders in
the Collateral (including power to institute and maintain suits or proceedings to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with
any legislative or other governmental enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid if the
enforcement of, or compliance with, such enactment, rule or order would impair the security interest hereunder or be prejudicial
to the interests of the Holders or the Trustee). Subject to Section 10.09, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have
any duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control of a bailee or any income derived therefrom or as to the preservation of
parties or rights.
Section 10.08 Authorization of Receipt of Funds by Trustee Under Security Documents.
The Trustee is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of the Holders distributed under the Security Documents, and,
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, to make further distributions of such funds to the Holders according to the provisions of
this Indenture and the Security Documents.
Section 10.09 Collateral Agent.
(a) The Collateral Agent is authorized and empowered to appoint one or more co-Collateral Agents as it deems necessary or
appropriate.
(b) Subject to Section 7.01 hereof, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of any Collateral,
for the legality, enforceability, effectiveness or sufficiency of the Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreement, or liability in
connection with enforcing the provisions of these documents, for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any
Subordinated Lien, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such matters or for any failure to demand, collect, foreclose or realize
upon or otherwise enforce any of the Subordinated Liens or Security Documents or any delay in doing so. The Collateral Agent
will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords to its own property, and the Collateral Agent will not be
liable or responsible for any loss or diminution in the value of any of the Collateral by reason of the act or omission of any carrier,
forwarding agent or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral Agent in good faith.
(c) The Collateral Agent (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) will be subject to such directions as may be given it
by the Trustee from time to time (as required or permitted by this Indenture).
(d) The Collateral Agent will be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the enforcement of the
Subordinated Liens or Security Documents.
67
(e) In acting as Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent may rely upon and enforce and shall have each and all of the rights,
privileges, protections, powers, immunities, indemnities and benefits of the Trustee under Article 7 hereof.
(f) The Holders of Notes agree that the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to the rights, privileges, protections, immunities,
indemnities and benefits provided to the Collateral Agent by the Security Documents
Section 10.10 Relative Rights; Intercreditor Agreement.
The Issuer and the Note Guarantor each agree, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that notwithstanding the date,
time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing the Secured Obligations or any Secured
Priority Liens securing the Designated Senior Claims, and notwithstanding any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect or
lapse in perfection of, or avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise of, any such Liens, the security interest in the
Collateral securing the Secured Obligations shall be junior in priority to all Liens securing any Designated Senior Claims. The
foregoing lien subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by holders of Designated Senior Claims. If requested by the
holder of any Designated Senior Claim or a representative of such a holder, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent each shall
execute the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement defines the relative rights of holders of the Subordinated Liens
and the holders of the Senior Priority Liens that will exist upon execution of the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in the Notes or in any Security Documents, upon execution of the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Subordinated Liens securing the Secured Obligations, and the exercise of any right or remedy with respect
thereto, will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of, on the
one hand, the Intercreditor Agreement and, on the other hand, any Note, this Indenture or any Security Document, upon
execution of the Intercreditor Agreement the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control. Each Holder, by its
acceptance of any Note, irrevocably agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and each Holder by its
acceptance of any Note hereby directs, and the Trustee and Collateral Agent shall and are hereby authorized, to enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement. Each Holder by its acceptance of the Notes agrees that it will be bound by, and will take no action
contrary to, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the present
and future holders of the Designated Senior Claims and such holders are intended third party beneficiaries of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Each Note and each Security Document shall bear a conspicuous legend that the Liens securing the Secured
Obligations under this Indenture, and rights and remedies related thereto, are subordinated pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case in the manner set forth therein.
ARTICLE 11
GUARANTEES
Section 11.01 Guarantee.
Subject to this Article 11, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the
Note Guarantor, hereby unconditionally guarantees (such
68
guarantee, the “Guarantee”) to each Holder and the Trustee irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Indenture, the
Notes, the Security Documents or the Obligations of the Issuer hereunder or thereunder: (i) the due and punctual payment of the
principal and premium, if any, of, and interest on, the Notes, whether at the Maturity Date or on an interest payment date, by
acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise; (ii) the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal and
premium, if any, of, and interest on, the Notes, if lawful; (iii) the due and punctual payment and performance of all other
Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, this Indenture and the Security Documents, all in accordance with the terms set forth
herein and in the Notes and the Security Documents; and (iv) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any
Notes or any of such other Obligations hereunder or under the Notes or the Security Documents, the due and punctual payment
or performance thereof in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at the Maturity Date, by acceleration or
otherwise.
The Note Guarantor hereby agrees that, subject to this Article 11, (i) its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional irrespective
of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Obligations of the Issuer
hereunder or thereunder, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to
any provisions hereof or thereof, any releases of Collateral, any amendment of this Indenture, the Notes or the Security
Documents, any delays in obtaining or realizing upon or failures to obtain or realize upon Collateral, the recovery of any
judgment against the Issuer or any of the Subsidiaries, any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstance that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Note Guarantor and (ii) the Guarantee will not be
discharged except by complete payment and performance of the Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, this Indenture and
the Security Documents or as otherwise provided in Section 11.07 hereof.
The Note Guarantor hereby agrees that it shall not be entitled to and irrevocably waives (to the extent lawful) (i) diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claim with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to
require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and (ii) any claim or other rights that it
may now or hereafter acquire against the Issuer that arise from the existence or performance of its Obligations under its
Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of a Holder against the Issuer or any
Collateral that a Holder now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, and including, without limitation, the right to take
or receive from the Issuer or any of the Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property, by setoff or in any other
manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer or the Note Guarantor, trustee, liquidator,
or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the Note Guarantor, any amount paid by the Issuer or the Note
Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and
effect; provided that, following the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Guarantee shall only be reinstated to the extent of the
Unconditional Interest Guarantee.
69
The Note Guarantor agrees that, as between the Note Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the
other hand, (i) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.02 hereof for the
purposes of the Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration as to the
Issuer of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of those Obligations as
provided in Section 6.02 hereof, those Obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by
the Note Guarantor for the purpose of the Guarantee.
The obligations of the Note Guarantor under its Guarantee, this Indenture and the Security Documents are not obligations of, or
guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States of America.
Section 11.02 Execution and Delivery of Guarantee.
To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 hereof, the Note Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of the Note Guarantor on each Note authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture will be executed on behalf of the Guarantor by one of its Officers. The Note
Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 hereof will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee.
If an Officer whose signature is on the Indenture or on the Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
authenticates the Note on which a Guarantee is endorsed, the Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the
Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Note Guarantor. Neither the Issuer nor the Note Guarantor shall be required
to make a notation on the Notes to reflect the Guarantee or any release, termination or discharge thereof and any such notation
shall not be a condition to the validity of the Guarantee.
Section 11.03 Limitation on Note Guarantor’s Liability.
The Note Guarantor and by its acceptance hereof each Holder hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the
guarantee by the Note Guarantor pursuant to its Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar Federal or state
law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Note Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the
Obligations of the Note Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all
other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Note Guarantor, result in the Obligations of the Note Guarantor under its Guarantee
not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under Federal or state law or render the Note Guarantor
insolvent.
70
Section 11.04 Rights Under the Guarantee.
(a) No payment by the Note Guarantor pursuant to the provisions hereof shall entitle the Note Guarantor to any payment out of
any Collateral or give rise to any claim of the Note Guarantor against the Trustee or any Holder.
(b) The Note Guarantor waives notice of the issuance, sale and purchase of the Notes and notice from the Trustee or the
Holders from time to time of any of the Notes of their acceptance and reliance on the Guarantee.
(c) No set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation or any defense of any kind or nature (other than
performance by the Note Guarantor of its obligations hereunder and other than (except with respect to the Unconditional Interest
Claim) the occurrence of a Termination Event) that the Note Guarantor may have or assert against the Trustee or any Holder
shall be available hereunder to the Note Guarantor.
(d) The Note Guarantor shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses (including all reasonable attorneys’ fees), that may be
incurred by the Trustee in enforcing or attempting to enforce the Guarantee.
Section 11.05 Guaranty of Payment Not Collection.
The Obligations of the Note Guarantor hereunder shall constitute a guaranty of payment when due and not a guaranty of
collection. The Note Guarantor agrees that its Obligations hereunder are independent of the Obligations of the Issuer, and that a
separate action may be brought against it, whether such action is brought against the Issuer or whether the Issuer is joined in
such action. The Note Guarantor agrees that its liability hereunder shall be immediate and shall not be contingent upon the
exercise or enforcement by the Trustee or the Holders of whatever remedies they may have against the Issuer, or the
enforcement of any lien or realization upon any security the Collateral Agent or the Trustee may at any time possess. The Note
Guarantor agrees that any release that may be given by the Collateral Agent, Trustee or the Holders to the Issuer shall not
release the Note Guarantor.
Section 11.06 No Subrogation.
Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Note Guarantor hereunder, the Note Guarantor shall not be entitled to
be subrogated to any of the rights of the Trustee or any Holder against the Issuer or any collateral security or guarantee or right
of offset held by the Trustee or any Holder for the payment of the Note Guarantor’s Obligations under its Guarantee, nor shall the
Note Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Issuer in respect of payments made by
the Note Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Trustee and the Holders by the Issuer under the Notes and the
Issuer’s Obligations thereunder and hereunder are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to the Note Guarantor on account of
such subrogation rights at any time when the Notes and the Issuer’s Obligations thereunder and hereunder shall not have been
paid in full, such amount shall be held by the Note Guarantor in trust for the Trustee and the Holders, segregated from other
funds of the Note Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Note Guarantor, be turned over to the Trustee in the exact
form received by the Note Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Note Guarantor to the Trustee, if required), to be applied against the
Note Guarantor’s Obligations under its Guarantee.
71
Section 11.07 Release of the Note Guarantor
The Note Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all of its Obligations under its
Guarantee of the Notes and this Indenture (i) in connection with a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of this Indenture
in accordance with Article 8 hereof or upon satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture in accordance with Article 12 hereof or
(ii) other than with respect to the Unconditional Interest Guarantee, upon the occurrence of a Termination Event.
Section 11.08 Agreement to Subordinate the Guarantee.
The Note Guarantor agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the obligations of the Note Guarantor under its
Guarantee are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 11, to the prior payment
in full of all Designated Senior Claims (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or
guaranteed) and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Designated Senior Claims.
The Note Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee shall in all respects rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing
and future unsubordinated Indebtedness (other than Designated Senior Claims) of the Note Guarantor, and will be senior in
right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Note Guarantor; and only Indebtedness of the Note
Guarantor that is Designated Senior Claims shall rank senior to the obligations of the Note Guarantor under its Guarantee in
accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article 11 shall be subject to Section 11.19 hereof.
Section 11.09 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy.
Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Note Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or
partial dissolution of the Note Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership of or similar proceeding
relating to the Note Guarantor or its property in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or in any marshaling of the Note
Guarantor’s assets and liabilities:
(a) the holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such
Designated Senior Claims (including interest accruing after, or which would accrue but for, the commencement of any such
proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Designated Senior Claims, whether or not a claim for such interest would be
allowed) before Holders of the Notes shall be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Note Guarantor’s Guarantee;
and
(b) until all Obligations with respect to the Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor (as provided in clause (a) above) are
paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders of the Notes would be entitled but for this Article 11 shall be
made to holders of such Designated Senior Claims as their interests may appear.
72
Section 11.10 Default on Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor.
(a) The Note Guarantor may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or any Holder in respect of Obligations with
respect to the Note Guarantor’s Guarantee and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property
until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Designated Senior Claims have been paid in full if (1) a payment
default on Designated Senior Claims occurs and is continuing; or (2) any other default occurs and is continuing on any
Designated Senior Claims that permits holders of such Designated Senior Claims to accelerate its maturity, or otherwise
demand its payment, and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a “Payment Blockage Notice”) from the Issuer or the
Note Guarantor or the Representative of any Designated Senior Claims. For purposes of this Article 11 of this Indenture, the
existence of an Outstanding Government Claim shall constitute a payment default with respect to any Claims within the meaning
of clause (v) of the definition of Designated Senior Claims.
(b) The Note Guarantor may and will resume payments on any distributions in respect of such Note Guarantor’s Guarantee and
may acquire Notes upon the earlier of:
(1) in the case of a payment default with respect to the Designated Senior Claims, upon the date upon which such default is
cured or waived, and
(2) in the case of a nonpayment default with respect to the Designated Senior Claims, upon the earlier of the date on which such
nonpayment default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received,
unless, in the case of this clause (2), the maturity of any Designated Senior Claim has been accelerated or demand for payment
of such Designated Senior Claim made, and such acceleration or demand for payment has not been waived or cancelled;
if this Article 11 otherwise permits such payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment, distribution or
acquisition.
Section 11.11 Demand for Payment.
If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default and a demand for payment is made on the Note Guarantor
pursuant to this Article 11, the Issuer, the Trustee or the Note Guarantor shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated
Senior Claims or the Representative of such Designated Senior Claims of such demand; provided that any failure to give such
notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the provisions of this Article 11. If any Designated Senior Claim is outstanding, the
Note Guarantor may not pay its Guarantee until ten (10) Business Days after the Representatives of all the issuers of such
Designated Senior Claim receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay its Guarantee only if this Indenture and
Federal law otherwise permits payment at that time.
Section 11.12 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.
In the event that the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes receives any payment of, or any distributions with respect to, any
Obligations with respect to the Note Guarantor’s Guarantee at a time when the payment is prohibited by Section 11.10 hereof
and the Trustee or the Holder, as
73
applicable, has actual knowledge that the payment is prohibited by Section 11.10 hereof, such payment will be held by the
Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and will be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to, the
holders of Designated Senior Claims as their interests may appear or their Representative under the agreement, indenture or
other document (if any) pursuant to which Designated Senior Claims may have been issued or incurred, as the case may be, as
their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Designated Senior Claims
remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Designated Senior Claims.
Section 11.13 Subrogation.
After all Designated Senior Claims have been Discharged and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the
rights of holders of such Designated Senior Claims to receive distributions applicable to such Designated Senior Claims to the
extent that distributions otherwise payable to Holders of Notes under the Note Guarantor’s Guarantee have been applied to the
payment of Designated Senior Claims. A distribution made under this Article 11 to holders of such Designated Senior Claims
which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Note Guarantor and Holders, a payment by the Note
Guarantor on the Guarantee.
Section 11.14 Relative Rights.
This Article 11 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor. Subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement, nothing in this Indenture shall:
(a) impair, as between the Note Guarantor and Holders, the obligation of the Note Guarantor, which is absolute and
unconditional, to make payments under its Guarantee in accordance with its terms;
(b) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by the Note Guarantor under its
obligations with respect to its Guarantee, subject to the rights of holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor to
receive payments or distributions otherwise payable to Holders and such other rights of such holders of Designated Senior
Claims as set forth herein; or
(c) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Note Guarantor other than their rights in relation to holders of
Designated Senior Claims.
Section 11.15 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Note Guarantor.
No right of any holder of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the obligations of the
Note Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Note Guarantor or by its failure to comply
with this Indenture.
74
Section 11.16 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
Notwithstanding Section 11.10 hereof, the Trustee or any Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes and shall
not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any payments unless, not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives notice that payments
may not be made under this Article 11. Only the Issuer, the Note Guarantor or a Representative or a holder of Designated Senior
Claims shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if any Designated Senior Claim has a Representative, only
the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Section 11.17 Distribution or Notice to Representative.
Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor, the
distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative, if any.
Section 11.18 Article 11 Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment.
The failure of the Note Guarantor to make a payment pursuant its Guarantee by reason of any provision in this Article 11 shall
not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a default by the Note Guarantor under its Guarantee. Nothing in this Article 11
shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on the Note Guarantor pursuant to
this Article 11.
Section 11.19 Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of Government Securities
held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes pursuant to Article 8 or Article 12 hereof shall
not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor or subject to the restrictions set
forth in this Article 11, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Note Guarantor or any
holder of any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor or any other creditor of the Note Guarantor, provided that, the
subordination provisions of this Article 11 were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were deposited in trust pursuant
to Article 8 or Article 12 hereof, as the case may be.
Section 11.20 Trustee Entitled to Rely.
Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any
order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.09 hereof are
pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the
Trustee or to the Holders or (c) upon the Representatives of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor for the purpose of
ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Designated Senior Claims of
the Note Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts
pertinent thereto or to this Article 11. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good
75
faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Designated Senior Claims of the Note
Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such
Person to furnish evidence as to the amount of such Designated Senior Claim held by such Person, the extent to which such
Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this
Article 11, and, if any such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending
judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02
hereof shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 11.
Section 11.21 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
A Holder, by its acceptance of a Note, agrees to be bound by this Article 11 and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee in
writing, on such Holder’s behalf, to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination between
the Holders and the holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor as provided in this Article 11 and appoints the
Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Section 11.22 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor.
The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of any Designated Senior Claims of the Note
Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders or the
Note Guarantor or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of any Designated Senior Claims of the Note
Guarantor shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 11 or otherwise, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
Section 11.23 Reliance by Holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor on Subordinated Provisions.
Each Holder, by accepting a Note, acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Section 11.08 through Section 11.24 hereof
are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Designated Senior Claim of the Note
Guarantor, whether such Designated Senior Claim was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire
and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Designated Senior Claim and such holder of such Designated Senior Claim
shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in
continuing to hold, such Designated Senior Claim.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Designated Senior Claims of the Note
Guarantor may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring
liability to the Trustee or the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 11 or the
obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of the Designated Senior Claims of the Note Guarantor, do any one or more
of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of
76
payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor, or otherwise
amend or supplement in any manner any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor, or any instrument evidencing the
same or any agreement under which any Designated Senior Claim of the Note Guarantor is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange,
release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing any Designated Senior Claim of the Note
Guarantor; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of any Designated Senior Claim of the
Note Guarantor; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Note Guarantor and any other Person.
Section 11.24 Amendments.
The provisions of Section 11.08 through Section 11.24 hereof may not be amended or modified without the written consent of
holders of all Designated Senior Claims.
ARTICLE 12
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE
Section 12.01 Satisfaction and Discharge.
This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, except that the Issuer’s
and the Note Guarantor’s obligations under Section 7.07 hereof and the Trustee’s and the Paying Agent’s obligations under
Section 8.06 and Section 8.07 hereof shall survive, when:
(1) either:
(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for
whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or
(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing
of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one (1) year and the Issuer or the Note Guarantor
has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders,
cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, to the Maturity Date or redemption date;
(2) in respect of subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section 12.01, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit and any similar deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens to secure such
borrowings) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which
the Issuer or the Note Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or the Note Guarantor is bound (other
77
than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make the deposit required to effect such satisfaction and
discharge and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and in each case the granting of Liens to secure
such borrowings);
(3) the Issuer or the Note Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture; and
(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Notes at the Maturity Date or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions
precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money has been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to
subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section 12.01, the provisions of Sections 8.06, 8.07 and 12.02 hereof will survive. In addition,
nothing in this Section 12.01 will be deemed to discharge those provisions of Section 7.07 hereof, that, by their terms, survive
the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
Section 12.02 Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.06 hereof, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 12.01 hereof shall be
held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons
entitled thereto, of the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with
the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 12.01 hereof
by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or Governmental Authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantor’s obligations under this Indenture and
the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.01 hereof; provided that if
the Issuer has made any payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, any Notes because of the
reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment
from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1272-1(c) or (d) or 1.1275-4(b) (the “Tax Reporting Rules”) apply to the Notes (the “Tax
Reporting Determination”).
(b) No more than seventy-five (75) days after the Issue Date, the Issuer shall provide notice to the Trustee and the Holders of the
Tax Reporting Determination (the “Tax Reporting Determination Notice”). The Tax Reporting Determination Notice shall include
the following information: (i) whether the Notes are “traded on an established market” for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1273-2(f)(9), (ii) the Tax Issue Price, and (iii) the Tax Reporting Rules that the Issuer has determined to apply to the

Holder in the name of the Issuer and at the Issuer’s expense within ten (10) days of the Trustee’s receipt of such Tax Reporting
Determination Notice; provided that the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee at least ten (10) days (unless a shorter period is

whether or not a Holder receives such Tax Reporting Determination Notice. In any case, failure to give the Tax Reporting
Determination Notice to a Holder of any Note shall not affect the validity of the Tax Reporting Determination Notice with respect
to any other Holder. Any Holder may waive in writing the right to receive the Tax Reporting Determination Notice either before or
after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of delivery to such Holder of such Tax Reporting Determination Notice.
Such waivers shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken
in reliance upon such waiver.
83
(d) Each Holder, by its acceptance of the Notes, agrees to use the Tax Issue Price and to apply the Tax Reporting Rules that the
Issuer has determined to apply to the Notes, including, if applicable, the “comparable yield” and “projected payment schedule” or
the applicable payment schedule, for its own tax reporting and return filing.

8.0% PIK TOGGLE NOTE DUE 2019/2024
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise
indicated.
1. Interest. Centrus Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), as obligor, promises to pay interest on the principal
amount of this Note at the rate and in the manner specified below.
The Issuer shall pay, in cash, interest on the principal amount of this Note, at the rate of 8.0% per annum; provided that (a) for
any Interest Payment Date between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015, the Issuer may elect to pay up to 3% per annum
of interest then due in PIK Notes or PIK Interest and (b) for any Interest Payment Date from October 1, 2015 through the Initial
Maturity Date or the Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be, the Issuer may elect to pay up to 5.5% per annum of interest
then due in PIK Notes or PIK Interest. The Issuer shall pay interest semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year,
commencing on March 31, 2015, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an
“Interest Payment Date”).
Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Interest shall accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date. To the extent lawful, the
Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Code) on overdue principal in
cash at the rate of 2% per annum in excess of the then applicable interest rate on the Notes; the Issuer shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Code) on overdue installments of interest (without
regard to any applicable grace periods) at the same rate to the extent lawful and in the same method of payment as the previous
interest period.
2. Method of Payment. With respect to the Initial Interest Period, the Issuer has made the Initial PIK Election. After the Initial
Interest Period, in the event that the Issuer shall determine to pay any interest in the form of a PIK Payment, the Issuer shall
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee), with respect to each interest period subsequent to the
Initial Interest Period, no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the beginning of the relevant interest period a PIK Notice
setting forth whether the Issuer has elected to pay any portion of the interest payment for such period in the form of a PIK
Payment and, if so, the percentage of interest to be paid in the form of a PIK Payment. The Trustee shall promptly deliver a
corresponding notice to the Holders. In the absence of an election for an interest payment date, interest on the Notes shall be
payable according to the method of payment set forth in the PIK Notice (excluding for the purpose, the Initial PIK Election) for the
previous interest payment date, or if no prior PIK Notice was delivered to the Trustee for the previous
2  Only for PIK Notes.
A-5
interest payment date, notwithstanding the Initial PIK Election, the Issuer shall be deemed to have elected to pay interest due on
such interest payment date in the form of a PIK Payment at the maximum percentage permitted under the Indenture and the
Notes.
The Issuer shall pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the
close of business on the record date next preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are cancelled after such
record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date. The Holder must surrender this Note to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. The Issuer shall pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal
tender for payment of public and private debts. The Issuer may pay principal and interest by check to a Holder’s registered
address.
At all times, PIK Interest on the Notes will be payable (x) with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes
registered in the name of, or held by, DTC or its nominee on the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the
outstanding Global Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded down to
the nearest whole dollar) as provided in an Issuer Order from the Issuer to the Trustee and (y) with respect to Notes represented
by Definitive Notes, by issuing PIK Notes in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK
Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded down to the nearest whole dollar), and the Trustee will, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, authenticate and deliver such PIK Notes for original issuance to the Holders on the relevant record date,
as shown by the records of the register of Holders. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global
Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, the Global Note will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the
Interest Payment Date related to the PIK Payment. Any PIK Notes issued certificated form will be dated as of the applicable
Interest Payment Date and will bear interest from and after such date. All Notes issued pursuant to a PIK Payment will mature on
September 30, 2019 (or on September 30, 2024 if the Maturity Date of the Notes has been extended under the terms of
Section 2.01 of the Indenture) and will be governed by, and subject to, the terms, provisions and conditions of, the Indenture and
shall have the same rights and benefits as the Notes issued on the Issue Date.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Issuer may change any Paying
Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice to any Holder. Subject to certain exceptions, any Subsidiary may act in any such
capacity.
4. Indenture. The Issuer issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of September 30, 2014 (the “Indenture”) among the
Issuer, the Note Guarantor named therein, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent. The terms of the Notes include those stated in
the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”) (15 U.S. Code
Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture until such time as the Indenture is qualified under the TIA and
thereafter as in effect on the date the Indenture is so qualified. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred
to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms. The terms of the Indenture shall govern any inconsistencies between
the Indenture and the Notes. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned in the Indenture.
A-6
5. Optional Redemption. The Notes shall be subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, at any time, at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, up to the
redemption date.
6. Mandatory Redemption. There shall be no mandatory redemption of the Notes.
7. Denominations, Transfer, Exchange. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1.00 and
integral multiples of $1.00, except that PIK Notes or increased principal amount of a Global Note shall be in denominations of
$1.00 or any integral multiple of $1.00 in excess thereof. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged
as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee shall require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or
permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar and the Issuer need not exchange or register the transfer (i) of any Note or portion of a
Note selected for redemption or (ii) of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the
period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of a Note may be treated as its owner for all purposes, subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect to the record dates for the payment of interest.
9. Amendments and Waivers. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the written
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default (except certain payment
defaults) may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes). Without the consent of any Holders,
the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, may be amended or supplemented to cure
any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for assumption of the Issuer’s obligations to the Holders in the case
of a merger or consolidation, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to make any
change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes, or that does not adversely affect the legal
rights hereunder or under the Indenture or the Security Documents of any Holder, to release the Guarantee of the Notes
permitted to be released under the terms of the Indenture, to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or
maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or to comply with the requirements of the Trustee and the Depositary
(including its nominees) with respect to transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the
consent of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, the Issuer, the Note
Guarantor and the Collateral Agent may not amend or supplement the Security Documents or waive or modify the rights of the
Holders thereunder or the provisions of the Indenture relating thereto, in either case, in a manner adverse to the Holders. In
addition, unless otherwise provided in this Indenture, without the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2⁄3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, the Issuer, the Note Guarantor and the Trustee may not amend or
supplement the Security Documents to release Collateral from the Liens created by the Security Documents if the Fair Market
Value of such Collateral exceeds $5,000,000.
A-7
10. Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately, except that in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of
bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require security and indemnity
satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of 66 2⁄3% in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Issuer must furnish an
annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
11. Subordination of the Notes. Payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the Notes is subordinated to
the prior payment of Issuer Senior Debt on the terms provided in the Indenture.
12. Trustee Dealings with Issuer. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to,
accept deposits from, and perform services for the Issuer or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates,
as if it were not Trustee.
13. No Recourse Against Others. No director, member, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or controlling
person of the Issuer or the Note Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Note
Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture or the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes and the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this provision shall be construed as a waiver or release of any claims under the Federal securities laws.
14. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating
agent.
15. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants
in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in
common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
16. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification
Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP
numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers
either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other
identification numbers placed thereon.
17. Governing Law. This Note and the Indenture shall be construed, interpreted and the rights of the parties hereunder and
thereunder shall be determined in accordance with the
A-8
laws of the State of New York, as applied to contracts made and performed within the State of New York, including, without
limitation, Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules
327(b).
The Issuer shall furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made
to: Centrus Energy Corp., Two Democracy Center, 6903 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, Attention: General
Counsel.

Subordination.
2.1 Subordination of Subordinated Debt to Senior Debt. The Issuer agrees, and the Trustee agrees on behalf of each
Holder, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner
provided in this Article 2, to the prior payment in full of all Issuer Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or
hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by holders
of Issuer Senior Debt. The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall in all respects rank pari passu in right of payment with all
existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Issuer Senior Debt) and will be senior in right of
payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer; and only Indebtedness that is Issuer Senior Debt
shall rank senior to the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of
this Article 2 shall be subject to Section 2.11 hereof.
3
2.2 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Issuer to creditors upon a total
or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Issuer or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership of or
similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or in any marshaling of the
Issuer’s assets and liabilities:
(a) holders of Issuer Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Issuer Senior Debt (including interest
accruing after, or which would accrue but for, the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable
Issuer Senior Debt, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed) before the Holders of Notes shall be entitled to
receive any payment with respect to the Notes; and
(b) until all Obligations with respect to the Issuer Senior Debt (as provided in clause (a) above) are paid in full in cash, any
payment or distribution to which Holders of Notes would be entitled but for this Article 2 shall be made to holders of Issuer
Senior Debt as their interests may appear.
2.3 Default on Issuer Senior Debt.
(a) The Issuer may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or any Holder in respect of Obligations with
respect to the Notes and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property until all
principal and other Obligations with respect to the Issuer Senior Debt have been paid in full if:
(i) a payment default on Issuer Senior Debt occurs and is continuing; or
(ii) any other default occurs and is continuing on any Issuer Senior Debt that permits the holders of such Issuer Senior
Debt to accelerate its maturity, or otherwise demand its payment, and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a
“Notes Payment Blockage Notice”) from the Issuer or the holders of such Issuer Senior Debt.
(b) The Issuer may and will resume payments or any distributions in respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon
the earlier of:
(i) in the case of a payment default with respect to any Issuer Senior Debt, the date upon which such default is cured or
waived, and
(ii) in the case of a nonpayment default with respect to any Issuer Senior Debt, upon the earlier of the date on which
such nonpayment default is cured or waived and 179 days after the date on which the applicable Notes Payment
Blockage Notice is received, unless in the case of this clause (ii), the maturity of any Issuer Senior Debt has been
accelerated or demand for payment of such Issuer Senior Debt made, and such acceleration or demand for payment
has not been waived or cancelled,
if this Article 2 otherwise permits such payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment, distribution or
acquisition.
2.4 Demand for Payment. If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Issuer or the
Trustee will promptly notify holders of the Issuer Senior Debt,
4
of the acceleration; provided that any failure to give such notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the provisions of
this Article 2. If any Issuer Senior Debt is outstanding, the Issuer may not make a payment of the Notes until ten
(10) Business Days after holders of such Issuer Senior Debt receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may
make a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes only if this Agreement, the Indenture and federal law
otherwise permits payment at that time.
2.5 When Distribution Must be Paid Over. In the event that the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes receives any payment
of, or any distributions with respect to, any Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the payment is
prohibited by Section 2.3 hereof and the Trustee or the Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that the payment is
prohibited by Section 2.3 hereof, such payment will be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and
will be paid forthwith over and delivered upon written request to, holders of Issuer Senior Debt as their interests may
appear under the agreement, indenture or other document (if any) pursuant to which any Issuer Senior Debt may have
been issued or incurred, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Issuer Senior Debt remaining
unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Issuer Senior Debt.
2.6 Subrogation. After all Issuer Senior Debt is Discharged and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders of Notes will be
subrogated to the rights of the holders of Issuer Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to such Issuer Senior
Debt to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders of Notes have been applied to the payment of
such Issuer Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Article 2 to the holders of Issuer Senior Debt that otherwise
would have been made to Holders of Notes is not, as between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on the
Notes.
2.7 Relative Rights. This Article 2 defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and holders of Issuer Senior Debt.
Nothing in this Agreement will:
(a) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders of Notes, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the Notes in accordance with their terms;
(b) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and creditors of the Issuer other than their rights in relation to holders of
Issuer Senior Debt; or
(c) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default,
subject to the rights of holders of Issuer Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to
Holders of Notes and such other rights of holders of Issuer Senior Debt as set forth herein.
2.8 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Issuer. No right of the holders of Issuer Senior Debt to enforce the
subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes may be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Issuer or
any Holder or by the failure of the Issuer or any Holder to comply with the Indenture or this Agreement.
2.9 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 2 or any provision of the Indenture, the Trustee will not be charged
with knowledge of the existence of any facts
5
that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent
may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any
Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 2. Only the Issuer or holders of Issuer Senior Debt may give
the notice. Nothing in this Article 2 will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to
Section 7.07 of the Indenture.
(b) The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Note, a member of, or a
participant in, DTC or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of DTC or its nominee or of any
participant or member thereof, with respect to any ownership interest in the Notes or with respect to the delivery to any
participant, member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than DTC) of any notice (including any notice of
redemption or purchase) or the payment of any amount or delivery of any Notes (or other security or property) under or
with respect to such Notes.
All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders in respect of the
Notes shall be given or made only to the registered Holders (which shall be DTC or its nominee in the case of a Global
Note). The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Note shall be exercised only through DTC subject to the applicable
rules and procedures of DTC. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished
by DTC with respect to its members, participants and any beneficial owners.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on
transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note
(including any transfers between or among DTC participants, members or beneficial owners in any Global Note) other
than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to
do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial
compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
2.10 Article 2 Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment. The failure of the Issuer to make a
payment on the Notes by reason of any provision in this Article 2 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence
of a Default by the Issuer. Nothing in this Article 2 shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to
make a demand for payment on the Notes pursuant to Article 2 of the Indenture.
2.11 Trust Moneys Not Subordinated. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from
money or the proceeds of Government Securities held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes pursuant to Article 8 or Article 12 of the Indenture shall not be subordinated to the prior payment
of any Issuer Senior Debt or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 2, and none of the Holders shall be
obligated to pay over any such amount to the Issuer or holders of Issuer Senior Debt or any other creditor of the Issuer,
provided that, the subordination provisions of this Article 2 were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were
deposited in trust pursuant to Article 8 or Article 12 of the Indenture, as the case may be.
6
2.12 Trustee Entitled to Rely. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this Article 2, the
Trustee and the Holders of Notes will be entitled to rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in
which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 2.12 hereof are pending or upon any certificate of such
representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the
Holders of Notes for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
holders of Issuer Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount
or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 2. In the event that the
Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of the holders of Issuer Senior Debt
to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 2, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such
Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Issuer Senior Debt
held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and
other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 2 and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee
shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to
receive such payment. The provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 of the Indenture shall be applicable to all
actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 2.
2.13 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. This Agreement is intended to effectuate the subordination provided in
Article 2 of the Indenture as contemplated by Section 2.27 of the Indenture.
2.14 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Issuer Senior Debt. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty
to the holders of Issuer Senior Debt and shall not be liable to any such holder if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute
to or on behalf of Holders or any other Person, money or assets to which holders of Issuer Senior Debt shall be entitled
by virtue of this Article 2 or otherwise, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Trustee.
2.15 Reliance by Holders of Senior Debt on Subordinated Provisions. Each Holder pursuant to the Indenture and by
accepting a Note, has acknowledged and agreed that provisions comparable to those in this Article 2 hereof are, and
are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to holders of Issuer Senior Debt, whether such Issuer Senior
Debt was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue
to hold, such Issuer Senior Debt and holders of such Issuer Senior Debt shall be deemed conclusively to have relied
on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Issuer Senior
Debt.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, holders of Issuer Senior Debt may, at any time
and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring liability to the
Trustee or the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 2 or the obligations
hereunder of the Holders to holders of Issuer Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner,
place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any Issuer Senior Debt, or otherwise
amend or supplement in any manner any Issuer Senior Debt, or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement
under which any Issuer Senior Debt is
7
outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing
any Issuer Senior Debt; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of any Issuer Senior
Debt; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Issuer and any other Person.
3. Miscellaneous
3.1 Integration/Conflicts. This Agreement and the Indenture represent the entire agreement with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof, and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating
to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the
Trustee or the Holders relative to the subject matter hereof and thereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or
therein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Indenture, the
provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control.
3.2 Effectiveness; Continuing Nature of this Agreement; Severability. This Agreement shall become effective when
executed and delivered by the parties hereto. This is a continuing agreement of payment subordination and the Issuer
Senior Debt Claimholders may continue, at any time and without notice to the Trustee or any Holder, to extend credit
and other financial accommodations and lend monies to or for the benefit of the Issuer constituting Issuer Senior Debt
in reliance hereon. The terms of this Agreement shall survive, and shall continue in full force and effect, in any filing or
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-
faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to those of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. All references to the
Issuer shall include the Issuer as debtor and debtor-in-possession and any receiver, trustee or similar person acting for
the Issuer (as the case may be) in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. This Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect:
(a) with respect to any Issuer Senior Debt Representative and the Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders represented by it
and their Issuer Senior Debt Obligations, on the date on which the Issuer Senior Debt Obligations of such Issuer Senior
Debt Claimholders are Discharged subject to the rights of such Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders under Section 3.20
and Section 3.21; and
(b) with respect to the Trustee and the Holders on the date that all Issuer Senior Debt has been Discharged subject to
the rights of such Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders under Section 3.20 and Section 3.21;
provided, however, that in each case, such termination shall not relieve any such party of its obligations incurred
hereunder prior to the date of such termination.
3.3 Amendments; Waivers
(a) No amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be made
unless the same shall be in writing signed on behalf of each party hereto or its authorized agent and each waiver, if any,
shall be a
8
waiver only with respect to the specific instance involved and shall in no way impair the rights of the parties making
such waiver or the obligations of the other parties to such party in any other respect or at any other time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not have any right to consent to or approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement except to the extent its rights are directly and adversely
affected.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Issuer or any party hereto any Person holding Issuer
Senior Debt or their agent, trustee or representative may become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a Joinder
Agreement in accordance with Section 3.7 of this Agreement and upon such execution and delivery, such Additional
Issuer Senior Representative and the Additional Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders represented thereby shall be subject
to the terms hereof.
3.4 Information Concerning Financial Condition of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. The Issuer Senior Debt
Representatives and the Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, shall
each be responsible for keeping themselves informed of (a) the financial condition of the Issuer, its Subsidiaries and
any endorsers and guarantors of the Issuer Senior Debt Obligations or the Notes and (b) all other circumstances
bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Issuer Senior Debt Obligations or the Notes. The Issuer Senior Debt
Representatives and the other Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand,
shall have no duty to advise of information known to it or them regarding such condition or any such circumstances or
otherwise. In the event any Claimholder, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any
such information to any other Claimholder, it shall be under no obligation:
(a) to make, and such Claimholder shall not make, any express or implied representation or warranty, including with
respect to the accuracy, completeness, truthfulness or validity of any such information so provided;
(b) to provide any additional information or to provide any such information on any subsequent occasion;
(c) to undertake any investigation; or
(d) to disclose any information, which pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance practices, such party
wishes to maintain confidential or is otherwise required to maintain confidential.
3.5 Subrogation. With respect to the value of any payments or distributions in cash, property or other assets that any of
the Trustee or the Holders pays over to any of the Issuer Senior Debt Representatives or the other Issuer Senior Debt
Claimholders under the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee or such Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of such
Issuer Senior Debt Representatives or the other Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders; provided that the Trustee, on behalf
of itself and each Holder, hereby agrees not to assert or enforce any such rights of subrogation it may acquire as a
result of any payment hereunder until the Discharge of all Issuer Senior Debt has occurred. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the value of any payments or distributions in cash, property or other assets received by
the Trustee or any Holder that are paid over to any Issuer Senior Debt Representatives or the other Issuer Senior Debt
Claimholders pursuant to this Agreement shall not reduce any of the obligations under the Indenture.
9
3.6 Application of Payments. All payments received by any Issuer Senior Debt Representative or other Issuer Senior
Debt Claimholder may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to such part of the Issuer Senior Debt
Obligations provided for in the applicable Issuer Senior Debt or the documents evidencing or governing such Issuer
Senior Debt (subject to any agreement among the Issuer Senior Debt Representatives). The Trustee, on behalf of itself
and each Holder, agrees to any extension or postponement of the time of payment of the Issuer Senior Debt
Obligations or any part thereof and to any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any substitution, exchange or
release of any payment which may at any time secure any part of the Issuer Senior Debt Obligations and to the addition
or release of any other Person primarily or secondarily liable therefor.
3.7 Additional Issuer Senior Debt Claims. Any Person holding Issuer Senior Debt or their agent, trustee or
representative may, but is not obligated to, become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a joinder agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.
3.8 Agency Capacities. The Company is acting in the capacity of Initial Issuer Senior Debt Representative solely for the
Initial Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders. Each other Issuer Senior Debt Representative is acting in the capacity of Issuer
Senior Debt Representative solely for the Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders for which it has been appointed agent,
trustee or other representative. The Trustee is acting as Trustee solely for the Holders.
3.9 Submission to Jurisdiction; Certain Waivers. Each of the Issuer and each Issuer Senior Debt Representative and
the Trustee, on behalf of itself and each other applicable Claimholder represented by it, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally:
(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement (whether arising in
contract, tort or otherwise) to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof,
to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the
courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and appellate
courts from any thereof;
(b) agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York
state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court;
(c) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law and that nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any Claimholder may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
against the Issuer or any of its assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;
(d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
paragraph (a) of this Section 3.9 (and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court);
10
(e) consents to service of process in any such proceeding in any such court by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the applicable party at its address provided in accordance with Section 3.11 (and agrees that
nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law);
(f) agrees that service as provided in clause (e) above is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over the applicable
party in any such proceeding in any such court, and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every
respect; and
(g) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover any special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
3.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
EACH PARTY HERETO AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY, COMMON LAW, STATUTE
OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO AND THE COMPANY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. EACH
PARTY HERETO AND THE ISSUER FURTHER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL
RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.
3.11 Notices. All notices to the Holders and the Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders permitted or required under this
Agreement shall also be sent to the Trustee and the applicable Issuer Senior Debt Representative, respectively. Unless
otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice hereunder shall be in writing and may be personally served or sent
by facsimile or United States mail or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person

depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed. For the purposes hereof, the
addresses of the parties hereto shall be as set forth below each party’s name on the signature pages hereto or in the
Joinder Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a party hereto, or, as to each party, at such other address as may be
designated by such party in a written notice to all of the other parties.
3.12 Further Assurances. Each Issuer Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and each other Issuer Senior Debt
Claimholder represented by it, the Trustee, on behalf of itself and each Holder, and the Issuer agrees that it shall take
such further action and shall execute and
11
deliver such additional documents and instruments (in recordable form) as is required for any Issuer Senior Debt
Representative to effectuate the terms of and the payment priorities contemplated by this Agreement.
3.13 APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED, INTERPRETED AND THE RIGHTS OF THE
PARTIES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO
CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW AND NEW YORK CIVIL PRACTICE
LAWS AND RULES 327(b).
3.14 Binding on Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Issuer Senior Debt
Representatives, the other Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders, the Trustee, the Holders, the Issuer and its successors
and assigns from time to time. If any of the Issuer Senior Debt Representatives or the Trustee resigns or is replaced
pursuant to the applicable documents evidencing or governing the applicable Issuer Senior Debt or the Indenture, its
successor shall be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights of, and be subject to all the
obligations of, this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement will inure to the benefit of a trustee, debtor-in-
possession, creditor trust or other representative of an estate or creditor of the Issuer.
3.15 Section Headings. The section headings and table of contents used in this Agreement are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose, be given any
substantive effect, affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.
3.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of
separate counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic imaging means), and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g. a document in “pdf” or “tif ” format sent by electronic
mail) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.
3.17 Authorization. By its signature, each Person executing this Agreement, on behalf of such Person but not in his or
her personal capacity as a signatory, represents and warrants to the other parties hereto that it is duly authorized to
execute this Agreement.
3.18 Third Party Beneficiaries/ Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. This Agreement and the rights and benefits
hereof shall inure to the benefit of each of the Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders and the Holders and their respective
successors and assigns from time to time. Each holder of any Issuer Senior Debt that is not (either directly or through
an agent) a party hereto shall be an express third party beneficiary hereof. The provisions of this Agreement are and
are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Issuer Senior Debt Representatives and the
other Issuer Senior Debt Claimholders on the one hand and the Trustee and the Holders on the other hand. Other than
as set forth in Section 3.3 and in Section 3.6, none of the Issuer or any other creditor thereof shall have any rights
hereunder and the Issuer may not rely on the terms hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair the
obligations of the Issuer, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the obligations under Issuer Senior Debt and
the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with their terms.
12
3.19 No Indirect Actions. Unless otherwise expressly stated, if a party may not take an action under this Agreement,
then it may not take that action indirectly, or support any other Person in taking that action directly or indirectly.
“Taking an action indirectly” means taking an action that is not expressly prohibited for the party but is intended by the
party to have substantially the same effects as the prohibited action.
3.20 When Discharge of Obligations Deemed to Not Have Occurred. If contemporaneously with the Discharge of Issuer
Senior Debt, the Company enters into any Refinancing of such Issuer Senior Debt, then such Discharge of Issuer
Senior Debt shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement and the obligations
under such Refinancing of the applicable Issuer Senior Debt shall automatically be treated as Issuer Senior Debt for all
purposes of this Agreement.
3.21 Avoidance Issues. If any Issuer Senior Debt Claimholder is required as a result of any filing or proceeding under
the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer any amount paid in respect
of Issuer Senior Debt Obligations (a “Recovery”), then such Issuer Senior Debt Claimholder shall be entitled to a
reinstatement of its Issuer Senior Debt Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts on the date of such
Recovery, and from and after the date of such reinstatement the Discharge of Issuer Senior Debt Obligations shall be
deemed not to have occurred for all purposes hereunder. If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such
Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish,
release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto from such date of reinstatement. This
Section 3.21 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 2. Payment Subordination and Payment Block.
2.1 Subordination of Junior Lien Obligations to Senior Lien Obligations. The Company covenants and agrees, and the
Junior Lien Claimholders likewise covenant and agree, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any of
the Junior Lien Documents, that the payment of any and all of the Junior Lien Obligations shall be subordinate and
subject in right and time of payment, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to the prior Payment in
14
Full of all Senior Lien Obligations. Each holder of Senior Lien Obligations, whether now outstanding or hereafter
created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed, shall be deemed to have acquired Senior Lien Obligations in reliance upon
the provisions contained in this Agreement.
2.2 Junior Lien Obligations Payment Restrictions.
(a) Notwithstanding the terms of the Junior Lien Documents, the Company hereby agrees that it may not make to the
Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder, and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent on behalf of itself
and each Junior Lien Claimholders hereby agrees that it will not accept, any payment or distribution in respect of
Junior Lien Obligations with respect to the Company’s guarantee of the Junior Lien Obligations and the Company may
not acquire from the Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder any Notes (as defined in the
Initial Junior Lien Indenture) for cash or property until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Senior Lien
Obligations have been paid in full, in each case, if (1) a payment default on Senior Lien Obligations has occurred and is
continuing or (2) any other default has occurred and is continuing on any Senior Lien Obligations that permits holders
of such Senior Lien Obligations to accelerate its maturity, or otherwise demand its payment, and the Junior Lien
Representative receives a notice of such default (a “Payment Blockage Notice”) from the Company, any Senior Lien
Representative or any other holder of Designated Senior Claims. For purposes of this Section 2.2, the existence of an
Outstanding Government Claim (as defined in the Junior Lien Documents on the date hereof) shall constitute a
payment default with respect to any Claims within the meaning of clause (v) of the definition of Designated Senior
Claims.
(b) The Company may and will resume payments or any distributions in respect of the Company’s guarantee of the
Junior Lien Obligations and may acquire the Junior Lien Obligations upon the earlier of:
(1) in the case of a payment default on the Senior Lien Obligations, upon the date upon which such default is cured or
waived, and
(2) in the case of a nonpayment default on the Senior Lien Obligations, upon the earlier of the date on which such
nonpayment default is cured or waived or 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is
received, unless, in the case of this clause (2), the maturity of any Senior Lien Obligations has been accelerated or
demand for payment of such Senior Lien Obligations made, and such acceleration or demand for payment has not
been waived, satisfied or cancelled;
if the Initial Junior Lien Indenture or other applicable Junior Lien Documents otherwise permits such payment,
distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment, distribution or acquisition.
15
2.3 Junior Lien Obligations Standstill Provisions.
The Junior Lien Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of the Designated Senior Lien
Representative, take any Enforcement Action with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations (for the avoidance of doubt,
Collateral Enforcement Actions shall be governed by Section 3.1, below and not this Section 2.3), until the earliest to
occur of the following:
(a) acceleration of the Senior Lien Obligations (provided, however, that if, following any such acceleration of the Senior
Lien Obligations, such acceleration in respect of the Senior Lien Obligations is rescinded, then all Enforcement Actions
taken by any Junior Lien Claimholders shall likewise be rescinded if the Junior Lien Claimholders would not otherwise
have any right under the last paragraph of this Section 2.3 to take any Enforcement Action);
(b) an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company shall have been commenced (provided,
however, that if such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is dismissed, the corresponding prohibition against the
Junior Lien Claimholders taking any Enforcement Action shall automatically be reinstated as of the date of dismissal as
if such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding had not been initiated, unless the Junior Lien Claimholder shall have the
right to take any Enforcement Action under the last paragraph of this Section 2.3); or
(c) the stated final maturity of the Junior Lien Obligations.
Any Distributions on account of a Junior Lien Obligation or other proceeds of any Enforcement Action obtained by any
Junior Lien Claimholders shall in any event be held in trust by it for the benefit of the Senior Lien Obligations and
promptly be paid or delivered to the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent in the form received until all Senior Lien
Obligations are paid in full.
Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no provision herein shall prevent any Junior
Lien Claimholders from (i) filing lawsuits to prevent the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or other similar
restrictions on claims, or (ii) seeking specific performance or other injunctive relief to compel the Company to comply
with a non-payment obligation under the Junior Lien Documents.
2.4 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy.
In the event of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding that is continuing involving the Company:
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and enforceable pursuant to its terms, and all references herein to
the Company shall be deemed to apply to the Company as debtor-in-possession and to any Person claiming through
or on their behalf, including a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or
agent for the estate of the Company, or otherwise.
All Senior Lien Obligations shall first be paid in full before any Distribution, whether in cash, securities or other
property, shall be made to any Junior Lien Claimholder (or any Person claiming through or on behalf of any Junior Lien
Claimholder, including a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or
agent, or otherwise) on account of any Junior Lien Obligations.
16
Any Distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, which would otherwise, but for the terms hereof, be
payable or deliverable in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations shall be paid or delivered directly to the Designated
Senior Lien Collateral Agent until all Senior Lien Obligations are paid in full. Each Junior Lien Claimholder by its
acceptance of the Junior Lien Documents irrevocably authorizes, empowers and directs any debtor, debtor in
possession, receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian, conservator or other Person having authority, to pay or otherwise
deliver all such Distributions in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations to the Designated Senior Collateral Agent. Each
Junior Lien Claimholder by its acceptance of the Junior Lien Documents also irrevocably authorizes and empowers the
Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent, in the name of such Junior Lien Claimholder, to demand, sue for, collect and
receive any and all such Distributions. Neither any Senior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Senior Lien Claimholder shall
have any liability to any Junior Lien Claimholder in connection with any action taken pursuant to this paragraph.
Each Junior Lien Claimholder by its acceptance of the Junior Lien Documents agrees not to initiate, prosecute, support
or participate in any claim, action or other proceeding challenging the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of
the Senior Lien Obligations or any liens and security interests securing the Senior Lien Obligations.
Each Junior Lien Claimholder may execute, verify, deliver and file any proofs of claim in respect of the Junior Lien
Obligations.
SECTION 3. Lien Priorities.
3.1 Relative Priorities. Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any
Liens securing the Junior Lien Obligations granted on the Collateral or of any Liens securing the Senior Lien
Obligations granted on the Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC or any other applicable law or the
Junior Lien Documents or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect or lapse in perfection of, or avoidance as a
fraudulent conveyance or otherwise of, the Liens securing the Senior Lien Obligations, the subordination of such Liens
to any other Liens, or any other circumstance whatsoever, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding
has been commenced by or against the Company, each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral
Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby agrees that:
(a) any Lien on the Collateral securing any Senior Lien Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Senior
Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien Claimholders or any agent or trustee therefor,
regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be
senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations; and
(b) any Lien on the Collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Junior
Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Claimholders or any agent or trustee therefor
regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or
17
otherwise, shall be junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens on the Collateral securing any Senior Lien
Obligations. All Liens on the Collateral securing any Senior Lien Obligations shall be and remain senior in all respects
and prior to all Liens on the Collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations for all purposes, whether or not such Liens
securing any Senior Lien Obligations are subordinated to any Lien securing any other obligation of the Company or
any other Person.
3.2 Prohibition on Contesting Liens; No Marshaling. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral
Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, and each Senior Lien
Representative and each Senior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Senior Lien Claimholder
represented by it, agrees that it will not (and hereby waives any right to) directly or indirectly contest or support any
other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the priority,
validity, perfection, extent or enforceability of a Lien held, or purported to be held, by or on behalf of any of the Senior
Lien Claimholders in the Senior Lien Collateral or by or on behalf of any of the Junior Lien Claimholders in the Junior
Lien Collateral, as the case may be, or the provisions of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any
Senior Lien Claimholder to enforce this Agreement, including the provisions of this Agreement relating to the priority of
the Liens securing the Senior Lien Obligations as provided in Sections 3.1 and 4.1. Until the Discharge of Senior Lien
Obligations, no Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent or Junior Lien Claimholder will assert any
marshaling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may otherwise be available to a junior secured creditor.
3.3 No New Liens. So long as the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency
or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company, the parties hereto agree that the
Company shall not:
(a) grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property to secure any Junior Lien Obligation unless it has
granted or concurrently grants a Lien on such asset or property to secure one or more Series of Senior Lien
Obligations, the parties hereto agreeing that any such Lien shall be subject to Section 3.1 hereof; or
(b) grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property to secure any Senior Lien Obligations unless it has
granted or concurrently grants a Lien on such asset or property to secure the Junior Lien Obligations; provided that
this provision will not be violated with respect to any particular Series of Junior Lien Obligations if the applicable Junior
Lien Collateral Agent is given a reasonable opportunity to accept a Lien on any asset or property and such Junior Lien
Collateral Agent states in writing that the Junior Lien Documents in respect thereof prohibit such Junior Lien Collateral
Agent from accepting a Lien on such asset or property or the applicable Junior Lien Collateral Agent otherwise
expressly declines to accept a Lien on such asset or property (any such prohibited or declined Lien with respect to a
particular Series of Junior Lien Obligations, a “Junior Lien Declined Lien”).
18
If any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Claimholder shall hold any Lien
on any assets or property of the Company securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to one or
more first-priority Liens securing Senior Lien Obligations under the Senior Lien Collateral Documents, such Junior Lien
Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent or Junior Lien Claimholder shall notify the Designated Senior Lien
Representative promptly upon having actual knowledge thereof and, unless the Company shall promptly grant a
similar Lien on such assets or property to each Senior Lien Collateral Agent as security for the Senior Lien Obligations
represented by it, such Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent and Junior Lien Claimholders shall be
deemed to hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of each Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral
Agent and the other Senior Lien Claimholders, other than any Senior Lien Claimholders whose Senior Lien Documents
prohibit them from taking such Liens, as security for the Senior Lien Obligations. To the extent that the foregoing
provisions are not complied with for any reason, without limiting any other rights and remedies available to any one or
more Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent and the Senior Lien Claimholders, each Junior Lien
Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of each Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it,
agrees that any amounts received by or distributed to any of them pursuant to or as a result of Liens granted in
contravention of this Section 3.3 shall be subject to Section 5.2.
Except as provided in the next paragraph, if any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any
Senior Lien Claimholder shall hold any Lien on any assets or property of the Company securing any Senior Lien
Obligations that are not also subject to one or more Liens securing Junior Lien Obligations under the Junior Lien
Collateral Documents, such Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or Senior Lien Claimholder shall
notify the Designated Junior Lien Representative promptly upon having actual knowledge thereof and, unless the
Company shall promptly grant a similar Lien, other than any such Lien that would constitute a Junior Lien Declined
Lien, on such assets or property to each Junior Lien Collateral Agent as security for the Junior Lien Obligations
represented by it, such Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent and Senior Lien Claimholders shall be
deemed to hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of each Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral
Agent and the other Junior Lien Claimholders (subject to the priorities set forth herein), other than any Junior Lien
Claimholders whose Junior Lien Documents prohibit them from taking such Liens, as security for the Junior Lien
Obligations. To the extent that the foregoing provisions are not complied with for any reason, without limiting any other
rights and remedies available to any any one or more Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the
Junior Lien Claimholders, each Senior Lien Representative and each Senior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of each
Senior Lien Claimholder represented by it, agrees that any amounts received by or distributed to any of them pursuant
to or as a result of Liens granted in contravention of this Section 3.3 shall be subject to Section 5.2.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations, cash and
cash equivalents may be pledged to secure Senior Lien Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect
of letters of credit issued pursuant to the Senior Lien Documents without granting a Lien thereon to secure any other
Senior Lien Obligations or any other Junior Lien Obligations.
19
3.4 Perfection of Liens. Except for the arrangements contemplated by Section 5.7, none of the Senior Lien
Representatives, Senior Lien Collateral Agents or the Senior Lien Claimholders shall be responsible for perfecting and
maintaining the perfection of Liens with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Junior Lien Representatives, the
Junior Lien Collateral Agents or the Junior Lien Claimholders. The provisions of this Agreement are intended solely to
govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Senior Lien Claimholders on the one hand and the Junior Lien
Claimholders on the other hand and such provisions shall not impose on the Senior Lien Representatives, Senior Lien
Collateral Agents, the Senior Lien Claimholders, the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents, the
Junior Lien Claimholders or any agent or trustee therefor any obligations in respect of the disposition of proceeds of
any Collateral which would conflict with prior-perfected claims therein in favor of any other Person or any order or
decree of any court or Governmental Authority or any applicable law.
3.5 Nature of Senior Lien Obligations. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on
behalf of itself and each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, acknowledges that a portion of the Senior
Lien Obligations represents, or may in the future represent, debt that is revolving in nature and that the amount thereof
that may be outstanding at any time or from time to time may be increased or reduced and subsequently reborrowed,
and that the terms of the Senior Lien Obligations may be modified, extended or amended from time to time, and that the
aggregate amount of the Senior Lien Obligations may be increased, replaced or refinanced, in each event, without
notice to or consent by the Junior Lien Claimholders and without affecting the provisions hereof. The lien priorities
provided in Section 3.1 shall not be altered or otherwise affected by any such amendment, modification, supplement,
extension, repayment, reborrowing, increase, replacement, renewal, restatement or refinancing of either the Senior Lien
Obligations or the Junior Lien Obligations, or any portion thereof. In addition, as among the Senior Claimholders, their
respective rights and obligations shall be governed by the Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement which among other
things may provide for various levels of Lien priority and/or payment priority as among the Senior Claimholders without
affecting the provisions hereof.
SECTION 4. Enforcement.
4.1 Exercise of Remedies.
(a) Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company, the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien
Collateral Agents and the Junior Lien Claimholders:
(1) will not commence or maintain, or seek to commence or maintain, any Collateral Enforcement Action or otherwise
exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral; provided that any one or more of the Junior Lien
Representative and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent may, in accordance with any relevant Junior Lien Security
Document, but is not required to, commence a Collateral Enforcement Action or otherwise exercise any or all such
rights or remedies after the passage of a period of at least 180 days has elapsed since the
20
later of (i) the date on which a Junior Lien Representative declared the existence of any Event of Default under (and as
defined in) any Junior Lien Documents and demanded the repayment of all the principal amount of any Junior Lien
Obligations thereunder; and (ii) the date on which the Senior Lien Representatives received notice from such Junior
Lien Representative of such declarations of such Event of Default and demand for payment (the “Standstill Period”);
provided, further, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Claimholder exercise any rights or remedies with
respect to the Collateral if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Standstill Period, any Senior Lien Representative, any
Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any applicable Senior Lien Claimholder(s) shall have commenced and is pursuing a
Collateral Enforcement Action or other exercise of its or their rights or remedies in each case with respect to all or any
material portion of the Collateral (prompt written notice of such exercise to be given to the Junior Lien Representative);
(2) will not contest, protest or object to (i) any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by any Senior Lien
Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien Claimholder or (ii) any other exercise by any Senior
Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien Claimholder of any rights and remedies
relating to the Collateral under the Senior Lien Documents or otherwise (including any Collateral Enforcement Action
initiated by or supported by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien
Claimholder); and
(3) subject to their rights under clause (a)(1) above will not object to the forbearance by any Senior Lien Representative,
any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien Claimholder from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding
or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Collateral,
in each case so long as any proceeds received by any Senior Lien Representative in excess of those necessary to
achieve a Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations are distributed in accordance with Section 5.1 hereof and applicable
law.
(b) Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company, subject to Section 4.1(a)(1), the Senior Lien
Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the Senior Lien Claimholders shall have the exclusive right to
(i) commence and maintain a Collateral Enforcement Action or otherwise enforce rights, exercise remedies (including
set-off, recoupment and the right to credit bid their debt, except that Junior Lien Representatives shall have the credit
bid rights set forth in Section 4.1(c)(6)), and (ii) subject to Section 5.3, make determinations regarding the release,
disposition, or restrictions with respect to the Collateral without any consultation with or the consent of any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder; provided that, in each case, any
proceeds received by any Senior Lien Representative in excess of those necessary to achieve a Discharge of
21
Senior Lien Obligations are distributed in accordance with Section 5.1 hereof and applicable law. In commencing or
maintaining any Collateral Enforcement Action or otherwise exercising rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral, the Senior Lien Representatives, Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the Senior Lien Claimholders may
enforce the provisions of the Senior Lien Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such
manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion in compliance with any applicable law and without
consultation with any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien
Claimholder and regardless of whether any such exercise is adverse to the interest of any Junior Lien Claimholder.
Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of
Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition, and to exercise all the rights
and remedies of a secured creditor under the UCC and under Bankruptcy Law of any applicable jurisdiction.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent, in accordance with
any relevant Junior Lien Security Document, and any other Junior Lien Claimholder may:
(1) file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations; provided that an Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company;
(2) take any action not adverse to the priority status of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Lien Obligations,
or the rights of any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or the Senior Lien Claimholders to
exercise remedies in respect thereof, in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect its Lien on the Collateral;
(3) file any necessary responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or
other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims of the Junior Lien
Claimholders, including any claims secured by the Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement;
(4) vote on any plan of reorganization, arrangement, compromise or liquidation, file any proof of claim, make other
filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations and the Collateral; provided that no filing of any claim or vote, or pleading
related to such claim or vote, to accept or reject a disclosure statement, plan of reorganization, arrangement,
compromise or liquidation, or any other document, agreement or proposal similar to the foregoing by any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder, may be inconsistent with the
provisions of this Agreement;
22
(5) exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral after the termination of the Standstill Period to the
extent permitted by Section 4.1(a)(1); and
(6) bid for or purchase Collateral at any public, private or judicial foreclosure upon such Collateral initiated by any
Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder, or any sale of
Collateral during an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding; provided that such bid may not include a “credit bid” in
respect of any Junior Lien Obligations unless the cash proceeds of such bid are otherwise sufficient to cause the
Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations.
Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and each other Junior Lien
Claimholder represented by it, agrees that it will not take or receive any Collateral or any proceeds of Collateral in
connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off and recoupment) with respect to any Collateral in
its capacity as a creditor, unless and until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, except in connection
with any foreclosure that is expressly permitted by Section 4.1(a)(1) to pursue after the expiration of the Standstill
Period to the extent such Junior Lien Representative or such Junior Lien Collateral Agent and Junior Lien
Claimholders represented by it are permitted to retain the proceeds thereof in accordance with Section 5.2 of this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless and until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations
has occurred, except as expressly provided in Sections 4.1(a), 6.3(b) and this Section 4.1(c), the sole right of the Junior
Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Junior Lien Claimholders with respect to the
Collateral is to hold a Lien on the Collateral pursuant to the Junior Lien Collateral Documents for the period and to the
extent granted therein and to receive a share of the proceeds thereof, if any, after the Discharge of Senior Lien
Obligations has occurred.
(d) Subject to Sections 4.1(a) and (c) and Section 6.3(b):
(1) each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, agrees that such Junior Lien Representative or such Junior Lien Collateral Agent
and such Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it will not take any action that would hinder any exercise of
remedies under the Senior Lien Documents or that is otherwise prohibited hereunder, including any sale, lease,
exchange, transfer or other disposition of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure or otherwise;
(2) each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby waives any and all rights such Junior Lien Representative or such Junior
Lien Collateral Agent and such Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it may have as a junior lien creditor or
otherwise to object to the manner in which any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any
other Senior Lien Claimholder seeks to enforce or collect the Senior Lien Obligations
23
or Liens securing the Senior Lien Obligations granted in any of the Senior Lien Collateral undertaken in accordance
with this Agreement, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by or on behalf of any Senior Lien
Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder is adverse to the interest of any
Junior Lien Claimholder; and
(3) each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby acknowledges and agrees that no covenant, agreement or restriction
contained in any Junior Lien Documents (other than this Agreement) shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights
and remedies of any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder
with respect to the Collateral as set forth in this Agreement and the Senior Lien Documents.
(e) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Article II of the Initial Junior Lien Indenture and the Note
Subordination Agreement, the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Junior Lien
Claimholders may exercise rights and remedies as unsecured creditors against the Company that has guaranteed or
granted Liens to secure the Junior Lien Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Junior Lien Documents and
applicable law (other than initiating or joining in an involuntary case or proceeding under any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding with respect to the Company); provided that in the event that any Junior Lien Claimholder becomes a
judgment Lien creditor in respect of Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor with
respect to the Junior Lien Obligations, such judgment Lien shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement for all
purposes (including in relation to the Senior Lien Obligations) in the same manner as the other Liens securing the
Junior Lien Obligations are subject to this Agreement.
(f) Except as specifically set forth in Sections 4.1(a) and (d), and without limiting Article II of the Initial Junior Lien
Indenture or the Note Subordination Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the receipt by any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder of the required payments of
interest, principal and other amounts owed in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations so long as such receipt is not the
direct or indirect result of the exercise by any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other
Junior Lien Claimholder of rights or remedies as a secured creditor (including set-off and recoupment) or enforcement
in contravention of this Agreement of any Lien held by any of them or as a result of any other violation by any Junior
Lien Claimholder of the express terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement impairs or otherwise adversely
affects any rights or remedies any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or other Senior Lien
Claimholder may have with respect to the Senior Lien Collateral.
4.2 Actions Upon Breach; Specific Performance. If any Junior Lien Claimholder, in contravention of the terms of this
Agreement, in any way takes, attempts to or threatens to take any action with respect to the Collateral (including any
attempt to realize upon or enforce any
24
remedy with respect to this Agreement), or fails to take any action required by this Agreement, this Agreement shall
create an irrebutable presumption and admission by such Junior Lien Claimholder that relief against such Junior Lien
Claimholder by injunction, specific performance and/or other appropriate equitable relief is necessary to prevent
irreparable harm to the Senior Lien Claimholders, it being understood and agreed by each Junior Lien Representative
and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of each Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, that (i) the Senior
Lien Claimholders’ damages from actions of any Junior Lien Claimholder may at that time be difficult to ascertain and
may be irreparable and (ii) each Junior Lien Claimholder waives any defense that either or both the Company and the
Senior Lien Claimholders cannot demonstrate either or both damage and be made whole by the awarding of damages.
Each of the Senior Lien Representatives and Senior Lien Collateral Agents may demand specific performance of this
Agreement. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and each other
Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy
at law and any other defense which might be asserted to bar the remedy of specific performance in any action which
may be brought by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien
Claimholder. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver by any Senior Lien
Representative or any Senior Lien Collateral Agent on behalf of itself and each other Senior Lien Claimholder
represented by it, of any right to seek damages from any Person in connection with any breach or alleged breach of
this Agreement.
SECTION 5. Payments.
5.1 Application of Proceeds. So long as the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company, any Collateral or any
proceeds thereof, Restricted Assets or any proceeds thereof or Sale Proceeds received in connection with any
Collateral Enforcement Action or other exercise of remedies by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien
Collateral Agent or any Senior Lien Claimholder, shall be applied by the Senior Lien Collateral Agents or the Senior
Lien Representatives, as applicable, to the Senior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant Senior
Lien Documents and, if then in effect, the Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided, that any non-cash Collateral
or non-cash proceeds may be held by the applicable Senior Lien Collateral Agent as Collateral unless the failure to
apply such amounts would be commercially unreasonable. Upon the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior
Lien Collateral Agent shall (x) unless a Discharge of Junior Lien Obligations has already occurred, deliver any
remaining proceeds of Collateral, Restricted Assets and Sale Proceeds held by it to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, to
be applied by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the other Junior Lien Collateral Agents or Junior Lien
Representatives, as applicable, to the applicable Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the applicable
Junior Lien Documents and (y) if a Discharge of Junior Lien Obligations has already occurred, deliver such proceeds
of Collateral, Restricted Assets and Sale Proceeds to the Company or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive
the same. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is the intention of the parties hereto that no amount of any
Sale Proceeds will in any event be allocated to any Restricted Assets, and no Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien
Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Claimholder will, in any forum (including in any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding), assert that any amount of any Sale Proceeds should be allocated to any Restricted Assets.

5.2 Payments Over.
(a) So long as the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company, any Collateral or any proceeds thereof, Restricted
Assets or proceeds thereof and all Sale Proceeds (including assets or proceeds subject to Liens referred to in the
second to last paragraph of Section 3.3 and any assets or proceeds subject to Liens that have been avoided or
otherwise invalidated) received by any Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior
Lien Claimholder in connection with any Collateral Enforcement Action or other exercise of any right or remedy relating
to the Collateral or the Restricted Assets, in all cases shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to
the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Senior Lien Claimholders in the same form as
received, with any necessary endorsements (which endorsements shall be without recourse and without any
representations or warranties) or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. The Designated Senior Lien
Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to make any such endorsements as agent for the Junior Lien Representatives,
Junior Lien Collateral Agents or any such other Junior Lien Claimholder. This authorization is coupled with an interest
and is irrevocable until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations.
(b) So long as the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has not occurred, if in any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder
shall receive any distribution of money or other property in respect of the Collateral, Restricted Assets or Sale
Proceeds (including any assets or proceeds subject to Liens that have been avoided or otherwise invalidated), such
money or other property shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to the Designated Senior Lien
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Senior Lien Claimholders in the same form as received, with any necessary
endorsements (which endorsements shall be without recourse and without any representations or warranties). Any
Lien received by any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder
in respect of any of the Junior Lien Obligations in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding shall be subject to the
terms of this Agreement.
5.3 Releases.
(a) If in connection with any Collateral Enforcement Action by any Senior Lien Representative or any Senior Lien
Collateral Agent or any other exercise of any Senior Lien Representative’s or any Senior Lien Collateral Agent’s
remedies in respect of the Collateral, in each case prior to the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations, such Senior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the Senior Lien Claimholders represented by it, releases any of its
Liens on any part of the Collateral, then the Liens, if any, of each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself or for the benefit
of the Junior Lien Claimholders, on such Collateral, shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously
released. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, shall, within a reasonable time following such request, execute and deliver to the
Senior
26
Lien Representatives, Senior Lien Collateral Agents or the Company, such termination statements, releases and other
documents as any Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or the Company may request in writing to
effectively confirm the foregoing releases, provided that the Junior Lien Representative and Junior Lien Collateral
Agent shall not be required to take any action if such actions would violate applicable law or court order.
(b) If in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral by the Company
(collectively, a “Disposition”) permitted under the terms of the Senior Lien Documents and not expressly prohibited
under the terms of the Junior Lien Documents (other than in connection with a Collateral Enforcement Action or other
exercise of any one or more Senior Lien Representative’s and Senior Lien Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of the
Collateral, which shall be governed by Section 5.3(a) above above), any Senior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself or on
behalf of any Senior Lien Claimholder represented by it, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Collateral, other
than (A) in connection with, or following, the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default under (and as defined in) any Junior Lien Documents, then the Liens, if
any, of each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself or for the benefit of the Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it,
on such Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. Each Junior Lien
Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder
represented by it, shall, promptly execute and deliver to the Senior Lien Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral
Agents or the Company such termination statements, releases and other documents as any Senior Lien
Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or the Company may request to effectively confirm such release, provided
that the Junior Lien Representative and Junior Lien Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action if such
actions would violate applicable law or court order.
(c) Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations occurs, each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent and any officer or agent of the Designated Senior
Lien Collateral Agent, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power
and authority in the place and stead of such Junior Lien Representative, such Junior Lien Collateral Agent and such
Junior Lien Claimholders or in the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent’s own name, from time to time in the
Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent’s discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Section 5.3, to
take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary to
accomplish the purposes of this Section 5.3, including any endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release.
This power is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations.
(d) Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations occurs, to the extent that any Senior Lien Collateral Agent, any Senior
Lien Representative or Senior Lien Claimholders (i) has released any Lien on Collateral and any such Liens are later
27
reinstated or (ii) obtains any new Liens from the Company, then each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and for the
Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it, shall be granted a Lien on any such Collateral (except to the extent such
Lien represents a Junior Lien Declined Lien with respect to the Junior Lien Debt represented by such Junior Lien
Collateral Agent), subject to the lien subordination provisions of this Agreement, and each Junior Lien Representative,
for itself and for the Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it, shall be granted an additional lien.
5.4 Insurance. Unless and until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, the Senior Lien
Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Senior Lien Claimholders shall have the sole and
exclusive right, subject to the rights of the Company under the Senior Lien Documents, to adjust settlement for any
insurance policy covering the Collateral in the event of any loss thereunder and to approve any award granted in any
condemnation or similar proceeding (or any deed in lieu of condemnation) affecting the Collateral. Subject to the rights
of the Company under the Senior Lien Documents, all proceeds of any such policy and any such award (or any
payments with respect to a deed in lieu of condemnation) if in respect of the Collateral shall be applied in the order of
priority set forth in Section 5.1. Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, if any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder shall, at any time, receive any
proceeds of any such insurance policy or any such award or payment in contravention of this Agreement, then it shall
segregate and hold in trust and forthwith pay such proceeds over to the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.2.
5.5 Amendments to Senior Lien Documents and Junior Lien Documents.
(a) The Senior Lien Documents of any Series may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their terms and the Senior Lien Claims of any Series may be
Refinanced subject to Section 5.8 and Section 8.7, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of, any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder, all without affecting the lien
subordination or other provisions of this Agreement; provided that any such amendment, supplement or modification
or Refinancing is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and, in the case of a Refinancing, the holders of
such Refinancing debt or their agent bind themselves in a writing addressed to each Junior Lien Collateral Agent to the
terms of this Agreement.
(b) The Junior Lien Documents may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time in accordance with their terms and the Junior Lien Debt of any Series may be Refinanced in full but
not in part subject to Section 5.8 and Section 8.7, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of, any Senior Lien
Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder, all without affecting the lien
subordination or other provisions of this Agreement, provided that any such amendment, restatement, supplement or
modification or Refinancing is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and, in the case of any Refinancing,
the holders of such Refinancing debt or their agent bind themselves in a writing addressed to each Senior Lien
Collateral Agent to the terms of this Agreement; and provided further that any such amendment, restatement,
supplement, modification or Refinancing shall not, without the consent of each Senior Lien Representative:
(1) increase the then-outstanding principal amount of the Junior Lien Debt of that Series, provided, that the foregoing
shall not restrict any increases in principal resulting from any “payment in kind”;
28
(2) increase the “Applicable Margin” or similar component of the interest rate or yield provisions applicable to the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Junior Lien Documents of that Series in a manner that would result in the total
yield thereon to exceed by more than 3% per annum the total yield on Indebtedness thereunder as in effect on the date
such Indebtedness became Junior Lien Debt (excluding increases resulting from the accrual of interest at the default
rate);
(3) amend or otherwise modify any “Default” or “Event of Default” (as each such term is defined in the Junior Lien
Documents for that Series) thereunder in a manner adverse to the loan parties thereunder;
(4) accelerate any date upon which a scheduled payment of principal or interest is due, or otherwise decrease the
weighted average life to maturity;
(5) modify (or undertake any action having the effect of a modification of) the mandatory prepayment provisions of the
Junior Lien Documents for that Series in a manner adverse to the Senior Lien Claimholders; or
(6) increase materially the obligations of the obligor thereunder or confer any additional material rights of the Junior
Lien Lenders (or a representative on their behalf) which would be adverse to any Senior Lien Claimholders.
(c) In the event any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or the applicable Senior Lien Claimholders and the Company enter into
any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the Senior Lien Collateral Documents for the purpose of adding
to, or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any Senior Lien Collateral
Document or changing in any manner the rights of the applicable Senior Lien Collateral Agent, Senior Lien
Claimholders, or the Company thereunder, then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any
comparable provision of a Junior Lien Collateral Document without the consent of any Junior Lien Representative,
Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Claimholder and without any action by any Junior Lien
Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any other Junior Lien Claimholder, or the Company, provided that:
(1) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of:
(A) removing assets subject to the Lien of the Junior Lien Collateral Documents, except to the extent that a release of
such Lien is permitted or required by Section 5.3 and provided that there is a corresponding release of the Liens
securing any Senior Lien Obligations;
29
(B) imposing duties on any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Representative without its consent;
(C) permitting other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms of the Junior Lien Documents or Section 6
hereof; or
(D) being prejudicial to the interests of the Junior Lien Claimholders to a materially greater extent than the Senior Lien
Claimholders (other than by virtue of their relative priority and the rights and obligations hereunder); and
(2) notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall have been given to each Junior Lien Collateral Agent within ten
(10) Business Days after the effective date of such amendment, waiver or consent.
5.6 Confirmation of Subordination in Junior Lien Collateral Documents. The Company agrees that each Junior Lien
Collateral Document shall include the following language (or language to similar effect approved by the Designated
Senior Lien Collateral Agent):
“Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the lien and security interest granted to the [collateral agent]
pursuant to this Agreement and the exercise of any right or remedy by the [collateral agent] hereunder are subject to
the provisions of the Junior Lien Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of [                    ] (as amended,
restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Junior Lien Subordination
and Intercreditor Agreement”), among [                    ], as Initial Senior Lien Representative, [        ], as Initial Senior Lien
Collateral Agent, [                    ], as Initial Junior Lien Representative, [            ], as Initial Junior Lien Collateral Agent and
certain other persons party to the Junior Lien Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement or that may become party
thereto from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Junior Lien Subordination and
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the Junior Lien Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement
shall govern and control.”
5.7 Gratuitous Bailee/Agent for Perfection; Rights of Initial Senior Collateral Agent and Initial Senior Lien
Representative.
(a) Each Senior Lien Collateral Agent agrees to hold that part of the Collateral that is in its possession or control (or in
the possession or control of its agents or bailees) to the extent that possession or control thereof is taken to perfect a
Lien thereon under the UCC (such Collateral being the “Pledged Collateral”) as collateral agent for the Senior
30
Lien Claimholders and gratuitous bailee for the Junior Lien Collateral Agents (such bailment being intended, among
other things, to satisfy the requirements of Sections 8-106(d)(3), 8-301(a)(2) and 9-313(c) of the UCC) and any assignee
thereof solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted under the Senior Lien Documents and the
Junior Lien Documents, respectively, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.7. Solely with respect to any
deposit accounts under the control (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC) of any Senior Lien Collateral
Agent, such Senior Lien Collateral Agent hereby agrees to also hold control over such deposit accounts as gratuitous
agent for the Junior Lien Collateral Agents, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.7.
(b) No Senior Lien Collateral Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever to the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior
Lien Collateral Agents or the Junior Lien Claimholders to ensure that the Pledged Collateral is genuine or owned by the
Company, to perfect the security interests of the Junior Lien Collateral Agents or other Junior Lien Claimholders or to
preserve rights or benefits of any Person except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.7. The duties or responsibilities
of any Senior Lien Collateral Agent under this Section 5.7 shall be limited solely to holding the Pledged Collateral as
gratuitous bailee [(and with respect to deposit accounts, agent)] in accordance with this Section 5.7 and delivering the
Pledged Collateral upon a Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations as provided in paragraph (d) below.
(c) No Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder shall have by reason of the Senior Lien
Collateral Documents, the Junior Lien Collateral Documents, this Agreement or any other document, a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder and the Junior Lien
Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and the Junior Lien Claimholders hereby waive and release the
Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Senior Lien Claimholders from all claims and liabilities arising pursuant to
any Senior Lien Collateral Agent’s role under this Section 5.7 as gratuitous bailee and gratuitous agent with respect to
the Pledged Collateral. It is understood and agreed that the interests of the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the other
Senior Lien Claimholders, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and
the other Junior Lien Claimholders on the other hand, may differ and the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the other
Senior Lien Claimholders shall be fully entitled to act in their own interest without taking into account the interests of
the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents or other Junior Lien Claimholders.
(d) Upon the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior Lien Collateral Agent shall deliver the remaining
Pledged Collateral in its possession (if any) together with any necessary endorsements (which endorsement shall be
without recourse and without any representation or warranty), (x) unless a Discharge of Junior Lien Obligations has not
already occurred, to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and (y) if a Discharge of Junior Lien Obligations has already
occurred, to the Company or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. Following the Discharge of
Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior Lien Collateral Agent further agrees to take all other action required or requested
by any Junior Lien Collateral Agent at the expense of
31
the Company in connection with the Junior Lien Collateral Agents obtaining a first-priority security interest in the
Collateral. After the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, upon the Discharge of Junior Lien Obligations,
each Junior Lien Collateral Agent shall deliver the remaining Pledged Collateral in its possession (if any) together with
any necessary endorsements (which endorsement shall be without recourse and without any representation or
warranty, to the Company or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.
(e) Upon execution of this Agreement, each Junior Lien Representative and Junior Lien Collateral Agent shall, promptly
following such requirements or requests, (x) enter into such documents and agreements as the Company or the Initial
Senior Lien Representative and/or the Initial Senior Lien Collateral Agent or Initial Senior Lien Representative shall
reasonably request in order to provide to the Initial Senior Lien Collateral Agent and Initial Senior Lien Representative
the rights contemplated hereby, in each case consistent in all material respects with the terms of this Agreement and
(y) deliver to such Initial Senior Lien Collateral Agent any Pledged Collateral held by it together with any necessary
endorsements (or otherwise allow such Initial Senior Lien Collateral Agent to obtain control of such Pledged Collateral),
provided that the Junior Lien Representative or Junior Lien Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action if
such actions would violate applicable law or court order.
5.8 When Discharge of Obligations Deemed to Not Have Occurred. If, at any time after the Discharge of Senior Lien
Obligations has occurred or contemporaneously therewith, the Company enters into any Refinancing of any Senior
Lien Documents evidencing a Senior Lien Obligation, then such Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations shall
automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to any
actions taken as a result of the occurrence of such first Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations), and, from and after the
date on which the Additional Senior Lien Representative and Additional Senior Lien Collateral Agent in respect of such
Refinancing each becomes a party to this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.7(b), the obligations under such
Refinancing of the applicable Senior Lien Documents shall automatically be treated as Senior Lien Obligations for all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth
herein, and the Additional Senior Lien Representative and the Additional Senior Lien Collateral Agent under such new
Senior Lien Documents shall be a Senior Lien Representative and Senior Lien Collateral Agent, respectively, for all
purposes of this Agreement. Upon receipt of a Designation from the Company in accordance with Section 8.7(b)(2) of
this Agreement, each Junior Lien Representative and Junior Lien Collateral Agent shall, promptly following such
requests, (x) enter into such documents and agreements (including amendments or supplements to this Agreement) as
the Company or any one or more such Additional Senior Lien Representative and such Additional Senior Lien
Collateral Agent shall reasonably request in order to provide to such Additional Senior Lien Representative and such
Additional Senior Lien Collateral Agent the rights contemplated hereby, in each case consistent in all material respects
with the terms of this Agreement and (y) deliver to such Additional Senior Lien Collateral Agent any Pledged Collateral
held by it together with any necessary endorsements (or otherwise allow such Additional Senior Lien Collateral Agent
to obtain control of such Pledged Collateral), provided that the Junior Lien Representative and Junior Lien Collateral
Agent shall not be required to take any action if such actions would violate
32
applicable law or court order. If the Additional Senior Lien Obligations under the Additional Senior Lien Documents in
respect of such Refinancing are secured by assets of the Company constituting Collateral that do not also secure the
Junior Lien Obligations, then the Junior Lien Obligations shall be secured at such time by a junior-priority Lien on such
assets to the same extent provided in the Junior Lien Collateral Documents and this Agreement except to the extent,
with respect to any Series of Junior Lien Obligations, such Lien on such assets constitutes a Junior Lien Declined Lien.
SECTION 6.
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings.
6.1 Finance and Sale Issues. Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Company shall be
subject to any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and any Senior Lien Representative shall desire to permit the use
of “Cash Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) on which such Senior Lien
Representative, such Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other creditor has a Lien, or to permit the Company to obtain
financing, whether from the Senior Lien Claimholders or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any similar Bankruptcy Law (“DIP Financing”), then each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral
Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, will not object to such Cash
Collateral use or DIP Financing (including any proposed orders for either or both such Cash Collateral use and DIP
Financing which are acceptable to any Senior Lien Representative) and to the extent the Liens securing the Senior Lien
Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with such DIP Financing, each Junior Lien Collateral Agent will
subordinate its Liens in the Collateral to the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto)
and each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other
Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection
therewith (except as expressly agreed by the Designated Senior Lien Representative or to the extent permitted by
Section 6.3); provided that the Junior Lien Representatives and the other Junior Lien Claimholders retain the right to
object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding Cash Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are
materially prejudicial to their interests. No Junior Lien Claimholder may provide DIP Financing to the Company secured
by Liens equal or senior in priority to the Liens securing any Senior Lien Obligations. Each Junior Lien Representative
and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it,
agrees that it will not seek consultation rights in connection with, and it will not object to or oppose, a motion to sell,
liquidate or otherwise dispose of Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code if the requisite Senior Lien
Claimholders have consented to such sale, liquidation or other disposition. Each Junior Lien Representative and each
Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, further
agrees that it will not directly or indirectly oppose or impede entry of any order in connection with such sale, liquidation
or other disposition, including orders to retain professionals or set bid procedures in connection with such sale,
liquidation or disposition, if the requisite Senior Lien Claimholders have consented to (i) such retention of
professionals and bid procedures in connection with such sale, liquidation or disposition of such assets and (ii) the
sale, liquidation or disposition of such assets, in which event the Junior Lien Claimholders will be deemed to have
consented to the sale or disposition of Collateral pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code and such order
does not materially impair the rights of the Junior Lien Claimholders under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code.
33
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, agrees that (A) without
the consent of the Senior Lien Claimholders, none of such Junior Lien Representative or such Junior Lien Collateral
Agent, the Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it or any agent or the trustee on behalf of any of them shall, for any
purpose during any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise, support, endorse, propose or submit, whether
directly or indirectly, any valuation of the Company or their respective assets that allocates or ascribes any value
whatsoever to any of the Restricted Assets and (B) without the consent of the Senior Lien Claimholders, none of such
Junior Lien Representative or such Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the Junior Lien Claimholders represented by it or any
agent or trustee on behalf of any of them shall for any purpose during any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or
otherwise, challenge, dispute or object, whether directly or indirectly, to any valuation of the Company or its assets, or
otherwise take any position with respect to such valuation, that is proposed, supported or otherwise arises in any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, on grounds that such valuation does not allocate or ascribe adequate or
appropriate value to any of the Restricted Assets.
6.2 Relief from the Automatic Stay. Until the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations has occurred, each Junior Lien
Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder
represented by it, agrees that none of them shall: (i) seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the
automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of the Collateral or the
Restricted Assets, without the prior written consent of all of the Senior Lien Representatives, unless a motion for
adequate protection permitted under Section 6.3 has been denied by a bankruptcy court or (ii) oppose (or support any
other Person in opposing) any request by any Senior Lien Representative or Senior Lien Collateral Agent for relief from
such stay.
6.3 Adequate Protection.
(a) Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, agrees that none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting):
(1) any request by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or other Senior Lien Claimholder
for adequate protection under any Bankruptcy Law; or
(2) any objection by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or other Senior Lien Claimholder
to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on such Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or
Senior Lien Claimholder claiming a lack of adequate protection.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this Section 6.3, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding:
(1) if the Senior Lien Claimholders (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of additional
collateral in connection with any
34
Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing, then each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any other Junior
Lien Claimholder represented by it, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien on such additional
collateral, which Lien will be subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior Lien Obligations and such Cash Collateral
use or DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing the Junior
Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Senior Lien Obligations under this Agreement; and
(2) the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and Junior Lien Claimholders shall only be
permitted to seek adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding in the form of (A) additional collateral; provided that as adequate protection for the Senior Lien Obligations,
each Senior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lien Claimholders represented by it, is also granted a Lien on
such additional collateral, which Lien shall be senior to any Lien of the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien
Collateral Agents and the Junior Lien Claimholders on such additional collateral; (B) replacement Liens on the
Collateral; provided that as adequate protection for the Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior Lien Collateral Agent, on
behalf of the Senior Lien Claimholders represented by it, is also granted replacement Liens on the Collateral, which
Liens shall be senior to the Liens of the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and the Junior
Lien Claimholders on the Collateral; (C) an administrative expense claim; provided that as adequate protection for the
Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior Lien Representative, on behalf of the Senior Lien Claimholders represented by it,
is also granted an administrative expense claim which is senior and prior to the administrative expense claim of the
Junior Lien Representatives and the other Junior Lien Claimholders; and (D) cash payments with respect to interest on
the Junior Lien Obligations; provided that (1) as adequate protection for the Senior Lien Obligations, each Senior Lien
Representative, on behalf of the Senior Lien Claimholders represented by it, is also granted cash payments with
respect to interest on the Senior Lien Obligation represented by it and (2) such cash payments do not exceed an
amount equal to the interest accruing on the principal amount of Junior Lien Obligations outstanding on the date such
relief is granted at the interest rate under the applicable Junior Lien Documents and accruing from the date the
applicable Junior Lien Representative is granted such relief. If any Junior Lien Claimholder receives Post-Petition
Interest and/or adequate protection payments in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (“Junior Lien Adequate
Protection Payments”) and the Senior Lien Claimholders do not receive payment in full in cash of all Senior Lien
Obligations upon the effectiveness of the plan of reorganization for, or conclusion of, that Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding, then each Junior Lien Claimholder shall pay over to the Senior Lien Claimholders an amount (the “Pay-
Over Amount”) equal to the lesser of (i) the Junior Lien Adequate Protection Payments received by such Junior Lien
Claimholder and (ii) the amount of the short-fall (the “Short Fall”) in payment in full in cash of the Senior Lien
Obligations; provided that to the extent any portion of the Short Fall
35
represents payments received by the Senior Lien Claimholders in the form of promissory notes, equity or other
property equal in value to the cash paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount, the Senior Lien Claimholders shall, upon
receipt of the Pay-Over Amount, transfer those promissory notes, equity or other property, equal in value to the cash
paid in respect of the Pay-Over Amount, to the applicable Junior Lien Claimholders pro rata in exchange for the Pay-
Over Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Senior Lien Claimholders shall not be deemed to
have consented to, and expressly retain their rights to object to, the grant of adequate protection in the form of cash
payments to the Junior Lien Claimholders made pursuant to this Section 6.3(b).
6.4 No Waiver. Subject to Section 6.7(b), nothing contained herein shall prohibit or in any way limit any Senior Lien
Representative or any other Senior Lien Claimholder from objecting in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or
otherwise to any action taken by any Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder, including the
seeking by any Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder of adequate protection or the
asserting by any Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Claimholder of any of its rights and remedies
under the Junior Lien Documents or otherwise.
6.5 Avoidance Issues. If any Senior Lien Claimholder is required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or
otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Company any amount paid in respect of Senior Lien
Obligations (a “Recovery”), then such Senior Lien Claimholder shall be entitled to a reinstatement of its Senior Lien
Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts on the date of such Recovery, and from and after the date of
such reinstatement the Discharge of Senior Lien Obligations shall be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes
hereunder. If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in
full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the
obligations of the parties hereto from such date of reinstatement. This Section 6.5 shall survive termination of this
Agreement.
6.6 Reorganization Securities. If, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized
debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed pursuant to a plan of
reorganization, arrangement, compromise or liquidation or similar dispositive restructuring plan, both on account of
Senior Lien Obligations and on account of Junior Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed
on account of the Senior Lien Obligations and on account of the Junior Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the
same property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such
plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.
6.7 Post-Petition Interest.
(a) None of any Junior Lien Representative, any Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Junior Lien Claimholder shall
oppose or seek to challenge any claim by any Senior Lien Representative, any Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any
other Senior Lien Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Senior Lien
36
Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien of the Senior Lien Collateral Agents
on behalf of the Senior Lien Claimholders on the Collateral or any other Senior Lien Claimholder’s Lien on the
Collateral, without regard to the existence of the Liens of the Junior Lien Collateral Agents or the other Junior Lien
Claimholders on the Collateral.
(b) None of any Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or any other Senior Lien Claimholder shall
oppose or seek to challenge any claim by any Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any other
Junior Lien Claimholder for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Junior Lien Obligations
consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of the Lien of the Junior Lien Collateral Agents, on behalf
of the Junior Lien Claimholders, on the Collateral (after taking into account the amount of the Senior Lien Obligations).
6.8 Waiver. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each
other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, waives any claim it may hereafter have against any Senior Lien
Claimholder arising out of the election of any Senior Lien Claimholder of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code, and out of any cash collateral or financing arrangement or out of any grant of a security interest in
connection with the Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding so long as such actions are not in express
contravention of the terms of this Agreement.
6.9 Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, and each Senior Lien
Representative and each Senior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Senior Lien Claimholder
represented by it, acknowledges and agrees that:
(a) the grants of Liens pursuant to the Senior Lien Collateral Documents and the Junior Lien Collateral Documents
constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens; and
(b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally
different from the Senior Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or
adopted in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.
To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the
claims of the Senior Lien Claimholders and the Junior Lien Claimholders in respect of the Collateral constitute only one
secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each of the parties hereto hereby
acknowledges and agrees that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior
secured claims against the Company in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the
aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Lien Claimholders),
the Senior Lien Claimholders shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of
principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing (or that would be owing if there were such separate
classes
37
of senior and junior secured claims) in respect of Post-Petition Interest (including any additional interest payable
pursuant to the Senior Lien Documents, arising from or related to a default, which is disallowed as a claim in any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding) before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the Junior Lien
Claimholders with respect to the Collateral, with each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral
Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby acknowledging and
agreeing to turn over to the Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other Senior Lien
Claimholder, Collateral or proceeds of Collateral otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to
effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the
Junior Lien Claimholders).
6.10 Effectiveness in Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is a
“subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which will be effective before, during and
after the commencement of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. All references in this Agreement to the Company
will include such Person as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such Person in an Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding.
SECTION 7. Reliance; Waivers.

Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and each other Senior Lien Claimholder represented by it, acknowledges that it

7.3 No Waiver of Lien Priorities.
(a) No right of the Senior Lien Claimholders, the Senior Lien Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral Agents or any
of them to enforce any provision of this Agreement or any Senior Lien Documents shall at any time in any way be

8.1 Integration/Conflicts. This Agreement, the Senior Lien Documents and the Junior Lien Documents represent the
entire agreement by and among the Company, the Senior Lien Claimholders and the Junior Lien Claimholders with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no promises, undertakings, representations
or warranties by the Senior Lien Claimholders or the Junior Lien Claimholders relative to the subject matter hereof and
thereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the Senior Lien Documents or the Junior Lien Documents, the provisions of this
Agreement shall govern and control.
8.2 Effectiveness; Continuing Nature of this Agreement; Severability. This Agreement shall become effective when
executed and delivered by the parties hereto. This is a continuing agreement of lien subordination and the Senior Lien
Claimholders may continue, at any time and without notice to any Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien
Claimholder, to extend credit and other financial accommodations and lend monies to or for the benefit of the Company
or Centrus constituting Senior Lien Obligations in reliance hereon. Each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior

and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace any invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
those of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. All references to the Company shall include the Company as
debtor and debtor-in-possession and any receiver, trustee or similar person acting for the Company (as the case may
be) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect:

42
provided, however, that in each case, such termination shall not relieve any such party of its obligations incurred
hereunder prior to the date of such termination.
8.3 Amendments; Waivers.
(a) No amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be made
unless the same shall be in writing signed on behalf of each party hereto or its authorized agent and each waiver, if any,
shall be a waiver only with respect to the specific instance involved and shall in no way impair the rights of the parties
making such waiver or the obligations of the other parties to such party in any other respect or at any other time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any right to consent to or approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement except to the extent their rights are directly and adversely

Collateral Agent and the Additional Senior Lien Claimholders and Additional Senior Lien Obligations or Additional
Junior Lien Claimholders and Additional Junior Lien Obligations of the Series for which such Representative and
Collateral Agent is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof.

Obligations or the Junior Lien Obligations. The Senior Lien Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the
other Senior Lien Claimholders, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral
Agents and any other Junior Lien Claimholder, on the other hand, shall have no duty to advise of information known to
it or them regarding such condition or any such circumstances or otherwise. In the event any Claimholder, in its sole
discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any other Claimholder, it shall
be under no obligation:
(a) to make, and such Claimholder shall not make, any express or implied representation or warranty, including with
respect to the accuracy, completeness, truthfulness or validity of any such information so provided;
43
(b) to provide any additional information or to provide any such information on any subsequent occasion;

the terms of this Agreement, such Junior Lien Claimholders, Junior Lien Representatives and Junior Lien Collateral
Agents shall be subrogated to the rights of such Senior Lien Representatives, Senior Lien Collateral Agents and Senior
Lien Claimholders; provided that each Junior Lien Representative and each Junior Lien Collateral Agent, on behalf of

other assets received by any Junior Lien Representative, Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Claimholder
that are paid over to any Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or other Senior Lien Claimholder
pursuant to this Agreement shall not reduce any of the Junior Lien Obligations.
8.6 Application of Payments. All payments received by any Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or

Junior Lien Claimholder represented by it, agrees to any extension or postponement of the time of payment of the
Senior Lien Obligations or any part thereof and to any other indulgence with respect thereto, to any substitution,

Debt, if and subject to the condition, the Additional Junior Lien Representative and Additional Junior Lien Collateral
Agent of any such Additional Junior Lien Debt each becomes a party to this Agreement by satisfying the conditions set

hereof shall inure to the benefit of each of the Senior Lien Claimholders and the Junior Lien Claimholders and their
respective successors and assigns from time to time. Each holder of any Designated Senior Claim that is not (either
directly or through an agent) a party hereto shall be an express third party beneficiary hereof. The provisions of this
Agreement are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Senior Lien
Representatives, the Senior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Senior Lien Claimholders on the one hand and the
Junior Lien Representatives, the Junior Lien Collateral Agents and the other Junior Lien Claimholders on the other
hand. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the relative rights and obligations as among the Senior Lien
Claimholders or as among the Junior Lien Claimholders; as among the Senior Lien Claimholders, such rights and
obligations are governed by, and any provisions herein regarding them are therefore subject to, the provisions of the
Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Other than as set forth in Section 8.3 and in Section 8.7, none of the Company or
any other creditor thereof shall have any rights hereunder and neither the Company nor the Company may rely on the
terms hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Company, which are
absolute and unconditional, to pay the Senior Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations as and when the same
shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms.
8.19 No Indirect Actions. Unless otherwise expressly stated, if a party may not take an action under this Agreement,
then it may not take that action indirectly, or support any other Person in taking that action directly or indirectly.
“Taking an action indirectly” means taking an action that is not expressly prohibited for the party but is intended by the
party to have substantially the same effects as the prohibited action.
8.20 Relationship with Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement; No Duty of Senior Claimholders to Non-Parties. This
agreement is solely intended to allocate rights and benefits between the Senior Lien Claimholders taken together on
the one hand and the Junior Lien Claimholders taken together on the other hand. As among the Senior Lien
Claimholders, their respective rights and benefits may be allocated as agreed among the Senior Lien Claimholders in
the Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement including without limitation as to Lien priority or payment priority all without
affecting the terms of this agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Senior Lien
Representative or Senior Lien Collateral Agent (including, without limitation, the Designated Senior Lien Representative
or Designated Senior Lien Collateral Agent) or other Senior Lien Claimholder shall have any duty or obligation
hereunder to any other Senior Lien Representative, Senior Lien Collateral Agent or Senior Lien Claimholder (other than
Senior Lien Claimholders of its own Series) unless such Senior Lien Representative and Senior Lien Collateral Agent
shall have become an express party hereto and to the Senior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

(x) all Equity Interests whether Investment Property or General Intangibles; provided, however, that no Equity Interests

such Foreign Subsidiary pledged hereunder would exceed 65% of such Foreign Subsidiary’s Equity Interests;
6
(xi) all books and records, wherever located, relating to any of the Collateral;
(xii) all General Intangibles (other than Equity Interests and other than Deferred Interests); and
(xiii) any and all proceeds, as such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, products, rents and profits of or

insurance (whether or not the Trustee or the Collateral Agent is the loss payee thereunder), indemnity, warranty or

the appropriate jurisdictions describing any other statutory liens held by the Trustee or the Collateral Agent and shall
provide copies and evidence of the filing thereof to the Trustee and Collateral Agent within a reasonable time period
after such filing.

DOE Collateral, (ii) any ACP Grant Purchased Property and (iii) any of Pledgor’s rights or interests in any license,
contract or agreement to which Pledgor is a party or any of its or interests thereunder to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such a grant would, under the terms of such license, contract or agreement or otherwise, result in a breach
of the terms of, or constitute a default under any license, contract or agreement to which Pledgor is a party (other than
to the extent that any such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code or any other
applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code) or principles of equity); provided that immediately upon the
ineffectiveness, lapse or termination of any such provision, the Collateral shall include, and Pledgor shall be deemed to
have granted a security interest in, all such rights and interests as if such provision had never been in effect; and
provided further that any Account or money or other amounts due or to become due to Pledgor under any such
license, contract or agreement or any proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition by Pledgor of any rights of
Pledgor under any such license, contract or agreement shall at no time be excluded from the Collateral or the security
interest granted by Pledgor hereunder in favor of the Collateral Agent.

the following liabilities and obligations of the Pledgor: (a) all liabilities and obligations, including obligations owing to
the Collateral Agent under the Security Documents (as defined in the Indenture), of the Pledgor as a Guarantor
pursuant to and under the Guarantee, whether such liabilities and obligations are now existing or hereafter incurred,
created or arising and whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, including, without
limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition or commencement of a case by or with respect to Issuer or
Pledgor seeking relief under any applicable federal and state laws pertaining to bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium, readjustment of debts, dissolution, liquidation or other debtor relief, specifically including,
without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code and any fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance laws, whether or not
the claim for such interest is allowed in such proceeding), (b) all such liabilities and obligations that, but for the

and expenses payable by Pledgor under Section 8.1 (the liabilities and obligations of the Pledgor described in this
Section 2.2, collectively, the “Secured Obligations”). In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act requires or would require the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of separate financial
statements of any “affiliate” of the Pledgor due to the fact that such affiliate’s “securities” secure any Secured
Obligations, then such “securities” shall automatically be deemed not to constitute security for any Secured
Obligations and shall not constitute Equity Interests or Collateral hereunder. As used herein, “securities” and “affiliate”
shall have the meaning set forth in Regulation S-X or such other law, rule or regulation, as applicable.
2.3 Deferred Interests.
7
(a) Subject to Section 2.3(b), Pledgor hereby pledges and assigns to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties, and grants to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the ratable benefit of the Secured
Parties, a Lien upon and security interest in, all of Pledgor’s right, title and interest in and to the following, in each case
whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising or in which Pledgor now has or at any time in the future
may acquire any right, title or interest (it being understood that, subject to Section 2.3(b), Section 2.3(c) and Section 1.2,
the following assets and properties shall also constitute “Collateral” as used in this Agreement):
(i) all Copyright Collateral;
(ii) all Patent Collateral;
(iii) all Trademark Collateral; and
(iv) any and all proceeds, as such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, products, rents and profits of or
from any and all of the foregoing and, to the extent not otherwise included in the foregoing, (w) all payments under any
insurance (whether or not the Trustee or the Collateral Agent is the loss payee thereunder), indemnity, warranty or
guaranty with respect to any of the foregoing Collateral, (x) all payments in connection with any requisition,
condemnation, seizure or forfeiture with respect to any of the foregoing Collateral, (y) all claims and rights to recover for
any past, present or future infringement or dilution of or injury to any Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral or
Trademark Collateral, and (z) all other amounts from time to time paid or payable under or with respect to any of the
foregoing Collateral (it being understood that, subject to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), the foregoing assets and
properties referred to in this clause (iv) shall also constitute “Proceeds” as used in this Agreement).
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a) or any of the provisions contained herein or in the Indenture or
Notes, no Lien upon and security interest in the Deferred Interests shall be deemed to have occurred nor shall any
such Lien and security interest be deemed to have attached to or on the Deferred Interests until any of the following
events shall have occurred (each a “Deferred Interests Triggering Event”): (i) Deferred Interests shall be pledged to the
holders of such Designated Senior Claim or a representative on their behalf to secure a Designated Senior Claim, or
(ii) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Immediately upon the occurrence of any Deferred
Interests Triggering Event, a Lien on the Deferred Interests consisting of Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral,
Trademark Collateral and all Proceeds related thereto shall automatically be deemed to have attached in favor of the
Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3 without any further action by the Collateral Agent or Pledgor and, on and
after the occurrence of such Deferred Interests Triggering Event, the Pledgor shall file financing statements under the
Uniform Commercial Code describing the Collateral represented by such Deferred Interests and Pledgor shall take all
necessary actions, including, but not limited to, those required by Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.12 herein to complete any
required annexes to this Agreement, as promptly as possible (and in no event more than ten (10) days from the
occurrence of any such Deferred Interests Triggering Event) at Pledgor’s expense in order to give the Collateral Agent
a first priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral represented by such Deferred Interests. As
of the date on which a Lien on any Deferred Interests attaches pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Pledgor shall be
deemed to have reaffirmed the representations and warranties set forth in Article III with respect to such Deferred
Interests. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, with respect to any Patent Collateral, no Lien or
security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent shall attach or be deemed to attach, and Collateral Agent agrees not to
take any action to register, record or file any financing statement or other evidence of a Lien or security interest, without
the prior written consent of the Pledgor (except that no such consent shall be required if a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding shall have been commenced by or against Pledgor) if: (i) the attachment, registration, recordation or filing
of such Lien could reasonably be expected to (x) result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of any
license, permit or contractual agreement between Pledgor and the DOE or any other applicable governmental authority
or (y) limit, invalidate or impair Pledgor’s right to maintain ownership of or license or right to use, such Patent Collateral;
or (ii) such Patent Collateral includes classified information and the attachment, registration, recordation or filing of
such Lien on such Patent Collateral would constitute a breach or violation of Pledgor’s duty to maintain the
confidentiality of such classified information.
8
(c) Without limiting Section 1.2, in no event shall the Collateral include, and Pledgor shall not be deemed to have
granted a security interest in any of Pledgor’s rights or interests in, any license, contract or agreement to which Pledgor
is a party or any of its or interests thereunder to the extent, but only to the extent, that such a grant would, under the
terms of such license, contract or agreement or otherwise, result in a breach of the terms of, or constitute a default
under any such license, contract or agreement (other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered
ineffective pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code or any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code) or
principles of equity); provided that immediately upon the ineffectiveness, lapse or termination of any such term, the
Collateral shall include, and Pledgor shall be deemed to have granted a security interest in, all such rights and interests
as if such term had never been in effect; provided further that any Account or money or other amounts due or to
become due to Pledgor under any such license, contract or agreement or any proceeds resulting from the sale or other
disposition by Pledgor of any rights of Pledgor under any such license, contract or agreement shall at no time be
excluded from the Collateral or the security interest granted by Pledgor hereunder in favor of the Collateral Agent.
(d) Except as specifically provided herein or as permitted by the Indenture, Pledgor will not sell or otherwise dispose of,
grant any option with respect to, or grant any Lien with respect to or otherwise encumber any of the Deferred Interests
or any interest therein; provided that a Lien on Deferred Interests may be granted to secure Designated Senior Claims
so long the Collateral Agent also has a Lien on any and all Deferred Interests securing any Designated Senior Claim.
2.4 Inventory Account. Pledgor shall establish, in its own name, an Inventory Account to which all Pledgor-owned
uranium and SWU Component in the Inventory shall be credited. The balance of material credited to this Inventory
Account shall be reconciled monthly.

to the extent that Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code are applicable thereto, superior and prior to the
rights of all other persons therein (except for Permitted Liens), and no other or additional filings, registrations,
recordings or actions are or shall be necessary or appropriate in order to perfect or maintain the perfection and priority
of such Lien and security interest, other than actions required with respect to Collateral of the types excluded from

located, and (v) the other consents and approvals described in Section 8.15. The provisions of this Section 3.4 shall not

the valid right to use all Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks material to its business and, to the best of Pledgor’s
knowledge, the use thereof by the Pledgor does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such

Effect. As of the date hereof and as of the date on which the Lien on the Deferred Interests attaches, all Copyrights,

symbol or number on any of Pledgor’s Equipment constituting Collateral except pursuant to a sale of such Collateral to
a third party permitted by this Agreement or the Indenture.
12
4.6 Taxes. Pledgor will, to the extent required under Section 4.05 of the Indenture, pay and discharge (i) all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it, upon its income or profits or upon any of its
properties, prior to the date on which penalties would attach thereto, and (ii) all lawful claims for taxes, assessment,
governmental charges or levies that, if unpaid, might become a Lien upon any of the Collateral.
4.7 Insurance.
(a) Pledgor will maintain and pay for, or cause to be maintained and paid for, with responsible insurance companies,
insurance with respect to its assets, properties and business, against such hazards and liabilities, of such types and in
such amounts, as is required pursuant to Section 4.12 of the Indenture.
(b) Pledgor hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent at all times during the continuance
of an Event of Default, its true and lawful attorney (and agent-in-fact) for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting
claims under such policies of insurance, endorsing its name on any check, draft, instrument or other item or payment
for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect to such
policies of insurance.
(c) If Pledgor fails to obtain and maintain any of the policies of insurance required to be maintained hereunder or to pay
any premium in whole or in part, the Collateral Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or Default, at
Pledgor’s expense, but without any obligation to do so, procure such policies or pay such premiums. All sums so
disbursed by the Collateral Agent, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, court and out of pocket costs, expenses and
other charges related thereto, shall be payable by the Pledgor to the Collateral Agent on demand and shall be
additional Secured Obligations hereunder, secured by the Collateral.
(d) Pledgor will deliver to the Collateral Agent, promptly as rendered, true copies of all material claims and reports made
in any reporting forms to insurance companies. Pledgor will deliver to the Collateral Agent one or more certificates of
insurance evidencing renewal of the insurance coverage required hereunder (or issuance of a replacement policy from
another insurance company meeting the requirements of this Section 4.7) plus such other evidence of payment of
premiums therefor as the Collateral Agent may request. Upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, from time
to time, Pledgor will deliver to the Collateral Agent evidence that the insurance required to be maintained pursuant to
this Section is in effect.
4.8 Intellectual Property.
(a) If at any time a Credit Agreement is outstanding and such Credit Agreement requires that the Pledgor deliver an
updated schedule of material Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks to the Credit Agreement Agent, then whenever the
Pledgor so delivers such an updated schedule to the Credit Agreement Agent, it shall also deliver the copies of such
updated schedules to the Collateral Agent. If there is no Credit Agreement outstanding or such Credit Agreement does
not require that the Pledgor deliver updated schedules of material Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks periodically,
then the Pledgor shall nonetheless deliver updated schedules of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks included in the
Collateral not less frequently than once per calendar year commencing on the first anniversary date of the Deferred
Interest Triggering Event and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, updated schedules will be
delivered to the Collateral Agent. As of the date on which the Lien on the Deferred Interests attaches, Pledgor will, at its
own expense, execute and deliver a fully completed Copyright Security Agreement, Patent Security Agreement or
Trademark Security Agreement in the respective forms of Exhibits B, C and D, as applicable, with regard to any
Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral or Trademark Collateral (in each case, to the extent registered or filed, subject to
the provisions of Section 3.7 hereof), as the case may be, of Pledgor, described in Annexes D, E and F hereto. In the
event that after such date, Pledgor shall acquire any registered Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral or Trademark
Collateral or effect any registration of any such Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral or Trademark Collateral or file
any application for registration thereof, within the United States, Pledgor shall promptly furnish written notice thereof to
the Collateral Agent together with information sufficient to permit the Collateral Agent, upon its receipt of such notice,
to (and Pledgor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to) modify this Agreement, as appropriate, by amending Annex
D, E or F hereto or to add additional exhibits hereto to include any Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral or Trademark
Collateral (in each case, to the extent registered or filed, subject to the provisions of Section 3.7 hereof) that becomes
part of the
13
Collateral under this Agreement, and Pledgor shall additionally, at its own expense, execute and deliver, as promptly as
possible (but in any event within ten (10) days) after the date of such notice, with regard to United States Copyrights,
Patents and Trademarks, fully completed Copyright Security Agreements, Patent Security Agreements or Trademark
Security Agreements in the forms of Exhibits B, C and D, as applicable, together in all instances with any other
agreements, instruments and documents that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from time to time to further
effect and confirm the security interest created by this Agreement in such Copyright Collateral, Patent Collateral and
Trademark Collateral, and Pledgor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact, upon the occurrence and
the continuance of an Event of Default, to execute, deliver and record any and all such agreements, instruments and
documents for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed and such power,
being coupled with an interest, being irrevocable for so long as this Agreement shall be in effect with respect to
Pledgor. In that connection, Pledgor shall also execute and deliver on the date on which the Lien on the Deferred
Interests attaches, one copy of the Special Power of Attorney in the form of Annex H hereto.
(b) The Pledgor shall file and prosecute diligently all applications for registration of Patents, Trademarks or Copyrights
now or hereafter pending that would be necessary to the business of the Pledgor to which any such applications
pertain, and do all acts (or refrain from doing all acts), in any such instance, reasonably necessary to preserve and
maintain all material rights in Patents, Trademarks or Copyrights, unless such Patents, Trademarks or Copyrights are
not material to the business of the Pledgor, as reasonably determined by the Pledgor consistent with prudent and
commercially reasonable business practices.
(c) From and after the date on which the Lien on the Deferred Interests attaches, Pledgor shall notify the Collateral
Agent promptly in writing if it knows or has reason to know that any material Patent Collateral, Trademark Collateral or
Copyright Collateral used in the conduct of its business may become abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any
adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any
proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Copyright Office or any court) regarding Pledgor’s ownership
of any material Patent Collateral, Trademark Collateral or Copyright Collateral, its right to register the same, or to keep
and maintain the same.
(d) From and after the date on which the Lien on the Deferred Interests attaches, in the event that any Collateral
consisting of material Patent Collateral, Trademark Collateral or Copyright Collateral used in the conduct of Pledgor’s
business is believed infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, Pledgor shall notify the Collateral Agent
promptly in writing after it learns thereof and shall, if consistent with the exercise of reasonable business judgment and
applicable laws, regulations and agreements to which the applicable Pledgor is a party, promptly sue for infringement,
misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution,
and take such other actions as are appropriate under the circumstances to protect such Collateral.
(e) From and after the date on which the Lien on the Deferred Interests attaches, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all requisite
consents or approvals from the licensor of each material License included within the Copyright Collateral, Patent
Collateral or Trademark Collateral to effect the assignment of all of Pledgor’s right, title and interest thereunder to the
Collateral Agent or its designee.
4.9 Delivery of Collateral. Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and Section 8.16 hereof, all certificates or instruments
representing or evidencing any material Account, Equity Interest or other Collateral delivered to the Collateral Agent
pursuant to this Agreement, shall be in form suitable for transfer by delivery and shall be delivered together with
undated stock powers duly executed in blank, appropriate endorsements or other necessary instruments of
registration, transfer or assignment, duly executed, and in each case such other instruments or documents required or
as the Collateral Agent may, but is not required to, request (provided that delivery of an opinion of counsel may only be
requested where required by the Indenture). Pledgor shall deliver an Officers’ Certificate (as defined in the Indenture) to
the Collateral Agent certifying as to the requirements for delivery.
14
4.10 Protection of Security Interest. Pledgor agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts, at its own cost and
expense, to take any and all actions necessary to warrant and defend the right, title and interest of the Collateral Agent
and Secured Parties in and to the Collateral against the claims and demands of all other persons.
4.11 Control of Investment Property, Deposit Accounts and Electronic Chattel Paper. Subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the last sentence of Section 3.2 and Section 8.16 hereof, if any Investment Property (whether now owned or
hereafter acquired) is included in the Collateral, Pledgor will notify the Collateral Agent in writing thereof and will
promptly take and cause to be taken all actions required under Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and
any other applicable law to enable the Collateral Agent (or the Credit Agreement Agent as agent or bailee for the
Collateral Agent) to acquire “control” (within the meaning of such term under Section 8-106 (or its successor provision)
of the Uniform Commercial Code) of such Investment Property and as may be otherwise necessary to perfect the
security interest of the Collateral Agent therein. Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and Section 8.16 hereof, if any
Deposit Account (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), other than any Excluded Account, is included in the
Collateral, Pledgor will notify the Collateral Agent in writing thereof and will promptly take and cause to be taken all
actions required under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and any other applicable law to enable the Collateral
Agent to acquire “control” (within the meaning of such term under Section 9-104 (or its successor provision) of the
Uniform Commercial Code) of such Deposit Account and as may be otherwise necessary to perfect the security
interest of the Collateral Agent therein. Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and Section 8.16 hereof, if any Account
of Pledgor would constitute “electronic chattel paper” as defined under the Uniform Commercial Code, Pledgor will
promptly notify the Collateral Agent in writing and will take such other steps as may be necessary to give the Collateral
Agent (or the holder of any Designated Senior Claim or a representative of such a holder, as agent or bailee for the
Collateral Agent) “control” over such electronic chattel paper (within the meaning of Section 9-105 of the Uniform
Commercial Code). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of any control agreement shall provide that the
Company may terminate such control agreement by delivery of a written certification to each of the relevant deposit
bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian, as applicable, and the Collateral Agent that the property subject to
such control agreement is subject to another control agreement for the benefit of the holders of any Designated Senior
Claims or their agent or other representative who are parties to the Intercreditor Agreement (provided that the foregoing
termination shall not apply to any control agreement that established the control of both the Collateral Agent and the
holders of any Designated Senior Claims so long as such control is consistent with the priorities established by the
Intercreditor Agreement). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of the following to
occur (such obligation to use commercial reasonable efforts to continue with respect to each of the following until such
efforts are successful as to one of the following or such efforts are unsuccessful as to all of the following): (i) obtain the
consent of the applicable holders of Designated Senior Claims or their agent(s) or other representative(s) and the
applicable deposit bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian, as applicable, to the Collateral Agent retaining its
own separate control agreement reflecting the priorities established by the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) obtain the
consent of the applicable holders of Designated Senior Claims or their agent(s) or other representative(s) and the
applicable deposit bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian, as applicable, to the Collateral Agent being a
party to the control agreement in favor of the holders of Designated Senior Claims or their agent(s) and pursuant to
such control agreement having the applicable deposit bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian, as applicable,
agree to follow instructions or entitlement orders, as applicable, of the Collateral Agent without further consent of the
Company upon a discharge of the Designated Senior Claims, or (iii) in the event that the provisions of Sections 8-106
and 9-104 of the Uniform Commercial Code are amended in a manner consistent with that set forth in Assembly Bill
9933, cause any control agreement for the benefit of any holders of Designated Senior Claims to be subject to the
Uniform Commercial Code. The Company agrees that it will not exercise its right to terminate any such separate control
agreements in favor of the Collateral Agent so long as the consent referred to in clause (i) is obtained or if such
separate control agreement is amended in accordance with clause (ii) rather than replaced.
4.12 Supplements to Schedules and Annexes. The Pledgor shall, from time to time, amend or supplement in writing and
deliver to the Collateral Agent revisions of and supplements to the Annexes and schedules hereto to the extent
necessary to disclose new or changed facts or circumstances arising after the date hereof, which, if existing or
occurring on such date, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Annex or schedule hereto;
provided that (i) in connection with any amendment or supplement to Annex B, the Pledgor shall provide the Collateral
Agent at least fifteen (15) days’ advance written notice of any such amendment
15
or supplement (or such shorter period as the Collateral Agent may approve in writing), shall comply with Section 4.2
and shall take any other action reasonably requested by Collateral Agent in connection therewith to maintain the Lien
of Collateral Agent on the Collateral after giving effect to such amendment or supplement, (ii) in connection with any
amendment or supplement to Annex G, the Pledgor shall provide the Collateral Agent at least fifteen (15) days’ advance
written notice of any such amendment or supplement (or such shorter period as the Collateral Agent may approve),
shall comply with Sections 3.9 and 4.11 and shall take any other action reasonably requested by Collateral Agent in
connection therewith to maintain the Lien of Collateral Agent on the Collateral after giving effect to such amendment or
supplement, (iii) in connection with any amendment or supplement to Annex C, the Pledgor shall comply with
Section 4.2, (iv) in connection with any amendment or supplement to Annexes D, E or F, the Pledgor shall comply with
Section 4.8(a), and (v) no such amendment or supplement to any such Annex shall constitute a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default in existence on or prior to the date of such amendment or supplement. Any reference to an Annex or
schedule in this Agreement shall refer to such Annex as amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with this Section 4.12. Pledgor shall deliver an Officers’ Certificate (as defined in the Indenture) to the Collateral Agent
certifying as to such changed facts or circumstances.
ARTICLE V
CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO EQUITY INTERESTS
5.1 Ownership; After-Acquired Equity Interests.
(a) Except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, Pledgor will cause the Equity Interests pledged by it hereunder to
constitute at all times 100% of the capital stock or other Equity Interests in each subsidiary of Pledgor, such that the
issuer thereof shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Pledgor. Unless the Collateral Agent shall have given its prior
written consent, Pledgor will not cause or permit any such issuer to issue or sell any new capital stock, any warrants,
options or rights to acquire the same, or other Equity Interests of any nature to any person other than Pledgor, or
cause, permit or consent to the admission of any other person as a stockholder, partner or member of any such issuer.
(b) If Pledgor shall, at any time and from time to time, acquire any additional capital stock or other Equity Interests in
any person of the types described in the definition of the term “Equity Interests”, the same shall be automatically
deemed to be Equity Interests, and shall be deemed to be pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 and,
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Pledgor will forthwith pledge and, subject to Section 8.16 hereof, deposit the
same with the Collateral Agent and deliver to the Collateral Agent any certificates or instruments therefor, together with
the endorsement of Pledgor (in the case of any promissory notes or other Instruments), undated stock powers (in the
case of Equity Interests evidenced by certificates) or other necessary instruments of transfer or assignment, duly
executed in blank, together with such other certificates and instruments as the Collateral Agent may, but is not required
to, reasonably request (including Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or appropriate amendments thereto),
and will promptly thereafter deliver to the Collateral Agent a fully completed and duly executed amendment to this
Agreement in the form of Exhibit A (each, a “Pledge Amendment”) in respect thereof. Pledgor hereby authorizes the
Collateral Agent to attach each such Pledge Amendment to this Agreement, and agrees that all such Collateral listed on
any Pledge Amendment shall for all purposes be deemed Collateral hereunder and shall be subject to the provisions
hereof, provided that the failure of Pledgor to execute and deliver any Pledge Amendment with respect to any such
additional Collateral as required hereinabove shall not impair the security interest of the Collateral Agent in such
Collateral or otherwise adversely affect the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder with respect thereto.
(c) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and Section 8.16 hereof, if any Equity Interests (whether now owned or
hereafter acquired) included in the Collateral are “uncertificated securities” within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code or are otherwise not evidenced by any certificate or instrument, each applicable Pledgor will
promptly notify the Collateral Agent in writing thereof and will promptly take and cause to be taken, and will (if the issuer
of such uncertificated securities is a person other than a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Parent) use its best efforts
to cause the issuer to take, all actions required under Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and any other
applicable law, to enable the Collateral Agent to acquire “control” (within the meaning of such term under Section 8-106
(or its successor provision) of the Uniform Commercial Code) of such uncertificated securities and as may be
otherwise necessary or deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent to perfect the security interest of the Collateral
Agent therein.
16
5.2 Voting Rights. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Pledgor shall be entitled to
exercise all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to its Equity Interests (subject to its obligations under
Section 5.1) which have become Collateral, and for that purpose the Collateral Agent will execute and deliver or cause
to be executed and delivered to the Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as the Pledgor may reasonably
request in writing to enable the Pledgor to exercise such voting and other consensual rights; provided, however, that
the Pledgor will not cast any vote, give any consent, waiver or ratification, or take or fail to take any action, in any
manner that would, or could reasonably be expected to, violate or be inconsistent with any of the terms of this
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture, or have the effect of impairing the position or interests of the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in such Collateral.
5.3 Dividends and Other Distributions. Except as provided otherwise herein or in the Indenture, all interest, income,
dividends, distributions and other amounts payable in cash in respect of the Equity Interests which have become
Collateral shall be paid to the Collateral Agent and retained by it in a non-interest bearing account as part of the
Collateral (except to the extent applied upon receipt to the repayment of the Secured Obligations). The Collateral Agent
shall also be entitled at all times to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral, (i) all interest, income,
dividends, distributions or other amounts paid or payable in cash or other property in respect of any Equity Interests
which have become Collateral in connection with the dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization or reclassification of the
capital of the applicable issuer to the extent representing an extraordinary, liquidating or other distribution in return of
capital, (ii) all additional Equity Interests or other securities or property (other than cash) paid or payable or distributed
or distributable in respect of any Equity Interests which have become Collateral in connection with any noncash
dividend, distribution, return of capital, spin-off, stock split, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or interests
or similar rearrangement, and (iii) without affecting any restrictions against such actions contained in the Indenture, all
additional Equity Interests or other securities or property (including cash) paid or payable or distributed or distributable
in respect of any Equity Interests which have become Collateral in connection with any consolidation, merger,
exchange of securities, liquidation or other reorganization. All interest, income, dividends, distributions or other
amounts that are received by Pledgor in violation of the provisions of this Section shall be received in trust for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of Pledgor and, subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and Section 8.16 hereof, shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent as Collateral in the
same form as so received (with any necessary endorsements) or in the case of cash, by wire transfer pursuant to
payment instructions provided by Collateral Agent to Pledgor. Any such cash shall be retained in a non-interest
bearing account.
ARTICLE VI
REMEDIES
6.1 Remedies. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(which may limit or preclude the exercise of rights under this Article VI), the Collateral Agent, at the direction of the
Trustee acting upon the written direction of the appropriate percentage of Holders under the Indenture, as applicable,
shall be entitled to exercise in respect of the Collateral all of its rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or
otherwise available to it under the Indenture, by law, in equity or otherwise, including all rights and remedies of a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, and shall be entitled in particular, but without limitation of the
foregoing (other than as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement), to exercise the following rights, which Pledgor
agrees to be commercially reasonable:
(a) To notify any or all account debtors or obligors under any Accounts or other Collateral of the security interest in
favor of the Collateral Agent created hereby and to direct all such Persons to make payments of all amounts due
thereon or thereunder directly to the Collateral Agent or to an account designated by the Collateral Agent; and in such
instance and from and after such notice, all amounts and Proceeds (including wire transfers, checks and other
instruments) received by Pledgor in respect of any Accounts or other Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit
of the Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from the other funds of Pledgor and, subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, shall be forthwith deposited into such account or paid over or delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsements or assignments), to be held as Collateral and applied to the
Secured Obligations as provided herein;
17
(b) To receive, open and properly dispose of all mail addressed to Pledgor concerning Accounts and other Collateral
and to notify the appropriate postal authority to change the mailing or delivery address of such mail; to accelerate any
indebtedness or other obligation constituting Collateral that may be accelerated in accordance with its terms; to take or
bring all actions and suits deemed necessary or appropriate to effect collections and to enforce payment of any
Accounts or other Collateral; to settle, compromise or release in whole or in part any amounts owing on Accounts or
other Collateral; and to extend the time of payment of any and all Accounts or other amounts owing under any
Collateral and to make allowances and adjustments with respect thereto, all in the same manner and to the same extent
as Pledgor might have done;
(c) Subject to applicable law and regulation, to transfer to or register in its name or the name of any of its agents or
nominees all or any part of the Collateral, without notice to Pledgor and with or without disclosing that such Collateral is
subject to the security interest created hereunder;
(d) Subject to applicable law and regulation, to require Pledgor to, and Pledgor hereby agrees that it will at its expense
and upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or any part of the Collateral as directed by the
Collateral Agent and to the extent permitted by applicable law make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place
designated by the Collateral Agent and Pledgor further agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to
clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale;
(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, to enter and remain upon the premises of Pledgor and take possession of
all or any part of the Collateral, with or without judicial process; to use the materials, services, books and records of
Pledgor for the purpose of liquidating or collecting the Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise; and to
remove the same to the premises of the Collateral Agent or any designated agent for such time as the Collateral Agent
may desire or as is necessary or advisable, in order to effectively collect or liquidate the Collateral;
(f) Subject to applicable law and regulation and the Intercreditor Agreement, to exercise, but only at the request of the
Trustee acting in accordance with the Indenture, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) all voting, consensual and
other rights and powers pertaining to the Equity Interests (whether or not transferred into the name of the Collateral
Agent), at any meeting of shareholders, partners, members or otherwise, and (ii) any and all rights of conversion,
exchange, subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to the Equity Interests as if it were the
absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange any and all of the Equity Interests upon the
merger, consolidation, reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares or interests, similar rearrangement or
other similar fundamental change in the structure of the applicable issuer, or upon the exercise by Pledgor or the
Collateral Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Equity Interests), and in connection therewith, the
right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Equity Interests with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar
or other designated agency and give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the Equity Interests, all without
liability except to account for any property actually received by it, but the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to
exercise any such right, privilege or option or give any such consent, waiver or ratification and shall not be responsible
for any failure to do so or delay in so doing; and for the foregoing purposes Pledgor will promptly execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, all such proxies and other instruments to enable the
Collateral Agent to exercise such rights and powers; AND IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING AND WITHOUT
LIMITATION THEREOF, PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTES AND APPOINTS THE COLLATERAL
AGENT AS THE TRUE AND LAWFUL PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF PLEDGOR, WITH FULL POWER OF
SUBSTITUTION IN THE PREMISES, UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF AN EVENT OF
DEFAULT, TO EXERCISE ALL SUCH VOTING, CONSENSUAL AND OTHER RIGHTS AND POWERS TO WHICH ANY
HOLDER OF ANY EQUITY INTERESTS WOULD BE ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THE SAME, WHICH PROXY
AND POWER OF ATTORNEY, BEING COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST, IS IRREVOCABLE AND SHALL BE EFFECTIVE
FOR SO LONG AS THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN EFFECT; and
18
(g) Subject to applicable law and regulation, to sell, resell, assign and deliver all or any of the Collateral, in one or more
parcels, on any securities exchange on which any Equity Interests may be listed, at public or private sale, at any of the
Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such
price or prices and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem satisfactory. If any of the Collateral is sold
by the Collateral Agent upon credit or for future delivery, the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for the failure of the
purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such failure, the Collateral Agent may, but is not
required to, resell such Collateral. In no event shall Pledgor be credited with any part of the Proceeds of sale of any
Collateral until and to the extent cash payment in respect thereof has actually been received by the Collateral Agent.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever
kind, including any equity or right of redemption of Pledgor, and Pledgor hereby expressly waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal, and all rights to require the Collateral Agent
to marshal any assets in favor of Pledgor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured
Obligations, that it has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted. No demand,
presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law, as referred to below), all
of which are hereby expressly waived by Pledgor, shall be required in connection with any sale or other disposition of
any part of the Collateral. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of any part of the Collateral shall be
required under applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall give the Pledgor at least ten (10) days’ prior notice of the time
and place of any public sale and of the time after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice
Pledgor agrees is commercially reasonable. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral if
it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale may have been given. The Collateral Agent may,
without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and
place to which the same was so adjourned. Upon each public sale and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon
each private sale, the Collateral Agent may purchase all or any of the Collateral being sold, free from any equity, right of
redemption or other claim or demand, and may make payment therefor by endorsement and application (without
recourse) of the Secured Obligations in lieu of cash as a credit on account of the purchase price for such Collateral.
The Collateral Agent shall, to the extent required by applicable laws, comply with any applicable state or federal law
requirements in connection with the sale or other disposition of the Collateral and Pledgor agrees that such
compliance is commercially reasonable. The Collateral Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral without
giving any warranties, specifically disclaiming any warranties of title or the like and Pledgor agrees that such disclaimer
is commercially reasonable.
6.2 Application of Proceeds.
(a) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, all Proceeds collected by the Collateral Agent upon any sale, other
disposition of or realization upon any of the Collateral, together with all other moneys received by the Collateral Agent
hereunder following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default shall be applied in accordance
with the Indenture.
(b) Pledgor shall remain liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of all Proceeds realized upon sale,
other disposition or collection of the Collateral, and monies held as Collateral pursuant to this Agreement and the
aggregate amount of Secured Obligations. Upon any sale of any Collateral hereunder by the Collateral Agent (whether
by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial proceeding, or otherwise), the receipt by the Collateral
Agent or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so
sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase
money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
6.3 Grant of License. To the extent permitted by applicable law and the Intercreditor Agreement and solely for the
purpose of enabling the Secured Parties to exercise rights and remedies under this Article VI, and at such time as the
Secured Parties shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, Pledgor hereby grants to the Collateral
Agent, to the extent it has the right to do so, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of
royalty or other compensation to Pledgor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to sufficient rights to quality control and
inspection in favor of Pledgor to avoid the risk of invalidation of such
19
Trademarks, to use, license or sublicense any Patent Collateral, Trademark Collateral or Copyright Collateral now
owned or hereafter acquired by Pledgor, wherever the same may be located throughout the world, for such term or
terms, on such conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall determine, whether general, special or
otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, and including in such license reasonable access to all
media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used
for the compilation or printout thereof. The use of such license or sublicense by the Collateral Agent shall be exercised
only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default; provided that any license, sublicense or
other transaction entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon each applicable
Pledgor notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
6.4 Private Sales.
(a) Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws as in effect from time to time, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or
any part of the Equity Interests conducted without registration or qualification under the Securities Act and such state
securities laws, to limit purchasers to any one or more persons who will represent and agree, among other things, to
acquire such Equity Interests for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof. Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be made in such manner and under such
circumstances as the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable, including at prices and on terms less
favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including, without limitation, a public
offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances,
agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and agrees
that the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to conduct any public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any
Equity Interests for the period of time necessary to permit its registration for public sale under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and shall not have any responsibility or liability as a result of its election so not to
conduct any such public sales or delay the sale of any Equity Interests, notwithstanding the possibility that a
substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until after such registration. Pledgor hereby waives
any claims against the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price at which
any Equity Interests may have been sold at any private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a
public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the
first offer received and does not offer such Equity Interests to more than one offeree.
(b) Pledgor agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section will cause irreparable injury to the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties have no
adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in
this Section shall be specifically enforceable against the Pledgor.
6.5 Waivers. Pledgor, to the greatest extent not prohibited by applicable law, hereby (i) agrees that it will not invoke,
claim or assert the benefit of any rule of law or statute now or hereafter in effect (including, without limitation, any right
to prior notice or judicial hearing in connection with the Collateral Agent’s possession, custody or disposition of any
Collateral or any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or redemption law), or take or omit to take any other
action, that would or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impeding or preventing the exercise
of any rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral, the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or the possession
thereof by any purchaser at any sale thereof, and waives the benefit of all such laws and further agrees that it will not
hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power granted hereunder to the Collateral Agent, but that it will permit the
execution of every such power as though no such laws were in effect, (ii) waives all rights that it has or may have under
any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted to require the Collateral Agent to marshal any Collateral or
other assets in favor of Pledgor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations, and
(iii) waives all rights that it has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted to
demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except notices expressly provided for herein or in
the other Financing Documents) or to require the Collateral Agent to pursue any third party for any of the Secured
Obligations.

ARTICLE VII
THE COLLATERAL AGENT
7.1 The Collateral Agent; Standard of Care.
(a) The Collateral Agent will hold all items of the Collateral at any time received under this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions hereof and the Indenture. The obligations of the Collateral Agent as holder of the Collateral and
interests therein and with respect to the disposition thereof, and otherwise under this Agreement and the Indenture are
only those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Indenture. The Collateral Agent shall act at the direction of the
Trustee (acting on written direction of the appropriate percentage of Holders under the Indenture) who shall give
directions to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Indenture. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder
are solely to protect its interest, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in the Collateral, and shall not impose any duty upon
it to exercise any such powers. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its
interest in the Collateral, shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent to exercise any such powers and shall
not make the Collateral Agent liable to any Person. Except for treatment of the Collateral in its possession in the same
manner as that which the Collateral Agent, in its individual capacity, accords its own property of a similar nature for its
own account, and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder in the exercise of reasonable care, the
Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights
against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to the Collateral. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Secured
Party shall be liable to Pledgor (i) for any loss or damage sustained by Pledgor, or (ii) for any loss, damage,
depreciation or other diminution in the value of any of the Collateral that may occur as a result of or in connection with
or that is in any way related to any exercise by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy
under this Agreement, any failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or any delay in doing so, or
any other act or failure to act on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, except to the extent that the
same is caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(b) The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the existence, genuineness,
value or protection of any Collateral, for the legality, effectiveness or sufficiency of any Security Document, or for the
creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any Liens securing the Secured Obligations. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Collateral Agent to file financing statements, continuation statements or
termination statements, or be responsible for maintaining the security interests purported to be created as described
herein (except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received
by it hereunder or under any other Security Document) and such responsibility shall be solely that of the Pledgor. In
connection with its execution and acting under this Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to all rights, privileges,
protections, immunities, benefits and indemnities provided to it under the other Security Documents, all of which are
incorporated by reference herein mutatis mutandis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, express or
implied, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers
(including making any determination or deeming any matter appropriate, necessary or satisfactory) unless it first
receives written direction from the Trustee acting on behalf of the appropriate percentage of Holders under the
Indenture. Furthermore, if the Collateral Agent shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10 days of a
request therefor from the Trustee (or such shorter period as reasonably may be specified in such notice or as may be
necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action as it
shall deem to be in the best interests of the itself and the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall have no liability to any
Person for such action or inaction.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, whenever reference is made in this Agreement to any action by,
consent, designation, specification, requirement or approval of, notice, request or other communication from, or other
direction given or action to be undertaken or to be (or not to be) suffered or omitted by the Collateral Agent, to any
amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement to be executed (or not to be executed) by the Collateral
Agent or to any election, decision, opinion, acceptance, use of judgment, expression of satisfaction or other exercise of
discretion, rights or remedies to be made (or not to be made) by the Collateral Agent, it is understood that in all cases
the Collateral Agent shall be acting, giving, withholding, suffering, omitting, making or otherwise undertaking and
exercising the same (or shall not be undertaking and exercising the same) as
21
directed in accordance with the written direction of the Trustee acting upon the written direction of the appropriate
percentage of Holders under the Indenture, as applicable. This provision is intended solely for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent and its successors and permitted assigns and is not intended to and will not entitle the other parties
hereto to any defense, claim or counterclaim under or in relation to any Security Document, or confer any rights or
benefits on any party hereto.
7.2 Further Assurances; Attorney-in-Fact.
(a) Pledgor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to sign (to the extent the Pledgor’s signature is required thereon)
financing statements and amendments thereto relating to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of
Pledgor (including, without limitation, making any notice filings with state tax or revenue authorities required to be
made by account creditors in order to enforce any Accounts in such state); provided that, promptly following the filing
thereof, the Pledgor shall provide the Collateral Agent with a copy of any initial financing statement filed by it or any
amendment to any initial financing statement which changes the collateral description set forth therein. The Pledgor
further agrees to execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements
and instruments as the Collateral Agent may reasonably require under applicable law to perfect, establish, confirm and
maintain the security interest and Lien provided for herein, to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Collateral Agent its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.
(b) Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place
and stead of Pledgor and in the name of Pledgor, the Collateral Agent or otherwise, and with full power of substitution
in the premises (which power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable for so long as this Agreement
shall be in effect), from time to time, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (except for
the actions described in clauses (ii), (iv) and (vii) below which may be taken by the Collateral Agent without regard to
whether an Event of Default has occurred) to take any action and to execute any instruments that are necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement, including, without limitation:
(i) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and
to become due under or in respect of any of the Collateral;
(ii) to receive, endorse and collect any checks, drafts, instruments, chattel paper and other orders for the payment of
money made payable to Pledgor representing any interest, income, dividend, distribution or other amount payable in
respect of any of the Collateral and to give full discharge for the same;
(iii) to obtain, maintain and adjust any property or casualty insurance required to be maintained by Pledgor under
Section 4.7 and direct the payment of proceeds thereof to the Collateral Agent;
(iv) to pay or discharge taxes, Liens or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, the
legality or validity thereof and the amounts necessary to discharge the same to be determined by the Collateral Agent,
any such payments made by the Collateral Agent to become Secured Obligations of the Pledgor to the Collateral
Agent, due and payable immediately and without demand (provided that the Collateral Agent shall not pay any tax
obligation being contested by the Pledgor as indicated on Schedule II hereto);
(v) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or
advisable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Collateral Agent with respect
to any of the Collateral;
(vi) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any and all of the
Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral
22
Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes, and to do from time to time, at the Collateral Agent’s
option and the Pledgor’s expense, all other acts and things necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral
and to more completely carry out the purposes of this Agreement; and
(vii) to sign the name of Pledgor on (to the extent the Pledgor’s signature is required thereon) and to file any financing
statement, continuation statement, notice or other similar document that, in the Collateral Agent’s Permitted Discretion,
should be made or filed in order to perfect or continue to perfect the security interest granted under this Agreement;
(c) If Pledgor fails to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement after written request to do so by
the Collateral Agent (provided that no such request shall be necessary at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default), the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause the performance of, such
covenant or agreement and may take any other action that it deems necessary and appropriate for the maintenance
and preservation of the Collateral or its security interest therein, and the reasonable expenses so incurred in
connection therewith shall be payable by the Pledgor under Section 8.1.
ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
8.1 Indemnity and Expenses. The Pledgor agrees:
(a) to indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, the Trustee, each other Secured Party and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, demands,
losses, obligations, judgments and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, out of pocket
costs and expenses) in any way arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent the same shall
arise as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking to be indemnified; and
(b) to pay and reimburse the Collateral Agent and the Trustee upon demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, out of pocket costs and expenses) that the Collateral Agent
may incur in connection with (i) the custody, use or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from or other realization
upon, any of the Collateral, including the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling
or otherwise disposing of or realizing on the Collateral, (ii) the exercise or enforcement of any rights or remedies
granted hereunder (including, without limitation, under Article VI), under the Indenture or Notes or otherwise available
to it (whether at law, in equity or otherwise), or (iii) the failure by Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions
hereof. The provisions of this Section shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the repayment of any
of the Secured Obligations and the discharge of the Indenture.
8.2 No Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Indenture and
the Notes are cumulative and in addition, to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in
equity or otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of any Secured Party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of
any Default or Event of Default. No course of dealing between the Pledgor and the Secured Parties or their agents or
employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or the Indenture or Notes
or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No notice to or demand upon Pledgor in any case shall
entitle Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the
right of any Secured Party to exercise any right or remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances
without notice or demand.
8.3 Pledgor’s Obligations Absolute. Until such time as this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 8.6, Pledgor
agrees that its obligations hereunder, and the security interest granted to and all rights, remedies and
23
powers of, the Collateral Agent hereunder, are irrevocable, absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged,
limited or otherwise affected (unless agreed to by the parties hereto) by reason of any of the following, whether or not
Pledgor has knowledge thereof:
(i) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any Secured Obligations, or any
amendment, modification or supplement to, restatement of, or consent to any rescission or waiver of or departure from,
any provisions of the Indenture, the Guarantee, the Notes, any other Security Document or any agreement or
instrument delivered pursuant to any of the foregoing;
(ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any Secured Obligations or any provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Guarantee, any other Financing Document or any agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to any of the foregoing;
(iii) the taking, acceptance or release of any Secured Obligations or additional Collateral or other security therefor or the
addition or release of any Pledgor hereunder;
(iv) any sale, exchange, release, substitution, compromise, nonperfection or other action or inaction in respect of any
Collateral or other direct or indirect security for any Secured Obligations, or any discharge, modification, settlement,
compromise or other action or inaction in respect of any Secured Obligations;
(v) any agreement not to pursue or enforce or any failure to pursue or enforce (whether voluntarily or involuntarily as a
result of operation of law, court order or otherwise) any right or remedy in respect of any Secured Obligations or any
Collateral or other security therefor, or any failure to create, protect, perfect, secure, insure, continue or maintain any
Liens in any such Collateral or other security;
(vi) the exercise of any right or remedy available under the Indenture, the Notes or other Security Document, at law, in
equity or otherwise in respect of any Collateral or other security for any Secured Obligations, in any order and by any

manner of sale thereby permitted, whether or not every aspect of such sale is commercially reasonable;

like change in the corporate structure or existence of the Issuer, Pledgor or any other person directly or indirectly liable

paid and howsoever realized, whether in reduction of any Secured Obligations or any other obligations of the Issuer,
Pledgor or any other person directly or indirectly liable for any Secured Obligations, regardless of what Secured
Obligations may remain unpaid after any such application; or
(ix) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense, set-off or
counterclaim available to, the Issuer, Pledgor or a surety or guarantor generally, other than a satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture pursuant to Article 12 of the Indenture or a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance or as otherwise
provided in Section 10.04 of the Indenture.
8.4 Enforcement. By its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Secured Party agrees that this Agreement
may be enforced only by the Collateral Agent, acting upon the instructions or with the consent of the the Trustee who

seek to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon any Collateral or other security given to secure the payment and
performance of the Secured Obligations.

requisite Holders pursuant to Article 9 of the Indenture and (iii) inure to the benefit of and, subject to Section 8.4, be
enforceable by each Secured Party and its successors and assigns. Upon any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition
by Pledgor of any Collateral (including, without limitation, any ACP Property) in a transaction expressly permitted
hereunder and under the Indenture, the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement in and upon such
Collateral shall be automatically released. Further, upon Pledgor ceasing to be a Guarantor pursuant to a transaction
expressly permitted hereunder and under the Indenture, the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement in any
Collateral of Pledgor shall be released and the earlier of a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture pursuant to
Article 12 of the Indenture or a Legal Defeasance or a Covenant Defeasance or as otherwise provided in Section 10.04
of the Indenture, this Agreement and the Lien and security interest created hereby shall terminate; and in connection
with any such release or termination, the Collateral Agent, at the request and expense of the Pledgor, will execute and
deliver to Pledgor such documents and instruments evidencing such release or termination as Pledgor may
reasonably request and will assign, transfer and deliver to Pledgor, without recourse and without representation or
warranty, such of the Collateral as may then be in the possession of the Collateral Agent (or, in the case of any partial
release of Collateral, such of the Collateral so being released as may be in its possession). All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
Pledge Amendment.

schedules hereto are so qualified.
8.15 Certain Regulatory Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, certain rights, remedies

Section 184 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (b) actions (other than acquiring title or ownership to
Inventory or Equipment by foreclosure or otherwise pursuant to existing general licenses from the NRC issued to and
generally available for use by any person) that involve taking possession or controlling the use of nuclear materials or
facilities for which a Permit is required, are subject to regulatory restrictions that may require the Collateral Agent to
obtain the prior written consent or approval of the NRC, and all provisions of this Security Agreement shall be limited to
conform with such restrictions. For purposes hereof, “Permits” means permits, licenses, certificates, approvals and
other authorizations issued by the NRC, or by a state agency exercising NRC’s authority under an agreement with the
NRC.
8.16 Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lien and security interest granted to
the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the exercise of any right or remedy by the Collateral Agent
hereunder are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as the Intercreditor Agreement is in effect, any requirement to
deliver possession of any Collateral to the Collateral Agent or to give the Collateral Agent “control” over any Collateral
shall be deemed to be satisfied if the holder of a Designated Senior Claim or any
26
representative thereof shall have such possession or control and such holder or representative as the case may be
has agreed in the Intercreditor Agreement to also hold such possession or control as agent or bailee for the benefit of
the Collateral Agent; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause one of the following to occur (such obligation to use commercial reasonable efforts to
continue with respect to each of the following until such efforts are successful as to one of the following or such efforts
are unsuccessful as to all of the following): (i) obtain the consent of the applicable holders of Designated Senior Claims
or their agent(s) or other representative(s) and the applicable deposit bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian,
as applicable, to the Collateral Agent retaining its own separate control agreement reflecting the priorities established
by the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) obtain the consent of the applicable holders of Designated Senior Claims or their
agent(s) or other representative(s) and the applicable deposit bank, securities intermediary, issuer or custodian, as
applicable, to the Collateral Agent being a party to the control agreement in favor of the holders of Designated Senior
Claims or their agent(s) and pursuant to such control agreement having the applicable deposit bank, securities
intermediary, issuer or custodian, as applicable, agree to follow instructions or entitlement orders, as applicable, of the
Collateral Agent without further consent of the Company upon a discharge of the Designated Senior Claims, or (iii) in
the event that the provisions of Sections 8-106 and 9-104 of the Uniform Commercial Code are amended in a manner
consistent with that set forth in Assembly Bill 9933, cause any control agreement for the benefit of any holders of
Designated Senior Claims to be subject to the Uniform Commercial Code.
8.17 No Recourse to the United States. The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement, the Indenture and the
Notes are the obligations of the Pledgor and are not obligations of, or guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the
United States.
