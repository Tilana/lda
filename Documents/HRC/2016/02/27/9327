<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 4/104, which 
requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to consult States, and 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on ways and means to enhance the 
international cooperation and dialogue in the United Nations human rights machinery, 
including the Human Rights Council as recognized in the ninth preambular paragraph of 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. On 19 October 2007, the Secretariat of the Human Rights Council sent a note verbale to 
Member States, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, seeking their views 
and information as requested in the above-mentioned decision. As of 7 January 2008, the Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had received responses, summarized below, from 
the Governments of Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cuba, Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Japan, Oman, the Russian Federation and Switzerland, as well as from the human rights 
organizations Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions and the Commonwealth 
Human Rights Initiative. The full texts of the submissions are available from the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p>3. <b>Belarus 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Russian] 
 [7 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Belarus stressed that international cooperation is 
of great importance for the effective promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. It emphasized that international cooperation must be carried out in a manner fully in 
keeping with international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. 
The Government expressed the view that international cooperation in the field of human rights 
will be effective if it is founded on the principles of universality, non-selectivity, impartiality and 
objectivity, as well as equitable and mutually respectful dialogue. Moreover, the Government 
stressed the importance of respect for the diversity of all States, as well as recognition of the 
right of countries and peoples to determine the paths of their political, economic, social and 
cultural development. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government emphasized that the fundamental importance of these principles 
have been reaffirmed in many resolutions of the General Assembly, including resolution 61/166 
on the promotion of equitable and mutually respectful dialogue on human rights, which was 
adopted upon the initiative of Belarus and Uzbekistan. The effective implementation of these 
resolutions by all United Nations Member States, without exception, would facilitate the 
enhancement of international cooperation and dialogue within the United Nations human rights 
machinery. 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government expressed the view that the enhancement of international 
cooperation and dialogue on human rights is hampered by the application of double standards 
and selectivity by certain countries. The Government stressed that politically motivated and 
prejudiced resolutions on the human rights situation in particular countries would seriously </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>undermine the principles of objectivity and non-selectivity in examining human rights issues, 
and hinder efforts to promote human rights. The assessments contained in country resolutions 
would be subjective in nature and would generally not be supported by reliable evidence from 
trustworthy sources of information or by comprehensive expert analysis carried out by 
competent institutions in the United Nations system. The Government regretted that the sponsors 
of country resolutions are not carrying out open and transparent consultations, and expressed 
support for the introduction of the requirement of approval by two thirds of the Member States of 
the United Nations for country resolutions, in order to exclude opportunities for manipulation 
and the use of country resolutions as instruments of political pressure. 
</p>
<p>(d) In its response, the Government stressed that the universal periodic review 
mechanism will help to eliminate subjectivism in examining the human rights situation in 
various countries. The universal periodic review should be conducted in an objective, 
transparent, non-selective, constructive, non-confrontational and non-politicized manner. 
</p>
<p>(e) Moreover, the Government stressed that the process of reviewing the existing system 
of special procedures and making them more effective would contribute to enhancing 
international cooperation and dialogue in the field of human rights. The Government also 
stressed the importance of objectivity and respect for the code of conduct by mandate holders, as 
this would enhance their authority and the degree of trust that States place in them. 
</p>
<p>(f) The Government also emphasized that the enhancement of international cooperation 
and dialogue in the field of human rights is undermined by the practice of applying unilateral 
coercive measures. The Government urged States to completely refrain from adopting or 
implementing any such measures, as they are not in keeping with international law or the Charter 
of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>4. <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [22 November 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina referred to various 
organizations at the national level which contribute to the promotion of human rights and 
compliance with regional and international human rights instruments, such as the Gender Centre 
of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Roma Committee and the Council of Children 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In particular, the Government mentioned efforts undertaken to comply 
with its international obligations regarding the prohibition of discrimination. In this context, it 
referred inter alia to the preparation of action plans on housing and social protection of the Roma 
national minority by the Government, in cooperation with the non-governmental sector and with 
the support of SIDA-Sweden, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government highlighted the importance of strengthening human rights 
protection mechanisms and preventing human rights violations, inter alia by providing the 
relevant legislative framework, by allowing visits of United Nations Special Rapporteurs and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe monitoring teams, by analysing State reports on the implementation of 
international and European instruments, by monitoring the work of the European Court of 
Human Rights and by developing case law through analysis of court decisions. 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina provided information on the 
cooperation of the Government with the relevant authorities, international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations in the context of submission of reports to the United Nations 
treaty bodies. In particular, the Government highlighted the cooperation of the Ministry for 
Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund in preparation of reports on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its Optional Protocols. The Government stressed that the consultation of competent 
authorities at all levels, as well as of the non-governmental sector, would contribute to more 
realistic reporting and to the improvement of cooperation between all relevant actors. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Cuba 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [7 January 2008] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Cuba stressed that international cooperation forms 
part of the purposes of the United Nations as contained in the Charter of the United Nations, in 
particular Article 1, paragraph 3, which lays down the duty of States to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian 
character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental 
freedoms for all. In the same manner, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated 
that enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights is essential for the full 
achievement of the purposes of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government of Cuba considers that genuine international cooperation constitutes 
the only viable means for the effective protection and promotion of all human rights for all. It is 
therefore essential to fully respect the sovereign equality of all States, as well as the principles of 
universality, objectivity and non-selectivity. An impartial and fair approach to human rights 
questions and the absence of politicization or application of double standards constitute 
fundamental pillars of the enhancement of international cooperation. Moreover, it is necessary to 
have a profound understanding of the different problems in each society and of the unequal 
levels of development, and to respect the national, historical, religious and cultural diversity and 
specificities of each country. Recognition of and respect for the plurality of political, economic, 
social, legal and philosophical systems is essential to promote genuine international cooperation, 
based on mutual understanding, dialogue, trust and transparency. 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government expressed great concern about the practices applied by some 
developed countries from the North, including the use of condemnatory approaches and double 
standards, as well as the manipulation of human rights to serve geopolitical interests. The 
Government recalled that such measures had discredited the Commission on Human Rights, and 
had ultimately led to its demise. 
</p>
<p>(d) The Government noted that during the 60 years of its existence, the Commission on 
Human Rights had never been able to adopt any resolution condemning human rights violations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in western industrialized countries, even though abundant information had been provided by 
thematic Special Rapporteurs, treaty bodies and non-governmental organizations regarding the 
violation of human rights, in particular those of minorities, migrant workers and indigenous 
populations. 
</p>
<p>(e) The Government noted that establishment of the Human Rights Council to replace 
the Commission provides the opportunity to enter a new stage in the promotion and protection of 
all human rights for all on the basis of international cooperation and constructive dialogue. The 
resolution establishing this new body states that the mechanism shall be based on the principles 
of cooperation, universal application and equal treatment, in order to assess the situation of 
human rights in all countries, with the aim of strengthening the capacity of Member States, 
facilitating the exchange of best practices and providing technical assistance to those 
Governments who request it. 
</p>
<p>(f) In its response the Government stressed that Cuba, both in its national capacity and 
as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, had worked hard and constructively during the 
negotiations on the establishment and institution-building of the new Council. The importance of 
a constructive approach in the context of the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms was reaffirmed by the Non-Aligned Movement in the framework of 
the 14th summit of Heads of State or Government (Havana 2006). 
</p>
<p>(g) In spite of its reservations regarding various elements contained in the 
institution-building package presented by the President of the Council in June 2007, Cuba had 
joined the consensus to demonstrate its firm commitment to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights for all. Also, Cuba had hoped that the new body would be void of the selectivity 
and politicization, which had prevented the Commission from fulfilling its mandate as the main 
human rights body. Cuba expressed great concern about the attitude of some countries, in 
particular the United States of America, which have exerted strong pressure to reopen the 
institution-building package of the Council, thereby seeking to reinstate selectivity, politicization 
and double standards, which would force the same fate as the Commission on the Council. The 
Government reiterated its rejection of the application of such practices, in particular in the 
context of the Third Committee of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>(h) Such harmful practices and approaches erode any possibility of establishing a 
genuine system of international cooperation, which would contribute to the promotion and 
protection of human rights for all. It is therefore essential to eliminate these vices from the 
United Nations human rights machinery. The new universal periodic review mechanism, if 
implemented as a genuine system of cooperation as stated in its principles, would offer the 
opportunity to encourage international cooperation in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>(i) The Government emphasized that international cooperation in the field of human 
rights would also require real representation and geographic rotation of special procedure 
mandate holders and experts of treaty bodies, as well as a fair balance in the composition of staff 
of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Moreover, it would also be necessary 
for the required resources to be available, in particular in relation to technical cooperation, 
human rights education and education in general. The Government stressed that understanding 
and respect for the diversity of cultures, civilizations and religions, as well as legal, political and 
philosophical systems is necessary for the objective and impartial fulfilment of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>responsibilities assigned to experts and to the secretariat. The Government stressed that 
cooperation cannot be imposed, but must take into account the specificities and realities of each 
country and refrain from condemnatory approaches. 
</p>
<p>(j) In conclusion, the Government stressed that it considers it its duty to draw the 
attention of all Member States and non-governmental organizations to the urgent need to 
effectively implement genuine cooperation and uphold dialogue as proclaimed by the Charter of 
the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [7 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Guatemala provided information on the 
formulation of national policy concerning international cooperation under the guidance of the 
Planning and Programming Secretariat of the Presidency (SEGEPLAN). This institution regards 
international cooperation as the provision of technical, financial and political support by partner 
countries and specialized multilateral organizations, in order to promote sustainable economic, 
social, financial, commercial, administrative and environmental development, in the framework 
of participatory democracy. The cooperation should be consistent with the policies of the 
Government, its international relations, and its financial and fiscal policies. The Government 
outlined the conditions required for ensuring the effectiveness of international cooperation, such 
as the quality of development projects and the administration thereof. 
</p>
<p>(b) Concerning human rights, the Government stated that a series of programmes, 
projects and strategies have been put in place to ensure respect and implementation of the 
obligations undertaken in the peace accords of 1996. In this regard, international cooperation has 
played a fundamental role in terms of strengthening the rule of law and the institutional 
structures of the State, and also with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights in 
Guatemala. The Government noted, notwithstanding the coordinated efforts and the progress 
made since the signing of the peace accords, that the &#8220;Agenda of Peace&#8221; has yet to be fully 
implemented. The cooperation policy of the State should therefore encompass the remaining 
aspects of the Agenda, and should strengthen efforts to comply with it. The Government noted 
that many of these aspects are linked to the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, 
and correspond to the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>(c) Furthermore, the Government provided information on international cooperation 
in the context of the country&#8217;s political transition, such as through the Dialogue Group and 
other cooperation mechanisms, which had supported the Government&#8217;s Political Transition 
Plan 2007-2008. The Government also highlighted the important contribution made by the 
Inter-American Development Bank. 
</p>
<p>(d) In conclusion, the Government stated that international cooperation constitutes an 
indispensable element for the strengthening of a State&#8217;s efforts in implementing projects and 
programmes for the benefit of its people. In this regard, the Government stressed the importance 
of the formulation of a national policy to be able to prioritize international cooperation 
programmes and projects. All State structures, in particular those established to respond to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>needs of vulnerable groups, should participate in decision-making on the allocation of resources 
deriving from international cooperation. The Government also stressed that the sustainability of 
projects and programmes supported by international cooperation is fundamental to achieving the 
desired results and designated objectives, in particular when activities and strategies have been 
drawn up on a medium- and long-term basis.  
</p>
<p>7. <b>Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [19 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran provided information 
on the Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, 
held in Teheran 3-4 September 2007, as an initiative to enhance international cooperation in the 
field of human rights. The Government emphasized that the relationship between human rights 
and cultural diversity is one of the fundamental issues of the twenty-first century. It expressed its 
conviction that all nations and societies with diverse culture, history and religions share in the 
universality of human rights, while standing up for their own cultural and religious values and 
traditions. The Government advised that the Non-Aligned Movement had decided to establish a 
Centre for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity in Teheran, which will serve as a focal point to 
enhance cooperation and dialogue among member States of the Non-Aligned Movement, as well 
as between these countries and other United Nations Member States. 
</p>
<p>(b) In its response, the Government provided information on bilateral human rights 
dialogues held with Switzerland and Japan, respectively, on a broad range of issues. 
Furthermore, the Government provided information about a course organized by the Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs on reporting to the United Nations treaty bodies for 14 experts from different 
ministries of Afghanistan held from 24 to 28 November 2007. 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government also provided information on efforts to promote communication 
and judicial cooperation among Islamic States, inter alia by organizing the first conference of 
prosecutors of the capitals of the Islamic countries, and the first summit of the judiciary chiefs of 
the Organization of Islamic States. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>Japan 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [6 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Japan expressed its appreciation for the increased 
attention the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is 
placing on its field activities. The Government expressed hope that the annual report of OHCHR 
will include more detailed information about the activities of each field office, in order to 
promote further cooperation between the United Nations, Governments and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government also referred to its capacity-building support to various countries, 
including through the provision of legal development assistance by dispatching experts and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>holding seminars. Given that OHCHR is providing similar assistance at both the bilateral and 
multilateral level, the Government considers that it would be useful if interested countries would 
share their knowledge and cooperate in a mutually complementary manner. 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government highlighted the increasing burden placed on Governments 
regarding the submission of reports to human rights treaty bodies. The Government encouraged 
the streamlining of this work, so that each organization could use its limited budget, and 
implement its work, more efficiently and effectively. 
</p>
<p>(d) The Government also referred to its efforts to eradicate discrimination against 
leprosy patients and their families, and stressed that it wishes to continue its cooperation with 
other Governments and the United Nations in this regard. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Oman 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [16 November 2007] 
</p>
<p>In its response, the Government of Oman stressed that the universality of human rights and 
their interconnectedness and interdependence makes it important that these be applied in an 
objective and transparent way, while taking into account the peculiarities and cultural diversity 
of States. This approach could promote international cooperation in the field of human rights and 
avoid using the issue of human rights to make unjustified, irresponsible and inaccurate 
judgements. 
10. <b>Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Russian] 
 [31 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Russian Federation stressed that it attaches great importance to 
international cooperation in the field of human rights, and emphasized that the main 
responsibility in this regard lies with States. International institutions and mechanisms play a 
supporting role by helping States to achieve such aims through an equitable and mutually 
respectful dialogue, taking account of the ethnic, religious, cultural and historical characteristics 
of States and their level of socio-economic development. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government recognizes that the human rights situation in a particular country 
may be a legitimate concern of the international community, and stresses that the discussion of 
human rights issues should be based on fairness and respect. The Government considers it 
inadmissible to use human rights issues as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of 
States, or to politicize human rights issues and apply double standards. The Government opposes 
the initiatives of individual countries, groups of countries and non-governmental organizations in 
imposing their own human rights standards on the international community as if they were 
universal. The Government emphasized that constructive dialogue is necessary for the 
establishment of cooperation on human rights between an individual State and the international 
community.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(c) The Government reiterated that the United Nations should be the main arena for 
international cooperation, including on human rights issues, and stressed that current challenges 
and threats in the field of human rights can only be addressed through joint efforts. The 
development of constructive interaction between States within the Human Rights Council has the 
potential to be a unifying factor in international relations. The Government expressed its 
intention to take an active part in the work of the Council by concentrating on finding mutually 
acceptable and constructive solutions to the most relevant international problems in the field of 
human rights, and to contribute to strengthening the authority of this organ. The Government 
expressed regret that a number of Member States, after only the first year of the Council, are 
already casting doubt on its importance and claiming that it is ineffective and unviable. 
</p>
<p>(d) The Government expressed the view that the work of the Council has demonstrated 
that international relations related to the field of human rights continue to be extremely tense and 
politicized. This is borne out by the confrontation that inevitably accompanies the discussion of 
contentious country issues. 
</p>
<p>(e) The Government considers that special sessions of the Council should make a 
genuine contribution to resolving critical and urgent human rights situations requiring an urgent 
response. Special sessions should however not be used as a means to introduce additional 
confrontation and politicization into the work of the Council. 
</p>
<p>(f) It is the understanding of the Government that the aim of the universal periodic 
review should be to reinforce and enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations human rights 
system and the international human rights regime, including by increasing the significance of 
voluntary cooperation between States. The review should be carried out in an impartial manner, 
with the ultimate aim of encouraging full respect for human rights, rather than marginalizing or 
condemning individual countries. The Government considers it necessary to take into account 
the level of development of the State in question as well as its social structure, moral values, 
religious and cultural traditions, judicial system and other characteristics. 
</p>
<p>(g) In its response, the Government stressed the importance of using objective and 
reliable information, and welcomed the adoption of broad general guidelines for the preparation 
of information by States under the universal periodic review (UPR). The UPR must be applied to 
all United Nations Member States, without exception, to avoid a potential geographical 
imbalance. In this regard, the adoption of a comprehensive timetable for all States at the sixth 
session of the Council constituted an important step. 
</p>
<p>(h) The Government expressed the view that peace and stability in inter-ethnic and 
interfaith relations is key to building a democratic and prosperous world order, in which all 
human rights are fully respected. The Government stressed that the universal nature of the 
United Nations makes it crucial to take into account the spiritual traditions and diversity of world 
cultures and religions. It referred to various initiatives, including the World Summit of Religious 
Leaders held in Moscow in July 2006. The Government expressed support for establishing a 
more systematic dialogue between the religious communities under United Nations auspices. An 
exchange of views among representatives of the main world faiths would strengthen 
international cooperation and facilitate the elaboration and adoption of adequate and informed 
decisions by the world community. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. <b>Switzerland 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: French] 
 [28 November 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Government of Switzerland stressed that in the conduct of its 
foreign policy, it has always promoted dialogue and cooperation over confrontation. The 
establishment of the Human Rights Council and the adoption of new procedures offer Member 
States the opportunity to promote cooperation in the field of human rights in a spirit of dialogue 
and solidarity. When raising a particular issue during a Council session, States should seek to 
improve the fate of victims of human rights violations, and not aim at condemning a particular 
State. It is by engaging in dialogue with the authorities of a country that these can be made more 
responsive to their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>(b) Switzerland considers that the universal periodic review constitutes an instrument of 
choice for the promotion of international cooperation in the field of human rights. The 
mechanism, which is to be applied to all United Nations Member States, should permit each 
State to take stock, in a transparent manner, of progress made and difficulties encountered 
regarding the implementation of their international obligations. The review should be conducted 
in a constructive spirit, including by exchanging best practice, in order to benefit both the 
international community in its entirety, as well as particular individuals. The universal periodic 
review should allow for identification of the national priorities of each State in the field of 
human rights. Where support by other States proves to be necessary, it could be provided 
through technical assistance programmes, the content and implementation of which would be 
elaborated by the country concerned in cooperation with its partners. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses from human rights organizations 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [6 December 2007] 
</p>
<p>(a) In its response, the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) 
stressed that national human rights institutions are in a unique position to inform their States on 
the scope and implementation of their international human rights obligations, and to provide 
independent expertise to their States, agencies of government, and generally to the community 
through their human rights education programmes. National human rights institutions also 
maintain a consultative relationship with civil society. 
</p>
<p>(b) APF welcomed the further formalization of mechanisms for the participation of 
national institutions in the United Nations human rights machinery, in particular in the 
framework of the Human Rights Council. The organization underlined that national institutions 
may comment on a particular issue within their jurisdiction, or may consult at the regional level, 
either on an ad hoc basis or through the regional coordinating body in place, to identify trends 
and common issues which could be reflected in a joint statement to the Council. The weight 
accorded to any such statements, by virtue of the special status of national institutions, could 
draw attention to some important issues that might not otherwise receive adequate consideration. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(c) As concerns the universal periodic review mechanism, the Forum outlined different 
possibilities for the participation of national institutions. At the country level, national 
institutions should be included in the consultation process held in preparation of country reports. 
Moreover, national institutions could themselves facilitate a consultation process with relevant 
State entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which could contribute to the 
compilation of a separate or joint report to be submitted to the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for the stakeholder report. The organization 
stressed that an important role for national institutions will be to disseminate the outcome of the 
universal periodic review to all major stakeholders and to actively monitor the implementation of 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>(d) APF outlined various measures through which national institutions can engage with 
the special procedures system. Such measures include encouraging Governments to extend a 
standing invitation to all thematic mandate holders, bringing particular human rights 
developments to the attention of the relevant mandate holder, engaging with mandate holders in 
the preparation and conduct of country visits, and monitoring the follow-up of their 
recommendations. In order for this relationship to be effective in practice, it is crucial for special 
procedures to liaise with national institutions, including in the context of country visits and 
regarding the adoption of specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>(e) Regarding the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, APF emphasized that 
communication between national institutions and the Advisory Committee will be essential for 
ensuring that the relevant information reaches the experts, including by circulating relevant 
publications to the Committee members. 
</p>
<p>(f) APF encouraged the further development of modalities for systematic interaction 
between national institutions and the United Nations treaty bodies. National institutions would be 
in a position to contribute both in the context of State reporting as well as regarding the 
individual complaints procedures. In the view of APF, national institutions could inter alia 
encourage States to fulfil their reporting obligations and assist them in the preparation of their 
reports, provide supplementary reports or additional information to a treaty body or encourage 
NGO reports, participate in treaty body sessions and disseminate concluding observations. APF 
also stated that national institutions can play a role in the individual complaints procedures by 
undertaking education and awareness-raising about the complaints procedures, by assisting 
individuals filing complaints, monitoring compliance of interim measures and encouraging the 
implementation of views. 
</p>
<p>(g) In conclusion, APF expressed the view that, as a result of their independent expertise 
and pluralistic perspective, the active presence of national institutions in the Council has the 
potential to create a more open dialogue on specific human rights issues at the international 
level. The organization stressed that the effective implementation of the modalities set up for the 
participation of national institutions is essential, and that the Council and its subsidiary bodies, as 
well as the OHCHR, should be encouraged to adopt inclusive working methods that ensure an 
effective flow of information to and from national institutions. </p>

<p>13. <b>Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative

<p>(a) In its response, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) referred to 
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolution 1996/31 which &#8220;confirms the need to take 
into account the full diversity of the non-governmental organizations at the national and 
international levels&#8221;, and encourages the need for greater participation of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) from developing countries and countries with economies in transition in 
international conferences convened by the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>(b) CHRI welcomed the openness of the Human Rights Council to receiving both 
written statements and oral interventions from NGOs. The organization expressed understanding 
that an accreditation mechanism has to be followed, but cautioned that restricting this process to 
NGOs having ECOSOC consultative status would significantly limit the scope of the civil 
society allowed to participate. 
</p>
<p>(c) The organization provided specific comments on the participation of NGOs in the 
universal periodic review mechanism. As concerns the national consultations to be held in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, the organization expressed the view that 
the Council should effectively encourage and review the process, in order to ensure that States 
are fulfilling their pledges to encourage and facilitate civil society participation. This review 
should encompass all steps taken by the Government, including transparency regarding the 
holding of national consultations, as well as provision of information on the variety of NGOs 
participating therein. Moreover, CHRI requested that more time be given to NGOs to prepare 
their submissions. The organization expressed concern regarding the page limitation of the 
summary of stakeholder information prepared by OHCHR, as this would not be sufficient to 
provide comprehensive information as to the general situation of human rights in a particular 
country.
