SUPPLEMENTARY JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J

I delivered my judgment in this matter today. Unfortunately I had not realized that the agreement between Counsel as to quantum was an agreement for judgment by consent. I had read Counsels submissions about this and now formally enter judgment in terms of Counsels submission.

In respect of quantum I make the following orders by consent:

1.      
Judgment is entered for the Plaintiff in the sum of $F6602.80;
2.      
Judgment is entered for the Plaintiff in the sum of $AU16,446.02;
3.      
Interest will be payable by the Defendant on those sums at the rate of 13.5% per annum simple from issue of the writ (2 February 1999) until the date of judgment;
4.      
The Defendant will pay costs on a solicitor/client indemnity basis $F20092.16.
