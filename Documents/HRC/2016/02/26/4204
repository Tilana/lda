</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Constitution and legislation of Colombia prohibit racial discrimination, protect 
and promote equality as a matter of law and recognize the country&#8217;s ethnic diversity. 
Numerous Government policies aim to address inequalities. Nevertheless, the legacy of 
slavery is still manifest in the social and economic marginalization of members of the Afro-
Colombian, Black, Raizal and Palenquero communities. While the country as a whole may 
be enjoying a reduction in hostilities and armed conflict, many Afro-Colombian 
communities and their leaders, particularly along the Pacific coast, still suffer violent 
attacks. Victims believe that there is impunity for those who commit crimes against them. 
</p>
<p> Violence and intimidation is now aimed at dispossessing Black communities of their 
lands, including for illegal coca cultivation and trafficking. New macro-economic 
development plans and commercial interests seeking to acquire land and exploit natural 
resources have also created incentives for dispossession. Displaced persons who return to 
their lands find that others have claimed ownership or rights of usage in their absence. 
Despite a plethora of Government legislation, policy and programme initiatives, the reality 
is poor implementation, inadequate resources and outputs which fall far short of the needs 
of Afro-Colombians.

committee, the Comit&#233; Interinstitucional de Alertas Tempranas (CIAT), of the security 
forces and civil institutions, which has frequently discounted the credibility of those alerts.

</p>
<p>  B. Afro-Colombian women&#8217;s experience of violence and displacement.............  44&#8211;<footnote name="4">4. Colombia&#8217;s Constitutional Court identified 13 risk factors making women affected 
by violence and displacement more vulnerable than men, including the risk of sexual 
violence, exploitation for their labour, and persecution for their membership in women&#8217;s 
organizations. Afro-Colombian, female, displaced and poor is a potentially fatal 
combination for discrimination, trauma and vulnerability. An NGO survey of displaced 
women found that the majority of displaced Afro-Colombians are women, many of whom 
are heads of households with children. During their displacement, women surveyed 
frequently reported physical aggression and sexual violence. Few victims register 
complaints due to fear or ignorance of channels of complaint. Afro-Colombian women in 
Su&#225;rez in Cauca described to the independent expert their experiences of forced labour, 
violence and rape committed by illegal armed groups. Many children were born as a 
consequence of rape and both mothers and children are ostracized within their 
communities. Women expressed their concerns regarding their children being forced and 
coerced into joining armed groups.

<p>  C. Responses of the Government to violence and displacement .........................  48&#8211;<footnote name="5">4. The Office of the Ombudsman was widely praised for its activities to protect Afro-
Colombian leaders and communities, particularly through an early warning (Sistema de 
Alerta Temprana &#8211; SAT) and risk assessment system coordinated with local government 
and public security forces. The Ombudsman has local representatives (defensores 
comunitarios) in highly sensitive areas where the presence of State authorities is weak. 
They have the trust of communities and often operate under difficult conditions and 
sometimes death threats from illegal armed groups.

suffer from a disproportionate impact of displacement on their collective and individual 
rights. It found that the Government has failed to respond with comprehensive, practical 
measures to solve the critical situation and that &#8220;[&#8230;] a policy focusing on the special needs 
of the displaced Afro-Colombian population is missing: attention to this population is 
limited to programmes and policies designed for the displaced population in general, and 
the Afro-Colombian displaced population has marginal access to this attention&#8221;.

<p>  G. Findings of the Constitutional Court...............................................................  63&#8211;<footnote name="6">3. In decision T-025 of 2004, the Constitutional Court analysed hundreds of cases of 
forced displacement and declared the situation to amount to an &#8220;unconstitutional state of 
affairs&#8221;. According to Decision T-025: &#8220;The public policies for assisting the displaced 
population have failed to counter the serious deterioration of displaced persons&#8217; conditions 
of vulnerability, they have not secured the effective enjoyment of their constitutional rights, 
nor contributed to surmount the conditions that cause the violation of said rights&#8221;. The 
decision emphasized the requirement for affirmative action measures for special groups 
within the displaced population. It identified 18 measures to be taken within strict 
timescales. In response the Government adopted a National Plan of Assistance for the 
Displaced (Decree 250 of 2005).

experiences of many Afro-Colombian communities. Afro-Colombian communities have 
conducted small-scale farming and artisanal gold mining in Su&#225;rez, North Cauca, since the 
17th century. However, communities complained of licences being granted to companies 
for large-scale mining on their ancestral lands without prior consultation with them., 
resulting in communities being denied access to ancestral mining areas or facing eviction.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert visited Colombia between 1 and 12 February 2010 and was 
honoured to meet with President &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez and numerous senior Government 
representatives. She consulted leaders of Afro-Colombian communities and met directly 
with hundreds of community members. She thanks the Government of Colombia for its 
cooperation with her mandate, the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals 
that provided information and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
Colombia for its exceptional support. Since her visit a new Government has been elected 
under President Juan Manuel Santos. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in Colombia is based on the 
1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities (A/RES/47/135) and other relevant international standards, from 
which she has identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These 
are: (a) the protection of minorities&#8217; survival, through combating violence against them and 
preventing genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority 
groups and the right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their 
collective identity and to reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-
discrimination and equality, including ending structural or systemic discrimination and the 
promotion of affirmative action when required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to 
effective participation of members of minorities in public life, especially with regard to 
decisions that affect them.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>3. The story of Afro-Colombians begins with slavery and gross violations of the rights 
of African descendants. As slaves escaped coastal plantations, they were forced to find 
refuge in geographically remote regions of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. They built 
communities and livelihoods under extreme climate conditions, in isolation and poverty. 
Consequently, Afro-Colombians have a special attachment to their ancestral lands, as a 
source of refuge and survival and the environment in which their distinct cultures have been 
maintained.  
</p>
<p>4. According to the 2005 census, Afro-Colombians make up 10.<footnote name="6">9. In some situations involving claims of usurped land, the interest of the Government 
appears to be complex.  Massive single-crop agro-business development projects, such as 
palm oil plantations, and large-scale mining industry, figure prominently in national 
development plans. The Government provides financing for projects that accord with 
national planning goals, which some claim have financed projects on usurped Afro-
Colombian lands. Local or departmental governments may have an ownership stake in 
public-private projects, as is the case in the planned port expansion project in 
Buenaventura, which threatens to displace thousands. Consequently, when Afro-Colombian 
communities seek Government assistance in regaining their lands or in bringing legal cases, 
they are unclear whether the Government is acting as a neutral referee or as an interested 
party.  
</footnote>2 per cent (4,<footnote name="31">. Notable in regard to international cooperation, in January 2010, Colombia and the 
United States signed a joint Action Plan on Racial and Ethnic Equality with the objective of 
cooperation to promote equality and to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination. They are 
to cooperate in areas covered under bilateral initiatives and recommendations from the 
Intersectoral Commission.  
</footnote>1,<footnote name="75">. Leaders in Buenaventura and Su&#225;rez complained that their Community Councils 
were being denied registration, effectively denying them the right to claim collective land 
title and to be consulted over megaprojects. The reasons identified for the denial of 
registration were often bureaucratic requirements that may not have been met with 
precision or claims that registration had already been granted to another competing Council 
claiming legitimacy. Community members and NGOs interpreted both rationales as being 
ploys to wrest control away from the legitimate representatives in favour of those more 
compliant with the ultimate purpose of expropriating the land title or enabling use of the 
land by outside interests. 
</footnote>7) 
of the population. However, the National Statistics Department (Departamento 
Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica &#8211; DANE) and the Ombudsman&#8217;s office 
acknowledge deficiencies in data gathering, stating that the actual figure is close to 25 per 
cent, or 10.5 million people. The census failed to accurately capture the demographic and 
socio-economic reality of the Afro-Colombian population1. Certain Afro-Colombian areas 
were considered inaccessible and population estimates replaced verified statistics. 
</p>
<p>5. The focus of the independent expert was on communities who identify as Afro-
Colombian, Black, Raizal2 and Palenquero3. She visited Bogot&#225; and Colombia&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Census statistics from 1993 recorded only 1.5 per cent as Afro-Colombian due to the limited 
</p>
<p>questioning on racial identification. The 2005 census broadened ethnic questions to allow ethno-
cultural self-identification as Raizal, Palenquero, Black, mulatto, Afro-Colombian or Afro-
descendant. 
</p>
<p> 2 Raizal is the name given to the native population from the islands of San Andr&#233;s and Providencia. 
 3 Palenquera is the name given to the Afro-descendant population of San Basilio de Palenque in the 
</p>
<p>Province of Bolivar.  </p>

<p>Caribbean/Atlantic and Pacific Coastal regions where Afro-Colombian communities are 
prominent, including Cartagena, San Basilio de Palenque, Turbaco (Bol&#237;var), Urab&#225; region 
and Curvarad&#243; (Choc&#243;/Antioquia), Apartado, Quibdo (capital of Choc&#243;), Cali, 
Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca) and the municipality of Su&#225;rez (Cauca). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework and enforcement mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>6. Colombia&#8217;s Constitution provides under article 7 that the State &#8220;recognizes and 
protects the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Colombian Nation&#8221;. The right to equality 
and non-discrimination is incorporated into the Constitution via components including: (a) 
a general principle whereby all persons are born free and equal before the law and shall be 
given equal protection and treatment by the authorities; (b) prohibition of discrimination; 
(c) the State&#8217;s duty to promote conditions for ensuring that equality is real and effective for 
all persons (art. 13); and (d) the possibility of instituting special measures to improve the 
circumstances of groups that are discriminated against or marginalized (art. 13)4.  
</p>
<p>7. An institutional framework exists to formulate policies to protect the rights of ethnic 
groups. The Department of Indigenous, Minority and Roma Affairs and the Department of 
Black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquero and Raizal Community Affairs exist within the 
Ministry of the Interior and Justice.  Additionally, the Vice-President chairs the national 
Intersectoral Commission for the Advancement of the Afro-Colombian, Palenquera and 
Raizal People. 
</p>
<p>8. Law 70 of 1993 &#8220;In Recognition of the Right of Black Colombians to Collectively 
Own and Occupy their Ancestral Lands&#8221; is the primary national legislation dedicated to the 
rights of Afro-Colombians and is exemplary in its provisions to protect and promote their 
rights. Article 1 states: &#8220;The object of the present Law is to recognize the right of the Black 
Communities that have been living on barren lands in rural areas along the rivers of the 
Pacific Basin, in accordance with their traditional production practices, to their collective 
property&#8221;. Law 70 establishes a wide range of collective and individual rights including the 
right to education and protection of cultural identity. 
</p>
<p>9. Law 70 establishes the process for the granting of collective property title based on a 
technical evaluation of requests and information including a physical description of the 
land, ethno-historic antecedents, demographic description, and details of traditional 
practices of production. Collective territories are to be &#8220;non-transferable, imprescriptible, 
and non-mortgageable&#8221;5. Article 5 requires each community to form a Community Council 
as its primary internal administrative body in order to receive adjudicable lands as 
collective property. 
</p>
<p>10. On the basis of Law 70, the Government states in its 2008 report to the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/COL/14), that at that time collective 
titles had been allocated for 5,128,830 hectares, benefiting 60,418 families. The Colombian 
Institute for Rural Development (Instituto Colombiano de Desarrollo Rural &#8211; INCODER) 
has processed applications for collective titling since 2008 that have increased the total by 
</p>
<p>  
 4  See the 14th periodic report of Colombia to CERD of May 2008, CERD/C/COL/14, considered by 
</p>
<p>the Committee in August 2009. 
 5 Article 7 of Law 70 states that: &#8220;Only areas assigned to a family group can be transferred, whether 
</p>
<p>through the dissolution of the group or any other cause indicated in the Law, but the preferential right 
to occupy or acquire the land can only fall to other members of the community, and, in their absence, 
to another member of the ethnic group, for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the lands and the 
cultural identity of the Black Communities.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>an additional 454,152 hectares. In aggregate, that is an estimated five per cent of the 
national territory. 
</p>
<p>11. Afro-Colombian land rights under Law 70 do not include rights to renewable and 
non-renewable natural resources or rights to the subsoil. However, under the provisions 
related to use of the land and protection of natural resources and the environment, article 24 
establishes that &#8220;For purposes of land resource exploitation priority will be given to 
proposals from members of the Black Communities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. The newly elected Government of Juan Manuel Santos has announced that it is 
giving a high priority to human rights and that significant progress has been made towards a 
human rights National Action Plan6. A National Development Plan currently under 
discussion has a chapter devoted to human rights. The new Government has created a 
Presidential Programme for Afro-Colombian Affairs whose Director is Afro-Colombian 
and has committed to form a High Level Commission responsible for recommendations to 
improve the living conditions of ethnic minorities. Human rights provisions already exist in 
a number of public policy instruments at the national and provincial levels. There is 
currently a human rights policy for the Ministry of Defence. 
</p>
<p>13. In 2000, the Presidential Programme for Human Rights and International 
Humanitarian Law was created under the Vice Presidency7. Its objective was to design a 
national policy that would increase collaboration among Government institutions, including 
the offices of the Procurator General, the Attorney General, the Superior Council of the 
Judiciary, the Ombudsman, the National Planning Department, and the Ministry of the 
Interior and Justice.  
</p>
<p>14. The Office of the Ombudsman (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo) is independent, in 
compliance with the Paris Principles, and has responsibility for ensuring the protection and 
promotion of human rights. The Ombudsman has a Division for Ethnic Minorities. It 
reports annually on human rights issues to the Congress of the Republic, receives 
complaints and provides assistance, information, and public defence lawyers for criminal 
processes. The Ombudsman has established an important early warning/risk assessment 
system. The Office of the Attorney General has established a unit for the prosecution of 
human rights and international humanitarian law violations.  
</p>
<p>15. Colombia has ratified human rights treaties most relevant to minorities including the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 
93 of the Constitution establishes that international human rights treaties and agreements 
have primacy in domestic law and that the Constitution must be interpreted in conformity 
with them. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discrimination and poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination and racism 
</b></p>
<p>16. The legacy of slavery endures and is manifested in socially and economically 
marginalized communities facing racist attitudes and structural discrimination. The 
Government acknowledges that: &#8220;Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities are still 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Despite the current suspension of the National Action Plan consultation process, some 27

<p>Government institutions worked towards content of the Plan for eventual consultation with civil 
society.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>victims of various forms of racial discrimination &#8230;, a complex cultural problem with its 
roots in the history of Colombia and Latin America, which has engendered a scenario in 
which the indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities have been traditionally subject to 
marginalization, poverty and vulnerability to violence&#8221;. The Government notes that its 
recognition of these problems has promoted meaningful affirmative action programmes to 
reduce inequality in the provision of public services and to close social gaps experienced by 
Afro-Colombians and other historically vulnerable populations.  
</p>
<p>17. The 2005 census introduced ethnic categories in an effort to provide statistical 
information required to inform public policies and affirmative action programmes to 
combat discrimination against Afro-Colombians. However, there is still very little official 
socio-economic data disaggregated by race or ethnicity to reveal inequalities experienced 
by Afro-Colombians. Even the human rights statistics of the Presidential Programme for 
Human Rights and international humanitarian law differentiate between homicides against 
indigenous people, trade unionists or politicians, but do not have a category for Afro-
Colombian victims8. When considered together with the gross statistical undercount of 
Afro-Colombians, it seems probable that Government policies are ill-informed about the 
extent of the problems facing Afro-Colombian communities.  
</p>
<p>18. Afro-Colombian representatives highlight pervasive structural discrimination, 
including access to quality education, employment and participation in economic life, 
housing, effective political participation and access to justice. The estimated illiteracy index 
within the Afro-Colombian population is 30 per cent, compared with the national average 
of 16 per cent9. Nearly 10 per cent of Afro-Colombian children from 6 to 10 years of age do 
not access primary education, with the percentage believed to be far higher in some 
regions10. 
</p>
<p>19. Afro-Colombians are grossly underrepresented in public sector employment, rarely 
represented at senior levels and face discriminatory barriers in private sector employment. 
Due to discrimination and poor educational achievements the employment opportunities of 
Afro-Colombians are largely limited to the informal sector in such areas as itinerant 
trading. Most rural communities rely on subsistence farming and, in some areas, on small-
scale mining.  Afro-Colombian women noted their overrepresentation as domestic workers 
and unskilled staff, often the only employment available to them. 
</p>
<p>20. In 1999, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its 
concluding observations (CERD/C/304/Add.<footnote name="7">4. Law 70, Article 5, requires each community to form a Community Council as its 
internal administrative body to receive title to ancestral lands. Community Councils are also 
to oversee the conservation and protection of collective property, the preservation of 
cultural identity, and the use and conservation of natural resources. Community Councils 
are required to identify a representative from the respective community to act as a friendly 
conciliator in internal conflicts. Community Councils offer essential leadership structures 
and potential for local governance, allowing Afro-Colombians to manage their own affairs. 
</footnote>6), described &#8220;de facto racial segregation in 
urban centres&#8221; and discrimination which results in Afro-Colombians being consigned to the 
poorest neighbourhoods and low quality housing. The independent expert&#8217;s consultations 
revealed that this situation continues in 2010. Discrimination in access to public places 
reportedly persists, despite at least one high-profile prosecution of a nightclub for denying 
entry to young Afro-Colombians11. The Government asserts that such incidents are not 
prevalent throughout the country. Afro-Colombians report that the media perpetuates 
negative racial stereotypes and images of Afro-Colombian people, trivializes their problems 
and gives little attention to their contributions to society.

<p>21. Discrimination, poverty, and violence have had far-reaching impacts on Afro-
Colombian culture and community structures. For example, community members in San 
Basilio de Palenque, where inhabitants maintain unique cultural elements of their African 
heritage, described to the independent expert how discrimination, loss of territory, poor 
access to education, public services and economic opportunities have led to social problems 
and cultural erosion.  The Government, however, notes its commitment to ensuring the 
survival of Afro-Colombian, Black, Raizal and Palenquero cultures, languages and 
identities.

with the map of areas of extreme poverty. Some Afro-Colombian rural areas and town 
ghettos experience extreme poverty rates of over 60 per cent and lack access to social 
services and assistance programmes. The five departments with the highest percentage of 
the population in poverty and with the lowest quality of life are those with the highest 
concentrations of Afro-Colombians (Bol&#237;var, Cauca, C&#243;rdoba, Choc&#243;, and Nari&#241;o). 
Surveys and Government sources12 reveal disturbing statistics. Some 80 per cent of Afro-
Colombians do not have basic needs met. The 2005 census revealed that nearly 15 per cent 
of Afro-Colombians go hungry one or more days a week, over double the national average. 
Nearly a quarter of Afro-Colombians lack sufficient income to ensure a basic nutritional 
diet. Access to clean water, sanitation and electricity is at markedly lower levels for many 
Afro-Colombians. Choc&#243; has the lowest per capita level of social investment and ranked 
last in education, health, and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>23. Life expectancy for Afro-Colombian women (66.7 years) is nearly 11 years less than 
the national average, while for men (64.<footnote name="6">8. Economic development &#8220;megaprojects&#8221; have increasingly led to the dispossession of 
Afro-Colombian collective territories. These projects have been associated with brutal 
forced displacement, mass violence and selected killings. Persistent reports indicate that 
armed groups collude with national and foreign companies (including palm oil and mining 
companies), and often with local government and business actors to acquire and control 
land and resources. Black communities rarely benefit from these megaprojects and have 
grave concerns about encroachment on their land rights and adverse environmental impacts. 
Equally, the manipulation or co-opting of community leadership and Community Councils 
creates divisions within Afro-Colombian communities with the aim of acquiring land. 
</footnote> years) it is nearly 6 years less. In Choc&#243;, the child 
mortality rate is 54 per 1,000, compared with Medell&#237;n where it is 8 per 1,00013. The 
average female infant mortality rate for the Afro-descendant population is 43.9, while the 
national average is 2114. The maternal mortality national average is 74.9 deaths for every 
100,000 live births, while in Choc&#243; the rate is 227.415. Access to health-care services is 
extremely poor for many, particularly rural communities. 
</p>
<p>24. Those living in the most remote and inaccessible rural localities face particular and 
extreme challenges. The Government highlights problems of service delivery to such areas 
including lack of access and infrastructure for development and ongoing security concerns 
in areas strategically important for illegal armed groups. Afro-Colombian representatives 
believe that discrimination and neglect are important components in the poor delivery of 
services. 
</p>
<p>25. In predominantly Afro-Colombian urban centres, including Quibd&#243; and 
Buenaventura, levels of poverty are disproportionately high and living conditions markedly 
deprived. Many Afro-Colombians live in poverty on the margins of urban centres as a 
consequence of violence and forced displacement from rural areas. Displaced rural 
communities, particularly women and children, have few resources and are ill-equipped for

cent of displaced Afro-Colombians live in the poorest and most dangerous areas of major 
cities. 
</p>
<p>26. Colombia&#8217;s Constitutional Court cites research showing that 96.5 per cent of Afro-
Colombians registered as displaced are living below the poverty line16. According to 2005 
Census data, 30 per cent of displaced Afro-Colombians did not have sufficient money to eat 
for at least one day a week and 69 per cent of displaced Afro-Colombian children had no 
access to education. 
</p>
<p>27. In Buenaventura, Colombia&#8217;s largest port, estimated to be over 90 per cent Afro-
Colombian, private and Government interests have brought huge investment and wealth to 
development of the port; however the city remains among the poorest and most neglected in 
Colombia. Most Afro-Colombians endure poor wages and labour conditions and 
substandard housing. Thousands displaced from the surrounding region live in conditions 
of poverty.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Responses of the Government to discrimination and poverty 
</b></p>
<p>28. State officials and institutions described to the independent expert a plethora of 
policy initiatives and programmes for Afro-Colombian communities including: the Long-
term Integral Plan for Black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquera and Raizal Peoples 2006-2010; 
the National Development Plan &#8220;Community State: Development for All&#8221;, 2006-2010; the 
National Development Plan Resources 2006-2010 for Afro-Colombian People; the Goals 
and Advancements of the State&#8217;s Policy for the Pacific (CONPES 3491, 2007); 
&#8220;Affirmative Action Policy for Black or Afro-Colombian People&#8221; (CONPES 3310, 2004); 
and the Formulation of the Long-term Integral Plan Proposal for Black, Afro-Colombian, 
Palenquera and Raizal people. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2008, the Government established the Intersectoral Commission for the 
Advancement of the Afro-Colombian, Palenquera and Raizal People. Headed by the Vice-
President, it includes key ministries and Government departments, advisors, municipal 
representatives, and legal representatives for Community Councils. The Commission&#8217;s 
objective was to evaluate living conditions and present recommendations to improve Afro-
Colombians&#8217; economic and social advancement and the enjoyment of their civil rights17.  
</p>
<p>30. The Commission&#8217;s recommendations seek to address issues including racism and 
discrimination, low participation in political life and decision-making, weak institutional 
capacity, inequality in education and access to employment, lack of recognition and social 
valuing of diversity, poor legal security of collective property rights, and limited access to 
subsidy programmes. Consultations with officials however revealed that implementation 
currently remains at the planning stages.

<p>failure to deliver sufficient tangible results. For example, housing subsidies for displaced 
persons do not cover the market costs of housing and few have additional resources to 
cover the deficit. It is evident that financial resources allocated to projects are too often 
failing to trickle down to the communities which urgently need services. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Violence and displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Disproportionate displacement of Afro-Colombians 
</b></p>
<p>33. Decades of armed conflict between the Government, paramilitaries and guerrilla 
forces have played out largely in Afro-Colombian territories. Paramilitary groups have been 
officially demobilized and the official position of the Government is that the &#8220;armed 
conflict&#8221; has ended, even though some violence continues18. Nevertheless, in every rural 
Black community that the independent expert visited she heard credible stories of ongoing 
violence, murders and threats. Whole communities are forced to flee their lands to seek 
security in towns and hostile urban environments.  Communities believe that there is 
impunity for those who commit crimes against them. 
</p>
<p>34. While large-scale massacres and atrocities are now less common, the opinion 
expressed to the independent expert in many communities that she visited is that the names, 
uniforms or tactics of illegal armed groups may have changed, but violence remains in the 
form of selective murders, disappearances, intimidation and forced confinement. Their 
experience is that demobilization has not put an end to the violence; paramilitaries have 
regrouped under new names such as &#8220;Las &#193;guilas Negras&#8221; (the Black Eagles) or &#8220;Los 
Rastrojos&#8221;.  Afro-Colombian communities still report consistently high levels of violence 
and intimidation. 
</p>
<p>35. Non-governmental organizations report an alarming escalation in the violence in 
recent months, including some 20 murders of Afro-Colombian leaders in 2009, either that 
had not been investigated or where investigations had produced no results19. The United 
Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions20 documented 
ongoing killings by illegal armed groups and members of the security forces, including 
cases of &#8220;false positives&#8221;21. He confirmed that &#8220;Indigenous and Afro-Colombian 
communities have been victimized by all parties to Colombia&#8217;s conflicts&#8221; and that 
&#8220;historically, paramilitaries, sometimes in collusion with State forces, appropriated land 
from the indigenous or Afro-Colombians and committed massacres to intimidate local 
populations or overcome their resistance&#8221;. The Government states that these acts constitute 
criminal phenomena which do not indicate a State policy or pattern of racial or ethnic 
discrimination, and, further, that important steps have been taken to investigate such acts 
and punish those responsible.  
</p>
<p>  
 18  The Government states that it recognizes that the problems caused by the armed conflict persist and 
</p>
<p>that it maintains efforts to resolve any situations of violence. 
 19 Documented cases include Jos&#233; F&#233;lix Orejuela, from the Los Manglares Community Council, 
</p>
<p>Municipality of L&#243;pez de Micay in the Cauca Coast; Miladis Belaide, a leader internally displaced 
from Urab&#225;, Choc&#243;, to Cartagena, and member of the National Association of Solidarity Assistance; 
Milton Grueso Torres, leader of the Community Council of San Jos&#233;, also from L&#243;pez de Micay, 
Cauca; and Argenito Diaz, member of the Community Council and Organizations of Bajo Atrato, 
Choc&#243; (ASCOBA).

</p>
<p>36. The phenomenon of &#8220;confinement&#8221; of communities (through violence, threats and 
economic blockade) is a cause for concern. Those in areas occupied by illegal armed groups 
that wish to exert control over territories and movement within them are sometimes 
confined to localities through force. Curfews are enforced and normal access to rivers, 
agricultural fields, bordering territories or markets is denied. Affected Afro-Colombian 
communities may consequently have little access to basic necessities and limited 
opportunities to continue their farming and economic activities. 
</p>
<p>37. Afro-Colombian territories are strategically important for illegal armed groups 
involved in narcotics production and trafficking. While violence and threats remain the 
initial forces propelling displacements, the motivations have changed over recent years. 
New macro-economic development plans have targeted these regions for one-crop agri-
business investments including palm oil and banana cultivation; and for mining 
concessions, ranching and logging operations. Aerial fumigation by the Government to 
control illicit crops has also reportedly caused massive displacement and health problems 
due to the poisoning of lands otherwise used for legitimate food crops. The Government 
does not recognize fumigations as a cause of displacement; therefore these IDPs are not 
eligible for registration as displaced and are unable to access certain assistance 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>38. The experiences of communities inhabiting the river basins of Curvarad&#243; and 
Jiguamiand&#243; were described during the independent expert&#8217;s visit to Curvarad&#243;. 
Community sources estimate that 3,000 Afro-Colombians were forcibly displaced from 
their collective territory, where they conducted small-scale sustainable agriculture. The 
region is strategically important to different armed groups and was the scene of military 
operations during the 1990s, causing initial displacements. This rich, bio-diverse region 
was subsequently sought after by agro-business &#8220;megaprojects&#8221;, including large-scale palm 
oil cultivation. Consequently, populations were displaced by paramilitaries, narco-
traffickers, and those seeking to acquire lands illegally for plantations and cattle ranching. 
One community member recalled being warned &#8220;if you don&#8217;t leave, we&#8217;ll negotiate with 
your widow&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>39. In 2007, the NGOs the National Association of Displaced Afro-Colombians 
(AFRODES) and Global Rights reported that a total of 252,541 people had been displaced 
from collective Afro-Colombian territories located in 50 municipalities. That represented 
79 per cent of the population registered as eligible for the right to collective land title.  As 
of the end of 2009, NGOs estimated that Afro-descendants represented almost a third of 
Colombia&#8217;s displaced population22, and that over 12 per cent of all Afro-Colombians are 
living in a situation of forced displacement23. These estimates are considerably higher than 
the numbers officially registered24.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2009 and 2010, mass displacements of Afro-Colombians continued. On 17 
August, 2009, 117 community members were displaced due to confrontations between 
illegal armed groups for control of the Bajo Baud&#243; River area. Intensive aerial fumigation 
of crops in collective territories in Guap&#237;, Cauca, reportedly caused the internal

<p>  
 22 Estimated by the Government to be around 3.2 million people and by NGOs to be some 4.9 million at 
</p>
<p>the end of 2009. 
 23 According to a survey by the Consultancy on Human Rights and Displacement (CODHES) in 2008. 
</p>
<p>Other estimates put the figure at over one third.  
 24 CODHES estimates that 286,<footnote name="3">9 Required by Constitutional Court judgement C-461 of 2008. </footnote>89 persons were displaced during 2009, compared to official 
</p>
<p>registration of 111,414 new displacements (17,844 of whom identified as Afro-Colombian). 
CODHES notes that 83 per cent of mass displacements (i.e. concerning over 50 people) involved 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>displacement of 56 persons. During late 2009, three major internal displacements were 
recorded by AFRODES as a consequence of intensive aerial fumigations, Colombian army 
operations, and confrontations with illegal armed groups. On 2 March 2010, combat 
between the military and FARC allegedly caused displacement of 576 Afro-Colombians in 
the municipality of L&#243;pez de Micay, Cauca. Fumigation in January 2010 reportedly caused 
the displacement of 48 people to the Municipality of Guap&#237;. 
</p>
<p>41. In Choc&#243; in 2010, confrontations between armed groups caused forced displacement 
in Antioquia. On 5 January, 96 persons of the Afro-Colombian Community Puerto Luis in 
Alto Baud&#243; were displaced due to confrontations between army forces and National 
Liberation Army guerrillas. On 15 and 16 February, 11 families were forcibly displaced in 
the rural area of Barranc&#243;n at Urrao municipality in Antioquia due to combats between 
military forces and FARC guerrillas. On 29 March, 234 members of the Dipurd&#250; 
community in Medio San Juan in Choc&#243; were forcibly displaced as a consequence of 
intimidation by &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221;, a new illegal armed group. On 17 April roughly 100 Afro-
Colombian persons abandoned their lands in Itsmina and San Juan towns, Choc&#243;, due to 
confrontations between illegal armed groups. On 15 August, 180 Afro-Colombians of the 
Uni&#243;n Berrecuy community at Medio Baud&#243; were forcibly displaced after the kidnap of 3 
members of their community and threats from Los Rastrojos. 
</p>
<p>42. The threat of displacement is ever present for other communities. During her visit to 
Buenaventura, community leaders informed the independent expert that expansion of port 
facilities, in a private/public partnership, will lead to displacement of approximately 3,400 
families. Communities report that they have yet to be consulted. Afro-Colombian fishing 
communities are concerned that displacement away from coastal areas will restrict them 
from traditional fishing-based livelihoods. Communities fear that not all displaced families 
will be eligible for re-housing. Projects to build a new road connecting Buenaventura with 
the Pan-American Highway and expansion of a military base were also identified as 
potentially leading to displacements. 
</p>
<p>43. Displaced Afro-Colombians have little choice but to move to urban areas,, 
frequently inhospitable environments of poverty, discrimination and fear. Impoverished city 
neighbourhoods provide a fertile recruitment ground for armed groups who coerce young 
people living in poverty to join them. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Afro-Colombian women&#8217;s experience of violence and displacement 
</b></p>

<p>threats against male leaders. The independent expert met with women leaders in the &#8220;City 
of Women&#8221; in the municipality of Turbaco (Bol&#237;var) established by displaced women (the 
League of Internally Displaced Women) in 2003, which is home to some 500 primarily 
Afro-Colombian women and children.  
</p>
<p>46. They obtained funding to purchase land and build their houses. They described their 
experiences of displacement and violence and their efforts to document cases and seek 
redress. The community provides practical, psychological and social support to members 
who feel they have received little Government support. The community has conducted 
training for women leaders and developed economic initiatives with micro-finance loans.  
Women in this community described continuing insecurity and fear of further displacement 
and violence. The community meeting centre was burned down in an arson attack. New 
illegal armed groups give rise to constant insecurity. Community women described security 
strategies, including moving in groups and quickly mobilizing in response to danger. They 
acknowledged some protection measures provided by the State, however noted that many 
of the measures were ill-suited to their realities.  
</p>
<p>47. Law 1257 on &#8220;Measures to raise awareness, prevent and punish all forms of violence 
and discrimination against women&#8221;, adopted in 2008, recognizes a wide range of acts of 
violence in both private and public spheres. Women&#8217;s groups expressed concern, however, 
regarding the lack of its implementation. The Government emphasizes that, among other 
measures, the Presidential Office on Equality for Women, the Ombudsman and the Office 
of the Attorney General have set up a Monitoring Committee to promote implementation of 
Law 1257 with the participation of women&#8217;s organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Responses of the Government to violence and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>48. Law 387 of 1997 requires measures to be adopted for the prevention of forced 
displacement, and for assistance, protection, and the socio-economic stabilization of 
persons internally displaced by violence. The Law underscores that forced displacement is a 
crime; however, reportedly less than one per cent of all criminal cases are prosecuted under 
this law.25. 
</p>
<p>49. The National System for Comprehensive Assistance to the Displaced Population 
(SNAIPD) identifies official entities at the national and local levels with duties with respect 
to internally displaced persons (IDPs).  The Presidential Agency for Social Action and 
International Cooperation, Acci&#243;n Social, is the primary body responsible for providing 
services for IDPs, vulnerable populations, and victims of violence and has specific 
initiatives targeted towards Afro-Colombian communities. It is responsible for registration 
of displaced populations and providing assistance to them. In 2009 the Government budget 
for assistance to IDPs was 1.<footnote name="3">3 See http://www.wola.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=viewp&amp;id=870&amp;Itemid=8  </footnote> trillion pesos (approximately US$650 million)26. 
</p>
<p>50. The Families in Action Programme aims to improve nutrition, health, and education, 
specifically by promoting registration and access to benefits and subsidies. The Network for 
Food Security, ReSA, supports sustainable subsistence farming, including through the 
return of individuals to their lands and territories where possible. Additional projects aim to 
provide emergency humanitarian assistance; essential goods to the poorest and most 
vulnerable populations; infrastructural development projects; housing and basic dwelling 
support; habitat improvement projects; and psychosocial support.

<p>51. Assistance programmes are targeted towards officially registered IDPs. However, 
several factors impede registration of the entire affected population, excluding some from 
receiving assistance. Among those factors are lack of awareness of the registration process; 
fear of coming forward; lack of access to registration locations; administrative barriers; and 
rejection on the basis of criteria which exclude certain causes of displacement (for example 
displacement due to aerial fumigations). The Constitutional Court directed the Government 
to improve registration systems; however, in 2009 Acci&#243;n Social refused 36 per cent of 
registration applications, citing fraudulent claims as the main reason for rejection and 
ineligible claims in a small percentage of cases27. The Government notes that as of 
31 October 2010, 4,516,246 people have claimed to be victims of forced displacement. Of 
these, 3,573,179 (79.1 per cent) were included in the Registry of Displaced Persons and 
20.9 per cent of claimants were rejected.  NGOs identify a high percentage of arbitrary 
denials. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Responses of security forces 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Vice Minister of Defence and commanders of operational brigades in Afro-
Colombian regions28 described to the independent expert efforts to integrate into the 
training of every soldier and police officer respect for the human rights and the needs of 
Afro-Colombian communities. They emphasize that through supervision, training, outreach 
and accountability, steps are being taken to break with the pattern of past violations. 
Directive 07 of 2007 of the Ministry of National Defence is aimed at strengthening the 
policy for recognition, prevention and protection of the rights of Afro-Colombians. 
</p>
<p>53. Government initiatives may have improved security in some areas. However Afro-
Colombian community members claim that certain practices, including increased military 
presence in sensitive areas and the extensive use of civilian informers, may put 
communities and individuals at heightened risk by feeding the perception by illegal armed 
groups that they are collaborating with the security forces. Civilian community members 
have been murdered or subjected to detention when armed groups or security forces accuse 
them of collaborating with their enemy29. Communities consequently feel threatened by all 
armed actors. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The Office of the Ombudsman 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>The Ombudsman does not sit on that committee but must rely on it to initiate protection 
measures.  Communities expressed a high level of frustration that the CIAT denies the 
legitimacy of the threats against them. 
</p>
<p>56. The Ministry of the Interior and Justice undertakes security assessments and 
determines protection measures based on specific requests from Afro-Colombian and 
Indigenous leaders, unionists and journalists.  The measures include increased military 
presences, vehicles, bodyguards, relocations, mobile phones and transport subsidies. 
However, some measures were reportedly imposed without full consultation and were not 
appropriate to the situation.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Transitional justice, reparations and restitution 
</b></p>
<p>57. Colombia is developing a transitional justice process to provide justice, truth and 
reparations for victims of violence. Part of the legal framework was established with Law 
975 of 2005, known as the &#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221;. This regulates the procedures to be 
followed with demobilized members of illegal armed groups who are responsible for 
serious crimes and establishes judicial benefits based on their contribution to justice and 
reparation. Subsequently, in 2008 the Government adopted Decree 1290 aimed at 
establishing an administrative programme for reparations. 
</p>
<p>58. Nevertheless, Afro-Colombians commonly expressed their frustration and anger to 
the independent expert over a transitional justice process that they feel has failed them. 
Most do not believe that justice has been served. They believe that the full truth of the past 
has not been revealed, crimes have led to few prosecutions and the vast majority of those 
displaced from their lands have received no reparations. Between August 2002 and October 
2009, 51,992 persons were individually and collectively demobilized and 3,957 are facing 
charges under Law 975. By December 2009, 737 voluntary depositions were under way30. 
By September 2010, only two persons had been sentenced for charges under the Justice and 
Peace procedures. The main mechanism available to satisfy the right to truth continues to 
be voluntary depositions under the Justice and Peace Law.  
</p>
<p>59. Although the State provides some benefits to victims of violence, such as social 
programmes targeting internally displaced persons, reparations have largely failed to reach 
the victims. Indeed, Decree 1290 of 2008 only applies to the victims of illegal armed 
groups and ignores victims of State agents. This legal distinction unfairly reduces the 
possibility of reparations for thousands. In addition, Decree 1290 has not been allocated the 
necessary financial resources. By December 2009, of the over 275,000 requests received, 
resources had been approved for just 10,593 persons31. Afro-Colombians represent a 
substantial number of victims of forced displacement yet no official records exist with 
respect to them, either in the context of the administrative programme of reparations or in 
the framework of the available judicial process. The reparations programme does not 
provide economic compensation for crimes involving property rights or collective 
violations of the rights of communities. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government states that the process of Justice and Peace is creating important if 
gradual change allowing a return of peace to communities affected by violence. It claims 
positive results, including that truth is emerging gradually, judicial proceedings against 
demobilized forces are under way, progress is being made in the compensation of victims, 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>former combatants have been placed in reintegration programmes, increased security has 
been achieved, and new spaces for dialogue have opened up.   
</p>
<p>61. The right to restitution of dispossessed lands of Afro-Colombians is an urgent matter 
that remains pending. The new Government has initiated two legislative reforms including 
a Bill for the restitution of land to forcibly displaced people and a Bill relating to the rights 
of the victims of the armed conflict. These legal initiatives are important and should include 
legal mechanisms clearly aimed at providing restitution of lands to Afro-Colombian 
communities as part of a complete reparation programme which considers victims on an 
equal basis while establishing specific measures for Afro-Colombians.  
</p>
<p>62. Given cases of intimidation, threats and murders against community leaders who are 
claiming land restitution, documented by OHCHR in 2008, 2009 and 2010, it is vital to take 
effective measures to protect victims and to investigate the perpetrators of such crimes. The 
independent expert&#8217;s consultations with many affected individuals and communities lead 
her to concur with the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or 
Arbitrary Executions who visited Colombia in June 2009 and stated: &#8220;groups composed of 
formerly demobilized paramilitaries, have also carried out many killings and the numbers 
are rising. The groups&#8217; existence and growth are largely due to demobilization and 
transitional justice processes that have resulted in impunity for paramilitaries&#8217; human rights 
violations. Neither victims nor the nation at large have seen justice done. The truth of why 
tens of thousands died and who was responsible remains hidden, and victims and their 
loved ones have been deprived of reparations.&#8221;

<p><b> G. Findings of the Constitutional Court

</p>
<p>facilitated the presence of armed groups32. It emphasized the need for differentiated 
approaches towards solving the problems faced by Afro-Colombian communities. 
</p>
<p>66. The Court ordered the Government to design and implement a Comprehensive Plan 
for the Prevention, Protection and Attention to forcibly displaced Afro-Colombian 
communities, including 62 specific plans aimed at identified communities and a roadmap 
for the protection of ethnic territories. Despite a deadline of the end of October 2009, at the 
time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, these requirements had not been effectively 
implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Dispossession of Afro-Colombian lands 
</b></p>
<p>67. Afro-Colombian lands, while isolated and neglected for centuries, have in recent 
years been identified as the most fertile and resource rich in Colombia. This has placed 
once isolated, largely self-sufficient communities directly in harm&#8217;s way. Violence and 
threats against Afro-Colombians are now most prominently associated with the ultimate 
aim of controlling land and natural resources resulting in the dispossession of Afro-
Colombian lands. Communities described ongoing violence and threats in pursuit of 
acquisition, control or exploitation of their collectively owned lands. While few displaced 
communities have returned to their lands, those who do often find that others have claimed 
ownership or rights of usage in their absence.

<p>illegal armed groups. In Curvarad&#243; and Jiguamiand&#243; agro-businesses have usurped lands of 
displaced communities to plant African palm. The courts have confirmed the land title held 
by the communities; however, thousands of hectares remain controlled by illegal armed 
groups in cooperation with agro-businesses33. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The right to consultation and participation in decision-
making 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>71. Civil society groups emphasized the poor levels of Afro-Colombian representation 
in political institutions at all levels. At the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, there were 
10 self-identified Afro-Colombian members of the House of Representatives out of 166 
elected members, two of whom occupied seats specifically reserved for Afro-Colombians. 
The 102-member Senate has no Afro-Colombian members and no reserved seats for Afro-
Colombians, while 2 seats are reserved for indigenous peoples. In the newly elected 
Government, none of the 13 Cabinet Ministers is Afro-Colombian; there are no Afro-
Colombians on any high court. 
</p>
<p>72. In the executive and administrative branches of Government there is apparent gross 
underrepresentation of Afro-Colombians. In the national police and military, Afro-
Colombians are concentrated at the lowest levels. 
</p>
<p>73. In the departments and municipalities where the population is overwhelmingly Afro-
Colombian, many of the politicians are considered to be corrupt or as not truly representing 
the interests of Black people. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Community Councils 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>ownership and the legitimate representation of communities. In such complex and long-
standing situations of displacement and dispossession of lands, research must take place to 
establish the historic membership of communities and collective rights to ownership of 
lands, with the vital involvement of community elders. The Government should facilitate 
dialogue and act as an honest and impartial broker. 
</p>
<p>77. Civil society organizations note that Community Councils have been designing 
territorial management plans and have presented several sustainable development plans to 
the National Planning Council (CONPES). They claim that these have received no 
consideration34. Community representatives urge measures to ensure the legitimacy of 
Community Councils, including election only by identified community members. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to free, prior and informed consultation and consent 
</b></p>
<p>78. Afro-Colombian communities have the right to free, prior and informed consultation 
and consent relating to the exploitation of natural resources within their territories. 
Colombia has ratified International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169 on 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples &#8211; Law 21 of 1991 &#8211; and an ILO expert committee has 
acknowledged the applicability of this Convention to the Afro-Colombian peoples35.  
Moreover, the Constitutional Court has defined Afro-Colombians as tribal peoples36 and 
has issued decisions in favour of their right to free, prior and informed consultation37. 
</p>
<p>79. However, Afro-Colombian communities commonly complained that consultation 
was not taking place or was held with people who do not legitimately represent community 
interests, and that procedures are unclear. In La Boquilla, an ancestral Afro-Colombian 
fishing community near Cartagena, Bol&#237;var, the community explained that they had not 
been consulted regarding development of the coastal tourism industry that is encroaching 
upon their ancestral lands. Community representatives believe that the municipal authorities 
have earmarked their lands for sale to developers. One leader stated: &#8220;Before the judges 
even handed down a ruling they were already building. We are doomed to disappear&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>80. Decree 1320 of 199838 requires prior consultation when a project or activity is 
proposed on lands under collective ownership of an Afro-Colombian community, or 
permanently inhabited by communities even if they do not have property titles. It 
established consultation procedures which include the participation of representatives of 
Afro-Colombians, the Ministry of Interior, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and the Procurator 
General&#8217;s Office. If parties do not reach agreement about the impact of a project and 
measures to prevent, correct, or compensate for any damage, the environmental authority 
decides on the future of the project and the measures to address its impacts. The 
Government emphasizes the different stages of the consultation process including a Pre-
consultation phase39 in order to define the framework for consultation, train communities on

</b></p>
<p>issues relating to their right to consultation, and identify appropriate representatives and 
methodology40.   
</p>
<p>81. Concerns, including lack of consultation with Afro-Colombians and Indigenous 
People in the drafting of Decree 1320 and with the procedures established for prior 
consultation processes, led the Constitutional Court to declare Decree 1320 incompatible 
with the protection provided to ethnic groups in the Political Constitution. Nevertheless, 
officials drew attention to the work of the prior Consultation Group established in 2008, 
with responsibility to coordinate implementation of consultation with ethnic groups for 
development projects affecting them and their territories. 
</p>
<p>82. Presidential Directive 001 of 26 March 2010 aims to establish a revised general 
framework for prior consultation. However the United Nations Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights in its consideration of Colombia in May 2010 found that this 
Directive may not be sufficient and that indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples were not 
adequately consulted regarding the Draft Bill prepared by the Working Party on Prior 
Consultation of the Ministry of the Interior. 
</p>
<p>83. The Government highlights additional initiatives to meet its obligations to ensure 
consultation and participation in decision-making, including the establishment of the High 
Level Advisory Commission incorporating 27 representatives of Afro-Colombian 
organizations and Afro-Colombian members of the House of Representatives. The 
Commission, together with consultative commissions at the provincial and regional levels, 
disseminates official information and review policies protecting Afro-Colombian rights. 
Some Afro-Colombians noted their reservations over the Advisory Commission, describing 
its members as not reflecting the choice of the community and its purpose as being to 
circumvent the legitimate consultative structures.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Government of President Juan Manuel Santos has reiterated its 
commitment to the Afro-Colombian population and has an important opportunity to 
act decisively to address the immense challenges confronting Afro-Colombians. To 
meet these challenges effectively will require a transformation in the approach of 
Colombia&#8217;s Government to emphasize implementation and enforcement of the rights 
of Afro-Colombians on an equal status with that of all other citizens. This will require 
the investment of considerable additional resources and a focus on results and 
outcomes. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Despite a commendable constitution and a plethora of Government institutions, 
programmes and policy initiatives created to advance the realization of Afro-
Colombian rights, implementation remains woefully inadequate. Where steps have 
been taken, no real enforcement has followed. Nearly two decades after Law 70, many 
communities remain displaced, dispossessed and unable to live on or work their lands. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Racism and structural discrimination have a significant impact on the lives and 
opportunities available to Afro-Colombians and are a direct cause of marginalization, 
poverty and vulnerability to violence. While anti-discrimination and equality

 40 Further phases include: an Opening phase; Analysis and Identification of Impacts and Measures; 
</p>
<p>Recording of Agreements; Systematization and Monitoring; and a Closing phase and signing of 
agreements by participants. It notes that during the period 2003 to 2006, 51 prior consultation 
processes took place relating to transportation projects, energy, mining, hydrocarbon and other natural 
resource utilization. Between 2007 and May 2010, an additional 260 had taken place.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1

<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>provisions exist in the Constitution, discrimination against Afro-Colombians persists 
in all walks of life. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government is therefore urged to enact comprehensive anti-discrimination 
legislation banning discrimination on all grounds including race. Such legislation 
should provide for effective enforcement mechanisms and establish appropriate civil 
as well as criminal penalties for acts of discrimination committed by both public and 
private actors. Importantly, implementation must be rigorously enforced by 
Colombia&#8217;s courts. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The statistical data which exists reveals the disproportionate poverty and 
relatively poor social and economic conditions experienced by many Afro-
Colombians. While numerous policy initiatives and recommendations exist with the 
aim of improving the conditions of Afro-Colombians, these have not been effectively 
implemented. It is essential to move rapidly towards implementation of policies and 
recommendations, including those of the Intersectoral Commission for the 
Advancement of the Afro-Colombian, Palanquera and Raizal People, and concrete 
measures that will impact upon their lives. Most importantly, the provisions of Law 70 
must be fully respected and upheld.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Despite improvements evident in the 2005 Official Census, the lack of accurate 
and disaggregated statistical data relating to the demographic and socio-economic 
situations of Afro-Colombians creates a major obstacle to accurately revealing their 
situation.  At the national, regional and local levels data gathering and social surveys 
should be conducted and analysis undertaken to substantially improve the accuracy of 
data on Afro-Colombian communities. This will assist in the design and 
implementation of appropriate, differentiated and effective policy and programme 
responses that address the specific needs of those communities.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The violence committed against Afro-Colombians is ongoing, is perpetrated or 
motivated by a variety of actors and is manifested in numerous ways both physical 
and psychological. For many Afro-Colombians the experience, memory or threat of 
violence is a constant in their lives. The independent expert fully shares the concerns 
expressed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and other bodies 
regarding the lack of judicial resolution for most of the crimes of violence that have 
affected Afro-Colombian communities and caused their displacement. The legal and 
administrative avenues currently in place are failing to address this unacceptable 
situation and must be reviewed, strengthened and rigorously enforced.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Government must take urgent and effective steps to protect the safety of 
Afro-Colombian leaders, their organizations and the human rights non-governmental 
organizations that champion their rights. This is particularly crucial with respect to 
members of Community Councils and others who are advocating for land restitution. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Early Warning and Risk Assessment system should be reviewed with a 
view to strengthening the operation of this essential protection system and the 
activities of the Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, including through increasing 
resources provided to it. Afro-Colombian women are particularly vulnerable to 
violence, including sexual violence and forced labour. It is essential that Law 1257 of 
2008 on measures to raise awareness, prevent and punish all forms of violence and 
discrimination against women is fully implemented and enforced. Women who take on 
leadership roles must be recognized and afforded equal and appropriate protection. 
Consultation with communities at risk must take place regarding security policies and 
measures designed for their protection.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Government must take effective steps to protect and implement the &#8220;pre-
emption&#8221; rights of Black communities in the context of the issuance of mining </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessions on ancestral or collectively titled lands (Law 70, art. 27).  Technical and 
financial assistance from Government ministries, including loans for business 
development and mine exploitation, should be available as a priority to those 
exercising their rights of pre-emption. Additionally Government should establish a 
programme of loan guarantees to encourage private banks to lend to Afro-Colombian 
communities and individuals wishing to develop agro-businesses, mines and other 
enterprises.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Forced displacement has massively impacted on the lives of Afro-Colombians 
and has devastated communities. Displacement is a current reality; not simply the 
legacy of a depleted war. The motivations of the perpetrators have evolved from 
tactical conflict-related to commercial, related to the acquisition of lands for illegal 
crops, agricultural megaprojects, economic development and exploitation of natural 
resources. Displacement continues to affect individuals and communities and remains 
a major concern of the Afro-Colombian communities. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Government should implement the measures required under 
Constitutional Court Order 005 of January 2009 as a matter of the highest priority. 
The administrative process for reparations should be adequately resourced and 
transformed to effectively meet the needs of the displaced communities. Compensation 
and humanitarian assistance programmes must be appropriate to the needs of victim 
communities. Efforts and strategies to prevent further displacement should be 
intensified and targeted towards the specific situations of Afro-Colombian 
communities identified to be at risk, in close consultation with those communities. 
Equally, efforts to facilitate the safe return of Afro-Colombians to their lands must be 
intensified as a high priority.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Dispossession of Afro-Colombian lands is a violation of this people&#8217;s 
fundamental rights that remains unresolved.  Implementing the rights of victims to 
reparations and restitution is a priority to be enforced through the courts and with 
rigorous implementation of court rulings. Where lands have been unlawfully 
appropriated by others, environments damaged and livelihoods destroyed, additional 
and long-term assistance must be provided to communities to help them to rebuild 
and restore their communities.  Furthermore, private companies and public officials 
who contributed to violent or deceitful land grabbing must be investigated and 
punished. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Afro-Colombians&#8217; right to truth, justice and reparations must be effectively 
protected within a comprehensive and systematic transitional justice process, which 
protects Afro-Colombian victims on an equal basis, taking into account their differing 
circumstances.  The package must guarantee the rights of victims to reparations and 
property restitution for the complete range of crimes suffered by Afro-Colombians 
individually and collectively perpetrated by both State and non-state actors. Any new 
laws on reparations and land restitution must comply with relevant Constitutional 
Court rulings, be consistent with the Pinheiro Principles on Housing and Property 
Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons and take into account the specific 
needs of Afro-Colombian communities and specifically protect the rights of women in 
the process. The legislative process should be used as a vehicle for meaningful 
consultations with all victim communities and include the voices of those communities 
in the Congressional debates. 
</b></p>
<p>98<b>. Concrete and robust measures must be taken to address the under-
representation of Afro-Colombians in political structures, State institutions and 
decision-making bodies at all levels. The fact that there are two reserved seats in 
Congress for Afro-Colombians is positive; however further measures, including in 
recruitment and training, must be taken to ensure that Afro-Colombians are </b></p>

<p><b>represented throughout all levels of the executive and administrative branches of 
Government and in public employment. The independent expert draws attention to 
the recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues on minorities and effective 
political participation (A/HRC/13/25) and urge their appropriate implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Prior consultation is a central principle in the protection of all rights of Afro-
Colombian communities and is particularly relevant as they seek to maintain control 
of their lands under considerable pressure from State and private actors. The right to 
free, informed prior consultation and consent must be respected and enforced in 
relation to all decisions that would affect Afro-Colombians and their territories. The 
rapid adoption of appropriate legislation to codify the right to prior consultation 
would be beneficial in this respect. Directive 001 must also be reviewed and revised 
appropriately to achieve that objective. Moreover, any bill on prior consultation and 
consent must itself be subject to a previous consultation process.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Community Councils offer essential representative structures and possibilities 
for local governance. However, there has been a lack of recognition and respect for 
Afro-Colombian leadership and decision-making structures and credible evidence of 
the manipulation or co-opting of Community Councils, often leading to divisions 
within communities. Community Councils must be legitimately elected by the 
communities that they represent. They should guarantee the equal representation of 
women.   
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Afro-Colombian cultural identity, traditions, languages and traditional 
livelihoods are an important part of the history and rich and diverse cultural mosaic 
of Colombia that must be protected. However, the damage inflicted by discrimination, 
racism and poverty, and the impact of violence, forced displacement and dispossession 
of territories, is immense. Solutions must focus on preventing further displacement 
and facilitating the urgent and secure return to their lands.
