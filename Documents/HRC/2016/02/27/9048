<p>*  The present document is submitted late to reflect the most up-to-date information possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The mandate of the independent expert on minority issues was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/79. The independent expert is required<i>, 
</i>inter alia, to promote the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging 
to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and to identify best practices by 
States and possibilities for technical cooperation by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights. The independent expert submitted her previous report to the Human Rights 
Council in February 2008, in which she provided a summary of her activities and addressed in 
detail the thematic issue of minorities and the discriminatory denial or deprivation of citizenship. 
</p>
<p> The present report provides a summary of activities undertaken by the independent expert 
since the submission of her previous annual report. The independent expert has undertaken 
official country missions to Guyana, from 28 July to 1 August 2008, and to Greece, from 8 to 
16 September 2008. The report includes a review of the ongoing collaboration of the 
independent expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with the aim of 
strengthening UNDP engagement with minorities in development processes. It also provides 
details of the inaugural Forum on Minority Issues and thematic recommendations of the Forum 
(see A/HRC/10/11/Add.1). 
 Human Rights Council resolution 6/15 of 27 March 2008 established a Forum on Minority 
Issues to be held annually for two days in Geneva. The resolution requires the independent 
expert on minority issues to guide the work of the Forum and prepare its annual meetings, and 
invites her to include in her report thematic recommendations of the Forum and 
recommendations for future thematic subjects, for consideration by the Human Rights Council. 
In accordance with resolution 6/15, the forum will, inter alia, identify and analyse best practices, 
challenges, opportunities and initiatives for the further implementation of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. The 
inaugural session of the Forum on Minority Issues was held on 15 and 16 December 2008. The 
Forum considered the thematic issue of &#8220;Minorities and the Right to Education&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Education is a basic human right for all children. And yet in all regions of the world 
minority children continue to suffer disproportionately from unequal access to quality education. 
Failure to ensure equal opportunities and equal access to education creates new generations of 
those who are disadvantaged in all walks of life, who cannot fulfil their potential in employment, 
and cannot contribute fully to their own communities and to wider society. Lack of access to 
education perpetuates the cycle of poverty that is often experienced most acutely by minority 
communities facing discrimination and exclusion, yet conversely, education provides a vital key 
to sustainable poverty alleviation. Education provides a gateway to the full enjoyment of a wide 
array of other rights, without which individuals and societies remain economically, socially and 
culturally impoverished. Ensuring equal access to education is one of the most serious challenges 
for minorities and States alike, and also offers one of the greatest opportunities for the 
advancement of the full rights and freedoms of persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p> Equal access to education must be understood in the holistic sense of the rights to 
non-discrimination and equality. The concept goes beyond issues of physical or economic 
accessibility to focus on the ultimate goal of equal access to achievement outcomes. 
Disproportionate outcomes should be considered to implicate State responsibility for the 
promotion and protection of these rights. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert is pleased to submit to the Human Rights Council her 
fourth annual report pursuant to Council resolution 2005/79. The present report provides an 
overview of her activities since her previous report, submitted in February 2008 (A/HRC/7/23) 
as well as a review of the ongoing collaboration with UNDP with the aim of strengthening 
UNDP engagement in minorities in development processes. The report also includes the 
recommendations of the inaugural Forum on Minority Issues as required in Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/15 (see A/HRC/10/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES INCLUDING 
THROUGH CONSULTATIONS WITH GOVERNMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the presentation of her previous report, the independent expert has undertaken 
official country missions to Guyana, from 28 July to 1 August 2008 (A/HRC/10/11/Add.2), and 
to Greece, from 8 to 16 September 2008 (A/HRC/10/11/Add.3). The independent expert thanks 
the Governments of Guyana and Greece for their exemplary cooperation during the preparation 
and conduct of her visits.  
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert&#8217;s visit to Guyana focused on the relations between and 
comparative situations of Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. She considered the legacy and 
impact on communities of an ethnically divided society and ethnic-based politics, and made 
recommendations to ensure non-discrimination and equality is achieved through legislation, 
policy and practice.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert&#8217;s visit to Greece enabled her to gather substantial information on 
the challenges as well as positive practices related to the rights of minorities and disadvantaged 
groups. She considered the situation of the Roma, Muslims in the region of Western Thrace, 
other religious minorities and communities claiming ethnic Macedonian identity.  
</p>
<p>5. In pursuance of her mandate to promote the implementation of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Minorities and to identify best practices in every region, the independent expert 
welcomes the positive response of the Government of Kazakhstan to her request for a country 
visit in 2009. She looks forward to continuing a dialogue with Bangladesh, Colombia, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Panama, Surinam, Sri Lanka, Thailand 
and Turkey, to whom she has made requests to visit. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. The independent expert issued a number of press releases and public statements on issues 
and situations of immediate concern. On 4 January 2008 she joined several mandate holders in 
expressing serious concern and alarm over the deteriorating situation in Kenya following 
disputed elections. The mandate holders called for a swift political solution and an immediate 
end to ethnically based violence and killings. On 28 February 2008 the independent expert joined 
the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of living in calling on the United States Government to halt ongoing evictions and to take 
immediate steps to protect the human rights of African-Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina 
and the demolition of public housing in New Orleans, Louisiana. On 10 April 2008, the 
independent expert was one of seven mandates which called for restraint by all parties and 
transparency as mass arrests were reported in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding 
areas in China. On 15 July 2008, the independent expert, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
criticized as discriminatory a policy of the Government of Italy to fingerprint all Roma, 
emphasizing that the policy contributes to an environment of hostility, antagonism and 
stigmatization of the Roma. On 20 November 2008 the independent expert, jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, issued a press release urging Europe-wide 
action to stop violence against Roma following incidents of violence in a number of European 
countries. 
</p>
<p>7. In pursuance of her mandate requirement to promote implementation of the Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, the 
independent expert receives information from diverse sources including Member States and 
non-governmental organizations regarding challenges to implementation of the Declaration and 
alleged violations of the rights of persons belonging to minority groups. On the basis of 
information received, and in order to solicit additional information from relevant States, the 
independent expert consults with Governments by sending communications in the form of letters 
of allegation, urgent appeals and thematic communications. The independent expert has 
consequently sent communications in relation to numerous situations involving minorities. 
Communications have been sent jointly with other relevant thematic mandate holders, and details 
are reflected in the summary reports of cases transmitted to Governments and replies received of 
those mandates.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACTIVITIES TO APPLY A GENDER PERSPECTIVE 
</b></p>
<p>8. Pursuant to the requirement under her mandate to apply a gender perspective in her work, 
the independent expert has placed a high priority on the issues of minority women. Information 
received by the independent expert consistently reveals that women belonging to minorities 
experience unique challenges and multiple or intersectional discrimination emanating from their 
status as members of minorities and as women or girls.  
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert has established a practice of holding forums dedicated to minority 
women&#8217;s views and voices during her country visits. She has conducted such forums during her 
visits to Hungary, Ethiopia, France, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Greece. These forums for 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  During the period under review the independent expert joined communications to: China, 
</p>
<p>India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Italy, Malaysia, Slovakia and the Sudan. Details of 
these communications are included in the summary reports of cases transmitted to Governments 
of the mandates including: the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression; the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the right to education. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>women have revealed highly significant country and community specific information about the 
lives of minority women, which is reflected in the visit reports of the independent expert. They 
have been vital to a deeper understanding of issues facing minority communities in general. 
</p>
<p>10. The forums for women have also revealed, over the course of several forums, a number of 
issues that are common to women from many minority communities. Particular problems are 
faced by girls in accessing educational institutions and continuing their education through higher 
levels, especially in highly patriarchal family and community structures. Poverty and 
discrimination add to the weight of the &#8220;burden of family care&#8221; shouldered by most women. 
Minority women, whose families are most often extended ones, find those burdens particularly 
constraining. Heightened levels of domestic violence and physical assaults in public places, 
coupled with a multifaceted denial of access to justice have been common complaints heard from 
women from marginalized minority communities. They also face blockages within their homes 
and communities that deny them a role in decision-making. In the larger society they are denied 
a voice in decisions of the national polity because they are women and because they are 
minorities.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. ACTIVITIES TO COOPERATE WITH EXISTING UNITED NATIONS 
BODIES, MANDATES, MECHANISMS AND REGIONAL  
ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>11. Article 9 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities reminds the specialized agencies and other organizations of 
the United Nations system that they are to contribute to the full realization of the rights and 
principles set forth in the Declaration within their respective fields. Additionally, the 
independent expert&#8217;s mandate requires her &#8220;to cooperate closely, while avoiding duplication, 
with existing relevant United Nations bodies, mandates, mechanisms as well as regional 
organizations&#8221;. In her initial report to the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human 
Rights, the independent expert said that in carrying out this aspect of her mandate, she &#8220;will 
explore possible means of collaboration with other United Nations bodies and specialized 
agencies whenever their work bears on her mandate. She will consult with these bodies to share 
information and strengthen understanding and capacity in regard to minority issues, as 
appropriate to their specialist fields of activity and programmes of work&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme:  
minorities, poverty and development processes 
</b></p>
<p>12. The independent expert has developed a fruitful collaboration with UNDP. Her first 
thematic report (A/HRC/4/9) was on minorities, poverty alleviation strategies and the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in which she stated that: &#8220;The poorest communities in 
almost any region tend to be minority communities that have been targets of long-standing 
discrimination, violence or exclusion. As such, poverty within minority communities must be 
viewed as both a cause and a manifestation of the diminished rights, opportunities, and social 
advancement available to the members of that community as a whole. Without a targeted focus 
on their needs and rights, they will remain disproportionately impoverished. And without a more 
coherent effort to reduce poverty through targeted strategies that specifically reach out to 
minority communities, the international community will fail to achieve, or sustain, the important 
targets set within the Millennium Development Goals.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>13. She concluded that more must be done in all regions to focus the development process 
sharply on the needs of minorities. In the report, she strongly encouraged States and international 
development actors &#8220;to share with her further information on positive practices undertaken to 
develop strong policies and technical cooperation initiatives on poverty reduction in 
communities of historically marginalized minority populations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. Pursuing her work in the area of poverty alleviation and realization of MDGs for 
minorities, the independent expert co-convened with UNDP in 2006 the consultation &#8220;UNDP&#8217;s 
Engagement with Minorities in Development Processes&#8221;. The co-conveners were the Democratic 
Governance Group of the Bureau for Development Policy (DGG/BDP) and the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The Consultation was to take stock of key 
issues, challenges, and gaps with regard to UNDP engagement with minorities in relevant 
practice areas and identify entry points that would help UNDP to better address issues related to 
minorities in development.<b>2</b> Following were the key conclusions and recommendations: 
</p>
<p> (a) Empirical research should be carried out to generate enhanced understanding of 
minorities, followed by capacity development support for UNDP staff and relevant partners;  
</p>
<p> (b) There is a lack of knowledge of the United Nations mechanisms related to minority 
issues, including the mandate of the independent expert, and of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities; 
</p>
<p> (c) There is need to undertake specific programmatic activities focusing on minority 
communities, grounded by clear policy and practical guidance for the staff of country offices, 
and to review ongoing projects and programmes with an intention to redefine target groups, and 
develop strategies for promoting non-discrimination, participation and transparency;  
</p>
<p> (d) As a longer term objective, a UNDP Guidance Note on Minorities in Development<b>3</b> 
would be useful, whilst a Resource Guide on Minorities in Development should be elaborated, as 
a medium-term objective.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Experiences of UNDP Nepal, Romania, Guatemala, Ecuador, Kenya, Regional Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Programme in the Asia Pacific, as well as the Regional Roma Initiatives in the CIS/CA 
regions were shared and further analysed. 
<b>3
</b>  A study commissioned by UNDP to suggest ways for more effective UNDP engagement with 
</p>
<p>national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, concluded, inter alia, that the existing 
policy/practice notes, such as the Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples (2001), UNDP 
and Civil Society Organizations: A Policy of Engagement (2001), Poverty Reduction and 
Human Rights (2003) and Human Rights in UNDP (2005), were not sufficient to address the 
particular concerns of the minorities and that enhanced attention to minority issues should be an 
essential component to promote inclusive development processes. The study recommended that 
developing a UNDP Policy Note on Minorities would be an important tool for country offices to 
start and/or to strengthen their work with minorities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>15. In 2008 the independent expert continued her collaboration with UNDP towards a UNDP 
Guidance/Policy note on minority issues. A UNDP Resource Guide on Minorities in 
Development was produced in cooperation with OHCHR and following extensive consultations 
with UNDP country offices and staff. A validation consultation on the draft UNDP Resource 
Guide on Minorities in Development was subsequently held on 2 and 3 December 2008 in 
New York to critically review the draft guide. The consultation also sought, inter alia, to share 
challenges and good practice in addressing minority issues in development, and to further 
enhance the inclusion of minority issues in UNDP programming. The guide will be finalized by 
mid-2009.  
</p>
<p>16. The primary target groups of the proposed Resource Guide are the UNDP country office 
practitioners and those with policy advisory responsibilities. However, it can also serve as a 
reference document for other United Nations agencies, government counterparts and other 
relevant partners. It is hoped that the final product will enable the target group(s) to understand 
the conceptual issues and fundamental principles relating to the promotion and protection of 
minorities, learn how to draw on the available international and regional standards to engage 
minorities in programming processes, influence policy choices, as well as increase their 
opportunities for meaningful participation and representation in development processes.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Collaboration with the Inter-Parliamentary Union/United Nations 
Development Programme on minorities and parliamentary  
representation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The independent expert has highlighted in her country and thematic work the importance 
of ensuring that minorities are represented in elected bodies at the national and local levels. As a 
member of the Advisory Group to the joint Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UNDP project 
entitled &#8220;Promoting Inclusive Parliaments: The representation of minorities and indigenous 
peoples in parliament&#8221;, the independent expert has contributed to the development of this 
ongoing project. This project builds on IPU&#8217;s long experience in working to promote 
inclusiveness in national parliaments, including promoting women&#8217;s political participation. The 
first phase of the project is to gather data on different aspects of inclusiveness in parliament 
including through a questionnaire survey sent to national parliamentary authorities, 
parliamentary party groups represented in national parliaments, and individual parliamentarians.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Collaboration with the Inter-Agency Working Group on Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>18. Under the auspices of the OHCHR Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Unit and the 
independent expert, the Inter-Agency Working Group on Minorities meets regularly to share 
information about ongoing initiatives relating to minorities. The Inter-Agency Working Group 
consists of the OHCHR, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNDP, UNESCO, OCHA, UNITAR, ILO, 
UNCTAD and WHO. A practical outcome of this inter-agency group has been an information 
note entitled &#8220;Towards Developing Country Engagement Strategies on Minorities&#8221;, which 
answers commonly asked questions regarding minorities and identifies possible elements that 
should be included in strategies to address the situation of minorities in United Nations country 
programmes. The Inter-Agency Group also offered practical opportunities for sharing of 
information and discussion including in regard to preparations for the inaugural Forum on 
Minority Issues.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Expert Meeting on Integration with Diversity in Policing 
</b></p>
<p>19. In her initial report the independent expert identified as a key thematic priority for her 
work: &#8220;to enhance understanding of minority issues in the context of promoting inclusion and 
stability&#8221;. In this context, and consistent with her dialogue with the Human Rights Council in 
March 2007, she is supporting work by the Indigenous and Minorities Unit of OHCHR in the 
area of policing in multi-ethnic societies. On 15 and 16 January 2008, she was co-organizer with 
OHCHR, ILO and UNODC of a global meeting on integration with diversity in policing, held in 
Vienna, which brought together experts in policing issues and diversity from every region. A 
summary report on the expert meeting was submitted to the Human Rights Council as document 
A/HRC/10/38/Add.1. 
</p>
<p><b>V. ACTIVITIES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VIEWS OF 
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>20. The independent expert places a high priority on her engagement with non-governmental 
organizations from all regions. She benefits greatly from the views and information provided by 
them in regard to all aspects of her work.  
</p>
<p>21. As part of her interaction with country and regional NGOs the independent expert attended 
the Regional Workshop on Minority Issues in Southeast Asia from 21 to 23 January 2008, held 
in Bangkok. The workshop was organized by the Asian Forum for Human Rights and 
Development (Forum-Asia) in cooperation with the International Movement Against All Forms 
of Discrimination and Racism (IMADR), and Minority Rights Group International (MRG). The 
workshop brought together some 30 representatives of minority communities and minority rights 
organizations in Southeast Asia engaged in the promotion and protection of minority rights. The 
objectives of the workshop included to promote awareness of the situations of minority groups in 
Southeast Asia; to identify issues and challenges in specific countries and the region as a whole; 
and to facilitate and strengthen networking among minority groups and human rights defenders 
working on minority issues in Southeast Asia.  
</p>
<p>22. The workshop was the first on the theme of minority issues to take place in the region. It 
considered minorities in the region in the context of numerous thematic issues including the right 
to culture; economic and development participation; health, education and the MDGs; political 
participation; and the situation of minority women. Country situation papers were presented on 
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. Concern was 
expressed by participants regarding the general situation of minorities and indigenous peoples in 
the Southeast Asia region. A statement issued by participating NGOs following the workshop 
made a number of recommendations to States in the region and highlighted a range of key 
challenges which include:  
</p>
<p> (a) Non-recognition of the diversity of ethnic, racial, religious and other identities within 
States in the region by national Governments;  
</p>
<p> (b) Laws and policies that discriminate against persons belonging to ethnic, national, 
religious or linguistic minorities, combined with the imposition of exclusivist national identities 
by States, often based on the ethnicity and identity of the ethnic majority;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Statelessness and the denial or deprivation of citizenship of ethnic minorities, despite 
residence for generations within present-day State territory, causing the denial of essential rights 
and services;  
</p>
<p> (d) Disadvantaged situations - poverty, non-participation, exclusion, marginalization - 
generally being experienced by minorities and indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p> (e) Lack of effective participation and representation in all stages of decision-making, as 
both an effect and cause of their already disadvantaged positions; 
</p>
<p> (f) The continuing serious situation faced by many minority women who face multiple 
discrimination, and the lack of integration of women and children&#8217;s concerns within existing 
national and international law and institutions that seek to address minority and indigenous 
issues;  
</p>
<p> (g) The need for effective State compliance with and domestic application of 
international human rights standards on minorities and indigenous peoples, including the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities. 
</p>
<p>23. All States in the region were urged by the workshop participants to ratify the major 
United Nations human rights treaties, including the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and comply with obligations including in regard to timely 
reporting to treaty bodies. States were further requested to commit to engage with OHCHR and 
special procedures mandate holders, including the independent expert on minority issues. 
Members of ASEAN were called upon to develop effective terms of reference for an ASEAN 
human rights body as mentioned in the ASEAN Charter signed at the 13th ASEAN Summit in 
Singapore on 20 November 2007, in accordance with international human rights standards, with 
full and meaningful participation by civil society and, in particular, representatives of minorities 
and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  FORUM ON MINORITY ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>24. In its resolution 6/15 of 28 September 2007, the Human Rights Council established a 
forum on minority issues, inter alia to provide a platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation 
on issues pertaining to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, as well as thematic 
contributions and expertise to the work of the independent expert on minority issues. The Forum 
is also required to identify and analyse best practices, challenges, opportunities and initiatives for 
the further implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p>25. Resolution 6/15 in paragraph 5 decided that &#8220;the independent expert on minority issues 
shall guide the work of the Forum and prepare its annual meetings&#8221;. Furthermore it requested the 
President of the Human Rights Council to appoint for each session, on the basis of regional 
rotation and in consultation with regional groups, a chairperson of the Forum among experts on 
minority issues, nominated by members and observers of the Council. In accordance with this 
requirement, the President of the Human Rights Council appointed Ms. Vikt&#243;ria Moh&#225;csi of 
Hungary and of Roma minority origin as the Chairperson of the first session of the Forum. The </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Chairperson is required to prepare &#8220;a summary of the discussion of the Forum, to be made 
available to all participants of the Forum&#8221;. The Chairperson is responsible for the preparation of 
a summary of the discussion of the Forum, which is available on the website of the Forum on 
Minority Issues.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>26. The inaugural session of the Forum took place on 15 and 16 December 2008 at the Palais 
des Nations in Geneva. The thematic focus of this first session of the Forum was &#8220;Minorities and 
the Right to Education&#8221;. The Forum was opened by the President of the Human Rights Council 
and opening remarks were made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
the independent expert and the Chairperson of the Forum.  
</p>
<p>27. The President of the Human Rights Council noted the Council&#8217;s willingness to provide a 
platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. This includes the sharing of best practices, 
challenges, opportunities and initiatives for the promotion of mutual understanding of minority 
issues. He stated that education is an issue which engages us all as we strive to promote and 
protect the rights of children from all communities, especially the most disadvantaged.  
</p>
<p>28. The High Commissioner for Human Rights reflected that her personal and professional 
experience had led her to emphasize that education is both a human right in itself, as well as an 
indispensable instrument for achieving many other rights, whether civil, cultural, economic, 
political, or social. However, persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities disproportionately suffer the brunt of educational exclusion and are least integrated 
into national education systems, she stated. Members of minority groups all over the world face 
barriers in accessing education equally, including the lack of mother-tongue education; poor 
provision of schools and qualified teachers in the regions where they live; prohibitive costs of 
school fees that disproportionately affect them as the poorest groups; and curricula that do not 
reflect community priorities for learning. 
</p>
<p>29. In her opening remarks, the independent expert stated that education is a fundamental 
human right of every man, woman and child. And yet in all regions of the world minority 
children suffer disproportionately from unequal access to quality education. Failure to ensure 
equal opportunities and equal access to education robs people of their full human potential and 
their ability to contribute fully to their own communities and to the wider society. Education 
provides a gateway to the full enjoyment of a wide array of other rights, without which 
individuals and societies remain economically, socially and culturally impoverished. Lack of 
access to education perpetuates the cycle of poverty that is experienced most acutely by minority 
communities facing discrimination and exclusion. Conversely, education provides a vital key to 
sustainable poverty alleviation. Ensuring equal access to education is one of the most serious 
challenges for minorities and States alike. 
</p>
<p>30. Equal access to education must be understood in the holistic sense of the rights to 
non-discrimination and equality. Minorities often face systematic discrimination which creates 
blockages to their full enjoyment of their rights, including their right to education. To fully

 <p> 
</p>
<p>protect the right to education for those who have been subjected to historical systematic 
discrimination, we must go beyond issues of physical or economic accessibility to focus on the 
ultimate goal of equal access to quality education and to equal achievement outcomes. 
Disproportionate educational outcomes along racial, ethnic or religious lines must be considered 
evidence of discrimination that implicates State responsibility for the promotion and protection 
of these rights.  
</p>
<p>31. The Durban Programme of Action urged States &#8220;to ensure equal access to education for all 
in law and in practice, and to refrain from any legal or any other measures leading to imposed 
racial segregation in any form in access to schooling&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. We have also learned that enforced segregated schools not only violates the rights of 
minorities but also robs the entire society of its best opportunity to foster social cohesion and 
respect for a diversity of views and experiences. 
</p>
<p>33. As required in resolution 6/15, the Forum achieved the active participation of 
representatives of Member States, United Nations mechanisms, bodies and specialized agencies, 
funds and programmes, intergovernmental organizations, regional organizations and mechanisms 
in the field of human rights, national human rights institutions and other relevant national bodies, 
academics and experts on minority issues, and NGOs. Over 370 individuals were accredited 
from all categories to participate in the Forum, including delegates from over 40 States, 
including several participants at ministerial and ambassador level. Some 90 NGOs were 
represented.  
</p>
<p>34. The views of experts and participants from minority communities were given a particularly 
high priority within the proceedings of the Forum. Several experts from each region were 
identified on the basis of criteria including their belonging to a minority group and their 
professional expertise in the field of education, particularly as it interfaces with the rights and 
experiences of minorities. Valuable insights were provided from such experts with professional 
and practical experience in working to promote equality in education and in the design and 
delivery of education solutions to address the needs of minorities.   
</p>
<p>35. Paragraph 6 of resolution 6/15 expresses the expectation that the Forum will contribute to 
the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to improve cooperation 
among United Nations mechanisms, bodies and specialized agencies, funds and programmes on 
activities related to the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities, 
including at regional level. Equally, the mandate of the independent expert requires her to 
cooperate closely, while avoiding duplication, with existing relevant United Nations bodies, 
mandates, and mechanisms. In view of these provisions, the independent expert engaged fully 
with such institutions early in her preparations in order to solicit their cooperation and 
substantive contributions.  
</p>
<p>36. She wishes to thank the following special rapporteurs and members of treaty bodies 
for their participation and contributions to the Forum, and welcomes their continued 
engagement: Mr. Vernor Munoz Villalobos, Special Rapporteur on the right to education; 
Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam, expert member of the Committee on Migrant Workers; 
Ms. Helen Keller, expert member of the Human Rights Committee; Mr. Lothar Krappmann, 
expert member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child; Mr. Jos&#233; Molintas, expert member </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Ms. Dubravka &#352;imonovic, chair 
and expert member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; 
Mr. Patrick Thornberry, expert member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination; Ms. Barbara Wilson, expert member of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights; and Ms. Mona Zulficar, expert member of the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee.  
</p>
<p>37. The independent expert will seek to continue and to enhance her consultation and 
cooperation with the chairs and expert members of relevant treaty bodies. She welcomes future 
opportunities to identify possibilities and modalities through which the recommendations of the 
Forum may become most useful to the work of treaty bodies, taking into account their 
established processes and working practices. The independent expert wishes to engage the treaty 
bodies including in regard to the extent to which the recommendations may benefit States and 
committees in regard to State reporting on issues relevant to minorities and the right to 
education.  
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert greatly welcomes and values the substantive engagement and 
participation of United Nations specialized agencies in the Forum, including UNESCO, 
UNICEF and UNDP. The Forum benefited in particular from the close collaboration of the 
independent expert with UNESCO, which in cooperation with the Organisation internationale 
pour le droit &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation et la libert&#233; de l&#8217;enseignement (OIDEL), held a thematic debate on 
&#8220;Overcoming Inequalities in Education: the Importance of Inclusion&#8221; as a side event for Forum 
participants during which they presented conclusions and recommendations of an international 
conference held on 25 November 2008 on the subject of inclusive education. The independent 
expert expects that substantive collaboration with relevant specialized agencies will continue to 
attract increased attention to minorities and the right to education within the scope of their work. 
The substantive engagement of specialized agencies in the shaping of the recommendations of 
the Forum will help to ensure that they are meaningful to their ongoing activities in the field. 
</p>
<p>39. The mandate of the independent expert requires her to cooperate closely, while avoiding 
duplication, with regional organizations. She therefore notes with appreciation the engagement 
and participation in the Forum of representatives of regional organizations including: the 
African Union, the Council of Europe Secretariat of the Framework Convention for the 
Protection of National Minorities, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the OSCE 
High Commissioner on National Minorities. She notes the attention paid by these regional 
intergovernmental organizations to minority issues and the education rights of minorities. She 
greatly values the regional perspectives which they contributed. In addition, she welcomes the 
participation of representatives of national human rights institutions who were accredited 
participants, including those of Fiji, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Southern Sudan, Sweden, 
and Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>40. On the basis of the provisions of resolution 6/15 and in the wider context of promoting 
implementation of the Declaration in all regions, the focus of discussions was broadly based 
around three core elements: identification of challenges and problems facing minorities and 
States; identification of good practices in relation to minorities and education; and consideration 
of opportunities, initiatives and solutions. A set of draft recommendations was prepared and 
circulated prior to the Forum. The draft recommendations were developed in collaboration with 
Patrick Thornberry who was formally appointed as Rapporteur of the Forum. The draft further </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>benefited from information, surveys and studies received by the independent expert. Participants 
were invited to target their contributions towards developing, improving and refining the draft as 
the subsequent outcome recommendations document.  
</p>
<p>41. Pursuant to the requirement for the independent expert to include in her report to the 
Human Rights Council thematic recommendations of the Forum, a series of recommendations 
emerged from the proceedings (see A/HRC/10/11/Add.1). The recommendations are intended 
for a wide readership of not only Governments but also international organizations and agencies, 
civil society, all educators and those who learn from them. They are phrased in broad terms with 
a view to their effective implementation in countries with diverse historical, cultural and 
religious backgrounds, with full respect for universal human rights. The range of issues included 
in the recommendations is not exhaustive. They represent only minimum requirements for an 
effective education strategy for minorities, without prejudice to further efforts made by 
individual States to address the needs of individuals and groups concerned. They should be 
interpreted in a generous spirit in cooperation with the communities, in the light of the demand 
that human rights instruments be interpreted and standards applied to be effective in practice, so 
that they can make a real difference to the lives of human beings.  
</p>
<p>42. Resolution 6/15 invites the independent expert to include in her annual report 
recommendations for future thematic subjects, for consideration by the Human Rights Council. 
Further to her consultations and taking into account the views of a variety of stakeholders, issues 
which are envisaged as future thematic subjects of the Forum by the independent expert include: 
minorities and political participation; minorities and the media; and minorities and development 
processes.
