The following Statement of Reserve Data and Other Oil and Gas Information (“51-101F1 Report”) by 
Heritage Oil Limited and Heritage Oil Corporation (collectively, “Heritage”) is an amended and restated 
version of Heritage’s 51-101F1 Report dated April 30, 2008.  This version of the 51-101F1 Report addresses 
and clarifies certain information required by applicable securities legislation.  In management’s view, these 
changes are not material.  The changes include: clarification of certain definitions and abbreviations; breaking 
out proved reserves and proved undeveloped reserves in the summary oil and gas reserves tables; additional 
narrative concerning the funding of Heritage’s property development; breaking out exploration costs and 
developments costs for proved and unproved properties for the table entitled “Costs Incurred During 2007”; 
and similar other non-material changes.

HERITAGE OIL LIMITED 
HERITAGE OIL CORPORATION
STATEMENT OF RESERVE DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
FORM 51-101F1
DATED APRIL 30, 2008
RPS Energy Ltd. (“RPS”) has evaluated the proved and probable reserves of Heritage Oil Limited and 
Heritage Oil Corporation (collectively, “Heritage”) effective December 31, 2007 (the “RPS Report”). The 
final preparation date of the information herein was April 23, 2008.
The following cautionary statements are specifically required by NI 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil 
and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”) and apply to each of the disclosure contained in this document.

Estimates  of  future  net  revenue  used  in  calculating  discounted  and  undiscounted  NPV  do  not 
represent fair market value.
Due  to  the  effects  of  aggregation,  estimates  of  reserves  and  future  net  revenues  for  individual 
properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenues 
for all properties.
A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel has been used. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if 
used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel is based on an energy equivalency 
conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency 
at the wellhead.
The aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and 
the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total 
finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year.
The following tables, based on the RPS evaluation, summarize the oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves 
attributable to oil and natural gas interests of Heritage and the present value of future net revenue for such 
reserves using forecast price assumptions and costs. Unless otherwise noted, all evaluations of future net 
production  revenue  set  forth  in  the  tables  are  stated  prior  to  the  provision  for  income  taxes,  but  after 
overriding and lessor royalties, Crown royalties, freehold royalties, mineral taxes, direct lifting costs, normal 
allocated overhead and future investments. It should not be assumed that the discounted future net production 
revenues estimated by the RPS evaluation represent the fair market value of the reserves. Other assumptions 
and qualifications relating to costs, prices for future production and other matters are included in the RPS 
evaluation. There is no assurance that the future price and cost assumptions used in the RPS evaluation will 
prove accurate and variances could be material.
Except for statements of historical fact, all statements in this news release - including, without limitation, 
statements regarding production estimates and future plans and objectives of Heritage – constitute forward-
looking  information  that  involve  various  risks  and  uncertainties.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  such 
statements will prove to be accurate; actual results and future events could differ materially from those 
anticipated in such statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated 
results  include  risks  and  uncertainties  such  as:  risks  relating  to  estimates  of  reserves  and  recoveries; 
production  and  operating  cost  assumptions;  development  risks  and  costs;  the  risk  of  commodity  price 
fluctuations; political and regulatory risks; and other risks and uncertainties as disclosed under the heading 
"Risk Factors" in its annual report, its Prospectus and elsewhere in Heritage documents filed from time-to-
time  with  the  London  Stock  Exchange  and  other  regulatory  authorities.  Further,  any  forward-looking
- 3 -
information is made only as of a certain date and Heritage undertakes no obligation to update any forward-
looking information or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is 
made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required by applicable securities 
laws. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management of Heritage to predict all 
of these factors and to assess in advance the impact of each such factor on Heritage's business or the extent to 
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained 
in any forward-looking information. 
 
The disclosure set out under the heading “Review of Operations” in Heritage’s annual report for the year 
ended December 31, 2007, relating to Heritage’s oil and gas activities and as filed on SEDAR, is hereby 
incorporated by reference into this document.
Unless otherwise indicated, references herein to “$” or “dollars” are to United States dollars.

Inflation rates for forecasting prices and costs is 2% per annum. 
The above forecast prices assumptions were made by RPS. 
Condensate and LPG are included in natural gas liquids reserves in the tables above.

FORECAST PRICES AND COSTS
Average  prices received in 2007 were $22.47 per bbl for oil sales in Russia, $65.77 per bbl for condensate sales in Oman and $20.36 per bbl for 
LPG sales in Oman. The West Bukha field had not commenced production in 2007.

The source of funding for future development costs of the reserves of Heritage will be derived from, inter alia, 
new credit facilities, reinvesting its funds from operations, using its existing treasury resources, disposal 
proceeds  from  the  sale  of  non-core  assets  and,  when  considered  appropriate,  issuing  debt  and  equity 
securities. Management does not anticipate that the costs of funding referred to above will materially affect 
the disclosed reserves and future net revenues of Heritage or will make the development of any of the 
properties of Heritage uneconomic.
