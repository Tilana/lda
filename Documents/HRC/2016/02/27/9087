<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the 
Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102. It presents updated information on the activities of 
the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and in particular the 
recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund at its twenty-ninth session, held 
in Geneva from 13 to 17 October 2008. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights approved the recommendations on behalf of the Secretary-General. The present note will 
be complemented by the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Fund, to be 
submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, detailing the outcomes of the 
twenty-ninth and thirtieth sessions of the Board of Trustees. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and individuals. In accordance with the practice established by its Board of 
Trustees in 1982, the Fund provides grants to non-governmental organizations that submit 
projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian or other 
forms of assistance to torture victims and their relatives. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of the Board of Trustees, 
composed of five members acting in a personal capacity and appointed by the Secretary-General 
with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in consultation with their 
Governments. In October 2008, the Secretary-General reappointed: Krassimir Kanev (Bulgaria), 
Savitri Goonesekere (Sri Lanka), Joseph Oloka-Onyango (Uganda) and Derrick Pounder 
(United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) for a final period of three years, and 
appointed Mercedes Doretti (Argentina) for a three-year term, renewable once. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>4. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the guidelines of the Fund. They require a 
project to be presented by a non-governmental organization. The beneficiaries must be direct 
victims of torture and/or direct family members. Priority is given to projects providing direct 
assistance to torture victims, which could consist in medical or psychological assistance, help 
with social or financial reintegration through vocational training for victims, legal assistance for 
victims or members of their families seeking redress or for processing asylum-seekers&#8217; claims. 
Depending on the funds available, the Fund may finance projects to organize training 
programmes, seminars or conferences to allow health-care professionals or other service 
providers to exchange best practices. However, grant requests for projects involving 
investigation, research, studies, publications or similar activities are not admissible. The Fund 
can provide emergency assistance to individuals in countries where no project is receiving 
support. This type of request is examined according to a specific procedure outlined in the 
guidelines.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>

<p>6. The amount available for distribution to projects was calculated after deducting 
programme support costs, operating cash reserve and expenditure for non-grant activities from 
the total amount of funds made available in the form of contributions received between the 
twenty-seventh session of the Board of Trustees, held in October 2007, and the twenty-ninth 
session of the Board, held in October 2008, and the operating cash reserve of the previous cycle. 
</p>
<p>7. In accordance with United Nations financial regulations, programme support costs will be 
charged to the Trust Fund at the rate of 13 per cent of total annual expenditure. In addition, the 
United Nations requires that an operating cash reserve of 15 per cent of annual estimated 
expenditure be maintained to cover exchange rate fluctuation, any shortfalls and to meet final 
expenditure, including any liquidating liabilities. The operating cash reserve will be left 
unallotted and carried forward from year to year, until required. Expenditure for non-grant 
activities include travel expenditure for Board members, expenditure for monitoring and 
evaluation of projects by United Nations staff and technical assistance for the further 
development of the grant management system.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations adopted by the Board  
</b></p>
<p>8. At its twenty-ninth session, the Board of Trustees made recommendations for grants for the 
period from January to December 2009 for 195 projects in more than 65 countries, for a total 
amount of $10,200,950, after deduction of the programme support cost and the operating cash 
reserve. The High Commissioner for Human Rights approved the recommendations 
on 27 October 2008 on behalf of the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>9. In spite of the limited resources available, and in accordance with recommendation 3 of the 
Office of Internal Oversight Services on the evaluation of the Fund (E/CN.4/2005/55, para. 76), 
the Board continued its practice of financing training and seminars, thus allowing health 
professionals, social workers, lawyers and other service providers to exchange experiences and 
develop new strategies to address the needs of torture victims. The Board recommended an 
allocation of $136,400 to nine organizations for training sessions to be organized in seven 
countries in 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. The Board reviewed information prepared by its secretariat concerning 225 projects, 
including the analysis of narrative, financial and audit reports on the use of grants paid in 
previous years. It considered requests for new grants amounting to $15,265,197 for more 
than 197 ongoing and 28 new projects to be implemented in 2009.  
</p><p>11. The Board recommended that $9,694,550 be paid in January 2009 and $506,400 be 
disbursed after its thirtieth session in February 2009, upon receipt of satisfactory information by 
applicants. In addition, in accordance with the guidelines of the Fund, the Board decided to 
maintain for 2009 the remainder of the amount set aside in 2008 to finance projects, in priority 
regions, identified by OHCHR field presences during the intersession period.  
</p>
<p>12. Further information on the activities of the Fund, including detailed information on, 
inter alia, the distribution of grants by region, policy decisions, meetings of the Board with 
Member States and relevant actors in the field of assistance to victims of torture will be available 
after the thirtieth session of the Board, to be held in February 2009.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  ESTIMATED NEEDS FOR 2010 
</b></p>
<p>13. On the basis of the requests received for 2009, it is expected that approximately 
$16 million will be requested by organizations for 2010.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The Board strongly encourages Governments that have not yet contributed to the 
Fund to do so, preferably before September 2009.
