Cypress Energy Partners, L.P. Announces Second Quarter Results
TULSA, Oklahoma.--(BUSINESS WIRE)—August 11, 2016
Cypress Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:CELP) today reported:
●
●Cash Distribution of $4.8 million to Unit Holders maintained at $0.406413 per unit,
approximately 5% above the target minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3875 per unit.
Our GP and sponsor continued temporary financial support with relief of the quarterly $1.0
million administrative fee paid pursuant to our omnibus agreement consistent with first quarter
of 2016, as well as additional temporary support of $2.0 million in expense reimbursements to
support the coverage of the current distribution level.
 ●Completion of additional $500 thousand in annual cost reductions above the $5.0 million in
annual reductions disclosed in May.
 ●$23.6 million of cash on hand as of June 30, 2016.
 ●3.33x leverage ratio per loan covenants compared to facility limit of 4.0x.
Peter C. Boylan III, CELP’s Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Today we announced
our second quarter 2016 operating performance, and that we maintained and will pay tomorrow
our distribution at a rate of $0.406413 per unit, consistent with the same distribution per unit the
last seven quarters, despite the continued challenging environment in the energy industry. The
second quarter’s performance was essentially flat compared to our first quarter and all segments
continued to grow at a weaker rate than we had previously expected. Fortunately, CELP’s
businesses do not require substantial capital expenditures and we again finished the quarter with
a solid balance sheet and approximately $24 million of cash. Approximately 50% of our limited
partner units remain in subordination and therefore protect common unitholders who have the
right to receive available cash up to the minimum quarterly distribution first before the
subordinated unitholders would receive any cash distribution. The subordination period will
expire, at the earliest, upon payment of the distribution for the period ending December 31, 2016.”
Mr. Boylan continued, “Our sponsor, Cypress Energy Holdings, LLC (“CEH”), and its affiliates
who control our general partner are aligned with our common unitholders, with an approximate
65% ownership interest in CELP. As a result of this alignment, CEH has again stepped forward
in support of the unitholders with temporary relief of the administrative fee paid to CEH pursuant
to the Omnibus Agreement, which would have charged $1.0 million to CELP this quarter absent
the relief, as well as contributing $2.0 million in cash to the MLP to reimburse for certain
expenditures. Consistent with the Omnibus Agreement relief provided last quarter, this additional
temporary relief from the sponsor did not require any additional consideration from CELP. Some
form of temporary relief will likely continue until the end of 2016 or such earlier time that our
business results improve, as determined by CEH. CEH is not committing to support CELP
beyond 2016 if the energy downturn continues and if CELP’s fundamental performance does not
improve the board will re-evaluate the current distribution policy.”
Mr. Boylan continued, “As discussed in May, we have taken steps to reduce our cost structure
and protect liquidity during this continued downturn which totaled approximately $5 million in
annual cost savings. These actions contributed to sequential improvement in the last month of
the second quarter and should continue to impact future periods. In July, based upon a continued
evaluation of our Water and Environmental Services segment we temporarily shut down one
additional facility, made plans to temporarily close another facility, and spent approximately $0.2
million on enhancing the automation capabilities of the remaining facilities. This automation
investment should drive an additional $0.5 million of annual cost out of this segment primarily
through labor and staffing reductions. I would also like to thank our dedicated employees for their
hard work, sacrifices, and completing another quarter with excellent safety.”
In conclusion Mr. Boylan commented, “Pipeline inspection and integrity services are federally
mandated essential services to protect our nation’s critical energy infrastructure which now
represent approximately 97% of our revenue. Additional state regulations like those
contemplated in California are generally additive to the federal rules. The new proposed DOT
PHMSA and California rules should materially benefit our business if enacted. Our team
continues to focus on organic growth opportunities with our customer relationships, as well as
acquisitions. We continue to win new customers and business that will benefit us in coming
periods. We also continue to look at a number of acquisition opportunities and CEH is prepared
to assist CELP in acquiring attractive assets that may be bigger than what CELP can currently
afford on its own with plans to offer those assets to CELP as drop down opportunities over time.
CELP is not currently evaluating any opportunities that would require material dilutive equity
issuances.”
Second Quarter:
Revenue of $72.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $91.0
million in the same period of 2015 as a result of fewer inspectors, and project delays or
cancellations. Results were essentially flat to the $73.5 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2016.
Gross margin of $7.4 million or 10.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$10.8 million or 11.8% in the same period a year ago and $7.8 million or 10.6% for the three
months ended March 31, 2016.
We recorded an asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to the carrying value of a
saltwater disposal facility in North Dakota. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$8.4 million related to our Integrity Services segment.
Net loss of $11.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 (which includes
impairments of $10.5 million), compared to net income of $1.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Current period results also include $0.3 million in severance and
termination costs associated with the cost savings measures executed in May 2016. Net loss
was $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Net loss attributable to CELP limited partners of $4.0 million for the three months ended June
30, 2016 (which includes impairments of $6.4 million), compared to net income of $2.1 million
for the same period of 2015 and a net loss of $26 thousand for the three months ended March
31, 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 (including non-
controlling interests and amounts attributable to our general partner) compared to $5.4 million
for the same period of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners of $5.5 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited
partners of $5.3 million for the same period of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
attributable to limited partners were $3.1 million and $3.2 million respectively for the period
ended March 31, 2016.
Distributable Cash Flow of $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$3.5 million for the same period of 2015 and $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31,
2016.
A common unit coverage ratio of 1.45x and a coverage ratio of 0.73x compared to the Q1 2016
coverage ratio of 0.38x. The improvement in common unit coverage is largely driven by the
additional $2.0 million of sponsor financial support.
A leverage ratio of approximately 3.33x compared to a 4.0x covenant limit and an interest
coverage ratio of 3.80x compared to a 3.0x covenant requirement on June 30, 2016 pursuant to
the terms of our credit facilities.

Year To Date:
●
●Revenue of $145.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, down 21.2% from the same
period in the prior year.
Net loss of $13.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (which includes impairments
of $10.5 million), compared to net income of $4.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015.
Net loss attributable to limited partners of $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
(which includes impairments of $6.4 million), compared to net income of $4.8 million for the
●
●
same period in the prior year.
 ●Net cash provided by operating activities of $11.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $20.7 million for the same period in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (including non-
controlling interests and amounts attributable to our general partner), compared to $11.0 million
for the same period in the prior year down 42.5%.
 ●Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners of $8.7 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016, compared to $10.4 million for the same period in the prior year down 15.8%.
 ●Distributable Cash Flow of $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, down 32.4%
from the same period in the prior year.
Highlights include:
●
●We averaged 1,134 inspectors per week for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 1,367 in
the same period of 2015 and 1,130 in the first quarter of 2016.
We disposed 3.3 million barrels of saltwater at an average revenue per barrel of $0.66 for the
second quarter of 2016, compared with disposing 5.2 million barrels of saltwater at an average
revenue per barrel of $0.77 for the second quarter of 2015 and 3.7 million barrels of saltwater at
an average revenue per barrel of $0.68 for the first quarter of 2016.
Maintenance capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $51
thousand, reflecting the limited maintenance capital expenditures required to operate our
businesses.
Our expansion capital expenditures during the second quarter of $91 thousand were related to
our continued expansions in Pipeline Integrity services to purchase new NDE technology to
serve a new investment-grade client.
●
●
Looking forward:
California is also now proposing new additional rules and requirements regarding inspection of
energy infrastructure. Gas pipeline safety regulations proposed by the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) included a
550 page notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the pipeline safety regulations for onshore
gas transmission and gathering pipelines. Essentially, the proposal would broaden the scope
of monitoring, testing and repairing pipes as well as the types of assets subject to protocols. In
●
●
●
●
●
●
addition to expanding the coverage to gathering pipelines, PHMSA is also proposing to delete
the “grandfather clause” and require all gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 be
subjected to a hydrostatic spike pressure test. Currently, pipes built before 1970 are exempted
from certain pipeline safety regulations (e.g. a requirement to pressure test the pipeline / verify
its integrity to establish maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP)). This could involve a
significant increase in testing as approximately 60% of total U.S. natural gas pipelines were
installed before 1970, according to a study commissioned by The INGAA Foundation, Inc.
Additionally, PHMSA would like to expand protocols to include pipelines located in areas of
medium population density or Moderate Consequence Area (MCAs). If passed, this would
likely require integrity management, material documentation verification as well as MAOP
verification for pipes in these areas. PHMSA estimates that approximately 41,000 miles of MCA
pipe would require an assessment within 15 years under this proposed rule.
To date, we have seen some growth in our average inspector headcounts from the averages
experienced in the second quarter of 2016 with the latest July average headcounts at 1,228.
We have also seen some growth in technician headcounts in our non-destructive examination
service offering which provides stronger margins than our typical inspection business and we
also have seen growth in our inline inspection service offering. We also continue to renew
several sizeable existing contracts and are bidding on some major new contracts.
During the second quarter, approximately 95% of total water volumes came from produced
water, and piped water represented approximately 44% of total water volumes. When
commodity prices improve and drilling activity increases, we expect to have significant
operating leverage with our cost structure and minimal maintenance capital expenditure
requirements as volumes increase. We have 534 drilled and uncompleted wells (“DUC’s”)
within a 15 mile radius of our facilities comprised of 392 in North Dakota and 142 in the
Permian. As prices improve, we expect to benefit from the completion of these DUC’s.
We continue to work collaboratively with our customers to help them address the downturn in
commodity prices and their need to reduce operating expenses until prices recover. We also
continue to carefully evaluate market pricing on a facility-by-facility basis. In response to these
conditions we temporarily shut in one additional facility in Q2, and another in Q3 and have
deployed additional automation technology at each of our remaining facilities. These steps
along with other steps taken to right-size our costs related to the Water & Environmental
Services business should lead to approximately $0.5 million of additional savings on an
annualized basis above the $1.0 million in previously announced savings in this segment.
Our Integrity Services business Q2 2016 results continued to be soft through mid-June with
project start date delays and toward the end of June we saw a material uptick in activity and
utilization in this segment. We have also lowered our bid margins to support our customers and
meet the competition. Our backlog remains solid going into Q3 and we continue to bid on a
substantial amount of work.
Our general partner also continues to support substantial costs associated with the new ERP
implementation that should benefit CELP with additional cost efficiencies as the project is
completed by year end. We have completed the implementation of the new financial system,
payroll system, and are in the final stages of completing the HRIS time and attendance capture
capabilities.
We continue to evaluate a number of acquisition opportunities including some very large
●
We continue to evaluate a number of acquisition opportunities including some very large
transformational opportunities that would need to initially occur at CEH with the expectation
that they would be offered to CELP in the future as a drop-down opportunity.
CELP will file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2016 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission later today. CELP will also post a copy of the Form 10-
Q on its website at www.cypressenergy.com.
CELP will host an earnings call on Friday, August 12, 2016, at 11:00am EDT (10:00am CDT) to
discuss its second quarter 2016 financial results. Analysts, investors, and other interested parties
may access the conference call by dialing Toll-Free (US & Canada): (888) 567-1602 or
International Dial-In (Toll): (862) 255-5346. An archived audio replay of the call will be available
on the investor section of our website at www.cypressenergy.com beginning at 10:00am EDT
(9:00am CDT) on August 16, 2016.
Non-GAAP Measures:
CELP defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation and
amortization expenses, income tax expenses, impairments, offering costs, non-cash allocated
expenses and equity based compensation. CELP defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to
limited partners as net income (loss) attributable to limited partners, plus interest expense
attributable to limited partners, depreciation, amortization and accretion attributable to limited
partners, impairments, income tax expense attributable to limited partners and equity based
compensation attributable to limited partners. CELP defines Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted
EBITDA attributable to limited partners excluding cash interest paid, cash income taxes paid and
maintenance capital expenditures. These are supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures used
by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and
commercial banks, to assess our operating performance as compared to those of other
companies in the midstream sector, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or
capital structure; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to
our unitholders; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the
viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of
various investment opportunities. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners, and Distributable Cash Flow are net
income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities, respectively.  These non-GAAP measures
should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an
alternative to net income, income before income taxes, net income attributable to limited partners,
cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in
accordance with GAAP as those items are used to measure operating performance, liquidity or
the ability to service debt obligations. CELP believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow will provide useful
information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. CELP uses
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow
as a supplemental financial measure to both manage our business and assess the cash flows
generated by our assets (prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the general
partner) to fund the cash distributions we expect to pay to unitholders, to evaluate our success in
providing a cash return on investment and whether or not the Partnership is generating cash flow
at a level that can sustain or support an increase in its quarterly distribution rates and to
determine the yield of our units, which is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment
community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships, as the value of a unit is generally
determined by a unit’s yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity
pays to a unitholder). Because adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited
partners and Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our
industry, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners
and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other
companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Reconciliations of (i) Adjusted EBITDA to net
income, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to limited partners and Distributable Cash Flow to net
income attributable to limited partners and (iii) Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by
operating activities are shown below.
