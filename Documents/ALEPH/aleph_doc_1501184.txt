MANAGING DIRECTOR’S ADDRESS
“I  am  pleased  to  report  that  exploration  success  has  driven  the  decision  to  expand  our  Co-O  mine  and
mill.  Hence  this  financial  year  is  a  year  of  transition,  from  a  100,000  ounce  per  year  operation  in  the
previous  year,  to  approximately  75,000  ounces  this  financial  year  while  the  expansions  to  the  haulage
capacity from underground are completed, and accelerated development is prioritised.
New, large scale haulage in the form of the Saga Shaft commenced in January 2011. Progress has been
good,  and  we  anticipate  the  shaft  will  be  fully  operational  from  350  metres  below  surface  in  the  last
quarter  of  calendar  year  2012.  Recent  re-optimisation  recommended  sinking  directly  to  its  final  depth,
which will then allow us to develop more levels ahead of increased production and to stockpile ore ahead
of  the  new  mill  commencing  operation  in  mid  calendar  year  2013.  This  is  the  first  major  shaft  the
Company has sunk, and the expertise gained from this will serve us well for the sinking of future shafts.
Continuing  exploration  success  to  the  east  of  the  Agsao  Shaft  has  driven  us  to  begin  preparations  for
another  deep  shaft  in  this  area,  initially  to  approximately  750  metres,  but  possibly  to  a  final  depth  of
approximately  1,000  metres.  Geotechnical  drilling  to  test  the  ground  conditions  in  this  area  are  in
progress.  This  will  be  a  major  undertaking  for  the  Company  and  will  cement  the  long  term  future  of
production from Co-O.
At the mill we have commenced construction, and our long lead time equipment has started to arrive on
site. We anticipate that all items will be delivered on schedule. Initially we are focussing on upgrading the
wet  circuit  being  the  leach  tanks,  elution  circuit  and  the  thickener,  and  installing  a  detoxification  unit  to
ensure our tailings are benign when discharged to the tailings dam.
The construction of a number of buildings is also in progress.  At the mine we are constructing additional
accommodation,  and  at  the  mill,  a  new  administration  building  and  senior  staff  accommodation.  The
current laboratory is being upgraded and expanded, and the building of a new geology division office and
a central core farm (that will house the 120 kilometres of core drilled each year, including core drilled to
date)  are  in  progress.  A  new  maintenance  workshop  for  trucks  and  heavy  equipment  will  also  be
constructed.
It  is  always  difficult  to  expand  and  produce  at  the  same  time.  However  with  the  team  we  have  on  site
assisted  by  our  consultants,  we  are  confident  we  will  achieve  our  timelines  for  the  Co-O  expansion,
barring interference from the weather.
At the Bananghilig Deposit, drilling is continuing with emphasis on converting the historic 650,000 Inferred
resource  ounces  and  additional  Inferred  resources  ounces  to  the  Indicated  category.  The  aim  is  to
achieve an initial reserve of approximately 1 million ounces for a 200,000 ounce per year operation.
Our growth plans remain intact and are progressing steadily forward. This year promises to be an exciting
year  as  we  move  the  Co-O  Mine  construction  forward  to  completion,  and  we  look  forward  to  providing
updates as milestones are reached.”

HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO 31 DECEMBER 2011:
Financials
Revenues  of  US$40.9  million  compared  to  US$78.3  million  for  the  corresponding  period  in  the
previous  year,  due  to  decreased  gold  production  as  a  result  of  planned  mine  expansion  and
development,  partially  offset  by  a  higher  average  price  received  on  sale  of  gold.  Medusa  is  an  un-
hedged  gold  producer  and  received  an  average  gold  price  of  US$1,655  per  ounce  from  the  sale  of
25,446 ounces of gold for the half-year to December 2011 (corresponding period to December 2010:
48,883 ounces at US$1,291 per ounce);
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) of US$28.4 million, (US$63.3
million in the prior corresponding period);
Earnings per share (“EPS”) of US$0.127 on a weighted average basis is based on NPAT of US$24.0
million (six months to December 2010: EPS of US$0.310 based on NPAT of US$58.1 million);
The  Company  remains  debt  free  and  had  total  cash,  cash  equivalent  in  gold  on  metal  account  and
bullion  on  hand  of  US$80.2  million  at  31  December  2011  (corresponding  period  to  31  December
2010: US$87.2 million).

Net of development costs and includes royalties and local business taxes but no by-product credits.
Gold production for the six months to 31 December 2011 was 26,780 ounces of gold at an average grade 
of 8.10 g/t gold was below last year’s production of 51,127 ounces of gold at recovered grades averaging 
14.28 g/t gold.
The  average  cash  costs  of  US$261  per  ounce,  inclusive  of  royalties  and  local  business  taxes  is  higher 
than  the  previous  period’s  average  cash  costs  of  US$186  per  ounce,  primarily  due  to  reduced  gold 
production.
Medusa,  an  un-hedged  gold  producer,  sold  25,446  ounces of gold at an average price of US$1,655 per 
ounce  during  the  period  (corresponding  period  last  year  48,883  at  average  price  received  of  US$1,291 
per ounce).
The forecast gold production for the fiscal year to 30 June 2012, following production of 26,780 ounces of 
gold  for  the  half  year  to  December  2011  has  been  revised  to  75,000  ounces  at  forecasted  cash  costs 
circa US$230 per ounce.

Co-O MINE and MILL
Mine
Mine development and expansion involves
The sinking of the Saga Shaft is at 210 metres as reported on 30 January 2012. Following a review 
during  the  December  quarter  and  re-optimisation,  the  shaft  will  now  be  sunk  directly  to  Level  8 
(approximately  350  metres  below  surface)  which  will  be  the  only  haulage  level  for  the  Saga  Shaft. 
The  current  mine  shaft  haulage  capacity  is  sufficient  for  the  current  mill  capacity  of  approximately 
1,000 tonnes per day;
The completion of a second internal shaft from Level 5  to Level 6;
Record  amounts  of  development  are  now  being  achieved  to  open  up  the  mine  for  increased
production, resulting in a higher percentage of development ore in the mill feed;
Refurbishment and upgrading of the Agsao Shaft during the September quarter involved replacement 
of  shaft  timbers  and  installing  a  new  larger  winder  and  larger  skip.  This  resulted  in  decreased 
production in the September quarter.
Mill
The  mill  has  continued  to  operate  normally.  Production  for  the  FY  2012  has  been  revised  to  75,000 
ounces due to the continuing aggressive development programme to match the sinking of the Saga Shaft 
to Level 8 which will continue the supply of a high percentage of development ore to the mill, as well as 
the effects of tropical storm Sendong and subsequent torrential rains which affected ore haulage from the 
mine to the mill.
In  November  2010  the  Company  approved  the  construction  of  a  new  mill  with  the  capacity  of  200,000 
ounces per year. Work has commenced on the following:
Upgrading of the thickener and the elution circuit;
Commencement  of  installation  of  one  additional  large  leach  tank  and  refurbishment  of  four  small
leach tanks;
Installation of a detoxification unit; and
Preparations for the installation of a new crusher and SAG mill.
Tailings Dam
Construction of tailings dam number 5 is 80% completed.
Health and Safety
Lost  time  accident  frequency  rate  (LTAFR)  for  the  six  months  to  31  December  2012  is  1.10  including 
exploration.  By  comparison,  the  latest  West  Australian  gold  mining  industry  figure  available  to  30 
September 2011 was 3.10, excluding exploration statistics of 6.70.
As reported on 31 October 2011, an underground miner on afternoon shift was involved in a fatal accident 
in  a  shrinkage  stope  at  the  mine.  The  broken  ore  that  the  miner  was  standing  on  collapsed  due  to  an 
undetectable cavity caused by bridging above the full ore chute.
There were no breaches of any of the project’s operating regulations during the quarter.
Co-O RESOURCES AND RESERVES

Vein modelling
Cube  Consulting  Pty  Ltd  of  Perth,  Western  Australia  was  contracted  to  undertake  the  resource 
estimations.  A wireframe model of the vein system and the mine depletions were based on all available 
information  as  at  30  June  2010.    A  2D  longitudinal  modelling  approach  was  used  and  is  based  on  an 
accumulation  variable  incorporating  mineralised  vein  horizontal  width  and  intercept  grade.    Variography 
was  used  to  analyse  the  spatial  continuity  of  the  horizontal  width  and  accumulation  variables  within  the 
mineralised  veins  and  to  determine  appropriate  estimation  inputs  to  the  interpolation  process.  The 
accumulation  variables  were  interpolated  into  blocks  using  Ordinary  Kriging.    High  grade  limits  were 
applied  to  gold  prior  to  the  calculation  of  the  accumulation  variable.    Mineral  resources  have  been 
reported  in  accordance  with  The  2004  Australasian  Code  for  Reporting  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Reserves (JORC Code) and Canadian National Instrument 43-101.
Co-O RESOURCE DRILLING
Diamond drilling has continued since the last resource model update announced on 27 July 2011 and has 
focused on extending the Co-O Vein system mainly along the eastern side of the resource model. Results 
from a total of 24 surface drill holes for 16,824 metres and 33 underground drill holes 6,900 metres have 
been  completed  (as  announced  on  17  October  2011)  since  the  previous  resource  estimation.  Maps 
showing  the  location  of  these  drill  holes  are  contained  in  each  announcement.  Resource  updates  are 
estimated annually, generally in the third quarter.
Table IV lists the surface diamond drilling results greater than 3 g/t gold over >0.5 metre downhole width 
from  the  Co-O  Mine  for  drill  holes  EXP  087  to  EXP  110.  These  results  are  extracted  from  the 
announcement  dated  17  October  2011  which  contains  more  detailed  drilling  results  with  intersections 
down  to  0.2  metres  downhole  width.  Hole  locations  are  also  shown  on  the  maps  in  these 
announcements.

TAMBIS–BAROBO AREA
BACKGROUND
The Tambis Project, containing the Bananghilig Gold Deposit as shown on Figures 1 and 2, is operated under a Mining 
Agreement with Philex Gold Philippines Inc. over Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (“MPSA”) 344-2010-XIII which 
covers 6,262 hectares.
The  area  has  been  known  as  an  alluivial  gold  producing  area  since  Spanish  times.  The  first  modern  exploration  pre-
Medusa  group  was  conducted  in  the  1970s  followed  by  further  work  in  the  1990s.  The  Company  commenced  a 
concerted drilling programme in July 2010.
The  Bananghilig  Deposit  currently  has  an  inferred  resource  of  650,000  ounces  contained  in  15,000,000  tonnes  at  a 
grade of 1.3 g/t gold. Figure 6 shows the surface geology of the deposit and Figure 7 shows a cross -section through the 
deposit.
Detailed  deposit  geological  and  mineralisation  descriptions  are  contained  in  the  announcement  dated  12  September 
2011  which  contains  results  for  drill  holes  TDH  027  to  102,  and  the  announcement  dated  17  January  2012  contains 
results for holes TDH 102 to 141 excluding TDH 131 to 134 which have been drilled outside Banaghilig. As there are a 
large number of intersections reported in these announcements, they have not been repeated in this half yearly report.
AIM OF PROGRAMME
In July 2010, new regional and detailed mapping and drilling programmes were commenced with the aim of validating 
the current resource and extending it to provide a reserve of approximately one million ounces. This reserve would form 
the  basis  for  a  feasibility  study  which  would  target  production  of  200,000  ounces  of  gold  per  year  from  a  new  milling 
facility.
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING
The Tambis regional geology, termed the Tambis intrusive-breccia complex, typifies a structurally complex intermediate-
sulphidation,  epithermal  gold,  breccia-type  system,  including  disseminated  gold  overprinting  the  host  Tertiary-age 
igneous package which had been emplaced into an andesitic volcanic basement. The fertile igneous suite comprises a 
multi-phase  calc-alkaline,  high  level,  sub-volcanic  intrusive  package  cut  by  extensive  bodies  of  phreatomagmatic 
diatremes and hydrothermal breccias.
Laboratory  studies  including  fluid  inclusions  have  indicated  that  the  Tambis  area  is  only  shallowly  eroded  with  an 
estimated 500 to 950 metres of material stripped from the original surface.
The Tambis intrusive-breccia complex is overlain by younger marine limestones and basal mudstones to the south and 
the east. The extent of the complex below this younger cover is yet to be determined.
To date most of the mineralisation has been identified within or around the margins of the Bananghilig Diatreme.
Exploration
Drilling  commenced  in  July  2010  and  is  continuing  with  seven  surface  rigs.  Drilling  is  currently  concentrating  on 
ensuring  as  much  as  possible  of  the  resources  will  be  in  the  Indicated  category.  It  is  planned  for  a  new  resource 
estimation to be undertaken around mid-2012.
Induced Polarisation / Resistivity and ground magnetics surveys were completed over the area.

USA PROJECT
Background
The  Usa  prospect  (Figure  8)  is  predominantly  contained  within  Mineral  Production  Sharing  Agreement  application 
(“APSA”) XIII-00077. The Company has a Memorandum of Agreement with Corplex Resources Inc.(“Corplex”).
The tenement is being progressed to granting.
ANOLING
The Mines Operating Agreement (“MOA”) with Alcorn Gold Resources Inc. covers Mining Production Sharing Agreement 
(“MPSA”) application number 039-XIII situated approximately 8 kilometres north from the millsite as shown on Figure 2. 
Granting of the Anoling MPSA is in progress.
Four drilling rigs are currently operating at Anoling to explore the vein system. Results from fifty drill  holes drilled several 
years ago are available in the 2011 Annual Report.
An Induced Polarisation/Resistivity and ground magnetics were completed over the area.
SAUGON PROJECT
FIRST HIT VEIN
Background
Figure  2  shows  the  Saugon  Project  located  approximately  28  kilometres  by  road  from  the  Co-O  Mill.    Work  in  2004 
involved drilling at the First Hit Vein (holes SDDH 1 to 35) in conjunction with underground development via a 30 metre 
deep inclined winze down the quartz vein-breccia to assist in understanding the mineralisation.
The  2004  drilling  indicated  a  well  developed  central  zone  (First Hit Vein) with two possible splays partly developed as 
footwall  and  hanging  wall  zones.  Further  details  are  contained  in  the  announcements  dated  20  April  2010  and  1 
December 2010.
Exploration
Drilling of 33 new drill holes totalling 13,410.40 metres (SDDH 69 to 101 inclusive) has been completed at and around 
the  First  Hit  Vein.  Drilling  finished  in  the  December  2011  quarter.  A  summary  of  results  will  be  provided  in  the  March 
quarterly report. 
 
An Induced Polarisation/Resistivity and ground magnetics programme has recently been completed.

FINANCIALS
Medusa  recorded  a  net  profit  after  tax  (“NPAT”)  of  US$24.0  million  and  earnings  before  interest,  tax 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) of US$28.4 million for the half year to 31 December 2011, compared 
to US$58.1 million and US$63.3 million respectively in the previous corresponding period.
The  Company  recorded  Revenues  of  US$40.9  million  compared  to  US$78.3  million  in  the  previous 
corresponding period. Medusa is an un-hedged gold producer and received an average price of US$1,655 per 
ounce  from  the  sale  of  25,446  ounces  of  gold  for  the  half-year  to  December  2011  (previous  corresponding 
period: 48,883 ounces at US$1,291 per ounce).
The  fall  in  NPAT,  EBITDA  and  Revenues  is  directly  linked  to  a  significant  drop  in  gold  production  (26,780 
ounces  compared  to  51,127  ounces).  The  Co-O  Mine  has  been  pre-dominantly  in  development  mode  since 
July  2011  to  prepare  for  the  anticipated  future  production  increase.  All  development  ore  has  been  treated 
through  the  mill  and  this  increased  amount  of  development  ore  is  the  primary  reason  for  the  lower  grade 
recovered.  A  reduction  in  haulage  capacity  with  the  refurbishment  of  the  Agsao  Shaft  has  impacted  on  mill 
throughput and inclement weather experienced in late December 2011 contributed to lower than expected gold 
production.
As  at  31  December  2011,  the  Company  which  is  debt  free,  had  total  cash,  cash  equivalent  in  gold  on  metal 
account and bullion on hand of approximately US$80.2 million (Dec 2010: US$87.2 million).
During the half-year:
The  Company  received  proceeds  of  US$40.6  million  from  gold  and  silver  sales  and  US$0.3  million  from 
interest  income  (Dec  2010  half-year:  gold  and  silver  sales  of  US$63.3  million  and  interest  of  US$0.3 
million);
Depreciation  and  amortisation  was  lower  at  US$4.5  million,  compared  with  US$5.2  million  in  the
December half of 2010;
US$15.9 million outlay on exploration expenditure, including US$8.3 million on the Co-O Mine (Dec 2010 
half-year:  US$12.0  million,  including  US$8.4  million  for  the  Co-O  Mine).  The  exploration  budget  for  the 
2011/12 fiscal year has been revised upwards by US$3 million to US$30 million;
US$9.0 million was spent on sustaining capital at mine and mill and capital works associated with the new
mill construction and infrastructure (Dec 2010 half-year: US$4.0 million); and
Incurred  US$14.7  million  on  general  and  accelerated  mine  development  costs,  inclusive  of  shaft  sinking 
costs (Dec 2010 half-year: on general mine development only of US$5.2 million).
CORPORATE
Dividend
A  final  un-franked  dividend  of  A$0.05  per  share  was  paid  to  shareholders  on  30  September  2011.  The
total amount paid inclusive of associated costs was US$9.34 million;
The  Board  approved  the  payment of an interim un-franked dividend of A$0.05 per share on 20 February 
2012.
The relevant dates for the interim dividend are as follows:

Independent Auditor’s Review Report 
To the Members of Medusa Mining Limited 
 
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  half-year  financial  report  of  Medusa  Mining  Limited  (“Company”), 
which  comprises  the  consolidated  financial  statements  being  the  statement  of  financial  position  as  at  31 
December 2011, and the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement 
of  cash  flows  for  the  half-year  ended  on  that  date,  a  statement  of  accounting  policies,  other  selected 
explanatory  notes  and  the  directors’  declaration  of  the  consolidated  entity,  comprising  both  the  Company 
and the entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or from time to time during the half-year. 
Directors’ responsibility for the half-year financial report 
The  directors  of  the  Company  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  half-year 
financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (including the Australian Accounting 
Interpretations)  and  the  Corporations  Act  2001.  This  responsibility  includes  establishing  and  maintaining 
internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the half-year financial report that is free 
from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error;  selecting  and  applying  appropriate  accounting 
policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. 
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a  conclusion  on  the  consolidated  half-year  financial  report  based  on  our 
review.  We conducted our review in accordance with the Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 
2410:  Review  of  a  Financial  Report  Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state 
whether,  on  the  basis  of  the  procedures  described,  we  have  become  aware  of  any  matter  that  makes  us 
believe that the financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including giving a true 
and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 31 December 2011 and its performance for 
the  half-year  ended  on  that  date;  and  complying  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134:  Interim  Financial 
Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001.  As the auditor of Medusa Mining Limited, ASRE 2410 
requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report. 
A  review  of  a  half-year  financial  report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial  and  accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review  procedures.    A  review  is 
substantially  less  in  scope  than  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  Australian  Auditing  Standards  and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters 
that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
Independence 
In conducting our review, we complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.   
Conclusion
33
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us believe 
that the half-year financial report of Medusa Mining Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 
2001, including:
a  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 31 December 2011
and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
b  complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting and Corporations
Regulations 2001.
