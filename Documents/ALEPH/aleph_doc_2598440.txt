Operations Review 
 
Offshore Italy Pantelleria Permits & d363C.R-.AX permit (Operator, 100% equity interests) 
The Nilde Field Redevelopment Project 
 
The d363C.R-.AX 3rd party independent resources review completed in Q1 2016 by Senergy (GB) Ltd (a Lloyds Company), 
identified significant and potentially commercial contingent resources as per the table below:

CONTINGENT RESOURCES & DEFINITIONS Refer to ASX announcement by ADX dated 17/2/2016 and notes below. ADX confirms that 
it is not aware of any new information or data that affects the information included in that market announcement and that all the 
material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply 
and have not materially changed. All contingent resource figures quoted in this quarterly report are third party verified.  
 
With these highly encouraging results ADX has acquired an extensive and valuable subsurface database  focussing on 
the Nilde Field and Nilde Bis discovery. The data includes joint venture reports by Shell and ENI (previous asset owners), 
well logs, seismic data, well test data and production data. The objective of the data acquisition is the building of a 3D 
reservoir  model  which  can  be  used  for  reservoir  simulation  and  production  history  matching.  The  resource 
determination work in combination with drilling and development costs studies is required to determine the potential 
commerciality of the redevelopment of Nilde and Nilde Bis. 
 
Both the initial 3D geological model and also the production data have confirmed that it is very likely that substantial 
amounts of oil have been left behind because the field was abandoned prematurely at slightly less than 30% water cut 
and only a minor pressure decline when the oil price crashed to $13 in 1989. The combination of the attractive Italian 
fiscal  regime,  high  well  flow  rates  (10,000  bopd),  light  quality  oil  and  a  significant  resource  base  would  make  the 
redevelopment of Nilde an economically viable development project even at low oil prices. ADX   has worked  closely  
with  a  number  of  contractors  and  industry  advisors  to  determine  realistic  capital cost  estimates  for  the  potential  
development  of  the  Nilde  and  Nilde Bis  fields to determine break even oil prices.  Indicative economics have been 
developed based on a floating, production, storage and offloading “FPSO” development option which may not be the 
optimal cost outcome but is a solution that is readily available and can be bench marked with other comparable projects. 
 
The  resulting expected  capital  costs  per  barrel  for  the  project  are  very  attractive  for  an  offshore  development. 
This  is  likely  to  lead  to  a  project  that  is  economic  at  low  oil  prices  and  very  attractive  at  oil  prices exceeding 
US$40 per barrel.
Notes 
1 Contingent Resources: those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations but,
for which the applied project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies.
2 1C, 2C, 3C Estimates: in a probabilistic resource size distribution these are the P90 (90% probability), P50, and P10, respectively, for individual
opportunities.
3 Totals are by arithmetic summation as recommended under PRMS guidelines. This results in a conservative low case total and optimistic high case
total.

Offshore Tunisia Kerkouane permit (Operator, 100% equity interest) 
 
ADX successfully negotiated with the Tunisian government authorities the extension of the Kerkouane license, without 
the requirement to take on additional commitments.  
 
The 3,080 sqkm large Kerkouane license contains a number of large sized exploration prospects and the Dougga gas 
condensate discovery. The license is contiguous with the Italian ADX Sicily channel licenses which include the Nilde oil 
field discussed above.  
 
ADX believes a Dougga commercialization strategy is more desirable in the current investor climate than a focus on large 
sized but more risky exploration prospects. Furthermore ADX believes the commerciality of a potential development of 
the large independently assessed resource base at Dougga (ASX release 14 October 2016, see summary table below) 
can be enhanced based on a subsea tie back to an  onshore  liquids removal gas plant rather than the previous basis of 
design  utilizing  an  offshore  facility  for  condensate  separation  and  offloading.  This  approach  is  expected  to  yield 
significant capital cost savings and improved project economics.

Refer to ASX announcements 26/9/2012 (contingent) and 4/11/2014 (prospective). ADX confirms  that it is not aware of any new 
information or data that affects the information included in that market announcement and that all the material assumptions and 
technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially 
changed. 
 
The forward program for the permit is to undertake a Dougga field feasibility study incorporating a new basis of design 
with  a  view  to  achieving  a  potentially  significant  CAPEX  reduction,  thereby  providing  the  basis  for  an  economic 
development scenario which can be incorporated into a development plan supporting the application for a production 
license. It is envisaged that this will  be followed by the drilling of an appraisal well targeting up dip potential identified 
on high quality 3D seismic with the key objective of establishing that the Dougga reservoir can produce at commercial 
rates.  
 
ADX  will  also  continue  to  engage  with  the  Tunisian  authorities  to  apply  for  a  Dougga  development  and  production 
license.    Discussions  are  expected  to  focus  on  the  negotiation  of  suitable  fiscal  terms  with  a  view  to  ensuring  the 
potential commercialisation of the resource.  
 
Onshore Western Romania, Parta Concession (Operator, 50% equity interest) 
 
During the period, ADX has achieved a large increase in the number of land access permits for seismic acquisition signed 
within an area of previous high community resistance. The positive outcomes are the result of close to a 100% success 
rate in court cases and a highly efficient permitting team of local lawyers with a good community network.  
 
While the entire 3D area of approximately 200sqkm has not been permitted yet, ADX can now hand over the completion 
of permitting to a seismic company.  
 
The 3D seismic will firm up a number of low risk prospects and an appraisal opportunity already identified on 2D seismic 
which is expected to facilitate an attractive farm-down prior to drilling.

A D X   E N E R G Y   L T D
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T
New Ventures 
 
ADX  is  concentrating  on  an  increasing  number  of  potentially  available  production  assets  onshore  in  Romania.  ADX 
believes these assets can be acquired at a relatively low cost because they are not material enough for larger companies, 
some  have  been  poorly  managed  and  have  lacked  appropriate  investment.  These  opportunities  could  provide 
meaningful cash flow and reserves for ADX. The Company is targeting assets where some initial production gains can be 
made  through  existing  well  remediation  with  modest  investment  and  the  potential  exists  for  low  risk  production 
additions through development drilling in a rising oil price environment. ADX is well placed on the ground in Romania 
with good local contactor and designated authority relationships.  
 
During the period ADX made an unsuccessful conditional offer for a Romanian producing oilfield opportunity and has 
commenced  the  assessment  of  two  further  oil  and  gas  production  and  development  opportunities  where  there  is 
potential to access  low cost, high value barrels.  
 
ADX will provide further details of these opportunities if the transactions reach an advanced nature.

1.  Basis of Preparation of Half-Year Financial Statements
ADX Energy Ltd is a company limited by shares, domiciled and incorporated in Australia. Its shares are publicly 
traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. 
 
This general purpose consolidated financial report for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 has been prepared in 
accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001. The financial report 
complies with Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
 
The  Group  is  a  for  profit  entity  and  is  primarily  involved  in  hydrocarbon  exploration,  evaluation,  and 
development.  
 
The  half-year  financial  report  does  not  include  all  notes  of  the  type  normally  included  within  the  Annual 
Financial  Report  and  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  provide  as  full  an  understanding  of  the  financial 
performance, financial position and financing and investing activities of the consolidated entity as the full 
financial report. 
 
The half-year financial report should be read in conjunction with the annual financial report for the year ended 
31  December  2015  and  any  public  announcements  made  by  ADX  Energy  Ltd  during  the  interim  reporting 
period  in  accordance  with  the  continuous  disclosure  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001.    For  the 
purpose  of  preparing  the  half-year  financial  report,  the  half-year  has  been  treated  as  a  discrete  reporting 
period. 
 
The half-year financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis.   
 
The half year consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of ADX Energy Ltd and its 
subsidiaries (“Group”) as at 30 June 2016. 
 
Going Concern 
 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  that  the  Company  will  continue  to  meet  its 
commitments and can therefore continue normal business activities and realise assets and settle liabilities in 
the ordinary course of business.  
 
As  an  exploration  group,  the  Company  and  its  controlled  entities  do  not  generate  cash  flows  from  their 
operating activities to finance these activities. As a consequence the ability of the Company to continue as a 
going  concern  is  dependent  on  the  success  of  capital  fundraising,  farmouts  of  projects  or  other  financing 
opportunities.  The  Directors  believe  that  the  Company  will  continue  as  a  going  concern.  As  a  result  the 
financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis. However should fundraising, farmouts or 
any alternative financing opportunities be unsuccessful, the Company may not be able to continue as a going 
concern. No adjustments have been made relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that 
might be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern.

8.  Share Based Payments - continued
(b)  Summary of share-based payments (options) granted during the half-year - continued:
The assessed fair values of the options were determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking 
into account the exercise price, term of option, the share price at grant date and expected price  volatility of 
the underlying share, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option. The 
inputs to the model used were:
Grant date
Number of options
23/5/2016
5,000,000
Option exercise price ($)
Expected life of options (years)
Dividend yield (%)
Expected volatility (%)
Risk-free interest rate (%)
Underlying share price ($)

Value of Option ($)

The  expected  life  of  the  options  is  based  on  historical  data  and  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  exercise 
patterns  that  may  occur.  The  expected  volatility  reflects  the  assumption  that  the  historical  volatility  is 
indicative of  future trends, which  may also not  necessarily be the actual outcome. No  other features of 
options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
9.  Commitments and Contingencies
Since the last annual reporting date, there has not been a material change to commitments or contingencies other 
than the approved 12 month extension of the Kerkouane (Tunisia) permit subsequent to year end.
10.  Subsequent Events
Subsequent to year end: 
 
3.
In  July  2016,  ADX  was  granted  a  twelve  month  extension  for  the  Kerkouane  permit  located  offshore 
Tunisia in the Sicily channel.
4.  On 1 August 2016, 21,959,911 shares were issued to directors and company secretaries in consideration
for remuneration waived for the period 1 September 2015 to 30 June 2016.  Refer to note 6(a)(iii).
No  other  matter  or  circumstance  has  arisen  since  30  June  2016  that  has  significantly  affected  or  may 
significantly affect the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of those operations or the state of 
affairs of the consolidated entity, in subsequent financial years.
