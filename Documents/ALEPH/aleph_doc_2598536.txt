Interim Financial Results 1H 2016
Production Increased 270%, with 51% Lower Field Production Costs
Incremental has recorded a half-year net loss after tax  (NPAT) of $1.1 million.  Production during 
the same period was 125.7 MBOE, an increase of 270% in production compared to 1H 2015.  The 
increase  in  production  was  a  result  of  acquiring  and  improving  production  at  the  Silvertip  Field.  
Operating  revenue  for  1H  2016  was  US$2.27  million  compared  to  US$1.62  million  in  the  same 
period last year. 
 
Half-year reported NPAT in 2016 was 58% lower than 1H 2015 primarily due to lower benchmark oil 
prices1 that fell 26% from 1H 2015 to 1H 2016. 
 
As  a  result  of  acquiring  the  Silvertip  Field  in  Wyoming,  the  company  is  in  a  stronger  position  to 
prioritise growth by developing of this asset and purchasing new assets. 
 
John  Whisler,  Incremental’s  Managing  Director  stated  that,  “We  have  demonstrated  through  the 
Silvertip  acquisition  that  we  have  the skills  and  capacity  necessary  to  identify  and  acquire  quality 
assets,  in  addition  to  the  requisite  technical  skills  to  convert  overlooked  value  into  increased 
production while improving efficiency. 
 
“Our cost to produce oil and gas is relatively low ($7.40 per BOE) compared to other operators and 
has placed the company in a strong position as oil and gas prices are forecasted to improve in 2017. 
 
“In addition, our cost of debt continues to be competitive at 3.75% and we have been successful in 
raising additional equity to balance our capital requirements.”  
 
Financial Enhancements for 1H 2016
  Field production costs of US$7.4/BOE, 51% lower than 1H 2015. 
  Decrease  in  administrative  expenses,  notwithstanding  the  major  expansion  of  operations
associated with the acquisition of the 105 well Silvertip Field.
  Gross  profit  margin  (before  overheads,  amortisation  and  depreciation)  at  approximately
42%, only 9% less than 1H 2015 (51%), despite oil prices being 26% lower than 1H 2015.
  Cash receipts from product sales was US$2.18M, 38% higher than 1H 2015.

Increase  in  proved  developed  producing  reserves  at  the  Silvertip  Field  by  65%  to 
0.962 MMBOE in 1H 2016 (Refer ASX Announcement 22 March 2016). 
Independently certified 3Bcf of natural gas identified in shallow behind-pipe formations in 
the Silvertip Field (Refer ASX announcement 13 April 2016).
  Planning and design for the Silvertip development program was completed in 1H 2016 and
workovers and recompletions commenced in August 2016.
Risk management


In 2015, Incremental acquired a 100% working interest in Silvertip Field which has a mixture 
of  oil,  natural  gas  and  natural  gas  liquids  production  and  sales  which  diversifies  the 
Company’s revenue streams and commodity price exposure across a number of products. 
Incremental  entered  into  a  12  month  forward  sale  agreement  for  approximately  75%  of 
existing gas production volume to underpin the recompletion program economics (contract 
negotiated  at  a  price  of  US$2.06/MMBTU  when  spot  price  was  approx.  US$1.55/MMBTU 
and subsequently dropped to as low as US$1.21/MMBTU).  Additional new gas production 
from well recompletions will benefit from seasonal (winter) price increases expected in Q4-
16 and Q1-17.
  Equity  raised  in  August  2016  to  provide  working  capital  to  further  develop  the  Silvertip
Field.
Building near-term value growth
  14  wells  were  permitted  for  recompletions  at  Silvertip  Field.  These  recompletions  will 
increase  gas  production  in  the  short  term.    Work  commenced  in  August  2016  (Refer  ASX 
announcement 24 August 2016).
  1 well recompletion approved will target oil in the Madison Formation at the Silvertip Field.  
Success  in  this  well  recompletion  will  create  further  oil  development  opportunities  in  the 
Field.
  Actively  pursuing  assets  in  onshore  USA  basins  with  existing  oil  and  gas  production  and 
development  potential.    Numerous  targets  have  been  assessed,  however,  none  have  met 
the company’s selection criteria for an even more detailed review.

Operating and Financial Review 
 
Summary Overview 

Production has increase by 270% (on a BOEPD basis) from H1-2015 to H1-2016 
primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Silvertip Field, WY in July 2015; 
The Silvertip Field (WY, USA) accounted for more than 75% of production in H1-
2016;

  A 24 well recompletion program to increase production of natural gas from
shallow formations in the Silvertip Field commenced in August;
  New project acquisitions continue to form the part of business growth strategy; 
The Company has announced an equity raising of A$1.520M via a placement 
 
of 38 million of ordinary shares. Of this amount, A$955,000 (before costs) was 
received in August 2016. The remaining balance of A$565,000 (before costs), 
which is subject to shareholder’s approval is expected to be received in 
September 2016.
Operations
Incremental is an exploration and production company focused on the exploitation 
of  existing  onshore  oil  and  gas  fields  in  the  USA.    The  Company’s  strategy  is  to 
identify and acquire low risk, underperforming oil and gas fields and apply modern 
technology  and  expertise  to  increase  production  and  enhance  hydrocarbon 
recovery,  thus  increasing  net  cash  flow  and  profitability  and  upgrading  proved 
reserves to enhance asset value. 
 
Production
Incremental  produced  and  sold  oil  from  all  four  of  its  fields  namely,  Silvertip  (WY), 
Florence (CO), Sheep Springs (CA) and Round Mountain (CA) in the first six  months 
of 2016.  It also produced  and  sold  natural  gas from  its Silvertip and  Sheep Springs 
Fields.    Natural  Gas  Liquids  (NGL’s)  are  extracted  from  natural  gas  at  the  Silvertip 
Field and sold as a separate product. 
 
Production  in  the  half  year  to  30  June  2016  and  the  corresponding  prior  periods 
were as follows:

1.  Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is the factor used to convert volumes of different hydrocarbon
production to barrels (42 U.S. gallons) of oil equivalent of crude oil.  One barrel of oil is deemed 
to have the equivalent amount of energy content as 6,000 British Thermal Units (or 6 MMBTU) of 
natural gas.  One barrel of oil is deemed to have the equivalent amount of energy content as 
42 gallons of natural gas liquids (NGL’s).

The  addition  of  production  from  the  Silvertip  Field,  owned  (100%  Working  Interest) 
and  operated  since  July  2015,  resulted  in  a  four-fold  increase  in  total  group 
production  from  the  first  to  second  half  in  2015.    The  Silvertip  Field  continued  to 
account for the majority of production in the first half of 2016. 
 
Silvertip 
A decrease in production in the first half of 2016 compared to the last six months of 
2015  resulted  from  natural  decline  and  wells  that  have  been  shut  in  due  to 
mechanical  issues  (primarily  oil  producing  wells).    Some  of  the  shut  in  oil  wells  will 
undergo workovers and be returned to production in Q3-16. 
 
Sheep Springs, Round Mountain and Florence 
There has been natural decline in production at the Company’s other fields, Sheep 
Springs,  Round  Mountain  and  Florence.    However,  as  a  result  of  pump  changes 
made at the Round Mountain Field, there has been an increase in production from 
the previous half year period.

Half Year Report    |   30 June 2016
Silvertip 
In  April  2016,  the  Company  announced  that  it  had  identified  up  to  3Bcf  of 
recoverable  gas  (independently  certified)  in  the  Meeteetse  and  Mesaverde 
Formations  (between  2000  feet  and  3000  feet  below  surface).    This  gas  can  be 
produced  from  existing  well  bores  by  way  of  a  recompletion  (perforation  of  the 
existing well bore at the depth of the behind-pipe natural gas). 
 
24  wells  have  been  selected  for  a  recompletion  program  which  commenced  in 
August 2016.  Permits to undertake 15 of these recompletions have been received 
while the remainder are in the preparation stage. 
 
As part of the future work program, Incremental plans to undertake a recompletion 
of an existing well to access a deeper oil bearing formation called the Madison.   If 
successful,  this  will  upgrade  the  potential  for  additional  oil  production  from  the 
Silvertip Field. 
 
Business Strategies and Prospects
The  Company  continued  to  focus  on  cost  management  and  field  operating 
efficiency have placed the Company in a strong position. 
 
The average prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the first half of 2016 
were lower than the same period in the prior year.  Both natural gas and oil prices 
recovered in the second quarter of 2016.

OIL AND GAS LIMITED 
Half Year Report    |   30 June 2016
The  acquisition  of  the  Silvertip  Field  in  June  2015  was  successful  for  Incremental.  
Production  from  the  new  field  has  increased  the  Company’s  revenue  base.    New 
1P reserves were identified and reported in the first half of 2016 which added value 
to the business. 
 
Incremental  continues  its  strategy  of  growth  through  acquisition.    The  Company  is 
targeting  oil and  gas fields which have  existing  or  near  term  profitable  production 
and  which  are  under-developed.    The  opportunity  to  acquire  such  assets  is 
heightened in periods of low commodity prices and the Company’s management 
team  has  dedicated  considerable  resources  into  reviewing  numerous  acquisition 
opportunities in onshore US basins in the first half of 2016. 
 
Financial Position
Assets
Total  assets  have  decreased  from  $17.08M  at  31  December  2015  to  $16.497M  at 
30 June 2016. 
 
Cash at bank as at 30 June 2016 was $192,311.  This compares to a total of $445,419 
of cash held at 31 December 2015. 
 
As  at  30  June  2016,  an  additional  $322,168  of  cash  was  held  as  a  term  deposit 
which  is  secured  against  performance  bonds  for  the  Silvertip  project.    This  is 
reported as a non-current financial asset in the balance sheet, not as cash at bank. 
 
A$1.52M  (Approx  US$1.15M)  was  raised  through  a  placement  of  share.  The  first 
tranche  has  been  finalised  with  23,875,000  shares  issued  raising  $955,000.  A  further 
14,125,000 shares will be issued in tranche 2 subject to shareholder approval at an 
Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on 2nd September 2016.  These funds will 
provide additional working capital for the company. 
 
Trade receivable, other receivables and prepayments and inventory of $471,508 at 
30 June 2016 is lower than the same assets at 31 December 2015 ($538,388). 
 
Net Oilfield Properties and Plant have decreased from $15.8M at 31 December 2015 
to $15.5M as a result of amortisation.

Liabilities
INCREMENTAL 
OIL AND GAS LIMITED 
Half Year Report    |   30 June 2016
Current  liabilities  have  increased  from  $2.08M  at  31  December  2015  to  $8.07M  at 
30 June 2016 due predominantly to the reclassification of the  Line of Credit facility 
($6,157,160) from a non-current liability as at 31 December 2015 to a current liability 
as at 30 June 2016. 
 
A  Revolving  Line  of  Credit  facility  which  matures  on  1  June  2017  has  been 
reclassified  as  a  current  loan  due  to  the  remaining  term  being  less  than  twelve 
months  from  the  balance  date  of  this  report.    There  is  a  provision  in  the  loan 
agreement  to  renegotiate  the  maturity  date  of  the  Line  of  Credit  facility  for  a 
further  two  year  term  prior  to  the  current  maturity  date.    The  Company  will 
renegotiate the maturity date of the loan  which will then be reclassified as a non-
current liability by the year’s end. 
 
Bank  Loans  (current  and  non-current)  have 
increased  by  $31,000  from  31 
December  2015  to  30  June  2016.    There  has  been  an  increase  in  the  non-current 
restoration provision of $657,000 since 31 December 2015.   
 
Equity
Total equity has decreased by $1.07M from $2.86M at 31 December 2015 to $1.79M 
at 30 June 2016.  This is due to accumulated losses (see Financial Performance).

Despite 
performance of the Incremental was impacted by: 
 

Lower oil prices in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year.  The 
average price achieved for oil sold in H1-16 of $33.39/Bbl was 30% below the 
prior year.  This resulted in $520,000 reduction in oil revenue; 
The volume of gas sold in H1-15 was negligible (only produced from the Sheep 
Springs Field in low volumes).  The natural gas and NGL’s sold from the Silvertip 
Field in H1-16 has provided an increase in revenue from the prior corresponding 
period; 
Field operating expenses in the first half of 2016 ($846,529) were higher than the 
corresponding prior year period ($383,519) as a result of adding the Silvertip 
Field to the business operations.  The 2016 operating costs represent a lifting 
cost of $6.73/Boe compared to $11.31/Boe in the same prior year period - 
based on production volume;
  Amortisation and depreciation of field assets was $327,707 higher in H1-16 than


the prior year corresponding period which is attributable to the Silvertip Field; 
The company’s corporate overhead in H1-2016 was $1,016,668 (H1-2015 
$866,259).  This was largely due to costs associated with the expansion 
(acquisition of the Silvertip Field); 
Interest charges in H1-2016 were $176,071 compared to $48,854 in H1-2015 as a 
result of approximately $6.7M of additional debt used to fund the Silvertip 
acquisition in June 2015.

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies
INCREMENTAL 
OIL AND GAS LIMITED 
Half Year Report    |   30 June 2016
issue
in
interim  financial  statements  were  authorised  for
The  consolidated 
interim  financial  statements  are  for  the  group  comprising 
Incremental  Oil  and  Gas  Limited  (“the  Company”  or  “Incremental  Oil  and  Gas”  or 
“the Parent”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”). 
 
Incremental  Oil  and  Gas  Limited  is  a  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  in 
Australia  whose  shares  are  publicly  traded  on  the  Australian  Securities  Exchange 
(ASX). 
 
These  consolidated 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 31 August 2016.  
 
The  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  the  interim  financial 
statements  are  consistent  with  those  followed  in  the  preparation  of  the  Group’s 
annual  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2015, 
except  for  the  adoption  of  new  standards  and  interpretations  effective  as  of  1 
January 2016. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. 
 
Basis of preparation  
These  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  of  the  Group  for  the  period  ended 
30 June  2016  are  a  general  purpose  condensed  financial  report  prepared  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  AASB  134

expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance, financial 
position and cash flows of the group as the full financial report. 
 
It  is  recommended  that  these  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  be  read  in 
conjunction  with the  annual  financial  report  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2015

accordance  with  the  continuous  disclosure  requirements  under  Corporations  Act 
2001.

OIL AND GAS LIMITED 
Half Year Report    |   30 June 2016
Going concern 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group has a working capital deficiency of $7.41M, has made 
an operating  loss for  the  six months ended 30  June  2016  of $1.097M  and  has had  a 
net reduction in cash and cash equivalents of $0.252M for the six month period. 
 
Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  a  going 
concern  basis  as  the  Directors  are  satisfied  that  the  Group  will  have  access  to 
sufficient working capital to fund administrative and other committed expenditure for 
a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. 
 
Pertinent  facts  relating  to  the  assessment  of  the  Group’s  ability  to  continue  as  a 
going concern are:
i.
The Company has announced an equity raising of A$1.520M via a placement 
of  38  million  ordinary  shares.  Of  this  amount,  A$955,000  (before  costs)  was 
received in August 2016. The remaining balance of A$565,000 (before costs), 
which  is  subject  to  shareholder’s  approval  is  expected  to  be  received  in 
September 2016.
ii.  The  directors  have  no  reason  to  believe  at  this  time  that  the  term  of  the 
existing  Revolving  Line  of  Credit  facility  with  ANB  Bank  of  $6.157M,  which 
currently  has  a  maturity  date  of  1  June  2017,  will  not  be  extended  in 
accordance with the facility terms.
iii.  The Group’s cashflow forecasts through to 31 December 2017 reflect that the 
Group will produce positive cash flows from its ongoing operations to enable 
the Group to meet its other financial commitments as and when they fall due.
Should the Group not be able to execute the strategies set out above, there would 
be  significant uncertainty as to whether the  Group would  be  able  to meet its debts 
as  and  when  they  fall  due  and  thus  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The  financial 
statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and 
classification  of  recorded  asset  amounts,  or  to  the  amount  and  classification  of 
liabilities that might be required should the Group not be able to achieve the matters 
set out above, and thus be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
New accounting standards and interpretations 
From  1  January  2016,  the  Group  has  adopted  all  Australian  Accounting  Standards 
and  Interpretations  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  before  1  January 
2016.  The Group has not elected to early adopt any new accounting standards and 
interpretations, New standards adopted by the Group include : 
 
AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
(Amendments to AASB 116 and AASB 138) and AASB 2015-1 Amendments to 
Australian Accounting Standards – Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting 
Standards 2012-2014 Cycle 
AASB 116 and AASB 138 both establish the principle for the basis of depreciation and 
amortisation as being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic 
benefits of an asset. The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to 
calculate  the  depreciation  of  an  asset  is  not  appropriate  because  revenue 
generated  by an activity that includes the  use  of an asset generally reflects factors 
other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset.  
 
The  amendment  also  clarifies  that  revenue  is  generally  presumed  to  be  an 
inappropriate  basis  for  measuring  the  consumption  of  the  economic  benefits 
embodied  in  an  intangible  asset.  This  presumption,  however,  can  be  rebutted  in 
certain limited circumstances. 
 
The  adoption  of  these  standards  has  had  no  effect  on  the  financial  position  or 
performance of the Company or disclosures made by the Company.

Impairment charge 
 
As  at  31  December  2015  the  Company  assessed  each  project  on  a  value  in 
use  basis  to  determine  whether  an  indicator  of  impairment  existed,  including 
future  selling  price,  future  costs  and  reserves.    As  a  result,  the  recoverable 
amounts  of  the  cash  generating  units were  formally  estimated  on the  basis  of 
value  in  use  calculation using  cashflow  projections  over  the  life  of the  oilfields 
(i.e. 15 to 24 years) resulting in an impairment loss of $835,085  (split between oil 
and gas properties and plant and equipment) being recognised for the year.   
 
The following assumptions were used in the assessment of the cash generating 
units’ recoverable amounts:
  Discount rate – the discount rate used for the assessment of operating oilfields 
with  a  similar  production  profile,  similar  characteristics  as  all  existing  oil  fields  is 
10%, which was applied to the pre-tax cash flows, expressed in real terms. The 
discount rate was derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
with  appropriate  adjustments  made  to  reflect  the  risks  specific  to  the  region 
and the oilfields.
  Oil price - as a result of oil price volatility experienced in 2015, the oil price for 
future cash flow generation has been based on the forward curve price at the 
date  of  assessment.    Oil  prices  are  adjusted  to  account  for  variances  in 
refinery/transportation charges  with a range  of $40.97  per  barrel to $56.16  per 
barrel.    Gas  charges  are  adjusted  to  account  for  the  market  into  which  the 
product  is  delivered  with  prices  ranging  from  $2.49  per  Mmbtu  to  $4.01  per 
Mmbtu.
The resulting impairment assessment on each field in 2015 was as follows:

A significant portion of undeveloped reserves are considered to be uneconomic at 
the  prevailing  price  and  have  been  categorised  as  Contingent  Resource  as  at 
31 December 2015 with no value ascribed to them. 
 
The determination of value in use (VIU) for each CGU are considered to be Level 3 
fair  value  measurements  in  both  years,  as  they  are  derived  from  valuation 
techniques that include  inputs that are  not based  on observable  market data.  The 
Group  considers  the  inputs  and  the  valuation  approach  to  be  consistent  with  the 
approach taken by market participants.

6.  Oil properties (Cont.)
For  the  30  June  2016  half  year,  management  has  reviewed  the  key  economic 
assumptions  underpinning  their  impairment  assessment  including  production  profile, 
recoverable reserves and discount factor, noting these are still appropriate and have 
not  changed  significantly  from  31  December  2015.  Accordingly,  management  is  of 
the view that the impairment made at 31 December 2015 remains appropriate and 
thus no reversal of the provision or further impairment of the oil properties is required.

Report on the half-year financial report to the members of Incremental Oil
and Gas Limited
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Incremental Oil and Gas Limited, which
comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated
statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors'
declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at half-year
end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the
basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the
financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view
of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year
ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and
the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Incremental Oil and Gas Limited and the entities it
controlled during the period, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to
the audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a copy
of which is included in the Directors’ Report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report of Incremental Oil and Gas Limited is not in accordance with the
Corporations Act 2001, including:
a)
b)
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Regulations 2001.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the financial report which describes the
principal conditions that raise doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the
consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be
unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

Despite significantly higher volumes of hydrocarbons sold, the financial performance 
of Incremental was impacted by lower oil prices in the first half of 2016 compared to 
the prior year.  The average price achieved for oil sold in H1-16 of $33.39/Bbl was 30% 
below the prior year.  This resulted in $520,000 reduction in oil revenue.
Field operating expenses in the first half of 2016 ($846,529) were higher than the 
corresponding prior year period ($383,519) as a result of adding the Silvertip Field to 
the business operations.  The 2016 operating costs represent a lifting cost of 
$6.73/BOE compared to $11.31/BOE in the same prior year period - based on 
production volume.
