<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Egypt was held at the 15th meeting on 5 
</p>
<p>November 2014. The delegation of Egypt was headed by Ibrahim el-Heneidy, Minister for 
</p>
<p>Transitional Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. At its 18th meeting, held on 7 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group adopted the report on Egypt. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Egypt: C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Montenegro, Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Egypt: 
</p>

</p>
<p>Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, 
</p>
<p>Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted 
</p>

</p>
<p>periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation of Egypt, Ibrahim el-Heneidy, Minister for Transitional 
</p>
<p>Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, expressed appreciation for the constructive role of the 
</p>
<p>UPR mechanism. The preparation process for Egypt&#8217;s second review provided a further 
</p>
<p>opportunity for communication with national and public forces and civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the first review of Egypt, in 2010, the country has witnessed major political 
</p>
<p>and social changes. In the past three years, Egypt has witnessed two popular revolutions 
</p>
<p>that have transformed the political landscape. The driving force behind those revolutions 
</p>
<p>was a call for the protection of the rights of Egyptian citizens and for guaranteeing their 
</p>
<p>freedoms. In this light, the demands of the Egyptian people have gone beyond the 
</p>
<p>recommendations that Egypt received and accepted during its first review. 
</p>
<p>7. On 25 January 2011, Egypt witnessed a popular peaceful revolt against a ruling 
</p>
<p>authority that had led the country into an atmosphere of political and social marginalization. 
</p>
<p>The new president, elected in 2012, adopted a series of exclusionary policies and 
</p>
<p>authoritarian practices, disseminated hate speech and incited the commission of violence, 
</p>
<p>thus violating the rule of law and the rights of Egyptians.  </p>


<p>8. The Egyptian people started another revolution on 30 June 2013, with the 
</p>
<p>participation of about 30 million Egyptians. Political and popular forces agreed on a 
</p>
<p>national road map that encompassed constitutional reform, presidential and parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections.  
</p>
<p>9. The Committee of the Fifty, a body comprising representatives of Egyptians from all 
</p>
<p>walks of life, drafted a new amended Constitution that was passed by a popular vote of 98.1 
</p>
<p>per cent, including an unprecedented participation by women. Following presidential 
</p>
<p>elections held in May 2014, a new President was appointed by a popular vote of over 96 per 
</p>
<p>cent. Preparations are also under way for holding parliamentary elections, the final step in 
</p>
<p>the road map. 
</p>
<p>10. The Ministry of Transitional Justice and Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for all 
</p>
<p>aspects relevant to human rights in Egypt. It observes types of violations and 
</p>
<p>marginalization and works on ensuring accountability and reparations to victims of 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p>11. In upholding the principle of accountability, the President of Egypt formed in 2013 
</p>
<p>an independent fact-finding commission to investigate acts of violence following the 
</p>
<p>30 June revolution. The commission has finalized its work and is in the process of 
</p>
<p>preparing its reports to submit to the competent authorities. 
</p>
<p>12. Among the first of the President&#8217;s decisions was the formation of a high committee 
</p>
<p>for legislative reform tasked with reviewing the legislative edifice in order to align it with 
</p>
<p>the new Constitution. The Committee has already prepared a number of draft laws to 
</p>
<p>address core human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>13. The 2014 Constitution in its article 5 lists human rights among the foundations of 
</p>
<p>the State&#8217;s political system. It stipulates that discrimination and incitement to hatred are 
</p>
<p>crimes with no statute of limitations. It further committed the state to achieving social 
</p>
<p>justice. Citizenship, equality and equal opportunity form the basis of the relationship 
</p>
<p>between the individual and the State. It has stipulated rights and freedoms unprecedented in 
</p>
<p>previous Egyptian constitutional systems, for example, the right to peaceful strike, and has 
</p>
<p>released controls over the freedom of belief. Personal freedom is ensured as a natural right, 
</p>
<p>as are the freedoms of movement, thought, opinion, artistic and literary creativity, press and 
</p>
<p>publishing. The Constitution prohibits forced arbitrary displacement. It ensures the rights to 
</p>
<p>form political parties, civil associations and organizations upon notification. The 
</p>
<p>Constitution further dedicates several articles to addressing the rights of women, children, 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, older persons and expatriates. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2010, Egypt received a total of 165 recommendations. It accepted 119 of them, of 
</p>
<p>which 25 were under implementation at the time of the review. Despite the pressing 
</p>
<p>domestic issues, the steps below have been taken to implement the accepted 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>15. A number of inter-agency governmental consultations have been held with civil 
</p>
<p>society representatives to hear their views on the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government issued a number of decisions and laws since 2011 during the 
</p>
<p>transitional period to implement its international legal obligations in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights. The most important ones include tightening punishments for crimes of violence 
</p>
<p>against women, establishing a health insurance system for women heads of families and 
</p>
<p>children under the school age and regulating the right to public assembly and peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>17. The law regulating political parties was amended in 2011 to allow for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of political parties upon notification. Political parties are not to be dissolved </p>


<p>except upon a court order. Those regulations led the number of registered political parties to 
</p>
<p>surge to 96.  
</p>
<p>18. The Al-Azhar and the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt launched the &#8220;House of the 
</p>
<p>Egyptian Family&#8221; initiative to reinforce the values of citizenship for all. The House of the 
</p>
<p>Egyptian Family launched, in cooperation with civil society partners, a campaign to restore 
</p>
<p>46 churches that had been affected by acts of violence following the June 30 revolution. 
</p>
<p>19. The Constitution and laws do not impose any limitations on access by bloggers or 
</p>
<p>the public to the Internet. Presidents of national newspapers are appointed upon 
</p>
<p>nominations by the newspapers themselves. The ministry of information has been 
</p>
<p>abolished. Steps are under way for establishing a council for media regulation in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>20. Since 2011, the Government has been involved in a review of Law no. 84 of 2002 
</p>
<p>regulating civil associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The total 
</p>
<p>number of registered NGOs now stands at around 47,000, compared with 26,000 in 2010. 
</p>
<p>21. The Egyptian Constitution stipulates that &#8220;torture in all forms and types is a crime 
</p>
<p>that is not subject to prescription,&#8221; and that &#8220;the State shall guarantee fair compensation for 
</p>
<p>the victims of such violations&#8221;. The Office of the Public Prosecutor investigates all cases 
</p>
<p>brought to its attention on claims of torture or harsh treatment. It is also responsible for the 
</p>
<p>surveillance of prisons and other places of detention and regularly undertakes surprise 
</p>
<p>visits. 
</p>
<p>22. Despite the scale of violence and barbaric acts committed by terrorist organizations 
</p>
<p>in Egypt and the Middle East, Egypt works to ensure the highest possible guarantees for the 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights. It has opted not to apply any exceptional measures while fighting 
</p>
<p>terrorism, instead relying on the stipulations of the Penal Code, which provides guarantees 
</p>
<p>for citizens&#8217; rights. The draft anti-terrorism law, which encompasses all the guarantees laid 
</p>
<p>out under United Nations standards, is ready for adoption.   
</p>
<p>23. The Government has specified a minimum standard of living for those living in 
</p>
<p>poverty and extreme poverty. The family social security pension has been raised by 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent.  
</p>
<p>24. Egypt designed a comprehensive housing strategy for the period 2012-2027 that 
</p>
<p>aims to provide housing to limited-income families, women breadwinners, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and others. A law on social housing has been issued.  
</p>
<p>25. A new ministry has been established responsible for civil development and slums, 
</p>
<p>and another for small and medium-sized enterprises. National strategies to address 
</p>
<p>unemployment and eradicate illiteracy are being implemented. 
</p>
<p>26. The Law on the House of Representatives stipulates that at least 50 per cent of 
</p>
<p>electoral lists must be women, as well as at least 50 per cent of appointed representatives. 
</p>
<p>Women government employees enjoy total equality with men.  
</p>
<p>27. In coordination with the National Council for Women, the Government has provided 
</p>
<p>support to women living in poverty, with the aim of facilitating their access to State 
</p>
<p>services. The Government has also established &#8220;women health centres&#8221; in most 
</p>
<p>governorates. 
</p>
<p>28. In June 2014, legal sanctions against harassment were tightened by way of 
</p>
<p>amendments to the penal code. Those amendments include, for the first time, a broad and 
</p>
<p>detailed definition of sexual harassment. The Ministry of the Interior provides centres for 
</p>
<p>care and treatment of women victims of rape and those subjected to violence. A female 
</p>
<p>police force is routinely assigned to deal with those cases. </p>


<p>29. The 2014 Constitution establishes children's rights in a manner that is unprecedented 
</p>
<p>in previous Egyptian constitutions in terms of the scope, level and areas of protection for 
</p>
<p>children, including children with disabilities. The State provides all types of comprehensive 
</p>
<p>care to children through care units across the country, nurseries, shelters and alternative 
</p>
<p>families.  
</p>
<p>30. The National Council for Persons with Disabilities was established in 2012, with 
</p>
<p>supervisory and coordination roles. The Council was represented in the Committee of the 
</p>
<p>Fifty, which was responsible for amending the Constitution. The new Law on the House of 
</p>
<p>Representatives specified an appropriate representation of persons with disabilities in 
</p>
<p>Parliament. A database on persons with disabilities has been finalized in order to provide 
</p>
<p>required care and services. 
</p>
<p>31. On 4 November 2014, Egypt submitted to OHCHR a draft agreement for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a regional office for North Africa in Cairo.  
</p>
<p>32. Regarding cooperation with Human Rights Council mechanisms, the Government 
</p>
<p>issued in March 2014 invitations to a number of Council mandate holders, including the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
</p>
<p>recurrence. 
</p>
<p>33. Education curricula include information on human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>International human rights law has become a standing subject in university curricula. The 
</p>
<p>Government provides financial support to civil society organizations that work in the field 
</p>
<p>of human rights on awareness-raising, and a new department on human rights and social 
</p>
<p>communication has been established at the Ministry of the Interior. 
</p>

</p>
<p>78. Belarus noted Egypt&#8217;s success in implementing the recommendations of the first 
</p>
<p>cycle. 
</p>
<p>79. Minister Tellawy of the Egyptian delegation explained that Egyptian women played 
</p>
<p>a crucial role during transitional phases, noting that the Constitution of 2014 refers to 
</p>
<p>women's rights in some 20 articles, including on women's rights to hold leadership 
</p>
<p>positions, equality in the workplace, protection from violence and provisions for financial, 
</p>
<p>social and health support to vulnerable and poor women. Since June 2013, additional 
</p>
<p>measures have been adopted to ensure that women are protected by law and in practice. 
</p>
<p>Notably, Egypt is about to adopt a new law on violence against women; has criminalized 
</p>
<p>violence against women in the Penal Code; is considering the adoption of a national 
</p>
<p>strategy on violence against women; has established a special unit at the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior to deal with issues related to violence against women; has created a hotline for 
</p>
<p>complains; and set up some 32 different units to ensure gender equality in the workplace. A 
</p>
<p>number of national programmes have also been developed to fight illiteracy among women 
</p>
<p>and facilitate their integration in the workforce. Egypt has also criminalized female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation. Despite these actions, women still face several challenges, particularly social 
</p>
<p>and cultural difficulties that were negatively reinforced during the rule of the Muslim 
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, which attempted to change or abolish many acts of legislation that had been 
</p>
<p>adopted in favour of women. Egyptian women expected international support during this 
</p>
<p>difficult time, yet several countries supported the Muslim Brotherhood. 
</p>
<p>80. Ambassador Hisham Badr noted that engagement with civil society was a key pillar 
</p>
<p>in the political and social transitional process, and that civil society was a natural partner 
</p>
<p>for the Government. He said there were 47,000 NGOs in Egypt, working without any 
</p>
<p>interference or restrictions, and that the right to freedom of assembly and association were 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the new Constitution, which provided for the establishment of NGOs by 
</p>
<p>notification, forbade any intervention in their affairs and confined their dissolution to a 
</p>
<p>court order. A new association law, to be adopted by Parliament, was being discussed with 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations, of which 800 had been consulted so far. On 26 October, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Social Affairs announced that it would facilitate the registration process of 
</p>
<p>unregistered NGOs. The High Committee on legislative reforms was currently studying a 
</p>
<p>number of laws, including a transitional justice law, a law on the Statute of the National 
</p>
<p>Council for Human Rights, the establishment of a high commission for equality, the 
</p>
<p>definition of torture in line with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), an electoral law and a draft law on unions.  </p>

</p>
<p>greater protection. 
</p>

</p>
<p>83. The Plurinational State of Bolivia noted Egypt&#8217;s strategies on housing and to combat 
</p>
<p>unemployment. 
</p>
<p>84. Bosnia and Herzegovina commended the creation of the Ministry of Transitional 
</p>
<p>Justice. 
</p>
<p>85. Botswana commended progress regarding the rights of women, human trafficking 
</p>
<p>and legislative reform. 
</p>
<p>86. Brazil enquired about Egypt&#8217;s intention to ratify the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court and the optional protocols to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>87. Brunei Darussalam commended initiatives on education, especially to eradicate 
</p>
<p>illiteracy. 
</p>
<p>88. Burkina Faso commended Egypt&#8217;s efforts, particularly to protect civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>

</p>
<p>90. Cabo Verde commended the process to align legislation with the Constitution and 
</p>
<p>international standards. 
</p>
<p>91. The Central African Republic welcomed Egypt&#8217;s return to constitutional order and 
</p>
<p>implementation of a social policy. 
</p>
<p>92. Chile was pleased that Egypt was considering withdrawing reservations to 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments. 
</p>

</p>
