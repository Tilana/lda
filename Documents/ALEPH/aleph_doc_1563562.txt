ITEM 1.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
General 
 
Dane Exploration Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 3, 2010. We are an exploration stage corporation.(cid:160)We intend to be in the business of mineral property exploration.(cid:160)We do not own 
interests in any property, but have acquired the right to conduct exploration activities on two properties (the ‘Judy Claims’). These claims are staked on approximately 627.96 hectares of land located east 
of the village of Cassiar, British Columbia, Canada.(cid:160)We are engaged in exploration for gold and silver on the property.  
 
(Hereinafter Dane Exploration Inc. may herein be referred to: “Dane Exploration”, “Dane”, “We”, “Us”, the “Registrant”, or the “Company”). 
 
The Company’s common stock traded publicly on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTC-BB) market and its trading symbol is: DANE. 
 
Our fiscal year end is September 30th. 
 
 
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
The following risk factors should be considered in connection with an evaluation of the business of our business: 
 
Risks Associated With Mining: 
 
Mineral exploration and development activities are speculative in nature. 
 
Resource exploration and development is a speculative business, characterized by a number of significant risks including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to 
discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits which, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. The marketability of minerals acquired or 
discovered by our company may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond our control and which cannot be accurately predicted, such as market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of 
milling facilities, mineral markets and processing equipment and such other factors as government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of 
minerals and environmental protection, the combination of which factors may result in our company not receiving an adequate return of investment capital. 
 
Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves through drilling, to develop metallurgical processes to extract the metal from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to develop the mining 
and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. We cannot predict whether minerals will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grades to justify commercial operations or that 
funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis. Estimates of reserves, mineral deposits and production costs can also be affected by such factors as environmental permitting 
regulations and requirements, weather, environmental factors, unforeseen technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological formations and work interruptions. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately 
mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results. 
(cid:160)

(cid:160)  
(cid:160)  
Short term factors relating to reserves, such as the need for orderly development of ore bodies or the processing of new or different grades, may also have an adverse effect on mining operations and on 
the results of operations. Material changes in ore reserves, grades, stripping ratios or recovery rates may affect the economic viability of any project. 
 
All of our properties are in the exploration stage and therefore highly speculative in nature. We may not be able to establish the existence of any mineral resource on any of our properties in 
commercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we cannot earn any revenues from operations and if we do not do so we will lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration. If we do not 
discover any mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, our business could fail. 
 
We have not established that any of our mineral properties contain any mineral reserve, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not, our business could fail. A mineral 
reserve is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Industry Guide 7, which can be viewed at www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/forms/industry.htm#secguide7 as that part of a mineral 
deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.(cid:160)  The probability of an individual prospect ever having a 'reserve' that meets the 
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Industry Guide 7 is extremely remote; in all probability our mineral resource property does not contain any 'reserve' and any funds that we spend 
on exploration will probably be lost. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop our properties into 
producing mines and extract those resources. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. 
The commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the 
resource to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase 
costs and make extraction of any identified mineral resource unprofitable. 
 
Mineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulation which may block our ability to explore or develop our claims. Even if we discover a mineral resource in a commercially 
exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of that mineral resource. If we cannot exploit any mineral resource that we might discover on our 
properties, our business may fail. 
 
Both mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with 
respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine 
safety and other matters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration of our mineral properties or for the construction and 
operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could fail. 
 
We are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities but current laws and regulations could be amended and we might not be able to comply with them, as 
amended. Further, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not 
obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties.

(cid:160)  
If we establish the existence of a mineral resource on any of our properties in a commercially exploitable quantity, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a 
producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the resource, and our business could fail. 
 
If we do discover mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities on any of our properties, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the resource, develop 
processes to extract it and develop extraction and processing facilities and infrastructure. If we were to discover a major mineral deposit, there can be no assurance that such a resource will be large 
enough to justify commercial operations, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise the funds required for development on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or 
complete the necessary facilities and infrastructure, our business may fail. 
 
Mineral exploration and development is subject to extraordinary operating risks. We do not currently insure against these risks. In the event of a cave-in or similar occurrence, our liability may 
exceed our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our company. 
 
Mineral exploration, development and production involves many risks which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our operations will be 
subject to all the hazards and risks inherent in the exploration for mineral resources and, if we discover a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantity, our operations could be subject to all of the 
hazards and risks inherent in the development and production of resources, including liability for pollution, cave-ins or similar hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to 
insure. Any such event could result in work stoppages and damage to property, including damage to the environment. We do not currently maintain any insurance coverage against these operating 
hazards. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence would have a material adverse impact on our company. 
 
Mineral prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations. 
 
We expect to derive revenues, if any, either from the sale of our mineral resource properties or from the extraction and sale of precious metals such as gold, silver and base metals such as copper. The price 
of those commodities has fluctuated widely in recent years, and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including international, economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, 
currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to new extraction developments and improved extraction and 
production methods. The effect of these factors on the price of precious and base metals, and therefore the economic viability of any of our exploration properties and projects, cannot accurately be 
predicted. 
 
The mining industry is highly competitive and, in addition to risks directly related to our current exploration plans, there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in acquiring mineral 
claims or to exploit any minerals we may discover. If we cannot continue to acquire properties to explore for mineral resources, we may be required to reduce or cease operations. 
 
The mineral exploration, development, and production industry is largely un-integrated. We compete with other exploration companies who are either exploring existing mineral resource properties or 
seeking to locate and acquire mineral resource properties. However, we may need to compete with different competitors for the removal or sales of mineral products from our properties if we should 
eventually discover the presence of minerals in quantities sufficient to make production economically feasible. 
 
Readily available markets exist worldwide for the sale of mineral products. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell any mineral products that we identify and produce. However, in identifying and acquiring 
mineral resource properties, we compete with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities. This competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable 
prospects for exploration in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will acquire any interest in additional mineral resource properties that might yield reserves or result in commercial 
mining operations.

Supplies needed for exploration may not always be available. If we are unable to secure exploration supplies we may have to delay our anticipated business operations. 
 
Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies needed for our proposed exploration work could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies of certain products, equipment or materials. There 
is no guarantee we will be able to obtain certain products, equipment and/or materials as and when needed, without interruption, or on favorable terms. Such delays could affect our anticipated business 
operations and increase our expenses. 
 
Risks Related To Our Company: 
 
We have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. 
 
We have been in the business of exploring mineral resource properties since March 3, 2010 and we have not yet located any mineral reserves. As a result, we have never had any revenues from our 
operations. In addition, our operating history has been restricted to the acquisition of our mineral properties and this does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of our prospects if we ever 
determine that we have a mineral reserve and commence the construction and operation of a mine. We have no way to evaluate the likelihood of whether our mineral properties contain any mineral reserve 
or, if they do that we will be able to build or operate a mine successfully. We anticipate that we will continue to incur operating costs without realizing any revenues during the period when we are 
exploring our properties. We therefore expect to continue to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from mining operations 
and any dispositions of our properties, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. At this early stage of our operation, we also expect to face the risks, uncertainties, expenses and 
difficulties frequently encountered by companies at the start up stage of their business development. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and our 
failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and we can 
provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. 
 
There is a risk that we have not properly evaluated the potential benefit of our claims because our President and Sole Director has not personally visited the Judy 1 and McDame Mountain 
Properties. 
 
The Judy 1 and McDame Mountain claim properties have not yet been visited by our President and Sole Director. This fact potentially compromises the Company's assessment of the potential value of 
the claims and the Company's ability to properly assess all factors which may impact our exploration plans 
 
There is a risk that our assessment of the potential benefit of our property claims and our plans for exploration may be faulty because we have based these on a report provided to us by the vendor of 
the property claims. 
 
We have not yet performed any exploration work on our property claims and have based a large part of our assessment of the Judy 1 and McDame Mountains claims on a report provided to us by the 
vendor of the claims. We have also based our exploration plans largely on the recommendations included in this report. If this report is false, incorrect, misstated, or analysis in the report has been over-
valued by Dane, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise funds and the survival of the Company.

Our property claims are presently held in trust for us by an unrelated third party which may put us at risk if there were a dispute with this third party, or if there were malfeasance on the part of this 
third party. 
 
Canadian jurisdictions allow a mineral explorer to claim a portion of available Crown lands as its exclusive area for exploration by depositing posts or other visible markers to indicate a claimed area. The 
claims we have purchased were staked by a third party and these claims are presently recorded in the name of the third party and held in trust by him for the Company. Under British Columbia, law title to 
British Columbia mining claims can only be held by British Columbia residents. In the case of corporations, title must be held by a British Columbia corporation. Since we are an American corporation, we 
can never directly possess legal mining claim to the land. In order to comply with the law we will have to incorporate a British Columbia wholly owned subsidiary-corporation. We plan to incorporate such 
a wholly-owned subsidiary in British Columbia and expect at that time the third party will transfer all claim rights he holds in trust for us to that subsidiary. However, if the third party were to transfer title 
to another person and that deed were to be recorded in their name before we were to have the claims recorded in the name of our planned subsidiary, that other person would have superior title and we 
would have no title to the claims we have purchased. If this were to occur, we would have to cease or suspend operations on those claims and sue the third party for the loss of our investment. The loss 
of our claims and the cost of a lawsuit regarding a breach of fiduciary duty by the third party would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our company. 
 
Our mineral claims have an expiration date and we must make minimum mandatory exploration expenditures in order to maintain our mineral claims. 
 
In order to maintain its mineral claim tenure titles in good standing it is necessary for the Company or its agent to perform and record physical or other acceptable work with a prescribed value per hectare 
per year during each yearly period mandated by the British Columbia Mineral Titles Branch (each such period covering July 1st to June 30th of the following year). 
(cid:160)  
Based on the claims extension to December 24,(cid:160)
(cid:160)2014, further work expenditures must be performed as follows to maintain the claims: $nil fiscal year 2014; $7,242 for fiscal year 2015; $11,052 for fiscal year 
2016; $12,559 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Alternatively, if payments in lieu of work performed are used to maintain the claims, these costs translate to $nil for fiscal year 2014; 
$14,484 for fiscal year 2015; $22,104 for fiscal year 2016; $25,118 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Failure to do work or pay the cash in lieu will result in forfeiture of title and would 
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our company. 
(cid:160)  
Our activities will be subject to environmental and other industry regulations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 
Our company's activities are subject to environmental regulations promulgated by government agencies from time to time. Environmental legislation generally provides for restrictions and prohibitions on 
spills, releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with certain mining industry operations, such as seepage from tailing disposal areas, which would result in environmental 
pollution. A breach of such legislation may result in imposition of fines and penalties. In addition, certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. 
Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which means stricter standards and enforcement, fines and penalties for non-compliance are more stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed 
projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees. The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations could have an adverse effect 
on the financial condition of our company.

(cid:160)  
The operations of our company include exploration; and may include development activities and commencement of production on our properties, which requires permits from various federal, state, 
provincial and local governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor 
standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in the development and operation of mines and 
related facilities generally experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. 
 
Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease 
or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to 
compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations and, in particular, 
environmental laws. 
 
The fact that we have not earned any operating revenues since our incorporation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue to explore our mineral properties as a going concern. 
(cid:160)  
We have not generated any revenue from operations since our incorporation and we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating expenses without revenues unless and until we are able to identify a 
mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity on one or more of our mineral properties and we build and operate a mine. At September 30, 2013, we had cash in the amount of $1,310 and working 
capital deficit of $21,578. We incurred a net loss of $41,996 for the year ended September 30, 2013 and have incurred losses since inception of $118,578. If we are not successful in acquiring further 
shareholder advances from our President and/or successfully raising funds through other methods such as private placements of our common shares, we will not have sufficient financial resources to 
fund our exploration program and will have only limited funds to cover our administrative expenses. In this event, we may become insolvent and fail. 
(cid:160)  
Because we do not know of a lender who would provide funds for us to explore and develop our mineral properties, we expect it will probably be difficult or impossible to raise debt financing from 
traditional lending sources. To date we have raised our operating capital from sales of founder shares to, and receipt of shareholder advances from, our President, but there can be no assurance that we 
will continue to be able to do so because our President has limited financial resources. If we cannot raise the money that we need to continue exploration of our mineral properties, we may be forced to 
delay, scale back, or eliminate our exploration activities. If any of these were to occur, our business will fail. 
(cid:160)  
These circumstances have lead our independent registered public accounting firm to comment about our company’s ability to continue as a going concern in their audit opinion. Management's primary 
funding strategy is to raise additional capital through a public offering of its capital stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our 
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and potential classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in 
the event our company cannot continue in existence.

We currently rely solely on our President & CEO for management of our operations and the loss of this key individual could have an adverse effect on the Company. 
 
Our success depends to a certain degree upon our President & CEO and sole director. This individual is a significant factor in the our growth and success. The loss of the service of current management 
and board and any future additional members of management and the board could have a material adverse effect on our company. In particular, the success of our company is highly dependent upon the 
efforts of our either our current President & CEO, the loss of whose services would have a material adverse effect on the success and development of our company.(cid:160)Additionally, we do not anticipate 
having key man insurance in place in respect of our sole director and senior officer in the foreseeable future. 
 
We require substantial funds merely to determine whether commercial precious metal deposits exist on our properties and this creates a significant risk that we will fail. 
 
Any potential development and production of our exploration properties depends upon the results of exploration programs and/or feasibility studies and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers 
and geologists. Such programs require substantial additional funds. Any decision to further expand our operations on these exploration properties entails significant risks and is anticipated to involve 
consideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: 
 
  § 
  § 
  § 
  §  Market prices for the precious metals to be produced; 
  § 
  § 
 
Third parties may challenge our rights to our mineral properties or the agreements that permit us to explore our properties may expire if we fail to timely renew them and pay the required fees. 
 
In connection with the acquisition of our mineral properties, we sometimes conduct only limited reviews of title and related matters, and obtain certain representations regarding ownership. These limited 
reviews do not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title and, furthermore, our title may be defective. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we hold good and marketable title to 
all of our mining concessions and mining claims. If any of our concessions or claims were challenged, we could incur significant costs and lose valuable time in defending such a challenge. These costs or 
an adverse ruling with regards to any challenge of our titles could have a material adverse affect on our financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance that any such disputes or 
challenges will be resolved in our favor. 
 
We are not aware of challenges to the location or area of any of our mining claims. There is, however, no guarantee that title to the claims will not be challenged or impinged in the future. 
 
Our management has no formal geological or engineering training and limited experience in mineral activities and consequently our activities, earnings and ultimate financial success could be 
irreparably harmed. 
(cid:160)  
Our management has no formal geological or engineering training and limited experience with exploring for, starting, and operating a mine. With no direct training and limited experience in these areas, 
management may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within the industry. Management's decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or 
managerial approaches mineral exploration companies commonly use. Consequently, our activities, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management's lack of 
experience in the industry.

Our success is dependent on current management, who may be unable to devote sufficient time to the development of our business; this potential limitation could cause the business to fail. 
(cid:160)  
Dane is heavily dependent on our sole officer and director.(cid:160)If something were to happen to him, it would greatly delay its daily operations until further industry contacts could be established. Furthermore, 
there is no assurance that suitable people could be found to replace this individual. In that instance, Dane may be unable to further its business plan. 
(cid:160)  
Because title to the property is currently held in the name of another person, if that person transfers the property to someone other than us, we will cease activities. 
(cid:160)  
Title to the properties upon which we intend to conduct exploration activities is not currently held in our name. Title to the property is recorded in the name of a third party who presently holds the 
property in trust for the Company for exploration upon the property. If the owner transfers the property to another third person, the other third person will obtain good title and we will have nothing. If 
this should occur, we will subsequently not own any property and we will have to cease all exploration activities. 
 
As our business assets and our director and officer are located in Canada; investors may be limited in their ability to enforce US civil actions against our assets or our director and officer. You may 
not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of your investment caused by wrongful actions by our director. 
(cid:160)  
Our business assets are located in Canada and our sole director and officer is a resident of Canada. Consequently, it may be difficult for United States investors to affect service of process within the 
United States upon our assets or our sole director and officer, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. 
A judgment of a U.S. court predicated solely upon such civil liabilities may not be enforceable in Canada by a Canadian court if the U.S. court in which the judgment was obtained did not have 
jurisdiction, as determined by the Canadian court, in the matter. There is substantial doubt whether an original action could be brought successfully in Canada against any of our assets or our sole 
director and officer predicated solely upon such civil liabilities. You may not be able to recover damages as compensation for a decline in your investment. 
 
Risks Associated With Our Common Stock: 
 
Our CEO and Sole Director has voting control of the Company due to his majority ownership position and this may negatively impact the interests of other shareholders. 
(cid:160)  
Our sole director and officer presently has effective voting control of our Company and this may negatively impact other investors if our sole director and officer does not act in their interests, or 
administer the Company effectively, because other shareholders are presently not be able to successfully vote to remove our sole director and officer from his positions with the Company. 
 
Dane is designated as a 'Shell Company' which may negatively affect trading of our shares. 
 
The SEC, through Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, has defined a 'Shell Company' as being a company (other than an asset-backed issuer), 
which has “no operations; and either no or nominal assets; assets consisting of solely cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other 
Assets.” Dane is presently designated as a 'Shell Company' and this designation may have a negative impact on investor interest in the Company.

Our stock price is subject to fluctuation because we are publicly traded.(cid:160)
 
Dane Exploration is publicly listed on the OTCBB under the symbol DANE. The market price for our common stock will vary from the $0.02 price included in our two public common stock offerings. Market 
price fluctuations may occur in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control and we cannot be certain that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be 
sustained. 
 
Trading on the OTCBB and other over the counter trading systems can be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our 
stockholders to sell their shares. 
 
Trading in stock quoted on the OTCBB and other over the counter trading systems (such as the OTCQB, or Pink Sheets) is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many 
factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility may depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, 
neither the OTCBB and other over the counter trading systems are stock exchanges, and trading of securities on these systems is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation 
system like NASDAQ, or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty selling their shares at any particular point in time. 
 
Shareholders may experience dilution of ownership. 
 
Since inception, we have experienced negative cash flow from operations and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future.(cid:160)We expect to require working 
capital to fund our operations.(cid:160)We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms when required, or at all.(cid:160)If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, or are unable to repay 
the debt, then we may cease operations, become insolvent, declare bankruptcy or be otherwise wound up, all of which may result in the loss of all or substantially all of the investment capital of the 
shareholders. We are authorized to issue up to 250,000,000 common shares.(cid:160)We have the authority to issue more of the shares, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, 
without the consent of any of the shareholders.(cid:160)If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity -related or debt securities, the securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior 
to those of the rights of the Common Stock and those stockholders may experience additional dilution. Purchasers of shares will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book 
value per share of their investment in the shares. 
 
Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations and FINRA’s sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and 
sell our stock. 
 
Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) 
less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice 
requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors”. The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 
$5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a 
transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the 
nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and 
its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer

(cid:160)  
and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s 
confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that 
the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of 
trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We 
believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 
 
In addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a 
broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, 
broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, 
FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA’s requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to 
recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. 
 
Other Risks: 
 
Because we have only one officer and director who is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure, in the future, there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to 
comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines, penalties and assessments against the Company. 
(cid:160)  
We currently have only one officer and director.(cid:160)As such, he is solely responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls 
under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls are implemented, he will be responsible for the administration of the controls. Should he not have sufficient experience, he may be incapable of 
creating and implementing the controls which may cause the Company to be subject to sanctions and fines by the Securities Exchange.(cid:160)  
 
We are unable to predict and articulate all trends, risks and uncertainties which may negatively impact our business and/or your investment. 
 
We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that 
we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, including those which 
may not be noted in the above risk factors descriptions.

Summary Description and Location 
 
The Judy Claims are located 2 km (1.5 miles) northeast of Cassiar, British Columbia, Canada and lie at high elevation on McDame Mountain. The area has a long history of mineral exploration. The 
geological setting is a structurally complex area of Sylvester allochthon and Cassiar batholith granitic intrusions and appears favorable for the discovery of epithermal gold and silver deposits. The 
tenures comprise an area of 627.96(cid:160)hectares (1551.68 acres) (see figures 4 and 5) and are road accessible at elevations from approximately 1100 meters (3600 feet) to more than 1500 meters (5000 feet). 
(Please see Glossary of Certain Technical Terms on page 23 for definitions of geological terms used herein). 
 
Regional History 
 
The general Liard mining district of northwest British Columbia since 1874 has been a prolific producer of placer gold and is the site of several important deposits of metallic and non-metallic minerals. The 
area has been in recent years mapped by scientists from the British Columbia provincial Ministry of Energy and Mines who expanded upon the pioneering studies of the Canadian federal Geological 
Survey of Canada (especially Gabrielse, 1963 and Price, 1949-53) and the formerly enigmatic geology of the area has been rationalized and revealed in publications of that Ministry. Ground acquisition 
prospecting and mineral explorations activities currently are being pursued at a very elevated pace with particular attention to gold, molybdenum, and base metal occurrences. Placer mining operations 
continue to yield important amounts of gold each year. 
 
The Cassiar area was subjected to several episodes of mineral exploration and prospecting. The earliest of which resulted from the Hudson Bay fur buying activity on the Dease River leading to the 
discovery of placer gold on McDame Creek in 1874. 
 
R. Sylvester established a trading post at the mouth of McDame Creek in 1872. The post was taken over in 1875 by the Hudson Bay Company and maintained to 1943. 
 
Placer gold was discovered on McDame Creek in 1874 and Walker Creek in 1877. 
 
G. M. Dawson (1889), W. Pike (1896) and C. Camsell (1954) gave accounts of travel on and near Dease River before the turn of the century. The trail from Sandpile Creek, east of Deadwood Lake, to 
McDame and Lower Post was described by J.D. Moodie of the Royal North-west Mounted Police in a report on a trip from Edmonton to the Yukon (1899). Equipment for the construction of Watson Lake 
airport in 1941 was brought by barge down Dease River from Dease Lake to Lower Post. About this time a paddle-wheel steamer was used on Dease River between Lower Post and McDame Post. After 
limited service the steamer was wrecked in Two Mile Rapids. 
 
Construction of the Alaska Highway in 1942-1943 contributed greatly to the development of the area. During the winter of 1946-47 Moccasin Mines Limited, with the assistance of the British Columbia 
government, constructed a road from the Alaska Highway to McDame Creek. This road provided the first all-land route to the area and thus stimulated prospecting and exploration. 
 
The Cassiar Asbestos deposit was staked in 1950 and from that time the town of Cassiar grew until the mine closure in 1994. 
 
In the middle years of the last century, helicopter usage facilitated access to the wilderness areas beyond the Stewart Cassiar Highway corridor and concomitantly geochemical survey techniques came 
into use. Unlike the development of the mining industry in the central parts of the province where many porphyry-type copper and copper-molybdenum deposits were discovered and, in many cases, 
placed in production, no similar mines resulted from that work. Several gold occurrences however received substantial amounts of exploration.

Mineral search in the Cassiar area has been mostly inactive in recent decades and, as a generalization, the area can be described as being “under-explored”. 
 
Starting in year 2003, there has been a dramatic revival of prospecting activity in all of British Columbia. The Cassiar district has benefited from renewed enthusiasm and confidence within the mining 
industry that has resulted from the escalation of metal prices and the recovery of the junior mineral exploration sector. It has been the site of much claim staking and acquisition. 
 
Description of Properties 
 
Ownership Interest 
(cid:160)  
On July 22, 2010, the Company purchased the Judy 1 claim tenure 1024577 and the McDame Mountain claim tenure 1024578 (collectively the ‘Judy Claims’) located in Northwest British Columbia, Canada 
from Mr. S.G. Diakow, an independent prospector. The Judy Claims are presently registered to Mr. S.G. Diakow and are held in trust for Dane Exploration Inc. A mineral exploration license is issued for one 
year.(cid:160)In order to maintain the claims, we must we must perform work on the claims or pay a fee in lieu of work expenditures. As long as the fees are paid, no work has to be performed to maintain the claims 
in good order. The renewal fees may increase in the future. We do not own any real property interest in the claims or any other property. 
(cid:160)  
The Company plans to explore and potentially develop the Judy Claims. In order to maintain its mineral claim tenure titles in good standing it is necessary for the Company or its agent to perform and 
record physical or other acceptable work with a prescribed value per hectare per year during each yearly period mandated by the British Columbia Mineral Titles Branch (each such period covering July 
1st to June 30th of the following year). 
 
Based on the extension of the claims to December 24, 2014, further work expenditures must be performed as follows to maintain the claims: $nil fiscal year 2013; $6,194 for fiscal year 2014; $9,419 for fiscal 
year 2015; $11,052 for fiscal year 2016; $12,559 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Alternatively, if payments in lieu of work performed are used to maintain the claims, these costs 
translate to $nil for fiscal year 2013; $12,387 for fiscal year 2014; $18,839 for fiscal year 2015; $22,104 for fiscal year 2016; $25,118 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Failure to do work 
or pay the cash in lieu of work will result in forfeiture of title. 
 
Access 
 
The Judy Claims are located at high elevation in a dissected plateau terrane and for practical purposes are best accessed by 4 wheel drive vehicle or an all terrain vehicle. Highway 37, the old paved 
Stewart-Cassiar highway which was used to truck asbestos to the Pacific Ocean Port at Stewart, B.C. passes along the southern claim boundary of the Judy Claims. At this juncture an old mining road 
climbs McDame Mountain to the centre of the Judy Claims block. Over 90% of the claim block is above tree line. The claims can be easily worked by driving to the property and staying at either the village 
of Cassiar or at Jade City on Highway 37. A local labor force is available at the native village of Good Hope Lake 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) north along Highway 37 from the claim access road.

Climate and Vegetation 
 
The Cassiar Mountains receive moderate precipitation but the bordering areas, Stikine Plateau to the west and Dease Plateau and Liard Plain to the east are relatively dry. Average annual precipitation 
over a 12-year period at Watson Lake in the Liard Plain, as reported by the Meteorological Division of the Canadian Department of Transport in 1954, was 16.75 inches. Of which 7.70 inches fell as snow 
(77 inches of snow). In the Cassiar Mountains the average annual precipitation averages approximately between 20 and 30 inches per year. 
 
June, July and August, are the warmest and wettest months during which unsettled weather is experienced and showers are frequent. In early August of 2009 temperatures of 85 degrees Fahrenheit (‘F’) 
were recorded on eight successive days. The average daily maximum temperature during the summer months, however, is generally between 50º and 70º F. 
 
January and February are the coldest months and temperatures may fall below -60º F. Snowfall is light in Dease River valley west of the Horseranch Range and horses have wintered successfully without 
cut hay for many years near the north end of the range. 
 
The months of June, July, August and September are most suitable for prospecting although snow may hamper work in the mountains until the middle of June and after mid-September. 
 
Much of the area is below timber-line, about 4,500 feet above sea-level. White spruce and cottonwood are the largest trees and grow mainly in the moist but well-drained stream valleys. Gravel and sand 
terraces flanking the main streams support a growth of lodgepole pine, trembling aspen, and some birch. Black spruce and larch are abundant in poorly drained areas. Larch is particularly abundant in the 
valleys of Red, Deadwood and lower Dease Rivers. Dwarf birch, willow, balsam fir, slide alder, and juniper are locally abundant near timber-line. Willow grows along most of the stream courses. Willow, 
Labrador tea, sedges cotton grass, and peat moss are common in swamps and bogs. 
 
Grassy slopes and meadows are found in many parts of the area and the tree-line is commonly at about 1500 metres (5000 feet).

Physiography 
 
The Cassiar Mountains occupy the southwest and southern parts of the McDame map sheet National Topographic Series (NTS) 104 P. This is a rugged region exhibiting many features typical of alpine 
glaciations and having a maximum relief of about 4,000 feet. The principle rivers flow through the mountains in deep, relatively broad, U-shaped valleys. All streams belong to the Arctic drainage system 
and flow into Liard River or its tributaries. Structural trends in underlying rocks appear to be a major control for valleys of the southeasterly flowing part of Red River, Wadin Creek, and streams east of 
Solitary Lake. Elsewhere stream directions and structural trends in underlying bedrock are apparently not related. 
 
Geology of Claims 
 
The ground covered by the Judy claim group appears from maps in H. Gabrielse Memoir 319 to be underlain by Devonian Sylvester Group rocks that are in contact with Cassiar intrusives. The Judy 
Claims were located by map-staking following the British Columbia Mineral Titles Online process by Mr. S.G. Diakow. They are situated northeast of the Cassiar Batholith. and are located in Ancestral 
North America terrain in the northwesterly continuation of the Cassiar intrusives. In the vicinity of the Judy Claims there is a Cornucopia occurrence located on Quartzrock Creek about 9 kilometers east of 
Cassiar. This area is within the Sylvester allochthon, which is composed of Devonian-Triassic volcanic, sedimentary and ultramafic rocks, and these same rocks underlay the Judy Claims. The allochthon 
is locally bounded by the Cassiar batholilth to the west and overlies Paleozoic platformal rocks to the east. 
 
Mineral Potential of the Judy 1 and McDame Mountain Claim Area 
 
Mr. Diakow has been on the claim properties and reports that the properties have not previously been drilled; and that numerous quartz veins can be observed. These veins have not been sampled and 
therefore little is known about mineralization associated with the veins. 
(cid:160)  
Regional Geology 
 
Within the Cassiar–area, stratified, consolidated rocks of marine origin range in age from Proterozoic to Mississippian. The assemblage has been folded and faulted, and intruded by Mesozoic granitic 
rocks.(cid:160) The Intermontane Belt at this latitude is composed of predominantly Mesozoic arc volcanic and arc-derived sedimentary rocks some Tertiary sediments and basalts occur locally. 
 
The Cassiar mining district is geologically varied and complex (Figure 5). It is bordered to the west by a series of small mountain ranges raised plateau’s and large fjord like lakes including some that are 
over a hundred miles in length. The plateaus are dominated by Mesozoic strata of mixed volcanic and volcanogenic formations. The central sector is a more mature terrain underlain by Devonian and 
Mississippian meta sediments of the Sylvester Group whereas the Intermontane Belt at this latitude is composed of predominantly Mesozoic arc volcanic and arc-derived sedimentary rocks. Sylvester 
Group sedimentary rocks of oceanic origin are intruded by the Cassiar Batholith. These intrusive rocks are made up of Quartz monzonite, granodiorite, granite, pegmatites, aplite and porphyritic granite. 
 
The district is structurally complex, with numerous northwesterly-striking fault complexes, some of which are of crustal scale and profound and can be traced far from the area of concern in this report, 
others are splays that create imbrications or slivers of the various formations. 
 
Several contrasting geological terrains are present in the Cassiar (Liard) mining district. Each has the potential to host important mineral deposits. Gold quartz veins are found where granitic intrusions are 
in contact with Meta sediments but are mainly significant as probable sources of placer gold. Other possible deposits include molybdenum, asbestos magnesium, and massive sulphide copper–zinc 
deposits. The strong fault zones and related structures offer opportunities to locate mineral deposits associated with hydrothermal systems that may have exploited the fractures and other weaknesses.

Overview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues 
 
Canadian jurisdictions allow a mineral explorer to claim a portion of available Crown lands as its exclusive area for exploration by depositing posts or other visible markers to indicate a claimed area. The 
process of posting the area is known as staking. 
(cid:160)  
All Canadian lands and minerals which have not been granted to private persons are owned by either the federal or provincial governments in the name of Her Majesty. Un-granted minerals are commonly 
known as Crown minerals. Ownership rights to Crown minerals are vested by the Canadian Constitution in the province where the minerals are located. In the case of the company's property, that is the 
Province of British Columbia. In the nineteenth century the practice of reserving the minerals from fee simple Crown grants was established. Legislation now ensures that minerals are reserved from Crown 
land dispositions. The result is that the Crown is the largest mineral owner in Canada, both as the fee simple owner of Crown lands and through mineral reservations in Crown grants. Most privately held 
mineral titles are acquired directly from the Crown. The company's property is one such acquisition. Accordingly, fee simple title to the company's property resides with the Crown. 
 
Underground metal mines generally involve higher grade ore bodies. Less tonnage is mined underground, and generally the higher grade ore is processed in a mill or other refining facility. This process 
results in the accumulation of waste by-products from the washing of the ground ore. Mills require associated tailings ponds to capture waste by-products and treat water used in the milling process. 
 
Capital costs for mine, mill and tailings pond construction can easily run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are factored into the profitability of a mining operation. Metal mining is 
sensitive to both cost considerations and to the value of the metal produced. Metals prices are set on a world-wide market and are not controlled by the operators of the mine. Changes in currency values 
or exchange rates can also impact metals prices. Thus changes in metals prices or operating costs can have a huge impact on the economic viability of a mining operation. 
 
Environmental protection and remediation is an increasingly important part of mineral economics. Estimated future costs of reclamation or restoration of mined land are based principally on legal and 
regulatory requirements. Reclamation of affected areas after mining operations may cost millions of dollars. Often governmental permitting agencies are requiring multi-million dollar bonds from mining 
companies prior to granting permits, to insure that reclamation takes place. All environmental mitigation tends to decrease profitability of the mining operation, but these expenses are recognized as a cost 
of doing business by modern mining and exploration companies. (cid:160)
 
Mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally 
becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and our operations are presently in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all 
material respects. We expect in the future to make expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. 
(cid:160)  
Every mining activity has an environmental impact. In order for a proposed mining project to be granted the required governmental permits, mining companies are required to present proposed plans for 
mitigating this impact. In the British Columbia, where our properties are located, no mine can operate without obtaining a number of permits. These permits address the social, economic, and environmental 
impacts of the operation and include numerous opportunities for public involvement and comment.

Compliance with Government Regulation 
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in Canada generally, and in British Columbia 
specifically. 
 
We will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental mediation for all exploration and development work undertaken. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know 
the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the currently planned work programs. Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any 
resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered. 
 
If we enter into production, the cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will be greater than in the exploration phases because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and 
regulations will control all aspects of any production program if the project continues to that stage because of the potential impact on the environment.

(cid:160) 
A processing plant that produces a concentrate of the valuable minerals or metals contained in an ore. The concentrate must then be treated in some other type of plant, such as a 
smelter, to affect recovery of the pure metal, recovery being the percentage of valuable metal in the ore that recovered by metallurgical treatment.

(cid:160) 
The economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource.(cid:160)  Appropriate assessments, often called feasibility studies, have been carried out and include 
consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social, and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate, at the time of, that extraction is reasonably justified. Mineral reserves are sub-divided, in order of increasing confidence, into probable and proven categories. A 
probable reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated (and in certain circumstances, measured) resource. A proven reserve is the economically mineable part of a 
measured resource.

Mineral Resource  A deposit or concentration of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic substance in
such quantity and at such grade or quality that extraction of the material at a profit is currently or potentially possible. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing 
geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. An inferred resource designation comes from limited sampling data insufficient for verification of deposit 
quantity and quality, but it is usually supported by limited geological, geochemical and geophysical data. An indicated resource designation comes from sampling data spaced 
closely enough to allow certain assumptions of deposit quantity and quality and to clearly establish its mineral content. Finally, a measured resource designation comes from 
sampling data spaced closely enough to allow confirmation of deposit quantity and quality and to allow a preliminary evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
(cid:160) 
A mineralized body, which has been delineated by appropriate drilling and/or underground 
(cid:160) 
sampling to support a sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal(s). Under SEC or standards, such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until a comprehensive evaluation, 
based upon unit cost, grade, recoveries, and other factors, conclude economic feasibility. 
(cid:160) 
The fifth period of the Paleozoic Era beginning about 350 million years ago and ending about 320 million years ago. The Mississippian System (referring to rocks) or Period (referring 
to the time during which these rocks were deposited) is employed in North America as the lower (or older) subdivision of the Carboniferous, as used in Europe and on other 
continents.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 
 
Our common stock is quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board stock market ("OTC-BB") under the symbol: 'DANE'. Because we are quoted on the OTC-BB, our securities may be less liquid, 
receive less coverage by security analysts and news media, and generate lower prices than might otherwise be obtained if they were listed on a major national securities exchange. 
 
The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for our Common Stock per quarter as reported by the OTC-BB since we were listed on July 1, 2013 through to our fiscal year end of September 30, 
2013. These prices represent quotations between dealers without adjustment for retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

Description of Business 
(cid:160)  
Dane Exploration Inc. was incorporated on March 3, 2010, in the state of Nevada and initiated business operations as a mineral exploration company at that time. Since inception the Company has not 
been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor has it been involved in any reclassification, consolidation, or merger arrangements. The financial statements included in this 
Form 10-K have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and our fiscal year end is September 30th. Dane has been in the 
exploration stage since its formation and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company was formed for the purposes of acquiring exploration and development stage mineral 
properties and Dane has begun implementation of its strategic plans through the purchase of mineral exploration claims in Northwest British Columbia, Canada. 
 
On July 1, 2013, the Company’s common stock became traded publicly on the OTC-BB under the symbol: DANE. 
 
Experience of our Chief Executive Officer 
 
Between 1972 to 1974, our CEO Mr. Christie held a Free Miners License issued by the British Columbia and Yukon Chamber of Miners which provided him with the right to prospect in all unclaimed areas 
throughout British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. His exploration and mining experience includes owning claims and directly working as an on-site prospector on a small gold and silver exploration 
project. This project was located in and around the Dominion-Sulphur Placer Area, Yukon, Canada and specifically focused on Dominion Creek, Gold Run Creek and Sulphur Creek. The project ran from 
1972 to 1974 and the staff complement included Mr. Christie and a business partner. The partners shared responsibility for all duties including: claim staking; filing and acquisition of claims; developing an 
exploration plan; purchasing supplies and logistics for movement of supplies to work sites; performing exploration work; cooking and camp management; health and safety; preparation of samples for 
assay; assay administration; and remediation of the work-sites.

(cid:160)The Judy 1 and McDame Mountain claim sites are located at an approximate elevation of 5,000 feet and can be subject to severe winter weather conditions. The field season at this elevation 
generally covers a period of June 1st to October 15th. As a result, we expect that the Initial Field Work component of Phase One will not be completed before August 2014. If we do not raise 
sufficient capital by late August 2014 to fund our Phase One Initial Field Work, this component of Phase One will be merged into Phase Two and our estimated completion date for Phase One 
Initial Field Work will be moved to July 2014.

Overview of Our Mineral Exploration Business 
 
Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. Successful exploration often results in increased project value that can be realized through the optioning or selling of 
the claimed site to larger companies. As such, we intend to acquire properties which we believe have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals. These acquisitions have and may take the form 
of mining claims on provincial land, or leasing claims, or private property owned by others. An “unpatented” mining claim is an interest that can be acquired to the mineral rights on open lands of the 
provincially owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the rules and regulations pursuant to laws of British Columbia established by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum 
Resources. 
 
We plan to perform basic geological work to identify specific drill or trenching targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling or trenching to confirm the presence of 
mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). We may enter into joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration work. We may 
include in our plans properties that may have been previously identified by third parties, including prior owners such as exploration companies, as mineral prospects with potential for economic 
mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects may either have some prior exploration 
history or may have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. Our current geographic focus is on northern British Columbia. The focus of our activity will be to acquire properties that 
we believe to be undervalued; including those that we believe to hold previously unrecognized mineral potential. (cid:160)

The Judy 1 and McDame Mountain claim properties have not yet been visited by our President and Sole Director. This fact potentially compromises the Company's assessment of the potential value of 
the claims and the Company's ability to properly assess all factors which may impact our exploration plans. 
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods 
 
Large and well capitalized markets are readily available for all metals and precious metals throughout the world. A very sophisticated futures market for the pricing and delivery of future production also 
exists. The price for metals is affected by a number of global factors, including economic strength and resultant demand for metals for production, fluctuating supplies, mining activities and production by 
others in the industry, and new and or reduced uses for subject metals. The mining industry is highly speculative and of a very high risk nature. As such, mining activities involve a high degree of risk, 
which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Few mining projects actually become operating mines. 
 
The mining industry is subject to a number of factors, including intense industry competition, high susceptibility to economic conditions (such as price of metal, foreign currency exchange rates, and 
capital and operating costs), and political conditions (which could affect such things as import and export regulations, foreign ownership restrictions). Furthermore, the mining activities are subject to all 
hazards incidental to mineral exploration, development and production, as well as risk of damage from earthquakes, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to or loss of property and 
equipment and possible environmental damage. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are also involved in mineral exploration and development. 
 
Mineral Exploration Industry and Licensing 
 
The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral 
exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the 
equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions 
available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders. 
Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available 
to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This 
advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and 
development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future 
mineral exploration properties. 
We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of 
investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. 
 
The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that 
investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior 
mineral exploration companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral exploration supplies 
and drill rigs.

General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of exploration and mining legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the government of the Province of 
British Columbia, the government of Canada and the governments of other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and 
demand for mineral exploration. 
 
(cid:160) Petroleum Resources ('BC Mines') is responsible for exploration permitting and the Canadian Federal Government becomes involved at a later stage 
The British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and(cid:160)
when the project is further developed and meets standards which requires Federal environmental permit approvals. Phase Two of our proposed exploration program will require approval of an application 
to BC Mines which is expected to take approximately six weeks. During this six week period BC Mines will also refer the permit application to aboriginal stakeholders, which in this case is the Dease River 
Band, for a period of 15 days. 
 
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring or developing profitable precious or base metal properties or interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable 
precious or base metal properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the mineral exploration industry by:

Expenses 
 
Our operating expenses are classified into four categories: 
(cid:160)
-(cid:160) Exploration costs  
-(cid:160)  Professional & consultant fees 
-(cid:160) Administrative expenses  
-(cid:160)  Impairment of mineral properties
Exploration costs 
Exploration costs totaled $nil for the year ended September 30, 2013 compared to $7,688 for the year ended September 30, 2012. Expenses for the Exploration Stage totaled $8,999. The year over year 
decrease in these expenses was due to a delay in implementation of our exploration plans due to limited capital reserves. During fiscal 2012, these expenses were comprised of costs for an aerial 
geophysical survey, due diligence work, and property maintenance charges. We cannot at this time accurately predict the level of these costs during fiscal 2014. 
 
Professional & consultant fees 
Professional & consultant fees are comprised of fees for work performed by audit, legal and accounting professionals. During the year ended September 30, 2013 these fees totaled $20,408 compared with 
$18,208 for the year ended September 30, 2012. For the Exploration Stage, these costs totaled $64,454. The moderate year over year increase in these expenses was related to legal and accounting costs 
arising from our initiative to become publicly traded. We anticipate professional & consultant fees will decrease moderately during the fiscal 2014. 
 
Administrative Expenses 
Administrative expenses were $21,588 for the year ended September 30, 2013 compared with $10,193 during the year ended September 30, 2012. For the Exploration Stage, administrative expenses totaled 
$37,625. These expenses are comprised of Edgar agent filing fees, stock transfer agent fees and general office expenses. The year over year increase in these expenses was primarily related to EDGAR 
filing and regulatory costs from our initiative to become publicly traded. We anticipate administrative expenses will decrease during the upcoming fiscal year. 
 
Mineral Properties Impairment 
As required by generally accepted accounting principles, at year end date of September 30, 2013 the Company undertook a review of the Company’s exploration projects and affirmed an impairment charge 
of $7,500 which had been recorded against mineral property purchases during the year ended September 30, 2010. Mineral properties impairment charges were $nil for the year ended September 30, 2013 
and totaled $7,500 for the Exploration Stage. 
 
Net (Loss) 
We incurred a net loss of $41,996 for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared with a net loss of $36,089 for the period ended September 30, 2012. For the Exploration Stage, the Net Loss totaled 
$118,578.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or 
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
Contractual Obligations 
 
The Company has no material contractual obligations outstanding. 
 
Material Events and Uncertainties 
 
Our operating results are difficult to forecast. Our prospects should be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable early stage companies in rapidly 
evolving markets. There can be no assurance that we will successfully address such risks, expenses and difficulties. 
 
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have expensed all development costs related to our establishment.

specific skills to assist with various aspects of its project evaluation, due diligence, acquisition initiatives, corporate governance and property management and will hire additional staff as needed. 
 
Critical Accounting Policies 
(cid:160)  
Dane’s financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of 
estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also 
affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying 
accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the 
preparation of our financial statements. 
 
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in NOTE 2 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations, Dane 
views certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on Dane’s financial statements and require management to use a greater 
degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

SADLER, GIBB & ASSOCIATES, L.L.C.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors 
Dane Exploration Inc. 
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Dane Exploration Inc. (an Exploration Stage Company) (the Company) as of September 30, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations, 
stockholders’  deficit  and  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended,  and  for  the  period  March  3,  2010  (date  of  inception)  to  September  30,  2013.(cid:160)
(cid:160)These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the 
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal 
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
(cid:160)  
In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dane Exploration Inc. (an Exploration Stage Company) as of September 30, 2013, and 
the results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2013, and for the period September 23, 2010 (date of inception) to September 30, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles. 
(cid:160)  
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company will need additional working capital to service its debt and for its 
planned activity, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these matters are also described in the notes to the financial statements. 
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1 – Operations 
 
Organization and Description of Business 
 
Dane Exploration, Inc. (“Dane”, "Dane Exploration", “We”, the “Registrant”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 3, 2010. Since inception the Company has not been 
involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor has it been involved in any reclassification, consolidation, or merger arrangements. The financial statements included herein have 
been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and our fiscal year end is September 30th. The Company's common stock is quoted on the 
Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board stock market ("OTC-BB") under the symbol: 'DANE'. 
 
Exploration Stage Activities 
 
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. Dane Exploration was formed for the purposes of acquiring 
exploration and development stage mineral properties. The Company has begun implementation of its strategic plans and has purchased mineral exploration claims in Northwest British Columbia, Canada. 
 
 
NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding Dane’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s 
management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and have been 
consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements, which are stated in U.S. Dollars. Amounts shown for September 30, 2012 are based upon the audited financial statements of that date. 
 
The financial statements reflect the following significant accounting policies: 
 
Exploration Stage Company 
 
The Company is an exploration stage company.(cid:160)The Company is devoting substantially all of its present efforts to establish a new business and none of its planned principal operations have 
commenced.(cid:160)As an exploration stage enterprise, the Company discloses the deficit accumulated during the exploration stage and the cumulative statements of operations and cash flows from inception to 
the current balance sheet date.

NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Exploration Costs and Mineral Property Right Acquisitions 
 
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially 
capitalized when incurred. The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under Accounting Standards 930 Extractive Activities – Mining (ASC 930). An impairment loss is recognized when the 
sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral property. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral 
property over its estimated fair value. No impairment losses were recorded during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 or September 30, 2012, respectively. 
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Basis and Diluted Loss per Common Share 
 
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The denominator in this 
calculation is adjusted to reflect any stock splits or stock dividends. Diluted loss per share is calculated using the treasury method which requires the calculation of diluted loss per share by assuming that 
any outstanding stock options with an average market price that exceeds the average exercise prices of the options for the year, are exercised and the assumed proceeds are used to repurchase shares of 
the Company at the average market price of the common shares for the year. An incremental per share effect is then calculated for each option. The denominator of the diluted loss per share formula is the 
number common shares outstanding at balance sheet date plus the incremental shares assumed to be issued from treasury for option exercises, less the number of shares assumed to be repurchased, 
weighted by the period they are assumed to be outstanding. This dilution calculation did not affect current fiscal year results because the Company does not have an Option Plan and has not issued any 
stock options; nor equity securities equivalents such as warrants. 
 
Stock-based Compensation 
 
The Company follows ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation, which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus 
on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award 
of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must 
be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options; nor has it made any awards of stock, or stock equivalents.

NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements", requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value 
hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the 
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
 
Level 1: 
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2: 
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or 
can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
 
Level 3: 
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
 
The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and shareholder advances. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, 
which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their 
nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 
 
It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns using the 
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities using enacted rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse and upon the possible realization of net operating loss carry-forwards.

NOTE 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
 
The Company will periodically analyze its long-lived assets for potential impairment, assessing the appropriateness of lives and recoverability of unamortized balances through measurement of 
undiscounted operation cash flows on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
Start-up Costs 
 
The Company expenses the cost of start-up activities, including organizational costs, as those costs are incurred. 
 
Foreign Currency 
(cid:160)  
The books of the Company are maintained in United States dollars and this is the Company’s functional and reporting currency. Transactions denominated in other than the United States dollar are 
translated as follows with the related transaction gains and losses being recorded in the Statements of Operations: 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
Monetary items are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing as at the balance sheet date; 
Non-Monetary items including equity are recorded at the historical rate of exchange; and 
Revenues and expenses are recorded at the period average in which the transaction occurred.
(cid:160)  
During the years ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012, the Company was not involved in any transactions which required translation of foreign currencies. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of cash on hand and demand deposits in banks with an initial maturity of 90 days or less. 
 
Risks and Uncertainties 
 
The Company is subject to substantial business risks and uncertainties inherent in starting a new business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient revenues or obtain 
sufficient funds necessary for launching a new business venture. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
Various accounting pronouncements have been issued during 2013 and 2012, none of which are expected to have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.

Other 
 
The Company paid no dividends during the periods presented. 
 
The Company consists of one reportable business segment. The Company has no revenue to report from any customers. 
 
Advertising is expensed as it is incurred. 
 
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as at September 30, 2013, or September 30, 2012. 
 
 
NOTE 3 – Going Concern 
 
Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company had a net loss of $41,996 for the year 
ended September 30, 2013; has an accumulated deficit of $118,578 for the period from March 3, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2013; and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt 
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Going forward, management will attempt to acquire additional operating capital through public or private offerings of our shares and through 
debt issuances, until our strategic initiatives create revenue. However, there is no assurance that any equity or debt offerings will successfully raise sufficient funds to assure the eventual profitability of 
the Company. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be 
necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. 
 
 
NOTE 4 – Acquisition of Mineral Properties and Impairments on(cid:160)
 
On July 22, 2010, the Company purchased the Judy Mineral Claims located in Northwest British Columbia, Canada from an independent prospector, for cash of $7,500. As of September 30, 2010, the 
Company did not have sufficient geological evidence to establish a reserves estimate. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $7,500, which was recorded in its financial statements 
during the year ended September 30, 2010. 
 
 
NOTE 5 – Related Party Transactions & Shareholder Advances 
 
During the year ending September 30, 2013, related party transactions included further advances from our president to the Company of $11,000 and payments to our president of $7,705, leaving and ending 
balance of $11,000 payable to our president at September 30, 2013. During the year ended September 30, 2012, the president advanced $1,980 to the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing and 
are payable on demand.

NOTE 6 – Commitments and Contingencies 
 
In order to maintain its mineral claim tenure titles in good standing it is necessary for the Company or its agent to perform and record physical or other acceptable work with a prescribed value per hectare 
per year during each yearly period mandated by the British Columbia Mineral Titles Branch (each such period covering July 1st to June 30th of the following year). If acceptable work is not performed, the 
Company must pay the equivalent sum as cash in lieu of work at double the work assessment rate. Failure to do work or pay the cash in lieu will result in forfeiture of title. 
(cid:160)  
The Judy 1 claim Tenure 1024577 and the McDame Mountain claim Tenure 1024578 each now have an expiry date of December 24, 2014. During the year ended September 30, 2013, new claim tenure dates 
were established through the filing of a work report with the Government of British Columbia Mineral Titles Branch and through fees in lieu of exploration work performed. 
(cid:160)  
Based on the claims extension to December 24, 2014, further work expenditures must be performed as follows to maintain the claims: $nil fiscal year 2014; $7,242 for fiscal year 2015; $11,052 for fiscal year 
2016; $12,559 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Alternatively, if payments in lieu of work performed are used to maintain the claims, these costs translate to $nil for fiscal year 2014; 
$14,484 for fiscal year 2015; $22,104 for fiscal year 2016; $25,118 for fiscal year 2017 and for each subsequent fiscal year. 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)  
NOTE 7 – Common Stock 
 
On March 18, 2012, the Company issued a total of 1,825,000 common shares related to its first public offering of shares. These shares were sold to non-related parties at a price of $0.02 per share for total 
consideration of $36,500 as part of an offering of 25,000,000 common shares which the Company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') through filing of a Form S-1 which was 
deemed effective by the SEC on September 19, 2011 and which expired on March 18, 2012. 
 
On September 27, 2012, the Company issued 50,000 common shares related to its second public offering of shares. These shares were sold to a non-related party at a price of $0.02 per share for total 
consideration of $1,000 as part of an offering of 25,000,000 common shares which the Company registered with the SEC through filing of a Form S-1 which was deemed effective by the SEC on September 
27, 2012 and expired on March 25, 2013. 
 
On November 19, 2012, the Company issued an additional 1,725,000 common shares which had been sold to non-related parties at a price of $0.02 per share for total consideration of $34,500 as part of its 
second public offering of common shares. Total proceeds from the Company's second public offering of shares totalled $35,500.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
(cid:160)  
There were no disagreements with our accountants regarding accounting and financial disclosure matters. 
 
 
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
(cid:160)  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, 
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15
(e). The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company's desired disclosure control objectives. In designing and 
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of 
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company's 
certifying officer has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in reaching that level of assurance. 
 
As of the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief 
Executive Officer and the Company's Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Section 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
As of September 30, 2013, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the criteria established by COSO management concluded that the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2013, as a result of the identification of the material weaknesses described below.

(cid:160)  
A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim 
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
Specifically, management identified the following control deficiencies: (1) The Company has not properly segregated duties as one or two individuals initiate, authorize, and complete all transactions. The 
Company has not implemented measures that would prevent the individuals from overriding the internal control system. The Company does not believe that this control deficiency has resulted in 
deficient financial reporting because the Chief Financial Officer is aware of his responsibilities under the SEC's reporting requirements and personally certifies the financial reports; (2) The Company has 
installed accounting software that does not prevent erroneous or unauthorized changes to previous reporting periods and does not provide an adequate audit trail of entries made in the accounting 
software. Accordingly, while the Company has identified certain material weaknesses in its system of internal control over financial reporting, it believes that it has taken reasonable steps to ascertain that 
the financial information contained in this report is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management has determined that current resources would be appropriately applied 
elsewhere and when resources permit, they will alleviate material weaknesses through various steps. 
 
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to 
attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to(cid:160)
report. 
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the Certifying Officers reviewed our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) 
under the Exchange Act as of the Evaluation Date and concluded that no changes occurred in such control or in other factors during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deficiencies identified include the inadequate segregations of duties, lack of controls over procedures used to enter transactions into 
the general ledger, and lack of appropriate review of the reconciliations and supporting workpapers used in the financial close and reporting process. Due to the potential pervasive effect on the financial 
statement account balances and disclosures and the importance of the annual and interim financial closing and reporting process, in the aggregate, management concluded that there was more than a 
remote likelihood that a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements could occur and would not be prevented or detected. 
 
Remediation Plan 
 
Addition of staff 
It is our determination that additional staff will be required to properly segment the accounting duties of the Company. However, we do not currently have resources to fulfill this part of our plan and will 
be addressing this matter in the future after sufficient resources have been raised.

project was located in and around the Dominion-Sulphur Placer Area, Yukon, Canada and specifically focused on Dominion Creek, Gold Run Creek and Sulphur Creek. The project ran from 1972 to 1974

Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 
The duties of an audit committee were assigned to the full board via a resolution executed March 4, 2010. Due to limited resources and the fact that the Company is in its exploration stage, it has not yet 
been able to recruit and compensate an expert for the Audit Committee.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of any class of our equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and 
reports of changes in ownership with the Commission. Executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our equity securities are required by Commission regulations to 
furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
 
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us under Rule 16a-3(d), and certain written representations from our sole executive officer and director, we are unaware 
of any required reports that were not timely filed, including compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to, and which has been signed by, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary and Treasurer

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 
(cid:160)  
Under SEC rules, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such 
security, or the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed 
to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock.
