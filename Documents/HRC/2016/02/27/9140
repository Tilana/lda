<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report sets out the findings of a mission that the independent expert undertook 
to Liberia from 6 to 20 July 2008. Over the course of this mission, the independent expert met 
high-level representatives of the executive and legislature, government officials, civil society, 
United Nations agencies and funds, some traditional rulers and the diplomatic community. 
The information received served as valuable inputs for the independent expert&#8217;s assessment of 
progress, concerns, challenges and gaps with regard to the promotion and protection of human 
rights in Liberia. 
</p>
<p> This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/31 in which the 
Council invited the independent expert to submit a final report at the ninth session. 
</p>
<p> For the first time in the history of Liberia, the Government led by President Johnson 
Sirleaf, has actually brought governance to the people by periodically holding cabinet meetings 
in the counties. Many ministries are effectively planning programmes taking into account the 
need for greater control at county level. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is nearing 
completion of its core activities, with public hearings coming to a close, and an extension of its 
mandate to December 2008 has been agreed. Furthermore the launching of a judicial training 
centre, and the possible introduction of paralegals in the very near future, are positive 
developments in the move to strengthen a weak judiciary. 
 The installation of a new democratically elected Government which took office in 
January 2006 has led to accelerated progress on a number of human rights and development 
issues including economic and social rights. Rehabilitation of some schools and hospitals and 
construction of new premises, the adoption and launching of the Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper following a consultative process were all much needed achievements. 
</p>
<p> Serious concerns remain however. One of the key defining elements of an effective 
national human rights protection system is the existence of an effective national independent 
human rights commission. While acknowledging the progress that has been made since the last 
report, the independent expert urges the Government to speedily establish this body which 
should be mandated by the enabling legislation to function in full compliance with the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p> There is an urgent need for far-reaching reforms in the policing, judiciary and correction 
sectors. In addition, action needs to be taken to ensure that protective and punitive measures are 
enforced in relation to the ongoing scourge of sexual violence. The lack of protection for 
children who represent the future of this nation must be addressed immediately. The persistence 
of harmful traditional practices which include the inflicting of trials by ordeal on suspected 
witches and other alleged offenders of local communities, and the practice of female genital 
mutilation, is a major concern. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> The primary responsibility for the protection of its citizens lies with the Government and 
clear policy choices must be made. However, support should also be forthcoming from the 
international community in a timely and effective manner to address capacity gaps within 
Government structures. In particular the necessary resources for the implementation of the key 
Poverty Reduction Strategy must be found. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert concludes the report with a set of recommendations for the 
Government of Liberia, the international community and the United Nations. The Government of 
Liberia needs the support of all actors in its efforts to re-establish the rule of law and the 
administration of justice, but it must demonstrate a willingness to discharge its obligations under 
international law and protect its citizens. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PREVIOUS REPORT 
</b></p>
<p>1. The last report of the independent expert on technical cooperation and advisory services 
in Liberia (A/HRC/7/67) noted that the Independent National Commission on Human Rights 
had not been established, despite the enabling legislation dating back to 2005, and no 
commissioners had been appointed. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) had 
established a secretariat and the recruitment of an executive secretary was completed, together 
with the adoption of revised rules and regulations. The TRC had commenced public hearings and 
concern was expressed that new members of the International Technical Advisory Committee, 
who could provide legal capacity, were not in place. The enabling legislation for the law reform 
commission, which had been a stated priority under the Government&#8217;s 150-day programme, had 
not been drafted. Serious concerns were also expressed about the persistence of discriminatory 
and harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and trial by ordeal. The lack 
of adequate protection for the most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as children, women 
and the disabled was particularly noted. The need for respect for the rule of law and specifically 
the need to address the weak and dysfunctional judiciary, were identified as key components of 
an effective promotion and protection of human rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Security and political situation 
</b></p>
<p>2. The increase in armed robbery constitutes a significant internal security threat. 
The Liberian National Police (LNP) launched Operation Thunderbolt in an effort to curb this 
phenomenon but a long-term and sustainable strategy which takes into account the extreme 
poverty and the high unemployment rate in Liberia needs to be developed. 
</p>
<p>3. There are a number of other internal situations which may pose a security threat if not dealt 
with. The resort to violence to resolve land and property disputes, as recently witnessed in 
Margibi County with the killing of 14 casual labourers and further disputes in Maryland, Bong 
and River Cess counties, is a worrisome trend. This is a conflict resolution area deserving of 
attention. There is also the need for greater attention to the corrections sector. An overcrowded 
Monrovia Central Prison and lack of respect for the judicial guarantees of detainees are giving 
rise to tensions which must be addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>4. At the time of writing public hearings have been conducted by the TRC in all counties and 
in the diaspora, and hearings are due to be held in Monrovia in the coming month, where 
witnesses who have not voluntarily provided evidence are to be subpoenaed. Furthermore an 
information management system has been put in place by the TRC and the statements collected, 
during the earlier statement-taking activities, are being analysed to determine patterns of 
violations. 
</p>
<p>5. Concern has been expressed about the inadequate witness and victim protection system. 
The independent expert has received information in relation to cases of harassment and 
intimidation and while an ad hoc protection system has been set up it may prove to be ineffective 
in the long term. Measures to provide protection need to be put in place. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. The TRC has functioned without the members of the International Technical Advisory 
Committee (ITAC). The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) has in fact nominated a member but he is not yet in place. The Economic Community 
Of West African States (ECOWAS) which is due to nominate the other two members of this 
three-member committee, has not yet made any nominations. 
</p>
<p>7. The extension of the mandate for three months to December 2008 is welcomed by 
the independent expert and it is hoped that the Commission will produce a comprehensive 
report which will include specific follow-up measures to ensure the timely and effective 
implementation of its recommendations. These recommendations should include provisions on 
reparation programmes and suggestions for reforms to prevent abuses in the future. This final 
report should serve as the Commission&#8217;s most enduring legacy. It is imperative that a workplan 
with identified benchmarks be developed so that this process can be concluded in an organized 
and timely manner. 
</p>
<p>8. It should be remembered however that the TRC is only one element of what should be 
a comprehensive transitional justice strategy. The Government must also take steps to put 
in place effective mechanisms and programmes to provide reparation, in all its forms, to citizens. 
This is primarily the responsibility of the State and steps should be taken even before the 
recommendations of the TRC are issued in its final report. The many victims, including those of 
rape and sexual violence, are living with the consequences of the abuses suffered in that period. 
Victims of rape in particular are now facing multiple discrimination. National reconciliation 
must be vigorously pursued. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Independent National Commission on Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>9. The amendments to the enabling legislation which was first adopted in 2005 are presently 
before the legislature. It is critical that any amendments do not compromise the independence of 
the Commission and that the enabling legislation provide for a body that is in full compliance 
with the Paris Principles as endorsed by the General Assembly in 1993.<b>1</b> The independent expert 
is encouraged by the engagement of civil society in this process and met with representatives of 
civil society to discuss suggested changes to the proposed legislation amending the enabling act, 
such as the power of the Commission to seek enforcement of its decisions where necessary, and 
the establishment of criteria for the Commissioners. 
</p>
<p>10. The Commission will have several important functions including advising the Government 
on the human rights situation and making recommendations. In particular the Commission will 
reinforce the rule of law by enhancing an area that is often overlooked in the justice sector. 
This relates to complaints in connection with the behaviour of Government officials that 
may not rise to the level of crime but infringes on human rights and amounts to administrative 
misconduct. It is important that the Government show commitment to addressing this area
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Resolution 48/134. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in order to promote good governance and enhance public confidence in State institutions. In 
addition, the Independent National Commission on Human Rights will also be the primary 
mechanism for the implementation of any recommendations arising out of the final report of the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission pursuant to the enabling legislation for the TRC.  
</p>
<p>11. It is imperative that any further delays which might arise in the creation of this national 
human rights commission be urgently addressed, particularly in light of the fact that the TRC is 
due to complete its mandate shortly. Ensuring implementation of any recommendations made by 
the TRC will need this mechanism to be in place. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Legislature 
</b></p>
<p>12. The independent expert in her meetings with the legislature stressed the importance of 
parliamentarians as essential actors in the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition 
to adopting laws their functions include adopting the budget and supervising the executive to 
ensure that the laws are respected. In this connection, parliament was commended for recently 
passing positive bills, including the enabling legislation for the anti-corruption commission and 
the freedom of information bill, and undertaking public hearings on key human rights bills. 
</p>
<p>13. However the adoption of the bill to amend the New Penal Law of 1976 on 15 July 2008 
provides for the death penalty. The bill was introduced in reaction to public outcry following the 
upsurge in armed robberies in Monrovia. Liberia acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2005 and thus has a legal obligation to 
abolish the death penalty. The independent expert reminded the Government of its obligation 
under this instrument and of General Assembly resolution 62/149 calling for a moratorium on 
the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL REFORM AND RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Review of national legislation 
</b></p>
<p>14. In July 2008 the draft enabling legislation for the establishment of the law reform 
commission was with the lower house of parliament. This is a positive development and the 
operationalization of this commission must be a priority for the Government as it will be 
responsible for constitutional review, reviewing the compatibility of domestic legislation with 
international human rights standards, and ensuring that current and future international and 
regional human rights treaties are domesticated. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>15. Liberia needs to move more quickly to effectively establish the rule of law and the 
administration of justice throughout the country. While there are many institutions involved in 
the rule of law, and promoting transparency and accountability in the overall public 
administration is critical, the key institutions of the judiciary, the police and the corrections</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>service deserve particular attention. A lack of public confidence in the State authorities together 
with a lack of resources may create a dangerous dynamic if not addressed, and seen to be 
addressed, in a decisive manner. Failing to address the existing lack of confidence within the 
population could have a devastating impact on reform efforts. 
</p>
<p>16. The justice sector should receive immediate attention as reform in this area is central to 
peace, security, development and respect for human rights. The independent expert welcomes 
recent developments to address the lack of qualified personnel within the judiciary. Notably the 
launching of the Judicial Training Institute will provide training to personnel at all levels of the 
judiciary, and will include orientation programmes for new judicial staff as well as continuing 
legal education for current members of the judiciary. In addition, the future use of paralegals in 
the Liberian legal system who will not function as qualified lawyers but will be in a position to 
offer legal advice, thereby increasing people&#8217;s access to justice, is to be welcomed. 
</p><p>17. However, at present the weak and dysfunctional judiciary is resulting in many trials being 
conducted in violation of fair trial standards, trials are repeatedly postponed and courts remain 
inoperational. In River Cess County the circuit court has remained inoperational since the 
opening of the May Term of court hearings and in Lofa County the court closed its May term 
early. Furthermore Justices of the Peace (JPs) have continued to hear cases even though their 
commissions have expired. They have no legal authority to exercise judicial functions but in 
Bong County for example the JP is still operating and has the use of a detention cell. In River 
Gee County a JP is operating on the basis of a letter of authority from the county attorney, while 
the law clearly provides that only the President has the power to appoint and commission JPs. 
</p>
<p>18. It is clear that there is need for assistance to the judiciary in a variety of ways including 
improving the management and administration of the courts, training of all judicial personnel, 
and provision of the material resources necessary to run a judicial system. Training and support 
must also be provided to both prosecutors and defence lawyers, to assist with the smooth running 
of the sector. 
</p>
<p>19. Much work has been done in the area of police reform and the United Nations Mission 
in Liberia (UNMIL) has assisted with the training of 3,700 new members of the Liberian 
National Police (LNP). However all this training will do little to enhance respect for human 
rights and the rule of law if the police are not managed properly, are not provided with vehicles, 
communication equipment or sufficient fuel and if an effective oversight body is not in place to 
ensure accountability of the police to the community it serves. It is vital that gaps in institutional 
capacity be addressed. Reform of the LNP is a multifaceted effort and the independent expert 
was encouraged to hear of ongoing plans, such as the research being carried out by UNMIL and 
the police service into options for a better accountability system. 
</p>
<p>20. The corrections sector is sometimes referred to as the anchor of the criminal justice system 
and is in need of urgent attention. Monrovia Central Prison is overcrowded which places a big 
strain on the utilities and facilities in the prison. It currently holds over 960 detainees with 
only 38 staff. Separate blocks for female and juvenile detainees were recently constructed with 
donor funding. However 95 per cent of the detainees held in the prison are pretrial detainees 
some of whom have been held without trial for over two years. This is as a result of a weak and 
dysfunctional judicial system, inadequate investigation of cases, alleged corruption which results 
in prisoners&#8217; cases not being brought to court without payment of a fee, absence of legal aid for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>poor prisoners who cannot afford the services of defence counsel, lack of sufficient courts to 
handle cases and a shortage of prosecutors. The common call from detainees during the visit of 
the independent expert was simply that they wanted to go to court. Failure to observe the legal 
and procedural guarantees for pretrial detainees is a serious challenge to respect for human rights 
in prisons. 
</p>
<p>21. The independent expert was deeply concerned at the degree to which the norms for the 
protection of persons accused of crime, and deprived of liberty by the authorities, have not been 
respected. In particular access to medical and mental health care was woefully inadequate. 
Failure to respect and protect basic rights leads to tension within the prison population and given 
the high ratio of prison staff to detainees (1:22) this is effectively also a security issue. 
</p>
<p>22. A holistic approach, which seeks to address all components of the criminal justice system, 
must be taken if the situation in the corrections sector in Liberia is to be effectively tackled. Such 
an approach would demand training for prosecutors who, some interlocutors felt, were too slow 
in prosecuting cases but were also guilty of proceeding with charges where insufficient evidence 
existed. Thus, individuals who should not be deprived of their liberty are entering the criminal 
justice system. Such individuals are remanded and then unnecessarily held in pretrial detention. 
Their cases are not being processed through the court system in a timely manner.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. Unless the deficiencies in the rule of law are addressed, including those identified above, 
impunity will not be successfully tackled. This is currently one of the greatest challenges facing 
Liberia today. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights of women 
</b></p>
<p>24. Rape and sexual violence remain the most frequently committed serious crimes in Liberia. 
In addition most health facilities are inaccessible to victims who seek comprehensive emergency 
care and available facilities are not sufficiently equipped and lack adequate drugs, medical 
supplies and health professionals trained in the clinical and psychological management of 
victims of gender-based violence. There has been no significant improvement in the weak 
implementation of the revised provisions of the criminal code related to rape, which came into 
effect in January 2006, as reported in earlier reports.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>25. However a lot of good work is being done by the Government of Liberia, together with 
UNMIL, in this area. The awareness campaign launched jointly by the Government of Liberia 
and UNMIL in December 2007 has led to an increase in the reported incidents of rape and this 
effort is likely to be further strengthened by the planned dissemination of the relevant 
provisions of the penal code on rape and sexual violence. Furthermore the national action plan 
on gender-based violence is to be supported by a four-year joint United Nations/Government 
programme. Assistance for the establishment of a special unit within the Ministry of Justice to 
prosecute gender and sexual violence cases, accompanied by appropriate capacity-building 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  A/HRC/4/6 and A/HRC/7/67. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>measures, will be part of this programme. The decision in May 2008 to dedicate a court to 
hearing cases of gender and sexual violence cases in Monrovia, the establishment of which has 
been advocated for two years by the Association of Female Lawyers of Liberia, is yet another 
positive development. 
</p>
<p>26. The new safe house, which is being run by the local non-governmental organization 
(NGO) Touching Humanity in Need of Kindness (THINK) and supported by the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), is a critical support measure and should allow for support to be 
given to women outside of Monrovia. In rape cases, police and prosecutors rely heavily on 
medical evidence, excluding other forms of both incriminating and exculpatory evidence that 
should be investigated. Owing to the culture of impunity that allows perpetrators of gender-based 
violence to go unpunished, victims of this type of violence are usually hesitant in seeking 
assistance or reporting the crimes. The stigmatization associated with victims of gender-based 
violence makes coming forward for assistance difficult and, at times, dangerous. These 
difficulties are compounded by economic challenges and gaps in legal, protection, health and 
psychosocial services that fail to ensure the confidentiality and support services that victims 
need. This situation discourages victims of rape from reporting cases to the police. 
</p>
<p>27. The independent expert was alarmed to find that there has been no change in the rate of 
maternal mortality. While acknowledging the policies and programmes that the Ministry of 
Health and Social Welfare has formulated to address the causes of maternal mortality the 
independent expert urged that this matter be given greater priority. There should be no 
discrimination against women because of their reproductive function. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government is to be commended for efforts undertaken in July 2008 to secure 
ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights 
of Women in Africa. Article 4 calls for the elimination of violence against women in public and 
in private. In order to effectively implement the Protocol and the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), including general recommendation 
No. 19 (1992) on violence against women of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the independent expert urged the Government to begin the 
process of drafting a comprehensive domestic violence bill. Civil society should play a key role 
in this process. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights of children 
</b></p>
<p>29. The recommendations of the Child Protection Network Task Force on Orphanages in 2006 
were not implemented, which further highlights the lack of protection of these vulnerable 
members of society. Illegal orphanages remain open. A second task force concluded its report 
and made recommendations in 2008. This report has not been made public. In addition the 
standard minimum rules for the upkeep of orphanages, which were also adopted by the Ministry 
in 2006, set out a maximum occupancy rate of 50 in each orphanage. This is not respected and is 
undermining the decision to close illegal orphanages. Effectively the Government&#8217;s decision to 
pay subsidies to all orphanages, including illegal ones, for each child even where the numbers 
exceed the recommended maximum of 50, is perpetuating the injustice and lack of protection. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. In relation to international adoptions, the existing legislation is outdated, and although 
information was received that draft legislation which seeks to incorporate international standards 
is being considered, it is important that a moratorium on adoptions be maintained until revised 
legislation and guidelines which conform to international standards are in force. 
</p>
<p>31. Another aspect of the lack of protection for children relates to the protection of school 
girls. There is no provision on sexual abuse in the Education Law of Liberia and recent cases of 
approximately 30 teenage pregnancies in one school highlight the need to address this aspect of 
child protection as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Harmful traditional practices 
</b></p>
<p>32. Harmful and discriminatory traditional and customary practices such as trial by ordeal, 
female genital mutilation, and early child marriage continue to exist. The recent initiative of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs to hold consultations with traditional leaders of the 15 counties on 
the challenges of eliminating harmful traditional practices and to seek to harmonize the beliefs 
and values of the traditional system with international and regional human rights framework is 
welcome. There is a great need for continual awareness raising and particularly to emphasize the 
negative health implications for women and girls, and the community as a whole. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>33. The independent expert was encouraged by the role of civil society in initiating the 
freedom of information bill which was passed by Parliament in July 2008. An active civil society 
is a vital element in an effective human rights protection system. No reforms will be successful 
and lead to real change without the support and input of this sector. 
</p>
<p>34. The independent expert was encouraged to see the coordinated manner in which the 
amendments to the enabling legislation for the independent national human rights institution 
were examined and commented upon by civil society, representatives of which then attended 
the committee hearings at the Senate to make their views known and advocate for change. 
This should be replicated in all areas relating to strengthening promotion and protection of 
human rights and significant capacity-building is needed. The international community has an 
important role to play and to truly build participation by groups working on human rights, 
justice, women&#8217;s rights, children&#8217;s rights, the rights of the disabled and of the mentally ill, means 
that they must be involved in planning, research, and developing strategies and budgets. 
</p>
<p>35. It is essential and critical to the sustainability of projects and programmes that civil society 
organizations also be involved in mechanisms for the evaluation of reforms and in seeking 
accountability in cases of non-performance or misbehaviour. Labour law reform and advocating 
for improvement in workers&#8217; conditions are issues on which these groups could have a strong 
impact. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. It is encouraging to hear of the work being done by many NGOs, together with the 
international community, with children of school age through human rights clubs so that future 
leaders and parents of this country will be familiar with human rights values from a young age. 
Fighting discrimination is a long-term goal and civil society must be empowered to take the lead 
on this issue, and especially in relation to the rampant discrimination against women evidenced 
by the high level of violence against them. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Linkage between poverty and human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>37. Poverty should be seen as multidimensional and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP), which was drafted following an extensive consultation process and which was 
enthusiastically welcomed at the Berlin Conference in June 2008,<b>3</b> recognizes this fact. The 
Poverty Reduction Strategy seeks to build a foundation for rapid, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth and also to ensure the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the delivery of basic 
social services. It is important that the fundamental human rights principles of accountability and 
non-discrimination - particularly geographic and ethnic - be respected throughout the 
implementation process. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>38. Many people in Liberia do not enjoy the right to food. Currently 40-45 per cent of the 
population is moderately to highly food insecure, and the need for both short-term and long-term 
strategies to deal with this situation is pressing. The current situation is being exacerbated by the 
global food security crisis and the rise in fuel prices. In order to mitigate its effects on the 
population the Government has made priority interventions to try and ensure access to affordable 
food, particularly to vulnerable households. Such measures include the removal of consumer tax 
on rice and negotiating with partners to ensure availability. A comprehensive action plan to 
increase food production is also being put in place by the Ministry of Agriculture. The school 
feeding programme has received a boost following recent commitments by the World Food 
Programme, so the nutritional requirements of schoolchildren are met. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to work, fair remuneration and regular payment of wages 
</b></p>
<p>39. The fact that studies on labour law reform are now finalized by the Ministry, and an issues 
paper has been produced, is a welcome development. The archaic laws, some of which are 
over 20 years old, are in need of radical review to bring them in line with international standards. 
The establishment of a national tripartite committee on which employers, workers and 
Government are represented is an important step to promoting social dialogue. 
</p>
<p>40. However the high rate of unemployment and vulnerable employment is cause for concern 
and underlines the need for independent and effective trade unions. In both the public and private

</p>
<p>sectors workers are obliged to face substandard and often dangerous conditions. In particular the 
situation for workers on rubber plantations has not significantly improved, despite previous 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Right to physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>41. Revitalization of the health-care sector has begun and projects for the rehabilitation of the 
JFK Hospital in Monrovia are ongoing. However the current system is not adequately funded 
and equipped. The impending withdrawal of non-governmental organizations working in this 
sector, now that Liberia is moving from the emergency to the development phase, will place 
additional pressure on the national health system particularly at a time when more Liberian 
refugees are returning. 
</p>
<p>42. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has an ambitious five-year health plan and 
during the visit of the independent expert a conference to review the first year of implementation 
took place. The provision of a basic package of health services to each community is central to 
this plan and is welcomed by the independent expert. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>43. Given that education is the primary vehicle by which economically and socially 
marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty, the critical state of the 
education system is of major concern. The Ministry of Education has an ambitious five-year 
programme, scheduled to start in September 2008. Five counties in the south-east, River Cess, 
River Gee, Grand Kru, Sinoe and Maryland counties, have been identified as particularly 
deprived and are to be targeted first. In an effort to address the inequitable distribution of 
educational facilities throughout the country, schools are to be rehabilitated or constructed and 
textbooks distributed so as to reduce the current pupil to textbook ratio in primary schools. Most 
importantly creative teacher training opportunities are to be provided. 
</p>
<p>44. The education of the girl child is to be the subject of a specific programme at the Ministry, 
which includes affirmative action. In this regard, it is important to encourage parents to ensure 
their daughters complete their primary education and progress to secondary level and beyond. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVIOUS 
RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE  
INDEPENDENT EXPERT 
</b></p>
<p>45. The establishment of the Judicial Training Institute should allow for implementation of the 
recommendation made in the previous report in relation to the necessity for gender sensitivity 
training for judges and judicial staff. 
</p><p>46. The independent expert notes with satisfaction that the Ministry of Health and 
Social Welfare is working with its partners to mitigate the negative impact caused by the 
gradual withdrawal of the non-governmental organizations which had assisted in the critical 
health sector. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. The extension of the mandate of the TRC to December 2008 is welcomed. 
The independent expert is further encouraged by the commitments made in the PRSP and 
other programmes to ensure equitable distribution of funds and services. Progress has been made 
towards the establishment of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights and the 
law reform commission. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  GAPS AND CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Government and its partners should take all measures to ensure that discrimination and 
marginalization in political and economic terms, as well as access to effective justice, are 
addressed so that the mistakes of the past, which had such tragic consequences, are not repeated. 
The Government has drafted and is in the course of implementing programmes in the area of 
economic and social rights and this implementation needs to be constantly monitored and 
evaluated so that any needed adjustments can be made promptly. There is a great need to move 
forward with a national conference on the rule of law with the assistance of UNMIL so that a 
national policy and framework can be put in place. 
</p>
<p>49. The domestication of international human rights instruments, many of which were acceded 
to in 2005, is crucial to an effective national human rights protection system so that citizens can 
enjoy these rights at the national level. The political will required to move this process must be 
demonstrated and civil society can play a pivotal advocacy role in this context. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Government of Liberia faces serious challenges in rebuilding its economy and society 
and in meeting its obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights guarantees. Some 
progress has been made, notably with the elaboration of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and 
ongoing plans by various line ministries have the potential to contribute to the enjoyment of 
human rights and the delivery of basic services. 
</p>
<p>51. Since the inauguration of the present Government in 2006 remarkable progress has been 
achieved. A milestone in this process was the successful launching of the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy in Berlin in June 2008. Indicators for key economic and social growth continue to 
improve, with economic growth close to 10 per cent. School enrolment has also risen. In 
addition, Liberia actually reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC initiative for 
debt relief in March 2008. Nonetheless, in spite of this progress the situation in Liberia remains 
fragile. 
</p>
<p>52. A joint Government and United Nations security assessment in all 15 counties carried out 
in May 2007 indicates that there is an urgent need to improve the institutional capacity of the 
national security and rule of law agencies. Many Liberians continue to have little confidence in 
the Liberian National Police and the justice system, and as a result some people resort to 
extrajudicial measures including mob violence. There are still too many gender-related violent 
crimes such as rape. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. Dealing with the many remaining challenges requires great political commitment. It is the 
responsibility of the State to ensure the necessary measures and protection systems are in place. 
This will require clear policy choices to be made and allocation of budgetary resources to the 
critical areas identified in this report, e.g. protection of children, police, judiciary and 
corrections. In this connection the role of Parliament is crucial. It should be an active and vocal 
partner in reform efforts. The international community has a very important role to play as 
funding of reforms is a major challenge and provision of technical and advisory services 
throughout this process is equally crucial. The support of an active civil society is an essential 
ingredient to ensure that reforms are implemented and sustained. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> To reinforce the progress made in Liberia in improving its human rights situation,

</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Eliminate harmful and discriminatory traditional and customary practices; 
 (i) Draft, in full consultation with civil society, a comprehensive bill on domestic 
violence.</b> 
</p>
<p>56. <b>The independent expert invites donor countries to:

Strategy in a timely manner; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Assist the Government to establish safe havens for victims of rape and domestic 
violence in all the 15 counties. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Furthermore, the independent expert calls on the United Nations Mission in Liberia 
to continue to support capacity-building in both Government and civil society, including 
non-governmental organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The independent expert calls on the United Nations System to continue to provide all 
possible assistance, particularly in the areas of human rights, peace, security and 
development. </b></p>
