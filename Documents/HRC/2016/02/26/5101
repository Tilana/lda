</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by

including, with respect to States parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless 
Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and

and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 64/127<b> </b>of 18 December 2009, in which, inter 
alia, the Assembly urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
to continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and reducing 
statelessness and protecting stateless persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the important work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees in seeking to address and prevent the problem of statelessness, as guided by, 
in particular, the conclusion of its Executive Committee on identification, prevention and 
reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 3 
December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations<b> </b>because of 
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 55/153 of 12 December 2000, 59/34 of 2 
December 2004 and 63/118 of 11 December 2008 on the work of the International Law 
Commission on the nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States,

including the question of the form that might be given to the relevant draft articles on 
nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States prepared by the 
International Law Commission, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects 
persons belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the independent expert on 
minority issues on the subject of the right to nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of 
persons of their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness and, in this regard, expressing concern at various forms of discrimination 
against stateless persons that may<b> </b>violate the obligations of States under international 
human rights law, </p>


<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose 
nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the right to a nationality of every human person is a 
fundamental human right; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on 
discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status is a violation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their 
nationality on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and 
legislation render a person stateless; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with principles of international law, in particular by 
preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Acknowledges</i> that 2011 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of 
the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,<b> </b>and<b> </b>encourages States that have not 
acceded to the Convention and to the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 
to consider doing so; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Notes</i> that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of an individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be 
affected by poverty, social exclusion and legal incapacity which have an adverse impact on 
their enjoyment of relevant civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, in particular 
in the areas of education, housing, employment and health; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recalls</i> that every child has the right to acquire a nationality, and recognizes 
the special needs of children for protection against arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that all children are registered at birth, and notes 
the importance of standardized and effective procedures for civil registration and identity 
documentation in order to help prevent arbitrary deprivation of nationality and 
statelessness; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also calls upon<b></b></i><b> </b>States to observe minimum procedural standards in order to 
ensure that decisions concerning the acquisition, deprivation or change of nationality do not 
contain any element of arbitrariness and are subject to review, in conformity with their 
international human rights obligations;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 11. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to ensure access of persons arbitrarily deprived of 
their nationality to effective remedies, including, but not limited to, restoration of 
nationality; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Secretary-General submitted 
in accordance with Council resolution 10/13 (A/HRC/13/34);<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges</i> relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and appropriate 
treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to continue with the ongoing collection of information on the issue of human 
rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources and to take account </p>


<p>of such information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their reports and 
activities conducted within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact that 
arbitrary deprivation of nationality may have on the enjoyment by persons of their human 
rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and to present it to the 
Council at its nineteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this matter.
