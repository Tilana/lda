<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, conducted a mission to Israel from 3 
to 10 July 2007, and visited the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the introductory section of the 
present report, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the particular challenge of combating 
terrorism in this region and the devastating violence suffered by all civilians living there. 
Section II addresses the overall framework of applicable law in which measures taken by Israel 
against terrorism should be examined, including the interplay between international human rights 
law and humanitarian law. It also addresses the state of emergency declared by Israel and 
potentially positive developments on the issue of derogation and legislative reform. However, of 
noted concern are the legal implications regarding the classification of suspected terrorists as 
&#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In section III, the Special Rapporteur considers particular problems in the Israeli legal 
system concerning the investigation and prosecution of terrorist suspects, such as legal 
definitions regarding terrorism; the interrogation methods used by the Israeli Security Agency; 
and the use of military courts. In section IV, the construction of a barrier - partly a wall and 
partly a fence - in the West Bank is critically examined regarding its legality and its impact on 
the Palestinian people and, in particular, its effect on economic, social and cultural rights. 
Section V highlights some key concerns regarding the situation in Gaza. The Special Rapporteur 
addresses in section VI the operations of the Israeli Defense Force and the issues of the use of 
human shields, the demolition of houses and targeted killings, including the killing of civilians. 
</p>
<p> In the final section, the Special Rapporteur provides a brief conclusion and his 
recommendations to the Government of Israel. The recommendations include matters pertaining 
to legislative reform and the discontinuation of practices that are incompatible with international 
law. The Special Rapporteur also draws the Government&#8217;s attention to the fact that the high 
emotional toll of counter-terrorism or security measures easily leads to counterproductive 
effects. The Special Rapporteur recommends the withdrawal of all Jewish settlements in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and the replacement of the still unfinished barrier with a security 
infrastructure that, for its geographical position, respects the Green Line or is otherwise accepted 
by the Palestinians. During the process of implementing such a decision, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends urgent action to ensure that the regime of permits, the administration of checkpoints 
and all other associated measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory do not have a 
disproportionate impact on the enjoyment of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights 
in the Territory. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, Martin Scheinin, conducted, at the invitation of the Government of Israel, a mission to 
Israel from 3 to 10 July, when he also visited the Occupied Palestinian Territory.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel, Tzipi Livni. 
The Special Rapporteur had meetings on a specialist level with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Ministry of Justice, the Israeli Defense Force, the Israeli Security Agency, members of the 
Knesset (Parliament), the Counter Terrorism Bureau and former and current Presidents of the 
Supreme Court of Israel. He travelled to various parts of Israel, including to the Hasharon and 
Hadarim prisons where he was able to conduct private interviews of detainees in conformity with 
the Terms of Reference for Fact-Finding Missions by Special Rapporteurs,<b>2</b> and to the Ofer 
Military Court, where he observed ongoing proceedings and met with the judges. In the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, he visited, inter alia, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, 
examined the route and impact of the barrier erected by Israel, and met with the President&#8217;s 
Office of the Palestinian Authority. He met with lawyers, academics, victims of terrorism and 
non-governmental organizations from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. He was also 
briefed by a number of international organizations, including by United Nations interlocutors. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is deeply mindful of the difficulties faced by Israel in its efforts to 
combat armed attacks and acts of terrorism and of the long history of violence in the region, 
which has had a devastating effect on the Israeli and Palestinian civilian population. While 
emphasizing that not all acts of violence committed against an occupying power, particularly 
when violence is targeted at the military forces of an occupying power, amount to acts of 
terrorism properly construed, the Special Rapporteur cannot ignore that, since the second intifada 
of September 2000 and up to October 2007, 1,165 Israelis were killed (71 per cent of whom were 
civilians) and 8,635 injured in over 300,000 violent attacks characterized by the Israeli Security 
Agency as terror attacks. Threats of military attack or terrorism against the Israeli people also 
arise from other parts of the region and further abroad. The Special Rapporteur was touched by 
the personal accounts of victims of terrorism, who have not only faced the loss of family 
members and other physical losses, but also struggle to overcome the psychological and 
fear-inducing consequences of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>4. Resorting to the methods of terrorism is always a morally inexcusable decision by a 
person. Despite this, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that perpetrators of acts of terrorism 
do not fall into a vacuum in the application of the law, and he is encouraged in that regard by
</p>

</p>
<p>the position of the Supreme Court of Israel that the fight against terrorism must be achieved 
through compliance with the law, including international law. He is furthermore pleased to 
receive assurances from Government sources that Israel is not involved in any global programme 
of extraordinary rendition or secret detention. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur underscores the fact that sustainable security can only be achieved 
through due respect for human rights. As emphasised by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights at the conclusion of her visit to Israel on 23 November 2006, the entitlement 
of all individuals to enjoy their rights is not dependent upon there being peace. Respect for 
human rights for all and the rule of law forms one of the four pillars of the United Nations 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/288 
in September 2006. It is identified in the Strategy as &#8220;the fundamental basis of the fight against 
terrorism&#8221;, thus applicable to all four pillars. Furthermore, the Strategy expressly identifies, in 
the preambular paragraph to pillar I, that a lack of the rule of law and violations of human rights 
amount to conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. In the latter regard, as recognized by 
the Israeli Security Agency and the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Bureau, high on the list of 
motivations for carrying out terrorist attacks are those of revenge borne out of the attacker&#8217;s 
personal or familial experience or perceptions of ill-treatment or humiliation. The Special 
Rapporteur further recalls that the Security Council has directed that all States members of the 
United Nations combat terrorism in compliance with international law, including international 
human rights and international humanitarian law.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  FRAMEWORK OF APPLICABLE LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International human rights and humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>6. The legal framework against which Israeli measures against terrorism are to be 
addressed is the combined effect of international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law. This is particularly the case with respect to Israeli conduct in, and the effect of 
counter-terrorism law and practice on, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has been under 
Israeli occupation for 40 years. Although Israel officially rejects the de jure application of 
the 1949 Geneva Conventions to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, it has undertaken to comply 
with the humanitarian principles under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which pertains to the 
protection of civilians during times of occupation. 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to the applicability of substantive norms of international humanitarian law, 
the Special Rapporteur agrees with the outcome of the positions of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Israeli Supreme Court that the norms of this body of law, 
pertaining to international armed conflict, are applicable. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
that, since the adoption of the Geneva Conventions in 1949, the understanding of the substance 
and scope of international humanitarian law norms has evolved to the effect that the 
classification of an armed conflict as an international or non-international one cannot be treated 
as having major substantive consequences for the international humanitarian law obligations of a 
State that is a party to an armed conflict. He refers, inter alia, to the ICRC study on customary 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  See for example Security Council resolution 1624 (2005), para. 4. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>norms of international humanitarian law, to the undertaking by Israel to respect the humanitarian 
principles of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and to sources of international humanitarian law 
that predate the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including The Hague Regulations of 1907. The 
Special Rapporteur is therefore of the view that, when considering its substantive obligations 
under international humanitarian law, it is not material whether Israel is a party to Additional 
Protocol II of 1977 or whether the West Bank was part of a sovereign State prior to the country&#8217;s 
occupation of the Territory. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur notes the Israeli position that the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights does not apply beyond its own territory, notably in the West Bank, 
especially as long as there is a situation of armed conflict there. He reminds Israel that 
international human rights law continues to apply during occupation or armed conflict. This is a 
point made clear by the Human Rights Committee in its general comments Nos. 29 and 31 and in 
its concluding observations on Israel,<b>4</b> and has been confirmed by the International Court of 
Justice.<b>5</b> As further explained in its advisory opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the 
Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories</i>, the International Court stated 
that the protection offered by human rights conventions did not cease in case of armed conflict, 
save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in article 4 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<b>6</b> The conduct of Israeli counter-terrorist 
operations must therefore comply not only with international humanitarian law, but also with 
applicable international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>9. Those same bodies, the Human Rights Committee and the International Court of Justice 
have also confirmed that human rights, including those enshrined in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, are legally binding upon a State when it acts outside its 
internationally recognized territory.<b>7</b> Therefore, as a State party to the Covenant, Israel is obliged 
to honour the rights laid down in it - including the absolute prohibition against torture or any 
other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment - of anyone within its power or effective

Congo v.</i> <i>Uganda), Merits </i>(2005), I.C.J. Reports, paras. 216-220 and 345 (3).

</p>
<p>control, even if not situated within the territory of Israel. With regard to the application of the 
Covenant and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Special Rapporteur therefore concludes that the provisions of 
both covenants apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, for 
all operations by Israeli authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of 
rights enshrined in the covenants and fall within the ambit of the State responsibility of Israel 
under the principles of public international law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Declared state of emergency 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur notes with encouragement that Israel is reconsidering its 
derogation from aspects of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights under a state 
of emergency, which has been in existence since the establishment of the State of Israel. This 
reform is long overdue, as the current legal framework for countering terrorism is vague and 
outdated, partly based on pre-1948 instruments and hardly compatible with the requirement of 
legality and the country&#8217;s commitment to democracy. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the 
fact that a challenge to the lawfulness of the state of emergency has been pending before the 
Supreme Court of Israel for more than eight years. The Human Rights Committee has repeatedly 
expressed its concern with the sweeping nature of measures under the declared state of 
emergency.<b>8</b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates the Committee&#8217;s position that recourse to 
derogations under article 4 must be temporary and exceptional in nature, and that the enunciation 
of certain rights within the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights already provide 
for the proportionate limitation of rights as prescribed by law and necessary for the protection of 
national security or public order, including articles 12 (3), 19 (3) and 21, relating to the freedoms 
of movement and residence, opinion and expression, and peaceful assembly.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur was informed that new counter-terrorism legislation is being 
drafted and is encouraged by advice from the Israeli Ministry of Justice that he will be consulted 
and invited to comment on this legislation prior to its introduction to the Knesset. The 
undertaking of this cooperative enterprise should be seen as representing an element of best 
practice in the development and reform of counter-terrorism law and practice. The Special 
Rapporteur further notes that Israel is in the process of establishing a written constitution to 
replace the various basic laws currently in existence, and that it will include a charter of rights. 
He encourages Israel to use this vehicle as an opportunity to fully incorporate its obligations 
under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Unlawful combatants 
</b></p>
<p>12. One troubling development in the counter-terrorist framework of the United States of 
America and Israel has been the classification of suspected terrorists as &#8220;unlawful enemy 
combatants&#8221; who purportedly find themselves in a gap in protection in respect of international 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>humanitarian law or certain parts of it. Most renowned is the use of this classification by the 
United States in respect of persons detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay, a matter considered in the 
report of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to the United States. Israel has similarly adopted 
the terminology in its Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law 2002. 
</p>
<p>13. The adjective &#8220;unlawful&#8221; was used together with the noun &#8220;combatant&#8221; by Allan Rosas, in 
his treatise <i>The Legal Status of Prisoners of War</i> to describe persons who commit hostile acts in 
international conflicts without authorization to do so under the law of war.<b>10</b> &#8220;Unprivileged 
belligerent&#8221; would be a synonymous expression. While such persons may not be entitled to 
prisoner of war status, they nevertheless enjoy certain minimum protections in respect of 
detention and trial.<b>11</b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to make clear that the term &#8220;unlawful 
combatant&#8221; is a description of convenience, meaningful only in international armed conflicts and 
even then only denoting persons taking direct part in hostilities while not being members of the 
regular armed forces or of assimilated units. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>14. In its resolution 1566 (2004), the Security Council called on all States to cooperate fully in 
the fight against terrorism and, in doing so, to prevent and punish acts that have the following 
three cumulative characteristics: 
</p>
<p> (a) Acts, including those against civilians, committed with the intention of causing death 
or serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages; 
 (b) Irrespective of whether motivated by considerations of a political, philosophical, 
ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature, also committed for the purpose of 
provoking a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, 
intimidating a population, or compelling a Government or an international organization to do or 
to abstain from doing any act; 
</p>
<p> (c) Such acts constituting offences within the scope of and as defined in the international 
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. 
</p>
<p>15. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this cumulative characterization represents the type 
of conduct that should be acted against in the context of State counter-terrorist law and 
practice.<b>12</b> Terrorism can be distinguished from other crimes or warfare by its use of deadly or 
otherwise serious violence against &#8220;civilians&#8221;, i.e. against innocent bystanders, or members of

</p>
<p>the general population or segments of it, or the taking of them as hostages, in order to cause fear 
or compel an international organization or Government to act or abstain from acting. Any 
definition of terrorism must comply with the requirements of legality (accessibility, precision 
and non-retroactivity), applicability to counter-terrorism alone, and non-discrimination.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>16. In its concluding observations on the second periodic report of Israel under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee expressed 
concern about the vagueness of definitions in Israeli counter-terrorism legislation and regulations 
which, although their application is subject to judicial review, appear to run counter to the 
principle of legality in several aspects owing to the ambiguous wording of the provisions and the 
use of several evidentiary presumptions to the detriment of the defendant.<b>14</b> The definition of an 
&#8220;act of terrorism&#8221; under article 1 of the Prohibition on Terrorist Financing Law 2004, for 
example, includes acts creating danger to the health or security of the public; serious damage to 
property; or serious disruption of vital infrastructures, systems or services. The Special 
Rapporteur takes the view that this definition goes beyond the Security Council&#8217;s 
characterization by including acts the commission of which go beyond causing death or serious 
bodily injury or the taking of hostages. While the acts described by article 1 would certainly 
amount to criminal conduct, they should not be treated as terrorist acts in the view of the Special 
Rapporteur. In contrast, article 144D (2) (b) of the Penal Law 1977 is properly restricted in its 
definition of &#8220;an act of violence or terror&#8221; as an offence that causes injury to a person&#8217;s body or 
places a person in danger of death or danger of grievous bodily injury. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interrogation methods 
</b></p>
<p>17. Sitting as the High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court of Israel held in 1999 that former 
governmental guidelines governing the use by the Israeli Security Agency of &#8220;moderate physical 
pressure&#8221; during interrogation were invalid.<b>15</b> Although the decision of the Supreme Court held 
that the &#8220;necessity defence&#8221; under article 34 (11) of Penal Law 1977 could not serve to ex ante 
allow Israeli Security Agency investigators to employ such interrogation techniques, the Court&#8217;s 
decision left open the possibility that the defence could be available post factum.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, even when properly applied, the necessity 
defence does not validate the application of physical or psychological means of torture or any 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It means, at most, that such wrongful conduct 
may, in certain very limited circumstances, go unpunished in respect of a particular individual. 
He further draws attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the operation of this defence, it will 
never absolve a State of its duty to secure accountability and provide an effective remedy for the

<p>human rights violation suffered. This position is consistent with that taken by the Human Rights 
Committee in its concluding observations to the third periodic report by Israel under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights where, although it welcomed the 
Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, it noted that there was no defence under article 7 of the Covenant to 
conduct amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, equally prohibited in 
non-derogable terms by article 7.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>19. It was therefore troubling to the Special Rapporteur to receive reports of the continued use 
by Israel of interrogation techniques such as beatings, sleep deprivation, use of the &#8220;shabach&#8221; 
position (where a person&#8217;s hands are tied behind his back, and he is seated for long periods on a 
small and low chair tilted forward towards the ground), and excessively tight handcuffs.<b>18</b> It is 
reported that child detainees have been subject to similar treatment, and threats being made of 
having the child&#8217;s family members beaten or their family home destroyed.<b>19</b> The Special 
Rapporteur received assurances that all instances of the use of moderate physical pressure fell 
within the bounds of the necessity defence, and that no individual interrogator has been the 
subject of criminal charges since the 1999 Supreme Court decision, despite the existence of 
mechanisms facilitating the reporting of abuse by persons under interrogation. In that regard, 
Israel has established a process by which any person under interrogation may make an allegation 
of ill-treatment, which will then be investigated by a complaints inspector. Although the rules of 
operation of the Israeli Security Agency do not allow interference with the investigations of the 
inspector, who reports directly to the State Attorney&#8217;s Office, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the ability of the inspector, as an employee of the Israeli Security Agency, to act 
truly independently from the Agency and thus vigorously investigate allegations of ill-treatment 
or torture. According to the statistics given to the Special Rapporteur, since 2000, the inspector 
has initiated more than 550 examinations, but only 4 have resulted in disciplinary measures and 
not a single one in prosecution. The Special Rapporteur disagrees with the Supreme Court ruling 
that article 34 (11) of the Penal Law may be used to permit the exercise of discretion in deciding 
whether to prosecute an individual interrogator against whom allegations have been made of 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.<b>16</b> Given the non-derogable and peremptory 
nature of the prohibition of torture, such determinations should only be made by a court during 
the course of a criminal trial. 
</p>
<p>20. In its 1999 decision, the Supreme Court of Israel accepted that the necessity defence could 
arise in instances of a &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221;, and that the imminence criteria of the defence could be 
satisfied even if the &#8220;bomb&#8221; was set to explode in a few days, or even in a few weeks, provided

<p>the act was certain to materialize and that there were no alternative means of preventing it.<b>20</b> 
This explanation by the Court is very troublesome and the Special Rapporteur was shocked by 
the unconvincing and vague illustrations by the Israeli Security Agency of when a &#8220;ticking 
bomb&#8221; scenario may be applicable. One such example given concerned the apprehension of a 
person found in possession of a small laboratory for manufacturing explosives and items capable 
of being used to perpetrate a kidnapping. Based upon information that the person had previously 
attempted a kidnapping, although not prosecuted for it, the Israeli Security Agency advised that 
it took these facts as amounting to a &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; scenario, although special interrogation 
techniques were not actually used. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned by the admission by the Israeli Security 
Agency officials that, in principle, there was no distinction, in the use of the &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; 
scenario, between a terrorist suspect and a person otherwise holding information about a terrorist 
incident. He was further troubled by the process by which individual interrogators would, in line 
with internal guidelines, seek approval from the Director of the Israeli Security Agency for the 
existence of a &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; scenario and the application of special interrogation techniques. 
This appears to render the use of special interrogation techniques a matter of policy rather than a 
case-by-case ex post facto defence in respect of wrongful conduct. Properly applied, the 
necessity defence only applies in respect of an improvised reaction by an interrogator in relation 
to an unpredictable event.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Arrest and detention of security suspects 
</b></p>
<p>22. The arrest and detention of Palestinians in the West Bank, with the exception of those from 
East Jerusalem, is governed to a large extent by military orders. Such orders do not require 
Israeli authorities to inform the person at the time of arrest of the reasons for their detention, at 
variance with article 9 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Although 
Israel has notified the United Nations of its intention to derogate from article 9 of the Covenant, 
any derogation must be both necessary and proportionate. There is no good reason for failing to 
inform a person of the reasons for their detention at the time of arrest. 
</p>
<p>23. According to the Criminal Procedures (Non-Resident Detainee Suspected of Security 
Offense) (Temporary Provision) Law 2006, a suspect may be held for up to 96 hours before 
being brought before a judge. It also allows a suspect to be held for 35 days without an 
indictment.  
</p>
<p>24. The same law permits a security suspect to be detained for up to 21 days without access to 
a lawyer. Since detainees do not have a right to family visits before an indictment is filed against 
them, according to article 12 (b) of the Criminal Procedure (Enforcement - Arrests) (Conditions 
of Detention) Regulations 1997, this creates a situation whereby a detainee may be held without

</p>
<p>contact with the outside world for periods that could amount to weeks at a time. The Special 
Rapporteur is gravely concerned about this position, since it is in just this type of circumstance 
that the risk arises of a detained person being made subject to torture, or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment.<b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Of further concern to the Special Rapporteur is the use in the West Bank of &#8220;administrative 
detention&#8221; authorized under Military Order 1229 (1988). This Order empowers military 
commanders in the West Bank to detain an individual for up to six months if they have 
&#8220;reasonable grounds to presume that the security of the area or public security require the 
detention&#8221; subject to confirmation by the District Court. Commanders can extend detentions for 
additional periods of up to six months, and the Military Order does not define a maximum 
cumulative period of administrative detention, thus meaning that detention can be extended 
indefinitely. At June 2007, Israel was holding approximately 830 Palestinians in administrative 
detention, and the Special Rapporteur is aware of cases in which persons have been held for 
periods of years under administrative detention. The terms &#8220;security of the area&#8221; and &#8220;public 
security&#8221; are not defined, their interpretation being left to military commanders, and thus lack the 
level of precision required by the principle of legality. Furthermore, much of the information 
concerning the reasons for such detention is classified, such that the detainee and his or her 
lawyer have no access to this information, available to the military court confirming the 
detention, and thereby no effective means of contesting the grounds of the detention. This is at 
variance with article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which not 
only guarantees the right to a fair criminal trial, but also requires that fundamental principles of 
fair trial be respected in any matter dealt with by a judicial body. 
</p><p>26. Detention of persons is also possible under the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants 
Law 2002, which authorizes the Chief of General Staff to detain an &#8220;unlawful combatant&#8221;, 
subject to judicial review every six months, along similar lines to the administrative detention 
regime. Particularly problematic in this regard is not only the use of the term &#8220;unlawful 
combatant&#8221;, as discussed earlier in this report, but also its definition, which includes persons who 
have &#8220;indirectly&#8221; participated in hostile acts against the State of Israel. The latter term remains 
undefined and is therefore open to abuse and inconsistent with the principle of legality. 
</p>
<p>27. Although it would be improper to suggest that the right to liberty of members of political 
parties should be any greater than others, the Special Rapporteur urges caution in this area to 
ensure that counter-terrorism is never used as a means of obfuscating the existence or 
development of democracy. He notes that 45 of 132 members of the Palestinian Legislative 
Council have been charged with affiliation with, or membership in, a proscribed organization 
and are currently detained by Israel; 4 of them are being held in administrative detention. 
</p>
<p>28. Of the 700 Palestinian children arrested in 2006, 25 were held on administrative detention 
orders.<b>23</b> Article 37 (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires, inter alia, that the

</p>
<p>detention or imprisonment of a child be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time. There are also reports that solitary confinement has been used by 
prison authorities as a means of encouraging confessions from children, or as a punishment for 
infractions of prison rules.<b>24</b> Rule 67 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Administration of Juvenile Justice prohibits disciplinary measures against children to include 
solitary confinement. Furthermore, whereas rule 26 (2) requires child detainees to receive 
educational care according to their age, it is reported that Hasharon prison, being one of five 
Israeli prisons at which children are detained, is the only facility providing Palestinian child 
prisoners with education facilities.<b>25</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Use of military courts 
</b></p>
<p>29. Terrorist and security suspects in the West Bank, who may be either civilians or persons 
directly participating in hostilities, are normally tried before military courts. In its general 
comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee emphasized that the trial of civilians in military 
or special courts could raise serious problems as far as the equitable, impartial and independent 
administration of justice was concerned. Therefore, the Committee stressed the need that all 
necessary measures be taken to ensure that such trials are held under conditions which genuinely 
afford the full guarantees stipulated in article 14. According to the Committee, trials of civilians 
by military courts should be exceptional, and the jurisdiction of military courts should be limited 
to military personnel. The exercise of jurisdiction by a military court over civilians not 
performing military tasks is normally inconsistent with the fair, impartial and independent 
administration of justice.<b>26</b> The Committee has also clearly stated that the right to trial by an 
independent and impartial tribunal is so central to the due process of law that it is an absolute 
right that may suffer no exception, and thus not capable of derogation under article 4 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<b>27</b> In a long line of helpful jurisprudence on 
the subject, the European Court of Human Rights has spoken of the need for a tribunal to be 
subjectively free of prejudice or personal bias, and to have an appearance of impartiality from an 
objective viewpoint.<b>28</b> While the Special Rapporteur makes no judgement as to the impartiality 
or otherwise of individual military judges, the fact remains that military courts have an 
appearance of a potential lack of independence and impartiality, which on its own brings into 
question the fairness of trials.

</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONSTRUCTION OF A BARRIER IN THE WEST BANK 
</b></p>
<p>30. Central to the Israeli strategy in the fight against terrorism, and the suppression of suicide 
bombings in particular, is the continuing construction of a barrier - partly a wall and partly a 
fenced zone with multiple physical obstacles - between Israel and certain towns in the 
West Bank. According to Government interlocutors heard during the visit, the existence of this 
physical barrier makes terrorist operations more difficult, because they require greater 
coordination among more people; more opportunities for mistakes to be made are thus created 
and give more time for the detection and interception of terrorist operations. This, combined with 
reliance upon human intelligence, detection and other technology, has been credited by the 
Government as resulting in a marked reduction in the incidence of terrorist acts within the 
territory of Israel proper, from the height of 213 casualties in 2002 to 11 in 2006. According to 
the statistics provided by the Government, there has been an 85 per cent decline in the number of 
suicide attacks and an 80 per cent decline in the number of casualties. 
</p>
<p>31. Notwithstanding the correlation between the construction of the barrier and the reduction 
in the number of successful terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, the barrier is having an 
enormously negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the Palestinian people. A 
considerable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including towns and villages, is being 
separated from the rest of the Territory by the barrier. The winding route of the barrier is creating 
multiple obstacles for movement between even close-by communities within the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and establishing a &#8220;seam zone&#8221; of land between the Green Line and the 
route of the barrier, representing approximately 10 per cent of the West Bank. The Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory reports a dramatic 
and continuing deterioration in the socio-economic conditions of many parts of the West Bank 
since the construction of the barrier. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legality of the barrier and Israeli settlements in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>32. In its advisory opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, the International Court of Justice held that the construction of the 
barrier was contrary to international law, despite the argument that its construction was 
consistent with the inherent right to self-defence of Israel and with Article 51 of the Charter of 
the United Nations.<b>29</b> The Court determined that Israel was under an obligation to immediately 
cease the construction of the barrier and to dismantle the structure, and to make reparation for all 
damage caused by its construction.<b>30</b> It is very problematic, in that regard, that the route of the 
barrier does not follow the Green Line but is largely located within the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, capturing on its western side, or within so-called &#8220;fingers&#8221; extending deep into the 
Palestinian territory, several Israeli settlements located there.

</p>
<p>33. Since the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, Israel has established an extensive system 
of roads and has improved or expanded existing roads. Although Israel explains that this work 
was, and continues to be, undertaken out of military needs and to improve infrastructure to the 
benefit of the Palestinian people, many such roads, such as routes 463 and 466, are built for use 
by Israelis only, and one cannot disagree with the conclusions of non-governmental 
organizations that this has been done to benefit and encourage the expansion of Israeli 
settlements in the West Bank.<b>31</b> Between 1997 and 2004, the number of Jewish settlers in the 
West Bank increased from 152,300 to 232,700, an increase of almost 53 per cent and 
representing 10 per cent of the entire population of the West Bank (not including East 
Jerusalem).<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the approach of the Supreme Court of Israel, which 
has rejected the outcome of the decision of the International Court of Justice and instead 
accepted the legitimacy and continued construction of the barrier on the basis of military 
necessity and the need to secure the safety of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Supreme 
Court&#8217;s decisions have addressed the exact route of the barrier and often ordered changes to it 
but failed to address the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The International Court 
of Justice ruled, in that regard, that the policy applied by Israel since 1977 of establishing 
settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was contrary to international law.<b>33</b> This 
position is consistent with that taken by the Security Council in response to the establishment of 
the policy by Israel,<b>34</b> and with the principle reflected in article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, which provides that an occupying power &#8220;shall not deport or transfer parts of its 
own civilian population into the territory it occupies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur notes that the route of the barrier does not always appear to 
coincide with the location and protection of Israelis. The wall in Bethlehem, for example (and as 
affirmed by the Supreme Court), extends through the city to encircle Rachel&#8217;s Tomb for the 
purpose of protecting Israeli visitors to the tomb. Furthermore, the route of the barrier in 
Bethlehem has caused a dramatic collapse in the economy of what was before a relatively 
prosperous area and centre of commerce for the Palestinian people, and has also resulted in a 
steep decline in Bethlehem&#8217;s tourism sector.<b>35</b>

</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur heard from Government sources of a long-term plan to replace the 
current and not yet complete unilaterally-positioned barrier with an agreed international border 
with a future Palestinian State. Until this is achieved on the basis of genuine negotiations and 
agreement, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that no part of the barrier must be treated as a 
fait accompli or annexation of territory. To do so would amount to an illegal annexation of 
territory by Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Impact of the barrier on the Palestinian people 
</b></p>
<p>37. As a physical obstruction, the barrier has an impact on the ability of the people in the 
West Bank to move from one place to another. Checkpoints at various locations are used for the 
security screening of people. A feature of these checkpoints is that many are closed without 
notice, this aimed at disrupting the execution of terrorist attacks. In April and May of 2007, 549 
and 537 checkpoints were closed respectively. An average of almost 200 &#8220;flying checkpoints&#8221; 
each week were utilized by the Israeli Defense Forces during the same period.<b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>38. Security measures by Israel must not have a disproportionate impact on the lives of 
ordinary Palestinian people. Two crucial elements are relevant in this regard in order both to 
comply with the requirements of international human rights and to counteract the experiences by 
Palestinians of the barrier causing increasing arbitrariness and oppression. There must be a 
reduction in the level of hardship to people moving inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
The practical implementation of all security measures, including at checkpoints and terminals, 
must also be by professional, transparent, accountable and, to the greatest possible extent, 
civilian means. While the civilianization of such work appears to be an important means of 
reducing tensions in the practical implementation of such measures, it is essential that there be a 
high level of accountability and professional training of civilian actors, including training on 
human rights and humanitarian law. The Special Rapporteur was troubled, for example, by the 
presence of a contracted security civilian at Qalqiliya terminal, who strolled casually outside the 
facility with his finger permanently on the trigger of his weapon without any sense of discipline 
or discretion. The need to secure accountability and full compliance by Israel with its 
international obligations, including as the occupying power, speaks against privatization as the 
method by which security measures are transferred from the military to civilians. 
</p>
<p>39. As a result of closures and the system of permits regulating the movement of people from 
one area to another, the Palestinian people are adversely affected in their ability to gain access to 
education; health services, including emergency medical treatment; other social services; and 
places of employment. Access by ordinary Palestinians to their land and water resources, 
including through the devastation or separation from villages of agricultural land in the course of 
erecting the barrier, is also being impeded, in some cases to the point of having a devastating 
socio-economic impact on communities. 
</p>
<p>40. Delays at checkpoints have complicated childbirth for Palestinian women. This has 
resulted in the delivery of children at checkpoints and unattended roadside births, putting at risk 
the health of both child and mother, and leading to numerous miscarriages and the death of at

</p>
<p>least five mothers.<b>37</b> These hardships are reported to have contributed to an 8.2 per cent increase 
in home deliveries.<b>38</b> The Special Rapporteur was furthermore troubled to hear of three cases in 
April 2007 in which Palestinian ambulance drivers are said to have been harassed and beaten at 
checkpoints in the Jenin area.<b>39</b> If true, not only were the civil rights of those individuals 
violated, as was the right to physical and mental health for all, as guaranteed under article 12 (1) 
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but it would also 
constitute a violation of international humanitarian law norms, which require that medical 
personnel be respected and protected at all times. 
</p>
<p>41. As a result of the barrier, Palestinian children encounter significant obstacles in attending 
or remaining at educational institutions. It also affects the movement of teaching staff, whether 
this be as a result of the barrier having been erected between &#8220;closed&#8221; communities and 
educational facilities, or the difficulties in obtaining special permits from the Israel Defense 
Forces to enter areas in which educational facilities are present.<b>40</b> As reflected in article 50 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention, it is the duty of an occupying power to cooperate with national and 
local authorities to facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and 
education of children. The Special Rapporteur was very troubled by reports of incidents 
involving attacks by the Israel Defense Forces on students, military raids on schools and the 
destruction of schools and school property.<b>41</b>  
</p>
<p>42. The permits regime also has an impact on the integrity of family units and the ability of 
men and women to marry with people outside their own permit zones. The permits regime, and 
checkpoint closures and procedures, have also had a negative impact on the ability of families to 
visit those in detention, whether sentenced prisoners or those held in administrative detention.<b>42</b>

<p>  &#8220;Barred from contact: violation of the right to visit Palestinians held in Israeli prisons&#8221; in

</p>
<p>Rights of the Child applicable in respect of the conduct of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, concluded that various infringements of rights enshrined in those treaties resulting 
from the wall and its associated regime could not be justified by military exigencies or by the 
requirements of national security or public order. Hence, the construction of the wall constituted 
a breach by Israel of various of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian 
law and human rights instruments.<b>43</b> The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that many of the 
human rights affected by the barrier and associated security measures, such as freedom of 
movement (article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and the right to 
privacy (art. 17) are subject to permissible limitations. In addition, during a publicly declared 
state of emergency, they may also be subject to derogations. As various interlocutors informed 
him of instances of arbitrariness or unprofessional conduct in the implementation of the security 
measures, and as the route of the barrier continues to breach international law, the Special 
Rapporteur is nevertheless convinced that the barrier and its associated regime continues to cause 
effects that violate the international obligations of Israel under both humanitarian law and human 
rights law. In respect of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own mandate, it is even more important that 
the barrier and its associated measures are widely experienced by the Palestinians as unlawful, 
destructive to normal human life, and humiliating. As a consequence, the barrier has 
counterproductive effects by contributing to conditions that are conducive to the recruitment to 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  SITUATION IN GAZA 
</b></p>
<p>44. Under the Disengagement Plan Implementation Law 2005, Israel has withdrawn 
all 21 Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip. The Disengagement Plan ends, from the 
perspective of Israel, its occupation of the Gaza Strip and is in furtherance of a two-State 
solution in the pre-1948 territory of Palestine. While the Special Rapporteur accepts that the 
level of control by Israel over Gaza may fall short of occupation within the meaning of article 42 
of The Hague Regulations, as a territory actually placed under the authority of a hostile army, 
Israel still exercises a good deal of control over the situation in the territory. With limited 
exceptions, Israel has sealed the borders of Gaza, and controls the only sea port in its vicinity. It 
retains a contingent of military personnel on the border between Egypt and Gaza, for the purpose 
of preventing the smuggling of arms from Egyptian territory into the Gaza Strip. Without the 
cooperation of Israel, Gaza is thus isolated from international trade routes and from its 
West Bank neighbours. The Israel Defense Forces also enforce a fishing limit of 6 nautical miles 
from the shore of Gaza, in marked contrast with the 20 nautical mile fishing limit under the 1995 
Oslo Agreements, thus having a severe impact on the fishing industry of Gaza and its economy.<b>44</b>

</p>
<p>45. The consequent restriction of movement has resulted in similar consequences as those felt 
in the West Bank, outlined earlier in this report, particularly heightened in the context of the 
movement of persons between Gaza and the West Bank. If there is indeed to be a two-State 
solution in which Gaza and the West Bank are to function as a single State, as envisaged by the 
General Assembly in its 1948 Partition Plan for Palestine (General Assembly resolution 181 (II) 
and under the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, 
an urgent and concerted effort must be made to facilitate the movement of people and goods 
between the dislocated territories in a manner that has the least possible impact on movement 
and without the use of an arbitrary and non-reviewable permits regime. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the recent deterioration of the 
humanitarian situation in Gaza, particularly following the numerous military interventions of the 
Israel Defense Forces since disengagement, including the bombing of the Gaza electricity power 
station on 28 June 2006, which destroyed six transformers responsible for 43 per cent of the total 
power capacity in Gaza. The Special Rapporteur is cognizant of the security threats arising from 
Gaza, heightened by recurring factional violence, and the fact that terrorist factions within the 
territory continue to repeatedly attack civilians in Israel. He nevertheless reminds Israel that 
international humanitarian law restricts the use of military force, including through the 
requirement to distinguish between civilians and military objectives. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE OPERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>47. Particularly problematic to counter-terrorist operations in Israel and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory is the overlap between armed conflict and policing. The Israeli Defense 
Force is a conscript armed force, with young soldiers facing a daily dilemma between the 
preservation of their own lives and the legitimate recognition and targeting of threats. This 
combination has led to many instances of unprofessional conduct, readily acknowledged by 
senior military staff and civil servants with whom the Special Rapporteur met. Such conduct can 
serve to undermine the very role of the Israel Defense Forces in seeking to achieve a sustainable 
end to terrorist activities. This is most palpably evident in the Israel Defense Forces security 
screening and search procedures at checkpoints, raising concerns about privacy and 
non-discrimination, particularly heightened in the case of women and children. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Israel chose not to share with him existing standing 
orders concerning searches by the Israel Defense Forces of persons, including those at 
checkpoints. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Use of &#8220;human shields&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>48. Despite a decision of the Supreme Court of Israel in 2005 banning the use of human 
shields, the Special Rapporteur received allegations supported by videotape recordings of recent 
incidents in Nablus and Balata that Palestinians, including children, continue to be exposed to 
violence during the conduct of Israel Defense Forces operations by either forcing them to enter 
potentially dangerous buildings ahead of Israeli soldiers or to stand in front of military vehicles 
to stop the throwing of stones against those vehicles. Such unprofessional conduct may be deeply 
traumatizing for the individuals in question, in particular children, and has the effect of causing 
frustration and anger among the Palestinian people. </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Demolition of houses 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur heard from various interlocutors, including the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, of the demolition 
of housing by Israel. He was told of many such demolitions in response to the construction 
of houses without a permit or in some other way contrary to building laws, but was troubled to 
learn of the inconsistent and apparently discriminatory enforcement of such laws, whereby 
demolition consistently occurs in the case of property owned by Palestinians but rarely in the 
case of property owned by Israelis. According to reports, in July 2005, the village of 
Khirbet Tana in Nablus was almost entirely demolished, including an elementary school which 
had previously had 40 pupils enrolled, leaving only a mosque and a single building standing.<b>45</b>  
</p>
<p>50. As stated by the Human Rights Committee in its concluding observations on the second 
periodic report of Israel, the demolition of property and houses of families, some of whose 
members were or are suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or suicide bombings, 
contravenes the obligation of Israel to ensure without discrimination the right not to be subjected 
to arbitrary interference with one&#8217;s home (art. 17), freedom to choose one&#8217;s residence (art. 12), 
equality of all persons before the law and equal protection of the law (art. 26), and not to be 
subject to torture or cruel and inhuman treatment (art. 7). Although the Government&#8217;s response 
to this view was that, in the midst of combat and when dictated by operational necessity, Israeli 
security forces may lawfully destroy structures used by terrorists, the Special Rapporteur remains 
concerned that the actual practice of the Israel Defense Forces appears to go well beyond such 
operational needs and does indeed amount to the breaches of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights noted by the Human Rights Committee.<b>46</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Targeted killings and the killing of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the decision of the Supreme Court concerning 
targeted killings, in which the Court correctly noted that, under international humanitarian law, a 
person directly participating in hostilities may during armed conflict be a legitimate military 
target, but where it applied an overly broad and vague explanation of what amounted to direct 
participation in hostilities and paid insufficient attention to the fact that not every instance of 
terrorist conduct falls under the law of armed conflict.<b>47</b>

</p>
<p>52. The Court nevertheless qualified its position by stating that such recourse must be by way 
of last resort and that arrest must always be preferred and actively pursued. It also determined 
that, in every case of a targeted killing, a thorough and independent investigation must be held as 
to the precision of the identification of the target and the circumstances in which the killing took 
place. The Special Rapporteur endorses the Court&#8217;s decision in this regard, as a matter consistent 
with the right to life and authoritative jurisprudence concerning the establishment of thorough, 
independent and impartial investigations into the loss of life caused by State agents.<b>48</b> He is 
therefore troubled by reports that such investigations are rare, and, when carried out, are 
conducted internally, by members of the Israel Defense Forces, with details of such 
investigations and their findings not made public.<b>49</b> As emphasized by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial executions, it is essential to ensure that the applicable rules of international human 
rights and humanitarian law are respected even in the midst of crisis, indeed especially in times 
of crisis.<b>50</b> Furthermore, where violations of law are found to have occurred, adequate reparation 
must be made. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear from the Israeli Security Agency its 
position that civilians taking direct part in hostilities may not be attacked if less harmful means, 
such as arrest and trial, can be employed, consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court. 
Such an approach, regrettably, does not appear to be borne out by statistics on civilian deaths. A 
total of 678 Palestinian civilians were killed in 2006, of which 127 were children.<b>51</b> Between the 
start of the intifada in 2000 and the end of 2005, 728 Palestinian children were killed as a result 
of Israeli military activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, representing the highest number 
of child fatalities at the hand of Israeli forces in any five-year period since the 1967 occupation

</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the reconsideration by Israel of its derogation 
from aspects of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and its invitation to him 
to comment upon new counter-terrorism legislation currently being drafted. He identifies this 
cooperative enterprise as one to be commended as an element of best practice. He has, in 
contrast, also identified serious situations of incompatibility of the country&#8217;s obligations 
pertaining to human rights and fundamental freedoms with its counter-terrorism law and 
practice. Such situations include the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment; the right to life and humanitarian law principles concerning legitimate targeting; the 
right to liberty and fair trial; and the severe impact of the construction of the barrier in the 
West Bank and associated measures on the enjoyment of civil, cultural, economic, political and 
social rights and freedoms in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Addressing the full range of 
those situations is imperative, not only to secure compliance by Israel with its international 
obligations but also to address conditions that may be conducive to recruitment to terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Israel, in the development of its 
counter-terrorism legislation, ensure that definitions of terrorism and security suspects are 
precise and limited to the countering of terrorism and the maintenance of national security, 
respectively. Definitions surrounding the countering of terrorism should be restricted to 
the suppression and criminalization of acts of deadly or otherwise serious physical violence 
against civilians, i.e., members of the general population or segments of it, or the taking of 
hostages, coupled with the cumulative conditions identified by the Security Council in its 
resolution 1566 (2004). All legislation, regulations and military orders must comply with 
the requirements of the principle of legality with regard to accessibility, precision and 
non-retroactivity. Having achieved those requirements, the enactment by the Knesset of 
this new legislation should be accompanied by a repeal or revocation of all current 
counter-terrorism legislation, regulations and military orders. He further recommends that 
the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law be repealed, without replacement.</b>

</p>
<p>56. <b>The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the decision of the Supreme Court of Israel 
regarding interrogation techniques by the Israeli Security Agency, but recommends that 
urgent steps be taken to ensure full compliance with that decision and associated 
international obligations. Since the proper application of the necessity defence under 
article 34 (11) of the Penal Law cannot validate conduct amounting to torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, the Special Rapporteur recommends that steps be taken 
to establish mechanisms by which victims of such conduct are provided with an effective 
remedy. Given the concerns that the Special Rapporteur has with the independence of the 
Israeli Security Agency complaints inspector, the non-derogable and peremptory nature of 
the prohibitions, and the apparent lack of understanding by Israeli Security Agency 
officers of the parameters of the necessity defence, he further recommends that all 
complaints of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment be referred to the 
Attorney General&#8217;s office for the immediate filing of criminal charges against the 
individual interrogator wherever such complaints point to conduct that, if proven, would 
amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and that only the courts may 
pronounce on the applicability and effect of the necessity defence. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>With regard to arrest and detention, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Israel 
take steps to ensure that all persons are informed of the reasons for their detention at the 
time of their arrest. He recommends the amendment of the Criminal Procedures 
(Non-Resident Detainee Suspected of Security Offense) (Temporary Provision) Law 2006 
to ensure that security suspects are provided with immediate and continued access to legal 
counsel and, where appropriate, family visits. In the context of administrative detention, he 
recommends that the terms &#8220;security of the area&#8221; and &#8220;public security&#8221;, currently under 
Military Order 1229, be defined with precision, and that steps be taken, such as the 
establishment of a panel of security-cleared counsel, to ensure that representations are able 
to be made to the district court on behalf of a detainee upon the making or extension of 
administrative detention orders. The practice of military or other courts authorizing 
administrative detention on the basis of evidence available neither to the detainee nor 
counsel should be discontinued as incompatible with article 14 (1) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges that care be taken to ensure that counter-terrorism 
law and practice never be used as a means of preventing or undermining the development 
of democracy in Palestinian territory. He further urges Israel to ensure that the detention 
or imprisonment of a child be used as a measure of last resort, that solitary confinement 
never be used by prison authorities as a means of coercion or punishment of children, and 
that all facilities in which children are detained provide educational care appropriate to the 
age of each child. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Given the illegality under international law of the existence and continued 
development of Jewish settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that a decision be made immediately to withdraw all such 
settlements and to replace the still unfinished barrier, extending deep into Palestinian 
territory, with a security infrastructure that, by its geographical position, respects the 
Green Line or is otherwise accepted by the Palestinians. During the process of 
implementing such a decision, the Special Rapporteur recommends urgent action to ensure 
that the permits regime, the administration of checkpoints, and all other associated </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.4 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory do not have a disproportionate impact on 
the enjoyment of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights in the territory. He 
also recommends that security measures be civilianized through means other than their 
privatization. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Israel to respect the rules of international 
humanitarian law, including the fundamental requirement of distinguishing between 
civilians and military objectives when resorting to the use of force. This must be the case 
irrespective of whether Israel is responding to an armed attack from Gaza, Lebanon or 
elsewhere and whether it classifies the attack as terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Israel to ensure that any demolition of housing or 
other destruction of private property conducted as a measure aimed at combating or 
preventing terrorism is resorted to in strict compliance with international law and is 
accompanied by adequate reparation. Due to the high emotional impact of such measures 
easily leading to counterproductive effects in a sustainable fight against terrorism, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Israel exercise extreme caution in 
resorting to such measures. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>While acknowledging that military necessity may dictate the deliberate killing of 
enemy combatants during an armed conflict, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
transparent laws and guidelines on the practice of targeted killings be established, and that 
they be strictly limited to persons directly participating in hostilities and as a means of last 
resort after all possible measures to apprehend the person have been taken. All such 
killings must be followed by a thorough and independent investigation as to the accuracy of 
the identification of the target, whether alternative means were available, and whether the 
action was undertaken in a manner ensuring that no civilian casualties were caused. The 
result of such investigations should be made public and, where violations of law are 
established, adequate reparation made.
