<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report contains my findings following an official visit as Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences, to Tajikistan in May 2008. 
 The transition in Tajikistan from a command economy to a market-led economy following 
its independence from the Soviet Union was particularly turbulent, coupled as it was by a 
devastating civil war. Today, Tajikistan seems to have achieved political stability and entered a 
phase of economic growth. However, the situation remains fragile as Tajikistan continues facing 
challenges pertaining to the transition, the erosion of sources of livelihood and social services, 
and massive poverty. A large part of the population resorts to subsistence farming and migration 
to make ends meet, with mixed consequences for women. 
</p>
<p> Women have been especially impacted by the consequences of the transition in Tajikistan. 
While formal equality is guaranteed in law, socio-economic and political achievements during 
the Soviet era have faded away, and patriarchal discourses and practices perpetuating women&#8217;s 
subordinate position in the family and society have resurfaced visibly, leading to women&#8217;s 
increased vulnerability to violence and exploitation. 
</p>
<p> Violence against women and girls is accepted by men and women alike as part of everyday 
behaviour. Violence by husbands and other family members is particularly widespread. Women 
and girls are also victims to sexual violence and exploitation on the streets and to trafficking 
inside and outside Tajikistan. Women&#8217;s lack of awareness of their rights, and issues pertaining to 
residency registration and the rise of early, polygamous and unregistered marriages further 
aggravate their vulnerability. While some encouraging steps have been taken, responses by State 
bodies to protect and support victims of violence and prosecute perpetrators have so far been 
insufficient. As a result, some women perceive suicide or murder of the abuser as the only ways 
out. 
</p>
<p> Against this backdrop, I call on the Government to take measures in the following priority 
areas: women&#8217;s empowerment and gender equality; elimination of violence against women and 
girls; statistics and data collection; marriage practices and residency registration and housing. 
Many of the recommendations contained in the report are also relevant for international 
organizations and the donor community. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 15 to 23 May 2008, I carried out an official visit to Tajikistan at the invitation of the 
Government. During the course of my mission, I held consultations in Dushanbe with the 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Labour and Social Protection, the Chairperson of the 
Supreme Court, the Chairpersons of both the Committee on State Statistics and the Committee 
for Women and Family Affairs, other government officials and members of Parliament. I met 
with representatives of civil society organizations, including women&#8217;s groups, the Council of 
Ulema, imams, and representatives of United Nations agencies, the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe and the donor community. I had the opportunity to speak with 
women survivors of violence at crisis centres in Khujand and Kurgan-Tyube, and with rural 
women in the Bobodjon Gafurovskiy and Vakhdat districts. I also visited the women&#8217;s prison in 
Nurek. 
</p>
<p>2. I would like to thank the Government of Tajikistan and the United Nations country team in 
Tajikistan for facilitating my mission. I am particularly grateful to those women who shared their 
experiences with me. 
</p>
<p>3. The report starts with an examination of the challenges of transition, which has a direct 
bearing on women&#8217;s lives in Tajikistan. This is followed by a discussion of the most prevalent 
forms of violence encountered by women and factors aggravating their vulnerability to it. After 
assessing responses to violence by governmental and non-governmental actors, the report ends 
with conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>4. I look forward to a continued dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the 
implementation of my recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSITION 
</b></p>
<p>5. The transition in Tajikistan from a command economy to a market-led economy following 
the break-up of the Soviet Union was particularly turbulent. Upon independence in 
September 1991, Tajikistan, the poorest of all the former Soviet Republics,<b>1</b> experienced a 
devastating civil war,<b>2</b> which, coupled with the withdrawal of subsidies from Moscow and the 
strenuous dictates of the global economy, put the country in disarray, causing the already ailing 
economy to deteriorate and eroding sources of livelihood for the population at large. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Tajikistan&#8217;s gross domestic product per capita (GDP) was nearly two thirds of that of other 
</p>
<p>countries in the region. The GDP was estimated at US$ 400 in 1991, and at US$ 215.4 in 1998 
(UNDP, 2000). 
<b>2
</b>  The civil war ended with the conclusion in 1997 of a General Agreement on the Establishment 
</p>
<p>of Peace and National Accord between the Government and the United Tajik Opposition. 
Around 60,000 people were killed, 55,000 were orphaned and 25,000 women left widowed. 
Women were also subject to physical and sexual violence, though exact figures are unknown. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>6. Today, Tajikistan seems to have arrived at political stability, with signs of economic 
recovery and growth,<b>3</b> but the situation remains fragile. Strenuous sources of livelihood, low 
levels of agricultural productivity, declining welfare provisions and services, concentrated 
structures of economic and political power and the lack of access to justice by the population are 
among the sources of continued tensions. Remittances from labour migrants abroad, on the other 
hand, constitute one of the most important safety valves for the Tajik economy and people - a 
phenomenon that is problematic in itself. 
</p>
<p>7. As in other transition economies, the process in Tajikistan has had a distinct gender face, 
affecting women&#8217;s well-being and socio-economic status. Resurging traditionalist patriarchal 
discourses and practices have increased women&#8217;s vulnerabilities to exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Changing trends in women&#8217;s status 
</b></p>
<p>8. When Tajikistan was a Soviet Republic (1929-1991), despite poverty, its people enjoyed 
some of the socio-economic benefits offered by the Soviet model of development. In 1992, 
with a Human Development Index of 0.629, Tajikistan compared to the 0.649 averaged by 
United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s (UNDP) &#8220;medium&#8221;-income countries. A range of 
social and health benefits were made available to families with children, persons with disabilities 
and the elderly. Education was compulsory up to grade 11 for both girls and boys, facilitating 
near-universal literacy at independence. Life expectancy at birth averaged 70 years. 
</p>
<p>9. The legal reforms undertaken during the Soviet period contributed significantly to 
improving women&#8217;s status, as secular institutions and laws became established. Certain practices 
such as polygamy, the payment of bride price (<i>kalym</i>), and marriage without consent were 
banned. The minimum age for marriage was set at 18 for boys and girls. Programmes, such as 
quotas, to ensure women&#8217;s representation in political and administrative processes at all levels of 
governance were adopted. Thanks notably to generous maternity leave and free day care, women 
constituted 40 per cent of the labour force. They remained, however, underrepresented in 
decision-making positions and in industries.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>10. Patriarchal gender relations in private life were not necessarily altered by the Soviet 
emancipation process.<b>5</b> Upon independence, as the country moved away from its Soviet past, 
hard-line patriarchal values, presented with religious overtones, gained prominence in public 
discourse.<b> </b>Women&#8217;s domestic and reproductive roles as well as the primacy of family 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Asian Development Bank. 
<b>5
</b>  As in other parts of the Soviet Union, the gender policies emphasizing women&#8217;s paid work 
</p>
<p>outside the home on equal terms with men did not necessarily question traditional patriarchal 
norms that governed women&#8217;s status in private life. The pro-natalist policies prevailing in the 
region also reinforced women&#8217;s reproductive role.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>preservation surfaced as highly cherished values. Within this context, women are required to be 
obedient and subservient to their husband and his family and deviations from this norm justify 
disciplinary measures and adverse consequences. Practices such as polygamous, unregistered 
and early marriages have also resurfaced and appear to be largely tolerated across society, 
including by some officials of this secular country.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The resurgent traditionalist patriarchal values are also supported by the changing material 
basis of women&#8217;s rights. As the country liberalized its economy, Tajik women became 
unemployed, dispossessed and dislocated, and lost many of the public benefits previously 
available to them. State provisions for childcare, maternity and health services<b>7</b> withered away, 
and industries that employed women closed down. At the same time, the decrease in male 
population due to the war and the labour exodus that followed left many women as the sole 
providers for their families. 
</p>
<p>12. With the withdrawal of quotas, women&#8217;s political representation sharply declined.<b>8</b> The 
gender gap in education, particularly illustrative of the intersection between poverty and 
patriarchy, has widened, resulting in a steady decline in school attendance of girls, in particular 
at the secondary and tertiary levels. While in 2006 girls made up 47 per cent of students in 
grades 5 to 9, in grades 10 and 11 they comprised only 39 per cent, possibly fewer given the 
likelihood of underreporting. Although poverty and the need for agricultural labour are often 
shown as the reason for the decline in school attendance for girls, it is worth noting that, when 
responding to such bottlenecks, families are more likely to withdraw girls than boys from 
school.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Poverty and sources of livelihood 
</b></p>
<p>13. Despite significant economic growth since 1997, reaching a peak of 10.6 per cent growth 
in 2004, poverty continues to afflict Tajikistan. According to World Bank data, in 2006 those 
living on less than US$ 2 per day were still as much as 43 per cent of the population, whereas 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  According to its Constitution, Tajikistan is a secular State; it has a Sunni Muslim majority and 
</p>
<p>Shia minority. 
<b>7
</b>  Since independence, maternal mortality has been relatively high, currently estimated 
</p>
<p>at 97 deaths per 100,000 live births (State Committee on Statistics, Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Survey, 2005). 
</p>
<p> This is due to lack of health-care professionals and equipment and the emergence of 
diseases bred by poverty as well as high level of home births (estimated at 80 per cent). 
<b>8
</b>  It is only recently that women&#8217;s participation has been increasing, with women 
</p>
<p>representing 29.8 per cent of all civil servants in 2006. Very few women, however, occupy 
important State positions, and these are mainly in traditional women&#8217;s sectors such as education. 
<b>9
</b>  In a 2002 survey 57 per cent of parents believed it was more important to provide education 
</p>
<p>for boys. See State Committee on Statistics, &#8220;Women and men in Tajikistan&#8221;, 2007. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>in 1999 two thirds of the population lived below the World Bank poverty line.<b>10</b> In 2005, official 
development assistance amounted to over 10 per cent of GDP, reflecting Tajikistan&#8217;s difficulties 
to secure full economic independence.<b>11</b> As discussed below, the economy is highly dependent 
on migrants&#8217; remittances. 
</p>
<p>14. Despite the relative decline in income poverty, the worsening of social and health 
indicators constitutes a threat to human well-being. Life expectancy for women dropped 
from 72.9 years in 1991 to 69.7 in 1998 and 68.1 in 2008, the corresponding figures for men 
being 67.3, 64.3 and 61.95 years, respectively. While the acute poverty due to the turmoil of the 
1990s has been identified as transient in nature, when young generations - especially women and 
girls - are deprived of the resources and services needed for the development of their capabilities, 
poverty in the longer term is likely to deepen and become chronic. In this regard, emerging 
trends in school dropout rates, early marriage for girls and women&#8217;s lack of professional 
expertise and training are reasons for continued impoverishment.<b>12</b> The situation is particularly 
dire in rural areas, where poor infrastructure compounds the burden on women.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Coping with poverty is a difficult task for the Tajik people, who have few options to make 
ends meet. Agriculture and labour migration are the most viable sources of livelihood for the 
majority of the people today - each embodying its own risks and opportunities. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>16. Agriculture provides the most important source of employment and income for 
over 60 per cent of the population. However, 90 per cent of Tajikistan&#8217;s territory is mountainous, 
leaving limited land for the production of cash and subsistence crops.<b>14</b> Furthermore, poor

<p>  Over 80 per cent of women turning to employment service offices have no specialized skills.

All Forms of Discrimination against Women in the Republic of Tajikistan&#8221; (hereafter, CEDAW

<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  Access to piped water or a public tap in rural areas, home to 73 per cent of the population, is 
only 40 per cent compared to 96 per cent access in urban areas. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  The country has the least agricultural and irrigated land in Central Asia. Up to 80 per cent of 
Tajikistan&#8217;s agricultural output, especially raw materials such as cotton, was transported to other 
republics of the former Soviet Union, in exchange for subsidies and foodstuffs. Source: &#8220;Notes

Agriculture and Protection of Nature of the Republic of Tajikistan with European Union support,

</p>
<p>agricultural infrastructure, dubious land-use patterns and lack of agricultural credit and capital 
inputs hamper labour productivity, income levels<b>15</b> and seriously undermine the sector&#8217;s capacity 
for market integration.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Labour conditions are poor. According to the Government, only 20 per cent of people 
working in agriculture are properly covered by labour contracts prior to starting work and there 
are problems regarding the payment of salaries. Women, who comprise over 70 per cent of all 
agricultural workers, are particularly disadvantaged as their access to land tends to be insecure. 
The process of privatization of land-use from the system of collective farming (<i>kolkhoz</i>) has been 
slow and the vaguely worded legislation, compounded with an opaque process of land-use title 
acquisition, enables the use of discretionary power by authorities to deprive women and other 
marginalized groups of their land-use rights. The proportion of private (<i>dehqon</i>) farms headed by 
women was only 6.8 per cent of total registered farms in 2004.<b>17</b> When women access land, it 
tends to be marginal unproductive plots, leaving many, especially female-headed households, 
destitute. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Labour migration 
</b></p>
<p>18. Permanent or seasonal labour migration has become the most important safety valve for 
the Tajik economy and its people in releasing the pressures of social discontent and labour 
surplus. It is estimated that 1 million people out of a population of over 7 million are migrants.<b>18</b> 
The majority of migrants are young unskilled men working mainly in the Russian Federation.<b>19</b> 
Many work in low-paid and insecure jobs in private enterprises. The situation is worse for those 
who do not possess work and residency permits. Female migration is said to be on the increase, 
with estimates ranging from 8 to 20 per cent of the overall migrant group. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  In 2004, the average monthly wage in agriculture was 35 Somoni (US$ 11), 
</p>
<p>against 156 Somoni (US$ 50) in the non-agricultural private sector (IMF 2005), quoted in  
SIDA, op. cit., p. 47. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  The relative growth in agriculture production came essentially from subsistence farming. See 
&#8220;Notes for a strategy for the agricultural sector&#8221;, p. 19. For analysis of the dismal situation in 
agriculture see also SIDA (2007). 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  SIDA, pp. 48-49. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  The total population of Tajikistan is 7,211,884 (July 2008). (See https://www.cia.gov/library/ 
publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ti.html). 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  According to government and other sources, there are about 600,000 Tajiks in the 
Russian Federation and another 50,000 in other countries, including Kazakhstan. These figures 
reflect only the formal documented migrants. Including those staying illegally, the total estimate 
reaches 2 million. Thirty (30) per cent of Tajik migrants have no skills, and 60 per cent work in a 
field other than their specialization. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>19. Migrant remittances have enabled households to improve their levels of subsistence. 
Remittances are also a significant component of the national economy of Tajikistan: officially 
recorded remittances constituted around 36.2 of GDP in 2006, and between 33 and 38.2 per cent 
in 2007, while the total estimate, including unrecorded flows, is believed to reach over 
50 per cent of GDP.<b>20</b> However, labour migration has reportedly had limited effect on the overall 
development of the economy.<b>21</b> Migration has also had disruptive effects within the labour force 
and households, with diverse implications for the women left behind. 
</p>
<p>20. With most able-bodied men abroad, the wives of migrants become the main workforce for 
farming and bear increased responsibilities for child and elder care and household subsistence. 
They work more than women in non-migrant households and many must take low-paid jobs 
outside of the household, usually in agriculture.<b>22</b> The increased workload borne by wives of 
migrants has not been accompanied by their increased participation in decision-making within 
the household or a higher social status in general.<b>23</b> In the husband&#8217;s absence, budget and 
household management generally remains with the male or senior female member of his 
family.<b>24</b> This may imply more workload, greater subordination and abuse and compounded 
hardship for the women. 
</p>
<p>21. The situation of abandoned or evicted women is the worst, as they may find themselves 
without a home or sources of income. Access to social security benefits or assistance is limited 
and a cumbersome process. Finding a job for abandoned women or those whose husbands stop 
sending money becomes critical. Since women disproportionately lack expertise and skills,<b>25</b> 
their only job opportunities may be arduous and low-paid work in agriculture or the informal 
sector. Some turn to illegal activities such as the drug trade to secure a subsistence income while 
others fall prey to trafficking.

</p>
<p>22. Despite the importance of migration for the Tajik economy, its largely irregular character 
and the absence of a comprehensive policy and mechanisms to manage, register and monitor the 
movements of people within and outside Tajikistan pose risks for the sustained livelihoods of 
families and for the protection of migrants, who are compelled to work in exploitative and 
hazardous conditions. Pre-departure and on-the-job training of migrants is lacking, and the 
existing law on migration and bilateral agreements with the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan 
do not ensure legal status and labour/social protection for most Tajik migrants.<b>26</b> It is nonetheless 
worth noting some progress in the area of policies/programmes, such as the adoption of a 
Programme of Foreign Labour Migration for 2006-2009 and the 2002 ratification of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families, in addition to initiatives undertaken by international organizations to support 
migrant workers.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>23. Violence against women in Tajikistan is not sufficiently acknowledged as a problem 
warranting public attention; therefore it goes largely unreported and unrecorded. While 
information on the diverse manifestations of the problem is scanty and anecdotal, its widespread 
acceptance in society, even by women themselves, is evident. Women&#8217;s economic dependency, 
legal illiteracy and practices pertaining to marriages, residency and housing aggravate their 
vulnerability to violence.

<p><b>A.  Prevalence and forms of violence

</b></p>
<p>24. Studies estimate that between one third to one half of women in Tajikistan regularly 
encounter some form of violence in the family, either by their husbands or other members of the 
husband&#8217;s family.<b>28</b> In a 2005 population-based survey in Khatlon Oblast,<b>29</b> over one third of the 
women responded that their husbands had beaten them; 58 per cent reported experiencing either 
physical violence or sexual abuse, with around 20 per cent having experienced both types of 
abuse. There were no significant differences across districts, age groups, education levels, or

</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  In this regard, the Government of Tajikistan requested that the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation agree to a quota for Tajik migrants in order to prevent illegal migration, 
apparently to no avail so far.

Organization for Migration.

<p>  Women refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, are said to be similarly victims of domestic 
violence but lack access to any form of formal or informal support and protection mechanisms.

<p>work. A large portion of women applying to crisis centres complain about psychological/ 
emotional violence (56 per cent in 2005), and over 20 per cent about physical violence. Women 
victims of sexual violence, due to the taboo surrounding the issue, reportedly either do not come 
to the centres or, when they do, tend not to disclose the problem. 
</p>
<p>25. Abuse by in-laws, particularly the mother-in-law, is also common and an accepted 
phenomenon. The Khatlon survey showed that over 60 per cent of the women agreed that if a 
mother-in-law was angry with her daughter-in-law, she had the right to abuse her by swearing at 
her or confining her to the house. However, the survey revealed little physical violence by 
mothers-in-law (less than 5 per cent),<b>30</b> who are said to exercise indirect forms of control, 
including through emotional abuse and economic deprivation. While only a few of the women 
I spoke to mentioned they were physically beaten by their mothers-in-law, many underlined their 
subordinate position, which makes them &#8220;the slaves of their mother-in-law&#8221;. For instance, a 
woman with a university degree in psychology explained that her mother-in-law forces her to 
work on the farm. 
</p>
<p>26. The extended patriarchal household and the age-sex status differentials, whereby young 
women occupy the lowest status, provide a fertile ground for abuse by mothers-in-law. With age, 
women may gain respect and be delegated patriarchal power, particularly in regulating the 
conduct of the younger women in the household. While the extended family tradition is 
deep-rooted in Tajik society, the deteriorating standards of living and the small size of land 
allocated to each family has made it particularly difficult to build additional dwellings on the 
same land, hence forcing the families to live under the same roof, often under strenuous and 
stressful conditions. 
</p>
<p>27. Wives of migrants appear subject to additional abuse by their in-laws; including eviction 
from their house should their husband not send money, not come back or marry abroad. Sahar&#8217;s 
story<b>31</b> is emblematic: after six years of marriage, her husband went to Russia without ever 
sending money or calling, and ended up marrying a Russian woman. The sister-in-law then 
exerted pressure on her mother to throw Sahar out of the house. With the assistance of a crisis 
centre, Sahar took the case to court and won the right to live at her in-laws&#8217; dwelling. However, 
her return was not well received; she is ignored by her in-laws and deprived of food and a plot 
of land to work on. As a result, she stays half of the week there and the other half with her 
parents, who are her main providers. This case also highlights problems emanating from 
residency/housing practices, discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Violence against girls 
</b></p>
<p>28. Nearly half of the population in Tajikistan is under 18, with 36.4 per cent under 14 (2007). 
There is no authoritative data on the nature and extent of violence against children and no 
systematic process or centralized database for registering cases. Nonetheless, research and

</p>
<p>observations from State, international and non-governmental organizations confirm the high 
levels of psychological, physical and sexual violence and exploitation against children generally, 
and girls to a larger extent than boys. Research shows, for instance, that 20 to 60 per cent of 
children experience violence in the family (with other findings specifying that 37 to 58 per cent 
experience psychological abuse at home), 23 to 50 per cent experience violence at school and 
other institutions, and 12 to 32 per cent of children experience and/or witness physical violence 
on the streets.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Violence against children is generally tolerated by society, including by officials,<b>33</b> unless 
it leads to serious injuries. In a 2002 WHO study, 40 per cent of parents said that physical 
violence was an acceptable punishment for children, while 44 per cent of children said they 
would not denounce abuse, based on the belief that their parents had the authority to use violence 
as a form of punishment. A large majority of parents admit they use emotional force/abuse 
against their children, with 80 per cent saying they shout and curse them, over 30 per cent 
prohibiting children from leaving the house or playing.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>30. Girls are at particular risk of violence and maltreatment, although data on abuse against 
them is fragmentary. Two out of three girls reported that they feel more susceptible to violence 
in the home than boys.<b>35</b> It has been particularly problematic to address sexual abuse against 
girls, because of the lack of recognition of the problem within society, the fear among victims 
that they will be considered responsible and become ostracized, and the low incidence of cases 
reported or brought to court. I met girls who were rape victims and who, due to mistreatment or 
rejection by their parents, ran away from home into the streets, where they became subject to 
exploitation and further abuse. These girls are not accepted into children&#8217;s homes, and 
specialized institutions which can provide the assistance needed do not exist. As a result, such 
girls may be detained in hospital wards for long periods of time or placed in the &#8220;Special 
School&#8221;, a closed institution for boys between ages 11 to 14 who have committed a criminal act 
or whose behaviour is deemed to be beyond parental control. 
</p>
<p>31. The story of Sana, a 14-year-old rape victim, is typical of the situation of the girls housed 
in the Special School. Sana ran away from her home in a village to Dushanbe to live with her 
aunt, with whom she sold food on the street. A woman she became acquainted with lured her to 
her house and sold her to three men. Sana lost consciousness at one point and when she awoke

<p>she was covered in blood and the men were gone. She managed to get out of the house and 
reached a policeman, who took her to the Temporary Isolation Centre for Minors. After 
explaining what happened, Sana was taken to the hospital where it was confirmed she had been 
raped. Following her testimony the police opened a criminal investigation, and a case was 
brought against the woman and the three men involved. The woman was convicted to 25 years of 
imprisonment, and the three men to 17 to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment. After two months of treatment 
in the hospital Sana was referred to the Special School by the Commission on Minors. Her 
parents do not want her because they feel that she has become &#8220;tainted&#8221; and a disgrace to the 
family. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>32. Girls and women are also vulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation outside 
Tajikistan, such as to the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation. Some 300 girls and 
women were trafficked to the United Arab Emirates in 2000. According to the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), 107 victims of trafficking were repatriated from the 
United Arab Emirates from 2005 onwards, ensuing in 45 proceedings against traffickers, most of 
which resulted in conviction. Today, victims identified through support services and 
investigations are in fewer numbers,<b>36</b> although women and girls remain vulnerable to 
trafficking, given the continuing difficult socio-economic conditions in the country. IOM data 
shows that from June 2005 to March 2008, 136 victims were identified, among whom 
105 victims of sexual exploitation. In early 2008, 60 persons had visited the IOM shelter in 
Dushanbe since its creation, while 34 minor victims of trafficking received assistance in the 
Khujand shelter from 2006 to early 2008.<b>37</b> Government data shows that, from March 2005 to 
August 2006, 123 victims were identified, resulting in the opening of 77 criminal cases.<b>38</b> 
In 2007, authorities reported 12 investigations, 19 prosecutions and 11 convictions.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Suicides and murders 
</b></p>
<p>33. Abused women and girls are at heightened risk of suicide. The Khatlon survey revealed 
that 70 per cent of women who had thoughts of suicide and 70 of those who actually attempted 
suicide reported experiencing physical violence from their husband. Other reasons for suicide are 
said to be abuse by in-laws, polygamy, early/forced marriage, or problems related to the 
husband&#8217;s working abroad.

</p>
<p>34. Though more men than women actually commit suicide, there are reports of an alarming 
number of suicide attempts by women through pharmaceutical overdoses, self-immolation or 
drowning as a way out of an oppressive life. Social and health professionals see these attempts as 
cry for help more so than desire to die. 
</p>
<p>35. While there is no comprehensive or countrywide data on the extent of women&#8217;s suicides in 
Tajikistan, some sporadic data give a sense of the problem. The Committee on Statistics noted 
that &#8220;hundreds of women die from fire and flame accidents&#8221;, with such deaths constituting 
6 per cent of accidental deaths in 2005.<b>40</b> And 11 per cent of all deaths in 2005 were listed as 
suicides. From 2001 to 2004, 344 women took their own lives.<b>41</b> In 2007, 123 cases of suicide 
were registered in Khatlon, with 74 (60 per cent) having been committed by women. In the first 
half of 2006, 102 persons - among whom 39 women (38.2 per cent) - committed suicide in Sogd 
oblast and 26 attempted suicide.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Article 109 on &#8220;Driving to suicide&#8221; of the Criminal Code can be used to prosecute an 
alleged violent abuser for his moral culpability for the suicide. There have been a few 
prosecutions under this article. Such cases are very difficult to prove as there are usually few 
witnesses other than the abuser&#8217;s family members. 
</p>
<p>37. In other cases, women have resorted to killing their abusers. Many of the women 
detainees I met in the Nurek prison were convicted for murdering their partners, whether 
during a fight or in a premeditated manner. They were condemned to heavy sentences ranging 
from 7 to 20 years in prison. Imprisonment of women is particularly devastating for family 
maintenance and childcare. The Presidential amnesty which resulted in the release of most 
women detainees in 2006 did not include those women who committed murder. While 
recognizing the gravity of their crimes, women&#8217;s criminality under situations of extreme abuse 
and violence needs to be treated with diligence, and their cases must be assessed in light of 
mitigating circumstances.<b>43

<p>  The &#8220;battered women&#8221; syndrome/defence may shed light into the circumstances in which a 
violent act was committed. Courts in a number of countries have acknowledged that battered 
women use force or kill as a way to defend themselves or respond to provocation. As a result, 
courts have given out more lenient sentences. See e.g. Thornton (No. 2) [1996] All ER 1023, 
<i>R. v. Kiranjit Ahluwalia</i> [1992], <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852. </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Aggravating factors 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Social convention 
</b></p>
<p>38. Many women are conditioned or pressured to remain silent under abusive conditions and 
made to believe that reporting violence would contravene societal values. Two recent surveys<b>44</b> 
demonstrated the broad acceptance by the population of violence against women, in particular 
domestic violence. An overwhelming majority of women and men interviewed agreed that 
physical violence against women was justified for a number of reasons, such as if wives 
answered back or disobeyed, did not respect husband&#8217;s relatives, or when a husband was angry 
with his wife. While, according to the Khatlon survey, more women than men accepted physical 
violence, there were no significant differences among women of various education levels and 
age. Acceptance of sexual violence was also significant, though less than of physical violence. 
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, most women have little or no awareness of their rights or about national and 
international mechanisms for redress. Awareness-raising campaigns on violence against women 
conducted by national and international organizations have been limited in time and geography.<b>45</b> 
The media has so far shown little interest in covering issues related to women&#8217;s rights, and legal 
aid provided by NGOs is insufficient. The situation seems particularly problematic in rural areas, 
where women have little access to information, legal aid or services. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Marriage practices 
</b></p>
<p>40. In the Tajik context, the legal status of a marriage is a crucial factor in providing women 
with access to some legal protection from abuse and safeguarding their socio-economic rights. In 
this regard, women&#8217;s organizations have expressed concern about the increasing rate of 
unregistered marriages - both monogamous and polygamous, which is said to diminish women&#8217;s 
access to entitlements.<b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>41. Religious marriages are not legally recognized by the secular laws of Tajikistan. Article 1 
of the 1998 Family Code provides that only the marriages registered with the civil registry 
office, or ZAGS, are recognized by the State.<b>47</b> Therefore, provision under the Family and Civil 
Codes and the Constitution, which provide women and men equal rights in marriage and upon its

</b>  For instance, the Swiss Cooperation Office has raised awareness of domestic violence through

with the OSCE, runs annual information campaigns on violence against women.

</p>
<p>dissolution, including the equal division of property and assets acquired during marriage, do not 
apply to couples without an official marriage certificate, leaving women in such unions in a 
vulnerable position upon divorce or the husband&#8217;s death. A woman without a civil marriage 
certificate could also be evicted from her home, a situation confirmed by the large number of 
cases received by crisis centres and the Committee for Family and Women Affairs. She may 
nonetheless be authorized by court to remain at her ex-husband&#8217;s place - upon proof that she and 
her de facto husband lived together and she contributed to the household. Women with children - 
provided the children are recognized by their natural father - may obtain greater entitlements to 
property, alimony and inheritance. 
</p>
<p>42. Reasons for the worrisome increase in unregistered matrimonies are varied. Reference was 
made to the 20 Somoni (about US$ 5.80) registration fee for the official marriage as being a 
cause, but compared to other wedding costs such a sum is negligible. While the rising influence 
of religion has also been mentioned, the primary cause behind the deviation from civil marriages 
seems to be linked to poverty and the motivation of the in-laws or the husband to deny the wife 
access to family property and assets, which more often than not is under the legal ownership of 
the in-laws. 
</p>
<p>43. Women in unregistered marriages are said to be more vulnerable to being subjected to 
violence and abuse, and have more difficulty ending an abusive relationship due to lack of 
support, alternative housing and legal protection, compared to women in a civil marriage. 
A 1999 WHO survey found that 52 per cent of women in unregistered marriages, compared to 
40 per cent of women in registered marriages, experienced sexual abuse; 67 per cent of women 
in unregistered marriages versus 51 per cent of women officially married experienced 
psychological abuse.<b>48</b> Many of the former, along with their children, are also most likely to be 
abandoned or evicted from their home by their de facto husband or his relatives.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The rise in unregistered marriages is invariably accompanied by early and polygamous 
marriages. Evidence shows that girls are being married at an increasingly younger age, and often 
against their will. The legal age of marriage has also been reduced from 18 years in Soviet times 
to 17 (art. 13, Family Code), for both boys and girls. Under some circumstances, such as 
pregnancy, marriage may be concluded at 16. Marriages under the legal age are criminalized 
under the Criminal Code and cannot be registered officially. An unregistered religious marriage 
offers a way out for those wishing to wed their daughters at a young age. Early marriages - 
whether registered or not - have adverse impact on girls&#8217; physical and psychological 
development as well as their attendance in school and their acquisition of professional skills, thus 
limiting their life choices.

</p>
<p>45. Similarly, although there are no exact figures, polygamy is also said to be on the increase 
since independence.<b>50</b> There is a general understanding in the society that the rise in polygamous 
practices is caused by the imbalance in the sex ratio, which has been caused by the civil war and 
male migration abroad. 
</p>
<p>46. Migration not only reduces the number of marriageable men but it also results in 
polygamous relations, as married migrant men reportedly often engage in extramarital relations 
abroad, eventually get married and establish new families.<b>51</b> This may have dire consequences 
for the well-being of the wife left in Tajikistan. Saidova&#8217;s husband, with whom she was married 
for 14 years, worked in the Russian Federation. Not only did he not send money but he ended up 
settling in Russia with his new wife. He gave away the house where Saidova lived, and she was 
thrown out on the street. A court annulled the husband&#8217;s decision and granted her the right to 
remain in the house. Upon appeal by the husband, the court authorized the sharing of the price of 
the house between the couple. As Saidova was responsible for raising their four children, the 
money granted by the court was not sufficient for her to live on. When I met her, she was 
appealing the decision and planned to file for divorce. 
</p>
<p>47. According to article 170 of the Criminal Code, polygamy is a criminal offence. The few 
cases that are prosecuted<b>52</b> are apparently handled as aggravating circumstance to other offences 
or are politically motivated. Government officials pointed to the practical and legal difficulties in 
prosecuting polygamous unions. It is only upon the complaint of one of the wives that polygamy 
could effectively be prosecuted. This is a counterproductive process in practice as the law only 
provides for the imprisonment of the husband, who is generally the main breadwinner of the 
family, and a risky option for the complainant who may encounter severe consequences from the 
other wives and relatives in general. 
</p>
<p>48. While recognizing the Government&#8217;s apparent determination not to compromise the 
secular principles of the State, there is an apparent dilemma as the practice of polygamy 
continues and many women are left without any legal protection. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Residency registration and housing 
</b></p>
<p>49. Tajikistan inherited from the Soviet Union a compulsory system of civil residency 
registration - <i>propiska</i> - which is regulated by the 2007 Decree on the Passport System and 
administered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Although an administrative civil procedure, the 
<i>propiska</i> system gives rise to some entitlements to housing and is a way to protect people from 
eviction. This, however, is not problem-free. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>50
</b>  The State Committee on Statistics estimated that in 2007 there were at least 25,000 women 
</p>
<p>between the ages of 22 and 50 who were second wives.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>51
</b></p>
<p>  See Olimova, S. and Kuddusov, J.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>52
</b></p>
<p>  Thirty persons were brought to account (criminal liability) for polygamy and condemned 
in 2002, and 56 persons in 2003. (State CEDAW report, CEDAW/C/TJK, op. cit.) </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>50. Traditionally, upon marriage women move to the husband&#8217;s paternal home, but it is not a 
legal requirement for them to change their residency so most women are said to retain their 
<i>propiska</i> at their paternal home. A reason for not changing residency may be the lack of 
awareness of the possible advantages such registration brings. In other instances, the groom&#8217;s 
side may refuse to allow the bride to register residency at their place due to their reluctance to 
pay additional charges for communal services and grant her housing entitlements.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>51. Divorce or separation can have serious consequences for the woman depending on where 
her <i>propiska</i> is registered, whether the marriage is legally recognized, and who the actual owner 
of the house is - the husband or his family members. In the case that property was acquired 
during a registered marriage, upon divorce the wife is entitled to 50 per cent of it and other 
jointly acquired assets, and the location of her <i>propiska</i> becomes irrelevant. This option most 
effectively secures her rights. In most other cases the registration of residency in the actual place 
of residency allows a woman additional protection compared to the situation in which her 
<i>propiska</i> is elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>52. Frequently, the house is owned by the husband&#8217;s relatives, often his parents. In such cases, 
upon divorce, separation or the husband&#8217;s death, courts may grant a woman the right to continue 
living with her in-laws, based on her <i>propiska</i> there. Courts may also grant a woman the same 
right of residence based on her being recognized in judicial proceedings as a &#8220;family member&#8221; of 
the owner under article 121 of the Housing Code. In both cases, this right is solely linked to 
residence in the actual house and is not an entitlement to property. If the owners of the house - in 
this case the in-laws - decide to sell the house, the daughter-in-law has no right to any 
proceedings of the sale or to live in the house after it is sold. 
</p>
<p>53. Nonetheless, in such cases, the actual owner must ask any holder of a <i>propiska</i> in his/her 
dwelling for authorization to sell and find a mutual agreement. Should the <i>propiska-</i>holder 
refuse, the owner cannot sell the house as it would in practice result in the forcible eviction of the 
former. Problematically, courts do not seem able to prevent the owner from selling or, should the 
sale go ahead, to grant the <i>propiska-</i>holder compensation. Saraya was driven out of the house by 
her in-laws after her husband&#8217;s death. She submitted a claim to the court to obtain the right to 
live at her in-laws&#8217; place. During the court proceedings, her in-laws sold the house, and she had 
to bring another case to the court to have the sale of the house annulled. At the time of my visit, 
judicial proceedings were ongoing. Such practices do not appear to comprehensively protect the 
rights of <i>propiska-</i>holders and would warrant further examination. 
</p>
<p>54. Finally, while it appears relatively common that courts grant women the right to live in 
their ex-in-laws&#8217; dwelling - whether they hold residency there or not - as a protection from 
forced eviction, this may be the last option a woman would choose. The woman&#8217;s unwanted 
presence, as such, only results in her being subjected to abuse and violence, and therefore 
women tend to go back to their parents&#8217; home.<b>54</b> There are cases, although rare, whereby a 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  The Ministry of Internal Affairs will only register a residency provided the actual owner of 
</p>
<p>the dwelling and all other adults who are registered there agree to it. (Decree on the Passport 
System, Section III.)

</p>
<p>woman may be granted a sum of money by the court if her former in-laws objected to her living 
with them. Reports indicate that women with residency elsewhere would not be able to make 
similar claims before the court. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RESPONSES TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>55. This chapter focuses on the existing gender equality framework and responses by the 
Government and non-governmental actors to violence against women and girls, highlighting 
existing gaps in laws and practices, as well as recent initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Government of Tajikistan has ratified numerous international human rights treaties,<b>55</b> 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, all 
of which form an integral part of the legal system of the Republic (as per article 10 of the 
Constitution). Gender equality is recognized in the Constitution, and women and men are granted 
equal rights under many laws, such as the Family and Civil Codes. Policies and programmes 
have been adopted with the aim of increasing women&#8217;s status in society and ensuring gender 
equality between women and men. 
</p>
<p>57. Among others, the &#8220;Basic Directions of State policy to ensure equal rights and 
opportunities for men and women in Tajikistan for the period 2001-2010&#8221;, approved by 
Decision 391, sets up the framework for gender equality. It was complemented in March 2005 by 
a Law on Guarantees of Equal Rights for Men and Women and Equal Opportunities in the 
Exercise of Such Rights, which includes a definition of discrimination compatible with the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>58. There is no specific law on violence against women or on domestic violence, although civil 
society has been advocating for the latter since 2003. In recent years, the Inter-coordination 
Council has been discussing a draft &#8220;Bill on Social and Legal Protection against Domestic 
Violence&#8221;, but some opposition to its adoption remains. Although I was given assurances during 
my visit that the draft bill would soon be presented to Parliament for adoption, at the time of 
writing, there was no sign of such development. 
</p>
<p>59. The main objections to the law apparently pertain to the resources required for its 
implementation, and that it repeats provisions already covered in other laws, in particular the 
Criminal Code and the Law on Social Services.<b>56</b> Many of my interlocutors argued on the 
contrary that the law is crucial to increase victim protection and the prosecution of all forms of 
violence against women in the family, including psychological violence. More importantly 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>55
</b>  See CEDAW State report, pp. 3-6, for instruments ratified and programmes/policies on 
</p>
<p>gender equality. 
<b>56
</b></p>
<p>  See below for a discussion on the Criminal Code. The Law on Social Services, adopted in 
January 2008, regulates the provision of services for people &#8220;in difficult situations/violence&#8221;, 
mainly women and children. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>perhaps, a specific law on domestic violence would highlight the particular conditions under 
which women are victims of violence and help shed light on the need to address women&#8217;s low 
status in society in this regard. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government and civil society could take heed of comparable initiatives in the area of 
trafficking, in particular the adoption in 2004 of the Law on the Fight against Human 
Trafficking, and in 2007 of the &#8220;Standard regulation on support and assistance centres for 
victims of trafficking&#8221;, and the creation of the Inter-ministerial Commission on Combating 
Trafficking in Persons, which have undoubtedly resulted in positive results, including 
convictions of traffickers. 
</p>
<p>61. While various provisions under the Criminal and Family Codes can be used to address 
violence against children, such as chapter 20 of the Criminal Code on &#8220;crimes against family and 
minors&#8221; and provide sanctions against parents/step-parents in the event of abuse/neglect of a 
child in the Family Code, many of my interlocutors deplored the absence of specific regulations 
to comprehensively address such violence. Encouragingly, the Government has adopted a 
National Plan for Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Child (2003-2010), which 
recognizes the need to protect children from violence and deplores the lack of measures in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>62. Gender issues are supervised by a deputy prime minister who is also the Chairperson of the 
Coordinating Council on the Prevention of Violence against Women. The Council was 
established in April 2006 to coordinate prevention activities and legislative reform on violence 
against women. It is composed of representatives from NGOs and key ministries. It has a 
coordinating role and no budget of its own. 
</p>
<p>63. The Committee for Women and Family Affairs, established in 1991, is responsible for 
implementing and monitoring State policies/programmes on gender equality and reports to the 
Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Gender Affairs. The Committee is understaffed and lacks 
resources to function as an effective women&#8217;s machinery.<b>57</b> It thus relies on NGOs and 
international agencies. 
</p>
<p>64. Generally, the capacity of State officials to address issues pertaining to violence against 
women and girls is weak. A few Ministries, such as those of Internal Affairs and Health, in 
cooperation with international organizations, have been conducting staff training and preparing 
guidelines on how to deal with victims of domestic violence.<b>58</b> However, only a small proportion 
of the staff has been reached. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>57
</b>  At the time this country mission took place, the Committee had only one or two staff in its 
</p>
<p>provincial offices (oblast), while other similar committees have several additional staff. 
<b>58
</b></p>
<p>  Such as the 2006 methodological guidebook from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on ways to 
deal with domestic violence. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>65. The National Commission on Child Rights, established in 2001 to implement the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and coordinate policies and activities of government 
bodies and NGOs working on children&#8217;s issues, is said to have limited capacity to manage and 
oversee child protection and welfare services.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reporting and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>66. There is underreporting of violence against women and girls. Revealing domestic problems 
to the outside or seeking divorce are considered inappropriate behaviour for women.<b>60</b> Lack of a 
protective infrastructure and practices by law enforcement and judicial bodies further hamper 
better reporting. 
</p>
<p>67. The lack of specialized units in police stations that deal with cases of violence against 
women constrains the reporting of cases. Another problem is the lack of mechanisms under the 
Police Law that would enable the police to protect women who report domestic abuses, 
especially with respect to issuing restraining or protection orders. The level of cooperation 
between the police and crisis centres is also less than desirable, although some crisis centres 
systematically provide information on domestic violence cases to the local police. There are a 
few specialized police departments which formally record and examine claims of domestic 
violence, but these remain exceptions. 
</p>
<p>68. Often, the police may attempt to reconcile the victim and the perpetuator, instead of 
pursuing its investigation. Law enforcement bodies deny they do so, arguing that the problem 
lies with victims themselves, who often withdraw their statements and strive to find an 
agreement with their abuser, possibly because of their strong economic and social dependency 
on him. As investigations are based on statements given by victims or witnesses, if a victim 
insists that an act of violence against her was an accident the police cannot conduct an 
investigation against the will of the victim, unless other strong evidence is available. 
</p>
<p>69. Investigation and prosecution of domestic violence appears limited to the most egregious 
forms of physical or sexual violence.<b>61</b> One of the reasons is the lack of a specific definition of 
domestic violence and related penalties and protective measures in existing legislation. The 
Criminal Code provides for penalties on hooliganism, systematic humiliation, minor to serious 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>59
</b>  UNICEF report, &#8220;Service providers&#8221;, p. 3, op. cit. </p>
<p><b>60
</b>  In 2006, there were 52.7 divorces per 1,000 marriages. &#8220;Women and men&#8221;, op. cit., p. 60. 
</p>
<p>This figure can be misleading as it reflects only the termination of official marriages.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>61
</b></p>
<p>  A survey of judiciary practice showed that, among the registered crimes committed against 
women, &#8220;deliberate assault and battery and beatings&#8221; (75.2 per cent) and &#8220;rape and attempt to 
rape&#8221; (11.9 per cent) prevail. One fourth of the victims had experienced violence from family 
members, predominantly the husband. See Bozrikova T., <i>Court Practice on Violence against 
Women: Realities and Peculiarities</i>, 2004. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>bodily harms, rape, premeditated murder, all used by the police and the Procurator&#8217;s Office to 
address cases of domestic violence. Only serious bodily harm is prosecuted by the Procurator&#8217;s 
Office, and the threshold is very high.<b>62</b> Less severe harm, humiliation or hooliganism can be the 
object of fines but will not give rise to prison sentences or protection measures for victims. 
Further, the Criminal Code does not mention psychological/emotional violence, which therefore 
cannot be prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>70. An encouraging initiative, which should offer better redress to women victims of domestic 
violence, is the plan to establish by 2010 judicial chambers or &#8220;collegiums&#8221; on family cases in 
the courts of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, Dushanbe city, and in the Supreme 
Court of the Republic of Tajikistan.<b>63</b> 
71. While there is mandatory reporting by health professionals of cases of domestic violence - 
a measure considered by some as a deterrent for some women to seek help from health services - 
there is no specific diagnostic protocols and procedures for documenting cases of child abuse. A 
study by UNICEF revealed that most State bodies do not adequately identify, report and refer 
cases of violence against children.<b>64</b> Since 2003, pilot &#8220;child rights departments&#8221; have been set 
up in selected towns, offering child protection services and investigating/registering cases. In the 
absence of a legal definition of violence against children, established penalties for offenders and 
official protocols for reporting, registering and responding to cases of violence against children, 
these departments are limited in their ability to address such violence. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Community-based mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>72. Rather than turning to the police or courts, many women contact local government offices 
(<i>khukumats</i>), &#8220;<i>mahallah</i> (neighbourhood) committees&#8221; (self-governing bodies within a 
community) or religious authorities to settle cases of domestic violence or property and financial 
disputes. While their responses vary, these actors generally offer counselling and mediation, 
with the aim to reconcile the couple. Traditionally, <i>mahallah</i> committees and <i>khukumats</i> were 
male dominated, but many of them now have female members or women&#8217;s committees, which is 
said to have a positive effect on the outcome of a case and women&#8217;s willingness to seek their 
help. 
</p>
<p>73. Some of my interlocutors have suggested that, within the Tajik context, <i>mahallah 
</i>committees and religious authorities in particular could play a useful role in addressing violence 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>62
</b>  A forensic examination is carried out to determine the category of injury (light/medium/ 
</p>
<p>strong). I was told that &#8220;serious bodily harm&#8221; qualifies in case a person is not able to work for 
several days or is made disabled; an aggravating factor would be the pregnancy of the victim.

June 2007.

</p>
<p>within the family. In this respect, the cooperation between crisis centres and <i>mahallah 
</i>committees in Khujand and Kurgan Tyube is promising. The committees refer women in 
difficulties to crisis centres; give information on the circumstances surrounding the violence; and 
follow up cases. Some mullahs are involved in projects aimed at preventing violence against 
women and use the occasion of religious gatherings to stress Islamic principles of respect within 
the family. 
</p>
<p>74. The impact of these religious and community leaders on addressing violence against 
women has been mixed so far. Their involvement in this regard could be explored and 
encouraged, provided that victims&#8217; protection and access to justice are not compromised. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Support services 
</b></p>
<p>75. Non-governmental organizations provide essential support services for women victims of 
violence and abuse. They manage most of the dozen of crisis centres in the country, as well as 
hotlines, some under the coordination and in cooperation with the Committee for Women and 
Family Affairs. The crisis centres offer psychological and social counselling on issues pertaining 
to domestic violence, property, housing and divorce. Many of them now offer legal advice, 
acknowledging the significant knowledge gap in this respect. These centres are insufficient in 
number and are not accessible to women in remote areas. They also lack human and material 
resources and infrastructure. They depend on donor funding and their sustainability is at stake. 
</p>
<p>76. There are two shelters for victims of trafficking in Tajikistan, but only one for victims of 
all other types of violence, located within the crisis centre of Khujand since 2005; 154 women 
had used the shelter up to May 2008, because of domestic violence, rape, or housing and other 
personal crises. The shelter offers six beds only as it cannot afford larger housing facilities. At 
the same time, the health sector is neither adequately equipped nor trained to offer appropriate 
medical or psychosocial services to victims of violence. There is also a lack of long-term 
housing or programmes which would enable women to start leading an independent life. 
</p>
<p>77. There is no institution in Tajikistan for children victims of abuse, and none that provides 
specialized assistance for girl victims. Instead, children are placed along with other abandoned, 
neglected and criminal children in poorly run State institutions, as discussed earlier in this 
report.<b>65</b> A planned &#8220;girls&#8217; support centre&#8221;,<b>66</b> which would offer psychosocial and residential 
services for girls at risk and victims of sexual abuse/violence, will considerably improve the 
situation.

</p>
<p><b>F.  Statistics and data 
</b></p>
<p>78. Government bodies such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Judicial Council gather 
statistics on offences committed, although these do not specifically refer to violence against 
women or domestic violence, nor do they mention who the victims are or their relationship with 
their aggressor. Within the State programme on equal rights and opportunities the Government 
committed itself to set up a department within the Ministry of Internal Affairs to collect and 
analyse data on violence against women, but the proposal has not been implemented yet. Data 
compiled by the State Committee on Statistics is limited to information on some crimes such as 
rape and data from crisis centres.<b>67</b> There is also no centralized and systematic process/database 
for recording cases of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>79. NGOs have made efforts to compile comprehensive data on the types of violence 
addressed through crisis centres.<b>68</b> Surveys and studies have been conducted with the support of 
donor agencies and international organizations. Yet there is no centralized collection of data that 
could be provided to government bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Any assessment of violence against women and women&#8217;s rights in Tajikistan needs to 
bear in mind the continued challenges the country has faced since independence, with 
respect to the economic and social transition, high levels of poverty, migratory flows and 
the remnants of its civil war. Despite significant economic growth, much of the population 
resorts to subsistence farming and migration to make ends meet. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The consequences of these challenges have been particularly dire for women. 
Although gender equality is guaranteed in law and policy, the gains achieved during the 
Soviet era have eroded. The resurgence of patriarchal discourses and practices, often 
articulated in religious overtones, have placed an additional burden on women. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> As a result, women&#8217;s subordination has deepened, increasing their susceptibility to 
abuse and violence, which is experienced in silence and condoned by society at large. Lack 
of a protective infrastructure, women&#8217;s legal illiteracy and issues pertaining to marriage 
registration, residency, and the rise of early and polygamous marriages further aggravate 
their vulnerability to abuse and prevent them from escaping it. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Women&#8217;s access to justice and their protection from violence have to date been 
inadequate. Besides long-awaited improvements in law and judicial practices, other 
measures are needed to address the broad tolerance of violence within society and support 
women&#8217;s empowerment to be free from abuse.
