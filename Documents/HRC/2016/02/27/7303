<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The year 2015 will be critical for setting out the course for a more just, more 
</p>
<p>equitable and more sustainable future for all. As recognized in the emerging post-2015 
</p>
<p>sustainable development agenda, better protection of, and respect for, human rights in the 
</p>
<p>economic sphere must be a central pillar of this endeavour.  
</p>
<p>2. Private sector financing and economic activities have helped lift millions out of 
</p>
<p>poverty and contributed to the realization of human rights. However, governance gaps 
</p>
<p>within and between countries have contributed to an environment in which business 
</p>
<p>activities across a range of sectors and countries have undermined respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>Thus, the growing role of business enterprises in the age of globalization has brought into 
</p>
<p>relief not only the need for more effective policies and regulation, but also the need to make 
</p>
<p>business enterprises part of the solutions to today&#8217;s global challenges. 
</p>
<p>3. The United Nations, which was set up to lead global efforts on human rights, 
</p>
<p>development and peace and security, has a particular role to play in supporting global 
</p>
<p>action and governance frameworks to address the way business operates and affects human 
</p>
<p>rights and development. These issues all come together in the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
</p>
<p>Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (A/HRC/8/5) and the Guiding Principles on Business 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31), endorsed by the Human Rights Council in 2011 as the 
</p>
<p>authoritative global reference point on the respective roles, obligations and responsibilities 
</p>
<p>of Governments and business enterprises for preventing and addressing adverse human 
</p>
<p>rights impacts resulting from business activities. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report contains examples of the application of the Guiding Principles in 
</p>
<p>ongoing work by the United Nations. It highlights further opportunities whereby United 
</p>
<p>Nations entities and processes (including Member State-led) can contribute to scaled-up 
</p>
<p>action on the Guiding Principles and to greater policy coherence between business- and 
</p>
<p>development-oriented frameworks and human rights considerations. It follows on from 
</p>
<p>reports of the Secretary-General calling for the business and human rights agenda and the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles to be embedded throughout the United Nations system (A/HRC/21/21 
</p>
<p>and Corr.1 and A/HRC/26/20).  
</p>
<p>5. First briefly set out is the context of emerging convergence of current practice and 
</p>
<p>initiatives around the framework set out in the Guiding Principles (sect. II). The importance 
</p>
<p>of integrating the Guiding Principles into specific areas of United Nations work and 
</p>
<p>processes is then discussed, focusing on the areas of trade, investment and financial 
</p>
<p>institutions (sect. III), on efforts to promote sustainable development (sect. IV) and on 
</p>
<p>United Nations partnerships with the private sector in support of United Nations goals (sect. 
</p>
<p>V).  
</p>
<p>6. The report is not intended to cover the entire spectrum of relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>work and processes, nor provide a comprehensive mapping of current practice. Rather, it 
</p>
<p>seeks to signal and raise awareness about the importance of the business and human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective to development-related work of the United Nations and about ways in which 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles can help address challenges of policy incoherence. Its ultimate 
</p>
<p>objective is thus to make a contribution towards achieving socially sustainable development 
</p>
<p>founded on respect for human rights for all. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context: emerging convergence  
</b></p>
<p>7. Global standards and initiatives relating to business and human rights have started to 
</p>
<p>converge around the Guiding Principles. The corporate responsibility to respect human </p>


<p>rights as set out in the Guiding Principles has been incorporated into key frameworks such 
</p>
<p>as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for 
</p>
<p>Multinational Enterprises, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO standard 
</p>
<p>26000: 2010 on guidance on social responsibility of businesses and other organizations, the 
</p>
<p>International Finance Corporation Sustainability Framework for its lending operations, the 
</p>
<p>Global Reporting Initiative&#8217;s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (fourth generation (G4)), 
</p>
<p>the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, approved by 
</p>
<p>the Committee on World Food Security and into key United Nations frameworks for the 
</p>
<p>private sector such as the Global Compact.  
</p>
<p>8. Regional organizations are following suit. The European Commission endorsed the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles in its 2011 corporate social responsibility strategy and made a 
</p>
<p>commitment to support their implementation, including by publishing guidance material 
</p>
<p>and calling on European Union member States to develop national action plans.1 The 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe has also taken steps to promote the Guiding Principles, including a 
</p>
<p>declaration by the Committee of Ministers in support of the Principles.2 Among other 
</p>
<p>developments, the Organization of American States passed a resolution in 2014 expressing 
</p>
<p>commitment to promote the Guiding Principles and calling on its member States to apply 
</p>
<p>them;3 and the African Union supported the Working Group in holding a regional forum on 
</p>
<p>business and human rights in Africa in 2014 and expressed its commitment to supporting 
</p>
<p>the development of an African framework for implementation of the Guiding Principles.4 
</p>
<p>Further, a baseline analysis carried out by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights on the nexus between business and 
</p>
<p>human rights was published in November 2014, referring to the Guiding Principles as a key 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized framework that should guide developments in the region.5  
</p>
<p>9. There is an emerging trend of more States taking steps to develop national action 
</p>
<p>plans on business and human rights based on the Guiding Principles, often spurred by 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and civil society entities.6  
</p>
<p>10. Surveys, such as those by the Working Group7 and the Economist Intelligence Unit8, 
</p>
<p>and discussions at the annual Forum on Business and Human Rights9 indicate that a

</p>
<p>and Human Rights (A/HRC/29/28/Add.3). </p>


<p>growing number of companies are becoming aware of, and taking steps to, implement the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles in policies and company procedures.  
</p>
<p>11. Industry bodies such as the mining industry&#8217;s International Council on Mining and 
</p>
<p>Metals and the oil and gas sector&#8217;s International Petroleum Industry Environmental 
</p>
<p>Conservation Association have developed several tools10 to help companies to implement 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles. Corporate law firms and bar associations are also increasingly 
</p>
<p>emphasizing that corporate practice not only needs to be in compliance with domestic legal 
</p>
<p>requirements, but also aligned with international human rights standards, in particular the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles.11 In the area of finance, there is growing recognition among investors of 
</p>
<p>the utility of the Guiding Principles as a framework for managing social risks in a business 
</p>
<p>context.12 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group has been actively supporting these efforts through its 
</p>
<p>engagement with stakeholder groups. While it is encouraged by the many examples of 
</p>
<p>progress, it also considers that most of the hard work of translating policy statements and 
</p>
<p>commitments into action remains to be done. In particular, concerns about elusive progress 
</p>
<p>in achieving access to remedy for victims of corporate-related human rights abuse must be 
</p>
<p>heeded. Such concerns were an important factor behind the civil society campaign in 
</p>
<p>support of the decision of the Human Rights Council to establish an open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group with the mandate to draw up an internationally legally 
</p>
<p>binding instrument on transnational corporations.  
</p>
<p>13. Recent efforts to map progress by both States and businesses in the form of the 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights Resource Centre&#8217;s &#8220;action platforms&#8221;,13 guidance on 
</p>
<p>reporting14 and initiatives aimed at ranking or benchmarking the practice of individual 
</p>
<p>companies15 all have potential for spurring the faster change needed.  
</p>
<p>14. Within the United Nation system, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) serves as a focal point for the business and human rights agenda. Equally, 
</p>
<p>the International Labour Organization (ILO) has a central role in working with States, 
</p>
<p>business enterprises and trade unions to promote and monitor the implementation of 
</p>
<p>international labour standards that are part of the normative content of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles, together with other human rights standards. Beyond OHCHR and ILO, United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies, programmes and processes have supported the Guiding Principles, but on 
</p>
<p>the whole have been slow in integrating them into key frameworks (see A/HRC/26/20,

<p>para. 81). The United Nations should use its unique status to drive further convergence on 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles, and in doing so improve the policy coherence of governance 
</p>
<p>frameworks aimed at managing adverse impacts of economic activity and supporting 
</p>
<p>sustainable development. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Integrating the Guiding Principles into United Nations work 
and processe</b>s with a &#8220;business interface&#8221;: <b>investment, 
trade and financial institutions 
</b></p>
<p>15. As the Secretary-General urged in his synthesis report on the post-2015 sustainable 
</p>
<p>development agenda, there is a need to remedy the policy incoherence between current 
</p>
<p>modes of international governance in matters of trade, finance and investment on the one 
</p>
<p>hand, and our norms and standards for labour, the environment, human rights, equality and 
</p>
<p>sustainability on the other and to ensure investment policies that are in line with the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles (see A/69/700, paras. 95 and 105). 
</p>
<p>16. Despite this recognition, uptake across the United Nations has been slow, with some 
</p>
<p>notable exceptions. Tangible progress is needed to increase the momentum of convergence 
</p>
<p>around the Guiding Principles in order to manage and address adverse human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts linked to business activities. Concerns about the possible negative impacts on 
</p>
<p>people and the environment of current investment, trade and financial practices are a 
</p>
<p>regular feature of the global debate and a central premise of efforts to reform global 
</p>
<p>governance. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to action within the United Nations system, there are great potential 
</p>
<p>dividends to be reaped from aligning efforts on investment, trade and financial institutions 
</p>
<p>with the Guiding Principles. The United Nations system has great potential for affecting 
</p>
<p>business practice, be it through facilitation of dialogue, be it through facilitation of 
</p>
<p>dialogue, consensus-building, lesson sharing and capacity-building to encourage 
</p>
<p>responsible business conduct, or through more direct involvement in shaping rules and 
</p>
<p>governing frameworks  
</p>
<p><b> A. Investment 
</b></p>
<p>18. It is highlighted in the Guiding Principles that investment policies and frameworks 
</p>
<p>must be consistent with international human rights standards. The primary responsibility for 
</p>
<p>meeting this objective is held by States, which, as set out in Guiding Principle 9, should 
</p>
<p>maintain adequate domestic policy space to meet their human rights obligations when 
</p>
<p>pursuing business-related policy objectives with other States or business enterprises, for 
</p>
<p>instance through investment treaties or contracts. The importance of due diligence and 
</p>
<p>human rights impact assessments in the context of trade and investment agreements has 
</p>
<p>also been consistently raised by other entities of the United Nations human rights system.16 
</p>
<p>19. The former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
</p>
<p>rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises devoted a significant 
</p>
<p>portion of his mandate to these questions, focusing in particular on: (a) State-investor 
</p>
<p>contracts and the effect of &#8220;stabilization clauses&#8221; on the policy space of States to protect 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 For example, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food developed guiding principles on human 
</p>
<p>rights impact assessments of trade and investment agreements (A/HRC/19/59/Add.5). See also the 
</p>
<p>statement by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights entitled &#8220;Globalization and 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights&#8221; (1998).  </p>


<p>human rights; (b) the importance of greater transparency in international investment 
</p>
<p>arbitration where human rights issues are at stake; and (c) how provisions in bilateral 
</p>
<p>investment treaties may constrain States&#8217; ability to adopt legitimate policy reforms, 
</p>
<p>including for human rights.17 Since then, further initiatives have emerged, building on his 
</p>
<p>work, as highlighted in the following sections. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Promoting responsible contracts 
</b></p>
<p>20. The work of the Special Representative highlighted State-investor contracts as a key 
</p>
<p>area in which the Guiding Principles could add significant value. It led to the development 
</p>
<p>of the principles for responsible contracts (A/HRC/17/31/Add.3).  
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group, together with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR), is actively disseminating the principles for responsible contracts and the 
</p>
<p>training developed by OHCHR on those principles,18 as tools for government negotiators, 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians, commercial negotiators and civil society to help ensure the integration of 
</p>
<p>the management of human rights risks into the negotiation of State-investor contracts. 
</p>
<p>22. The principles for responsible contracts are increasingly being used to inform 
</p>
<p>technical advice in the context of investment contract negotiations for better management 
</p>
<p>of stakeholder-related risks. More work needs to be done to explore practices and promote 
</p>
<p>further uptake. The Working Group would like to encourage relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>identify examples of how the principles have been applied and how they work in leveraging 
</p>
<p>better practices. In particular, it calls for more work to be done, including on the technical 
</p>
<p>details, by relevant parties such as law societies, law committees, business associations and 
</p>
<p>groups of companies dealing with these issues, and negotiator communities such as the 
</p>
<p>Association of International Petroleum Negotiators, as well as government experts. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Investment policy and global value chains 
</b></p>
<p>23. One of the principal global multi-stakeholder platforms for discussions on 
</p>
<p>investment policies and practice is the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
</p>
<p>Development (UNCTAD) World Investment Forum, which involves Governments, 
</p>
<p>businesses, civil society and academic experts. At the World Investment Forum 2012, the 
</p>
<p>investment policy framework for sustainable development was launched. It consists of a set 
</p>
<p>of core principles for investment policymaking, guidelines for national investment policies, 
</p>
<p>and guidance for policymakers on how to engage in the international investment policy 
</p>
<p>regime. The framework refers to the Guiding Principles in the context of encouraging 
</p>
<p>investors to comply with internationally recognized standards and to carry out corporate 
</p>
<p>due diligence.19  
</p>
<p>24. To catalyse further discussion on how to integrate concern for human rights into 
</p>
<p>investment policy, UNCTAD and OHCHR, together with the London School of Economics 
</p>
<p>Investment and Human Rights Project, organized two panel discussions on investment and 
</p>
<p>human rights at the 2014 World Investment Forum. The panels reflected on the integration 
</p>
<p>of human rights into government investment policymaking and efforts by United Nations 
</p>
<p>organizations to support such integration. An example is UNCTAD guidance to States on 
</p>
<p>the investment policy framework for sustainable development and the opportunities it offers 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 A catalogue of some of this work is available from http://business-humanrights.org/en/special-

<p>for integrating human rights considerations into national investment policies and 
</p>
<p>regulations, and into international investment agreements. The framework has been used in 
</p>
<p>practice by Governments to guide their efforts in reforming investment rules and by civil 
</p>
<p>society as a benchmark to evaluate the impact of investment policies on sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals.  
</p>
<p>25. Another example is the role of the African Minerals Development Centre of the 
</p>
<p>Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in supporting implementation of the Africa 
</p>
<p>Mining Vision and promoting policy developments aligned with human rights standards. It 
</p>
<p>was highlighted in the discussions at the World Investment Forum that much more learning 
</p>
<p>and work needed to be done to understand the connections between human rights and 
</p>
<p>investment so that domestic policy and regulation, international investment instruments and 
</p>
<p>dispute resolution mechanisms are both designed to, and trusted by the wider public to, 
</p>
<p>foster the right outcomes for investors and for people.20  
</p>
<p>26. Another entry point is the work of UNCTAD on corporate social responsibility in 
</p>
<p>global value chains.21 It seeks to analyse policies on corporate social responsibility with a 
</p>
<p>view to identifying best practices for maximizing the development impact of corporate 
</p>
<p>activities, in particular by transnational corporations, for which the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>provide a useful reference. Ongoing work includes a forthcoming paper on corporate social 
</p>
<p>responsibility in export processing zones, which highlights the State duty to protect in 
</p>
<p>relation to business activities in such zones.22  
</p>
<p>27. One platform with potential for contributing to further convergence around the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles is the inter-agency round table on corporate social responsibility jointly 
</p>
<p>organized by UNCTAD, ILO and OECD.23 The round table is an event organized to 
</p>
<p>provide an opportunity for international organizations to better collaborate and align their 
</p>
<p>activities and give States a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for discussing corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>issues with relevant experts within international organizations. It could play an important 
</p>
<p>role in promoting implementation of the Guiding Principles and policies and practices 
</p>
<p>aligned with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>28. One cross-cutting aspect related to making progress on implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles is the issue of corporate reporting on human rights commitments and 
</p>
<p>due diligence in the context of corporate social responsibility. A recent framework 
</p>
<p>developed to support corporate reporting on the Guiding Principles,24 for example, presents 
</p>
<p>opportunities for making progress. There is a general interest in ensuring access to 
</p>
<p>information upon which market decisions can be based &#8211; including in the contexts of 
</p>
<p>investment, lending, mergers and acquisitions, and trade. It would be only logical for such 
</p>
<p>information to disclose how risks of harm to people are assessed and addressed. This point 
</p>
<p>was also highlighted by a group of investors welcoming the above-mentioned reporting 
</p>
<p>framework, which emphasized that meaningful disclosure of human rights performance

</p>
<p><b> 3. International investment agreements and dispute settlements 
</b></p>
<p>29. Carrying forward discussions about reforming the international investment 
</p>
<p>agreements regime, in February 2015 UNCTAD convened a range of stakeholders from the 
</p>
<p>investment and development community to identify strategies and action points for a 
</p>
<p>sustainable development friendly international investment framework and improved global 
</p>
<p>investment governance.26 The Guiding Principles can also serve as a useful reference for 
</p>
<p>addressing some of the current failures of the international investment agreements regime, 
</p>
<p>as they provide an agreed normative framework with benchmarks for assessing and 
</p>
<p>informing government and corporate action to assess and address the adverse human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts of business activities.  
</p>
<p>30. The world of international investment  is both complex and fluid, and is 
</p>
<p>characterized by a growing number of both international investment agreements and 
</p>
<p>investor-State dispute settlement cases. At the end of 2014 there were 3,268 such 
</p>
<p>international investment agreements and 608 known investor-State dispute settlement 
</p>
<p>cases.27 In particular, the increasing number of investor-State dispute settlement cases has 
</p>
<p>prompted debate about the legitimacy of the system, especially where high-profile 
</p>
<p>negotiations on international investment agreements have been the subject of public 
</p>
<p>controversy. The expansion in the use and interpretation of provisions in international 
</p>
<p>investment agreements to protect investors and subject disputes to binding international 
</p>
<p>arbitration has in a number of cases enabled investors to sue Governments for policies and 
</p>
<p>regulations introduced to pursue public interest goals, such as new labour standards and 
</p>
<p>environmental protection. The consequence may be that the States implicated are unable to 
</p>
<p>preserve adequate policy space to meet their human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>31. Some of the fundamental questions relating to reform of the international investment 
</p>
<p>agreements regime indicate the relevance of the Guiding Principles. For example, there is 
</p>
<p>an increasing realization that the success of investments requires not only the management 
</p>
<p>of social and environmental risks, but also of adverse impacts on people. However, there is 
</p>
<p>still not much experience in reflecting human rights risks in international investment tools. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, given that investment is intended to enable development, the question arises of 
</p>
<p>how investment tools should be designed to bolster, rather than undermine, the ability of 
</p>
<p>host States to protect human rights and realize development goals. Such perspectives and 
</p>
<p>experiences should be brought to the table in discussions on reforming the regime. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group also considers that there is a particular need for empirical research on the 
</p>
<p>links between the way in which investment agreements and arbitration operate and the 
</p>
<p>impact on enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Transparency in investment arbitration 
</b></p>
<p>32. A significant opportunity for increasing transparency in the area of investor-State 
</p>
<p>arbitration has arisen from work of the Working Group on Arbitration and Conciliation of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The 
</p>
<p>UNCITRAL Working Group started working on transparency in 2010, with a mandate that 
</p>
<p>stressed the importance of ensuring transparency in investor-State dispute settlements 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 27 UNCTAD, International Investment Agreements Issues Note No. 1, February 2015. </p>


<p>(A/6317, para. 314). In a written submission in support of that mandate, a Member State 
</p>
<p>observed that the lack of transparency in investor-State arbitration was  contrary to the 
</p>
<p>fundamental principles of good governance and human rights upon which the United 
</p>
<p>Nations is founded (see A/CN.9/662, para. 20). That work has culminated in two major 
</p>
<p>texts: (a) the rules on transparency in treaty-based investor-State arbitration, which came 
</p>
<p>into effect on 1 April 2014; and (b) a convention on transparency28 (the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention on Transparency), which was finalized by the Commission in July 2014 and 
</p>
<p>opened for signature on 17 March 2015. The Working Group on the issue of human rights 
</p>
<p>and transnational corporations and other business enterprises welcomes these new 
</p>
<p>transparency rules. 
</p>
<p>33. Both the Guiding Principles and the UNCITRAL work on transparency back 
</p>
<p>procedural and legal transparency and take a practical approach to achieving that aim. The 
</p>
<p>new UNCITRAL rules on transparency seek to address a regular concern with investor-
</p>
<p>State dispute settlement cases &#8211; namely that their typically confidential and non-
</p>
<p>participatory nature does not allow for involvement by affected stakeholders, or for an 
</p>
<p>adequate balance between the need for States to ensure that they retain adequate policy and 
</p>
<p>regulatory ability to protect human rights and provide investor protection, as clarified in 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principle 9. With the new UNCITRAL rules and the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration, States have a practical means 
to promote good governance and respect for human rights with a broader policy framework 
</p>
<p>that is aligned with the Guiding Principles.29  
</p>
<p>34. These rules, when they apply, provide a transparent procedural regime under which 
</p>
<p>investment treaty arbitrations are conducted. They can be used in investor-State arbitrations 
</p>
<p>initiated under UNCITRAL arbitration rules, as well as under other institutional arbitration 
</p>
<p>rules or in ad hoc proceedings. States can now incorporate them into investment treaties 
</p>
<p>concluded on or after 1 April 2014, but for the rules to apply to disputes arising under the 
</p>
<p>more than 3,000 investment treaties concluded before that date, the States parties to a 
</p>
<p>treaty, or disputing parties in an investor-State arbitration, would need to agree to apply the 
</p>
<p>rules under that treaty or to that dispute. This highlights the importance of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on Transparency, which provides an efficient, multilateral mechanism by which States can 
</p>
<p>agree, subject to relevant reservations, to apply the rules to all arbitrations arising under 
</p>
<p>their investment treaties concluded before 1 April 2014. The Working Group welcomes the 
</p>
<p>rules and considers that an obvious step for States to remedy incoherence between current 
</p>
<p>modes of investment with norms for good governance and human rights considerations, 
</p>
<p>including those set out in the Guiding Principles, would be to sign and ratify the 
</p>
<p>Convention.  
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group is pleased to have had the opportunity to engage with 
</p>
<p>UNCITRAL, including at its forty-seventh session in July 2014, and to note that in the 
</p>
<p>report of that session the Commission agreed that the UNCITRAL secretariat should 
</p>
<p>monitor developments in the area of business and human rights, in cooperation with 
</p>
<p>relevant bodies within the United Nations and beyond and inform the Commission about 
</p>
<p>developments of relevance to UNCITRAL work (see A/69/17, para. 204).

<p><b> B. Trade agreements and trade-related issues 
</b></p>
<p>36. The debate on the links between trade and human rights, and in particular labour 
</p>
<p>rights, is not new.30 Yet, while the Guiding Principles have begun to inform some 
</p>
<p>discussions in the area of investment regimes, the idea of translating the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>to the area of multilateral trade frameworks, notably in the context of the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO), remains underexplored.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. World Trade Organization and international trade rules 
</b></p>
<p>37. The former Director General of WTO, Pascal Lamy, contributed to the debate 
</p>
<p>during a panel discussion on the links between the global economic architecture and the 
</p>
<p>business and human rights agenda at the 2014 annual Forum on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. He argued that the current international system was failing in integrating human 
</p>
<p>rights in the areas of trade and economic governance, and called for a more integrated and 
</p>
<p>coherent approach. The &#8220;clustered&#8221; system whereby the Human Rights Council did not 
</p>
<p>consider trade and finance issues in country reviews, and whereby the WTO did not look at 
</p>
<p>human rights when doing country trade policy reviews, demonstrated the limits of the 
</p>
<p>system. A specific example illustrating this gap was the continued challenge of getting 
</p>
<p>WTO members to accept that ILO should have observer status at WTO sessions, a step that 
</p>
<p>could contribute to greater coherence.31 Mr. Lamy had, in his capacity as WTO Director 
</p>
<p>General, pointed out that for trade to act as a positive vector for the reinforcement of human 
</p>
<p>rights, a coordinated international effort was needed, and that a coherent approach that 
</p>
<p>integrated trade and human rights policy goals should be developed.32 
</p>
<p>38. In the commentary to Guiding Principle 10, the need for greater policy coherence at 
</p>
<p>the international level is stressed, including where States participate in multilateral 
</p>
<p>institutions that deal with business-related issues, such as international trade and financial 
</p>
<p>institutions. They should do so to meet legal obligations, as States retain their international 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations when they participate in such institutions, but also for policy 
</p>
<p>reasons, as collective action through multilateral institutions can help States level the 
</p>
<p>playing field with regard to business respect for human rights. The Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>provide an authoritative global reference point for such efforts and could serve as the basis 
</p>
<p>for building cumulative progress &#8220;that takes into account the respective roles and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of all relevant stakeholders&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Labour provisions in free trade agreements 
</b></p>
<p>39. A review by ILO and the International Institute for Labour Studies highlighted that, 
</p>
<p>alongside the rapid increase in bilateral and regional free trade, there has also been a 
</p>
<p>growing number of social and labour provisions included in such agreements: 58 in 2013, 
</p>
<p>compared to only 4 in 1995.33 This is a positive trend, which has had positive impacts on

<p>national labour standards and the enforcement of international standards.34 However, it also 
</p>
<p>poses challenges, in terms of the risk of confusion and diverging interpretation, and thereby 
</p>
<p>of uniform application and protection.35 While it is important to take the latter concern into 
</p>
<p>account, there should nevertheless be scope for going further, beyond the current focus on 
</p>
<p>labour provisions. It is pointed out in a research report on the &#8220;state of play&#8221; of the political 
</p>
<p>economy of business and human rights that this is possible, as reflected in specific 
</p>
<p>examples of existing trade agreements.36 A cautious approach would thus be to couple the 
</p>
<p>increased call for integration of human rights needs with international coordination and 
</p>
<p>alignment around common tools and benchmarks.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public procurement 
</b></p>
<p>40. A specific policy area with links to trade in which there has been considerable 
</p>
<p>movement since the endorsement of the Guiding Principles is public procurement. It is 
</p>
<p>noted in the commentary to Guiding Principle 6 that States conduct a variety of commercial 
</p>
<p>transactions with business enterprises, not least through their procurement activities. One 
</p>
<p>estimate puts the magnitude of public procurement at 15&#8211;25 per cent of the gross domestic 
</p>
<p>product of OECD member States, and even higher in a number of countries in other 
</p>
<p>regions. 37 As emphasized in the commentary to Guiding Principle 6, this provides States&#8212;
</p>
<p>individually and collectively&#8212;with unique opportunities to promote awareness of and 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights in such transactions. Concerns that human rights requirements 
</p>
<p>would be perceived as trade barriers and be at odds with competition and trade rules have 
</p>
<p>been cited as a common obstacle to introducing such a consideration into public 
</p>
<p>procurement procedures.However, in order to meet their duty to protect human rights and 
</p>
<p>incentivize business respect for human rights in the context of procurement activities, 
</p>
<p>competition considerations should not trump international human rights standards. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>trade agreements on procurement make it clear that governments retain the authority to 
</p>
<p>adopt measures that protect public morals, safety and order. 
</p>
<p>41. The impact of sustainable public procurement on responsible business conduct was 
</p>
<p>the topic of the 2014 inter-agency round table on corporate social responsibility, at which 
</p>
<p>the importance of standards set by ILO and the Guiding Principles was mentioned. It was 
</p>
<p>affirmed that there was now near-universal consensus that sustainable procurement practice 
</p>
<p>was fully compatible with free trade and an important part of public policy. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>sustainable procurement was a concern for States in all regions and at different levels of 
</p>
<p>economic development.38 
</p>
<p>42. As seen in the 2014 annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, there is increased 
</p>
<p>interest in a number of jurisdictions in exploring ways to integrate human rights into public 
</p>
<p>procurement.39 However, specific measures are few. There are ongoing initiatives to

<p>address this gap, aimed at developing practical guidance and good practice models for 
</p>
<p>public authorities to integrate human rights due diligence procedures and requirements 
</p>
<p>when purchasing goods and services from the private sector.40 As emphasized at the 2014 
</p>
<p>corporate social responsibility round table discussions, collaboration is essential to reach a 
</p>
<p>critical scale. Members of the United Nations system can play a role in supporting 
</p>
<p>developments towards more State action and aligning multilateral frameworks for public 
</p>
<p>procurement with the Guiding Principles. Among the opportunities with potential for 
</p>
<p>contributing to reaching greater scale, both UNCITRAL guidance for procurement and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure projects and WTO discussions on government procurement could and should 
</p>
<p>make reference to the Guiding Principles and take note of emerging tools and good 
</p>
<p>practices.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Financial institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. World Bank Group 
</b></p>
<p>43. In the financial sector, the World Bank and its private-sector lending arm, the 
</p>
<p>International Finance Corporation, is another key player within the United Nations system 
</p>
<p>for enabling alignment with the Guiding Principles. The Corporation has already 
</p>
<p>incorporated elements of the Guiding Principles into its social and environmental 
</p>
<p>sustainability framework, updated in 2012.41 The current review of the World Bank&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Environmental and Social Framework42 offers a further opportunity for integrating key 
</p>
<p>elements of the Guiding Principles to prevent and mitigate the risk of adverse human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts related to the Bank&#8217;s lending activities.  
</p>
<p>44. It was stressed in a joint open letter to the World Bank President by several special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders, including the Working Group,43 that the Bank&#8217;s safeguard 
</p>
<p>standards should be premised on a recognition of the central importance of respecting and 
</p>
<p>promoting human rights in order to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, it was stated that, consistent with international law, with its own obligations and 
</p>
<p>with those of its member States, the Bank should acknowledge the relevance of human 
</p>
<p>rights in its overall programme objectives and incorporate human rights due diligence into 
</p>
<p>its risk management policies. Similar recommendations have been made with respect to 
</p>
<p>regional and national financial institutions.44

<p>45. A failure to align the World Bank Framework with the Guiding Principles would 
</p>
<p>mean that the World Bank risks falling behind standard-development that has taken place in 
</p>
<p>the context of private finance. The most notable example is the Equator Principles,45 a 
</p>
<p>much-cited risk management framework adopted by a group of 79 of the world&#8217;s major 
</p>
<p>financial institutions covering as much as 70 per cent of international &#8220;project finance&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>the so-called emerging markets. When they were revised in 2013, they were aligned with 
</p>
<p>key elements of the pillar of the Guiding Principles on the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect. The Equator Principles have been instrumental in promoting convergence around 
</p>
<p>common environmental and social standards in the global financial sector, and are 
</p>
<p>increasingly used by public financial institutions, including multilateral development banks 
</p>
<p>and export credit agencies.  
</p>
<p>46. Thus the alignment of the Framework with the Guiding Principles is not only critical 
</p>
<p>for institutional coherence. A failure by the World Bank to go in the same direction as the 
</p>
<p>International Finance Corporation and the Equator Principles could jeopardize the 
</p>
<p>momentum noted above. Conversely, an updated Framework aligned with the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles would constitute a significant contribution to reinforcing that momentum. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Financial system regulation 
</b></p>
<p>47. Another issue that merits wider attention is the links between international financial 
</p>
<p>regulation and sustainable development. The United Nations Environment Programme 
</p>
<p>(UNEP), through its inquiry into the design of a sustainable financial system,46 explores 
</p>
<p>how the rules that govern the financial system&#8212;(standards, metrics, incentives, 
</p>
<p>regulations&#8212;and the roles and responsibilities of global and national financial institutions 
</p>
<p>can help better mobilize capital for sustainable development. In order to do so, UNEP and 
</p>
<p>the Institute for Human Rights and Business convened a meeting in December 2014 on the 
</p>
<p>value of a human rights-focused examination of the rules of financial systems.47 The 
</p>
<p>meeting report48 suggests that the Guiding Principles could be a useful framework for the 
</p>
<p>UNEP inquiry, so that the focus is both on the State duty to protect, in line with States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations, and on the responsibility of business enterprises, 
</p>
<p>including in the financial sector, to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>48. These issues were further developed at a second meeting, in March 2015, which will 
</p>
<p>inform a forthcoming working paper for the UNEP inquiry. Questions identified included 
</p>
<p>exploring the different levels at which the financial sector has an impact on human rights; 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence with regard to financial products, other than project finance, 
</p>
<p>such as derivatives and commodities trading, and the implications of human rights 
</p>
<p>considerations for monetary policy.49

</p>
<p>which it would be useful to shed further light with a view to achieving greater policy

<p>coherence at different levels of the patchwork of international, regional and domestic

<p><b> 3. Sustainable stock exchanges 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative is yet another area of finance where 
</p>
<p>explicit alignment with the Guiding Principles could add value. The Initiative, which is co-
</p>
<p>convened by the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, 
</p>
<p>UNCTAD, the UNEP Finance Initiative and the Global Compact, is a peer-to-peer learning 
</p>
<p>platform for exploring how exchanges, in collaboration with investors, regulators and 
</p>
<p>companies, can enhance corporate transparency&#8212;and ultimately performance&#8212;on 
</p>
<p>environmental, social and corporate governance issues and encourage sustainable 
</p>
<p>investment. The Guiding Principles could offer normative and operational guidance, for 
</p>
<p>example on matters concerning portfolio investors (e.g. pension funds) and their human 
</p>
<p>rights-related responsibilities in relation to investee companies, where the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles provide benchmarks on standards for due diligence and corporate governance.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Sustainable development 
</b></p>
<p>51. The growing role of business in economic and social development has underscored 
</p>
<p>the need for stronger accountability systems in emerging development frameworks. Two 
</p>
<p>main aspects are worth underlining. First, as part of their duty to protect, States must 
</p>
<p>protect internationally recognized human rights, and the Guiding Principles provide an 
</p>
<p>additional framework for States to ensure that businesses do not undermine development 
</p>
<p>efforts. 
</p>
<p>52. Second, as part of their corporate responsibility to respect, businesses should avoid 
</p>
<p>infringing human rights and address any adverse impact with which they are involved. In its 
</p>
<p>statement to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group pointed out that business contribution to a socially sustainable and equitable 
</p>
<p>development starts with respecting the rights of people affected by their activities&#8212;in 
</p>
<p>simple terms, by avoiding infringing on the rights of others and addressing the adverse 
</p>
<p>human rights impacts with which they are involved.50 Importantly, in the development 
</p>
<p>context, it is clarified in the Guiding Principles that, even though companies may undertake 
</p>
<p>commitments to support and promote human rights, this cannot &#8220;offset&#8221; possible adverse 
</p>
<p>impacts on rights elsewhere in their operations. Moreover, the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights also implies that business should not undermine States&#8217; abilities to 
</p>
<p>meet their own human rights obligations, including in their development efforts.  
</p>
<p>53. The ongoing efforts at the United Nations to establish the post-2015 sustainable 
</p>
<p>development framework provide a major opportunity for better integration of the business 
</p>
<p>and human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Post-2015 framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Sustainable development goals 
</b></p>
<p>54. Making the private sector in the post-2015 development framework work for human 
</p>
<p>rights has been identified as one of the foremost challenges for the global business and 
</p>
<p>human rights agenda.51  
</p>
<p>55. The increasing acknowledgment of the role business can be playing with regard to 
</p>
<p>driving economic growth and sustainable development has also been reflected in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 50 Available from www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/BNUNGuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR.pdf.

<p>proposed sustainable development goals (A/68/970 and Corr.1) as well as in the synthesis 
</p>
<p>report of the Secretary-General on the post-2015 framework (A/69/700). It is encouraging 
</p>
<p>to note that the draft goals refer explicitly to human rights standards and agreements, and 
</p>
<p>that they include a call to put people at the centre of sustainable development, for a world 
</p>
<p>that is just, equitable and inclusive and that aims to benefit all without distinction of any 
</p>
<p>kind such as age, sex, disability, culture, race, ethnicity, origin, migratory status, religion, 
</p>
<p>economic or other status (see A/68/970 and Corr.1, sect. IV, para. 4). With respect to the 
</p>
<p>role and impact of the private sector, the draft goals call for protection of labour rights and 
</p>
<p>the promotion of safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant 
</p>
<p>workers (target 8.8).  
</p>
<p>56. However, no reference is made in the draft goals to the Guiding Principles and the 
</p>
<p>importance of ensuring protection and respect for all internationally recognized human 
</p>
<p>rights in the context of business operations. Failure to include such a reference in the final 
</p>
<p>goals and supporting documents would constitute a significant lost opportunity to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the acknowledgment of the increased role of the private sector in driving sustainable 
</p>
<p>development is also coupled with the necessary accountability for a greater role and impact. 
</p>
<p>57. While the need for greater policy and institutional coherence is acknowledged in the 
</p>
<p>draft (targets 17.13-17.15), the wording on the need to achieve greater policy coherence 
</p>
<p>across international frameworks relating to the business sector, ranging from investment to 
</p>
<p>trade frameworks and programmes, should be strengthened in the final goals and efforts to 
</p>
<p>implement them at the country level should be enhanced. Guiding Principles 9 and 10 could 
</p>
<p>provide the necessary guidance with regard to setting a benchmark for greater policy 
</p>
<p>coherence. It is not yet clear how the goals and, more specifically, the targets under each 
</p>
<p>goal, will be adapted to the national level. In line with the outcome of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Conference on Sustainable Development, it is critical that efforts to tailor global targets to 
</p>
<p>national circumstances be guided by the obligations of States and businesses under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, as embodied in the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>58. A major gap is the lack of reference to accountability mechanisms with regard to the 
</p>
<p>potential adverse impacts of business operations and the governance gaps created by 
</p>
<p>globalization, which are a central premise of the Guiding Principles. Accountability should 
</p>
<p>be at the heart of the process, and it should be acknowledged in the sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals that individuals need to have access to meaningful consultation, in order 
</p>
<p>to voice concerns prior to business operations that may have an impact on their human 
</p>
<p>rights, and to remedy mechanisms, both judicial and non-judicial, when abuses occur.  
</p>
<p>59. With regard to the accountability of businesses, in Guiding Principle 3 emphasis is 
</p>
<p>placed on the role of corporate governance and the need to ensure that relevant laws and 
</p>
<p>policies not only prohibit but require companies (and company officers such as board 
</p>
<p>directors) to actively consider human rights risks.52 
</p>
<p>60. Another concern is the lack of references in draft sustainable development goal 17, 
</p>
<p>on revitalizing partnerships, to the need to avoid adverse impacts in the context of public-
</p>
<p>private partnerships. Reiterating the State&#8217;s duty to foster respect for human rights by 
</p>
<p>businesses through adequate regulation and policies and the minimum expectation that 
</p>
<p>businesses will contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development goals in a way 
</p>
<p>that is consistent with their corporate responsibility to respect human rights, could ground 
</p>
<p>the goal of effective partnerships more firmly in international standards.  
</p>

<p>61. While hundreds of public-private partnerships already exist, as pointed out by the 
</p>
<p>Institute for Human Rights and Business , &#8220;we don&#8217;t yet have solid evidence or even shared 
</p>
<p>views on what good practice looks like and we are still in the early stages of developing 
</p>
<p>effective tools for evaluating the impacts and results of such partnerships across the 
</p>
<p>board&#8221;.53 Initiatives such as that pursued by the Institute54 to assess and report on how 
</p>
<p>partnerships with the private sector could be made more accountable and consistent with 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles and international human rights standards in the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development context should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p>62. The sustainable development goals should also be strengthened in relation to the 
</p>
<p>critical role of reporting on human rights in the context of sustainability reporting. In draft 
</p>
<p>target 12.6 companies, especially large and transnational companies are encouraged to 
</p>
<p>adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting 
</p>
<p>cycle. As set out in the Guiding Principles, accounting for how they address human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts provides a key measure of transparency and accountability to individuals or groups 
</p>
<p>who may be impacted and to other relevant stakeholders, including investors. Reporting on 
</p>
<p>human rights impacts and measures in a meaningful way would thus be a significant 
</p>
<p>contribution to enhancing sustainability reporting. Adding human rights considerations 
</p>
<p>alongside the social and environmental is critical. If companies do not report on their 
</p>
<p>potential or actual impacts on the rights of individuals, they could be missing critical social 
</p>
<p>and environmental impacts as well. Thus, adding a reference to the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>would contribute to aligning the goals with international standards by promoting 
</p>
<p>meaningful disclosure by companies.55  
</p>
<p>63. The draft goals also address the role of public procurement, calling for public 
</p>
<p>procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and 
</p>
<p>priorities (target 12.7). Here too, the goals and their implementation at the national level 
</p>
<p>should be in line with the Guiding Principles and include the clear expectation that States 
</p>
<p>adopt practices that are not only sustainable but that explicitly integrate human rights 
</p>
<p>considerations. 
</p>
<p>64. The goals are expected to be adopted in September 2015. The Working Group hopes 
</p>
<p>that the Guiding Principles will be adequately reflected in the final commitments at the 
</p>
<p>global and national levels. Much work remains to be done to solidify and translate the goals 
</p>
<p>into action by States and businesses and to ensure that businesses will contribute to, not 
</p>
<p>undermine, inclusive and sustainable development in the period beyond 2015. The Guiding

<p> 55 A government-led initiative in this area, supported by UNEP and the Global Reporting Initiative, is 
</p>
<p>the Group of Friends of Paragraph 47 following acknowledgement of the importance of corporate 
</p>
<p>sustainability reporting in paragraph 47 of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference 
</p>
<p>on Sustainable Development. The Guiding Principles are referenced in its frequently asked questions 
</p>
<p>on corporate sustainability reporting, available from

</p>
<p>Business/CorporateSustainabilityReporting/GroupofFriendsofParagraph47/FAQsonCorporateSustaina
</p>
<p>bilityReporting/tabid/106320/Default.aspx. Another initiative in this context involves the Global 
</p>
<p>Reporting Initiative, the United Nations Global Compact and the World Business Council for 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development and aims to mobilize the private sector behind the sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals. It will produce a guide for businesses for assessing impacts and aligning strategies with the 
</p>
<p>goals (https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/1361-10-07-2014). It would be critical for guidance 
</p>
<p>from such initiatives to emphasize the role of human rights reporting and alignment with ongoing 
</p>
<p>initiatives and tools to support implementation of the Guiding Principles. The recent &#8220;UN  Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles Reporting Framework&#8221; provides a useful tool. </p>


<p>Principles serve as a framework to guide efforts at the national level in this respect. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group will also dedicate parts of the 2015 Forum on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>in November, to engage key stakeholders in a dialogue on these issues.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Financing for sustainable development 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Guiding Principles should also be referred to in the context of the third 
</p>
<p>International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held from 13 to 16 July 
</p>
<p>2015, which is expected to play a key role in the follow-up to the post-2015 agenda. 
</p>
<p>66. The zero draft of the outcome document of the above-mentioned conference 
</p>
<p>includes a number of encouraging and important references to the promotion of more 
</p>
<p>responsible business conduct in the overall context of financing for development, including 
</p>
<p>the need for businesses to commit to and apply principles for socially and environmentally 
</p>
<p>responsible investment and business activities; complementary national regulations, 
</p>
<p>including for the protection of labour rights, and environmental and health standards; 
</p>
<p>mandatory integrated reporting for large companies; &#8220;coherence checks&#8221; on the sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals by relevant international institutions, private rule-setting bodies and 
</p>
<p>international and national development finance institutions, with a view to aligning their 
</p>
<p>business practices with sustainable development objectives, inter alia through assessments 
</p>
<p>of their impact on the enjoyment of human rights, including indigenous peoples&#8217; rights; and 
</p>
<p>progress towards gender equality. 
</p>
<p>67. While all of these references are welcome contributions to a strengthened 
</p>
<p>international governance framework, the outcome document should be more fully aligned 
</p>
<p>with international standards referencing the Guiding Principles. It should reaffirm the clear 
</p>
<p>benchmarks relating to the State duty to protect human rights in the context of business 
</p>
<p>activities, the business responsibility to respect human rights and the need for affected 
</p>
<p>individuals to have access to effective remedies. There should be scope for doing so, and a 
</p>
<p>suggested policy idea in the &#8220;elements&#8221; paper for the conference, contained under the 
</p>
<p>heading &#8220;strengthening the sustainable development impact of investment&#8221;, is to implement 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, core labour standards of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization and relevant environmental standards, with enforcement 
</p>
<p>and accountability mechanisms.56  
</p>
<p>68. Further improvements could be made by adopting the considerations outlined above 
</p>
<p>with regard to regulatory action and recommendations regarding corporate reporting. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Beyond the post-2015 framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Role of the United Nations Development Programme  
</b></p>
<p>69. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has a particularly important 
</p>
<p>role among agencies in the United Nations system in supporting global efforts towards 
</p>
<p>sustainable development, and can play a key role in scaling up action on the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. UNDP has supported implementation of the Guiding Principles in various ways. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group encourages further efforts along at least two strategically important 
</p>
<p>dimensions. 
</p>
<p>70. First, UNDP is uniquely placed to promote national action plans on business and 
</p>
<p>human rights and support the relevant national authorities and national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions in initiating an open, inclusive process to develop action-oriented plans by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 56 www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FfD_Elements-paper_drafting-session.pdf. </p>


<p>Governments to implement the Guiding Principles. This would be a contribution towards 
</p>
<p>better managing the domestic business and human rights-related challenges and fostering 
</p>
<p>dialogue and cooperation between stakeholder groups, including business and civil society. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group&#8217;s guidance for State national action plans57 could provide a starting 
</p>
<p>point, as could the emerging experiences of countries in different regions in taking steps 
</p>
<p>towards such plans.58 Among specific experiences, the role played by UNDP and OHCHR 
</p>
<p>in supporting national action plan processes in Malaysia, Mozambique and the Philippines, 
</p>
<p>with the involvement of the Government, national human rights commissions and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, could provide important lessons. 
</p>
<p>71. Second, as a significant number of governance failures stem from conflict over 
</p>
<p>natural resources where business actors are involved, there may be huge potential benefits 
</p>
<p>from better engagement with the business sector. A key entry point in that regard is the 
</p>
<p>UNDP Extractive Industries for Sustainable Development initiative, through which UNDP 
</p>
<p>supports capacity-building for national governance of extractive industries, including by 
</p>
<p>facilitating and convening dialogues on extraction with affected populations, especially 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, the private sector and Governments. Grounding such engagement in 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles would provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of duty-
</p>
<p>bearers in line with international standards and clear benchmarks for expected action by 
</p>
<p>States and businesses. Emerging tools and resources for companies59 inter alia60 provide 
</p>
<p>specific practical guidance which, aligned with the Guiding Principles could help support 
</p>
<p>such engagement.61 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Promoting regional dialogue on the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>72. UNDP has also played an important role in the organization of the regional forums 
</p>
<p>on business and human rights convened by the Working Group to engage stakeholders in 
</p>
<p>various regions with a view to promoting implementation of the Guiding Principles in a 
</p>
<p>manner that is better grounded in local realities: UNDP co-organized the Latin America and 
</p>
<p>the Caribbean Regional Forum, held in Medellin, Colombia, from 28 to 30 August 2013, 
</p>
<p>and supported the African Regional Forum, held in Addis Ababa from 16 to 18 September 
</p>
<p>2014.62  
</p>
<p>73. As highlighted in the report of the Secretary-General on the contribution of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system to the advancement of the business and human rights agenda, the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles can also contribute to the activities of United Nations regional 
</p>
<p>commissions focused on guidance, capacity-building and technical cooperation on

</p>
<p>Principles in the context of preventing conflict in this sector.

<p>economic and social policy involving Member States and other stakeholders in the 
</p>
<p>respective regions (see A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 41).  
</p>
<p>74. A welcome contribution has been the support provided by the Economic 
</p>
<p>Commission for Africa (ECA) in the organization of the above-mentioned African Regional 
</p>
<p>Forum. During the Forum, ECA stated that the Guiding Principles provided a critical 
</p>
<p>reference for a human rights-based approach to development, and that the pursuit of human 
</p>
<p>rights was a social and economic necessity for inclusive and sustainable development and 
</p>
<p>cohesive societies (see A/HRC/29/28/Add.2, para. 13). Other United Nations regional 
</p>
<p>commissions could usefully play similar roles. 
</p>
<p>75. With regard to the integration of the Guiding Principles in regional development-
</p>
<p>related initiatives, the aforementioned contribution of ECA to the African Mining Vision 
</p>
<p>through the African Minerals Development Centre provides a good example. The efforts to 
</p>
<p>mainstream human rights and the Guiding Principles in the extractive sector through the 
</p>
<p>design of national mineral policies are encouraging. Creating links with other efforts aimed 
</p>
<p>at promoting development of national action plans on business and human rights could 
</p>
<p>build further synergies and coherence.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Engaging small and medium-sized enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>76. While small and medium-sized enterprises make up the vast majority of the world&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>companies, they have been given considerably less attention in the global business and 
</p>
<p>human rights debate, in spite of the fact that such enterprises could affect human rights in 
</p>
<p>the same way as transnational corporations do and are less often subject to the same level of 
</p>
<p>scrutiny.  
</p>
<p>77. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) could play an 
</p>
<p>important role in supporting outreach to small and medium-sized enterprises. A starting 
</p>
<p>point would be to embed the Guiding Principles across its work, especially in the context of 
</p>
<p>its corporate social responsibility programme (but not only).63 The work of UNCTAD on 
</p>
<p>global value chains provides yet another entry point. Existing tools and research could 
</p>
<p>provide useful resources for aligning such support and engagement with the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles.64 
</p>
<p>78. Another highly complex challenge, also relevant in the discussion on linking the 
</p>
<p>development and business and human rights agenda, is to promote protection and respect 
</p>
<p>for human rights in the informal sector. This was identified as a key issue in discussions at 
</p>
<p>the African Regional Forum, one that needs to be discussed further among all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> V. United Nations partnerships with the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>79. Some final observations relate to the important role of United Nations platforms for 
</p>
<p>partnerships with private sector that already support the dissemination of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles.  
</p>
<p>80. The contributions of the Global Compact and the UNEP Finance Initiative are 
</p>
<p>especially critical for addressing the strategic challenges set out below.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 63 www.unido.org/csr.html. 
</p>
<p> 64 In particular the European Commission&#8217;s guidance for SMEs on the Guiding Principles, &#8220;My business 
</p>
<p>and human rights&#8221;, which provides an introduction to the field in simple language. See also the IHRB 
</p>
<p>State of Play report (see footnote 41). </p>


<p><b> A. Insufficient awareness of human rights responsibilities in the global 
</b></p>
<p><b>business community 
</b></p>
<p>81. The majority of the world&#8217;s enterprises have not heard about the Guiding Principles, 
</p>
<p>which is one of the principal challenges to lasting progress. Through its global reach, with 
</p>
<p>over 8,000 company members, a growing participant base and connections with local 
</p>
<p>businesses through 85 local networks, the Global Compact is already making a laudable 
</p>
<p>contribution to raising awareness of the Guiding Principles.65 Sixty-four per cent of its 
</p>
<p>participants have indicated that they are aware of the Guiding Principles,66 which is a 
</p>
<p>promising basis for achieving even greater awareness.  
</p>
<p>82. While smaller in size, the UNEP Finance Initiative is also strategically positioned to 
</p>
<p>contribute to closing the awareness gap, given that among its some 230 members are some 
</p>
<p>of the world&#8217;s major financial institutions and given the potential catalytic role of the 
</p>
<p>financial sector. One option could be to embed the Guiding Principles in all the activities of 
</p>
<p>the Initiative rather than confining human rights to a subtopic under social issues. For 
</p>
<p>example, as already mentioned there is a strong case for building on guidance on corporate 
</p>
<p>human rights reporting aligned with the Guiding Principles, including in the context of 
</p>
<p>finance. 
</p>
<p>83. The roles of both the Global Compact and the UNEP Finance Initiative in promoting 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles could be further strengthened through improved coordinated action 
</p>
<p>across relevant agencies and entities in the United Nations system to reinforce the 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising efforts already undertaken by OHCHR and the Global Compact. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of capacity and understanding to grapple with the implications 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>84. A lack of capacity and understanding to grapple with the implications of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles is cited as one of the most common challenges and one reason why uptake of the 
</p>
<p>Principles has not been quicker.67 An important role of the Global Compact is to continue to 
</p>
<p>collaborate with OHCHR to develop and disseminate guidance on how to implement the 
</p>
<p>corporate responsibility to respect human rights in practice, both on general aspects and in 
</p>
<p>relation to thematic issues.68 Global Compact initiatives with other United Nations agencies 
</p>
<p>on women&#8217;s empowerment (with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
</p>
<p>Empowerment of Women), children&#8217;s rights (with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund) and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; rights have helped to raise the awareness of business as to how to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 65 Constructive ways for local networks to support uptake of the Guiding Principles include supporting 
</p>
<p>national-level processes to develop national action plans and working with national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions. Seehttps://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/ 
</p>

<p> 68 The United Nations Global Compact tools and resources database provides a key portal with guidance

<p>respect and support the rights of these groups.69 In addition to producing and promoting 
</p>
<p>guidance on key elements of the Guiding Principles, the Global Compact has addressed 
</p>
<p>issues such as the role companies can play in respecting the rights of the lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual and transgender community, business efforts to support the rights of older persons 
</p>
<p>and the role of business in addressing the adverse human rights impacts of climate change. 
</p>
<p>It also undertakes training for business representatives at the local level through its local 
</p>
<p>networks, at the global level through interactive online webinars and through capacity-
</p>
<p>building events at key business and human rights conferences, such as the annual Forum on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights and the African Regional Forum in 2014. With its potential for 
</p>
<p>reaching a wide business audience globally, it would seem obvious that strengthened 
</p>
<p>resources for the Global Compact specifically to promote the Guiding Principles could 
</p>
<p>deliver significant progress.  
</p>
<p>85. The &#8220;UN Guiding Principles reporting framework&#8221; provides a useful reference to 
</p>
<p>help businesses understand the practical implications of the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights and for Global Compact participant companies to report on progress 
</p>
<p>on the first six principles (covering human and labour rights).  
</p>
<p>86. The UNEP Finance Initiative also plays a critical role in enhancing understanding by 
</p>
<p>business of human rights in the context of finance and in alignment with the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. Its guidance tool on human rights,70 which is designed as an online signposting 
</p>
<p>tool providing information on human rights risks for financial institutions, offers a platform 
</p>
<p>for learning and sharing information. It should be regularly updated in order to reflect the 
</p>
<p>rapid developments in this field and align with emerging tools and initiatives, such as the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;UN Guiding Principles reporting framework&#8221;. In addition, the Initiative works to better 
</p>
<p>understand the current landscape of human rights expectations in the context of banking 
</p>
<p>through an analysis of soft and hard law.71 Both of these projects led by the Initiative 
</p>
<p>contribute to clarifying the implications of the Guiding Principles for the financial sector. 
</p>
<p>However, as is the case with the Global Compact&#8217;s human rights work, fulfilling more of 
</p>
<p>the potential impact of this work remains highly dependent on the availability of resources. 
</p>
<p>87. In addition, engagement with other partnership initiatives involving the United 
</p>
<p>Nations to promote responsible business practices is vital. For example, initiatives such as 
</p>
<p>the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Principles for Responsible Management 
</p>
<p>Education and the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative should be firmly aligned with the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles across their activities and take into account relevant emerging tools and 
</p>
<p>initiatives to further support wider uptake of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88<b>. Since their endorsement in 2011, there has been progress in convergence 
</b></p>
<p><b>around the Guiding Principles in policy and tool development among major 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder groups. However, gaps remain both in terms of translating policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments into better protection of human rights on the ground and policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherence in relevant global governance frameworks. In particular, there is potential 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout the United Nations for more robust integration of the Guiding Principles.

<p><b>Principles in United Nations work and processes have been highlighted in the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report. These opportunities to align with, and support implementation of, the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles have potential for spurring uptake on a larger scale and contributing to 
</b></p>
<p><b>greater overall coherence in global governance frameworks that directly or indirectly 
</b></p>
<p><b>relate to the Guiding Principles. This would also be a significant contribution to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more accountable and inclusive post-2015 development framework. States and United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations entities are thus encouraged to act on the opportunities highlighted in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>present report. 
</b></p>
<p>89<b>. Although the scope of the report does not enable the Working Group to 
</b></p>
<p><b>examine other areas, such as peace and security and humanitarian action, where the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles would be of similar relevance, these areas should also be subject to 
</b></p>
<p><b>further analysis and engagement. Similarly, there is a need to better delineate roles, 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities and appropriate accountability systems for both States and business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises with regard to specific issues, such as water and sanitation, agricultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment, supply chains and child and forced labour, tax avoidance, corruption and 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate justice.  
</b></p>
<p>90<b>. A major challenge is that of </b>achieving policy coherence between States&#8217; conduct 
</p>
<p><b>in multilateral institutions that deal with business- and development-related issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>and their international human rights obligations. This is especially relevant in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of State-driven processes at the United Nations, including the negotiations on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the post-2015 development agenda. In Guiding Principle 10 the need is stressed for 
</b></p>
<p><b>States to draw on the Guiding Principles to promote a shared understanding and 
</b></p>
<p><b>advance international cooperation to promote respect by business for human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and help States meet their duty to protect against human rights abuses by business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 26/22, encouraged States to submit 
</b></p>
<p><b>information on their national action plans and other relevant initiatives on business 
</b></p>
<p><b>and human rights, with annual reports on the implementation of such commitments, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and invited all relevant stakeholders to submit relevant information to the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group. The Working Group would like to receive such information from States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders, including in relation to policy coherence. That information would 
</b></p>
<p><b>inform discussions and lesson-sharing, including at the 2015 Forum on Business and 
</b></p>
<p>Human Rights. The present report is part of the Working Group&#8217;s effort to enhance 
</p>
<p><b>cooperation and dialogue with certain key actors, as mandated by Council resolutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>17/4 and 26/22. In that regard, the Working Group would like to highlight its desire to 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursue efforts towards more comprehensive and systematic data collection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysis of progress and challenges, including in the areas emphasized in the report. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>looks forward to pursuing a dialogue with relevant organizations, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to more coherent approaches in global governance and ultimately to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve human rights outcomes at the global and national levels in support of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development.
