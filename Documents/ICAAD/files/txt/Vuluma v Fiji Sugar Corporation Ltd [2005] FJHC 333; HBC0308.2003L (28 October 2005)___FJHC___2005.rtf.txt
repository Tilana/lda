Background

The Tokatoka Natubawai owns Native Land Commission Lot 29 which is native land. The plaintiff is a member of Tokatoka Natubawai.

On the 26th September 1926 the Mataqali Nadakuvatu, Noibatiri, Vidilo, Matarisiga and Tunuloa granted 3,177 acres of part of their lands to the Crown for public purposes. The Mataqali Nadakuvatu, Noibatiri, Vidilo, Matarisiga and Tunuloa comprise part of the Yavusa Saru, which has 7 Mataqali in total. The grant was made under Native Grant No. 187. The grant area by the 5 Mataqali became known as the Lautoka Water Reserve. The land covered under the grant comprised of two parts, Part A and Part B which are referred to in the affidavit filed in the proceedings on behalf of the defendant and sworn by Alipate Radrodro on the 17th May 2004.

On the 27th September 2006 a title was issued for the area covering the Lautoka Water Reserve land. The legal description of the land comprising the Lautoka Water Reserve is Certificate of Tile Register Vol. 50, Folio 4999. The Director of Lands for and on behalf of the Crown became the registered proprietor of the Lautoka Water Reserve land, including part of the Lot 29, the plaintiff now claims is owned by his Tokatoka Natubawai.

Prior to the native grant, the Tokatoka Natubawai of the Mataqali Nadakuvatu owned Native Land Commission Lot 29, described in the Register of Native Lands as Volume 4, Folio 58.

Under Native Grant No. 187, only part of Lot 29 was granted by the landowners. By reference to Annexure AR4 to the affidavit of Alipate Radrodro sworn on the 17th May 2004, the area bounded by the black lines delineates the boundary of Lot 29. The area to the right of the blue lines is Part A of Native Grant No. 187 and the pink line is Part B of Native Grant No. 187, which comprises a narrow strip following the FSC pipeline. All of the land that carries FSCs pipeline which is the subject of these proceedings is contained in Parts A and B of Native Grant No. 187. The area hatched in green is the rest of the Lot 29 that is not part of Native Grant No. 187 and that area does not contain any of Fiji Sugar Corporations (FSC) pipeline.

FSC owns and operates the Lautoka Sugar Mill. The sugar mill requires large amounts of water and FSC draws this water from Saru Dam. The dam has been the main source of water supply to the mill since 1903. The water is piped from the dam to the mill by a single pipe. FSC holds a special water catchment lease from the Director of Lands to enable it to draw water from the dam. The lease is for 99 years commencing from 1968.

In or about February 2003, work commenced to replace the pipeline which resulted in a new pipeline being laid adjacent to the existing line of pipes.

Evidence placed before the Court by way of affidavit from the surveyor, Mr. Ami Chand who confirms that Part A of the Native Grant No. 187 is to the right of the blue line referred to in Annexure AR4 to the Radrodro affidavit and Part B of the Native Grant No. 187 is to the left of the blue line. It is considered by the plaintiff and defendant that the pipeline, the subject of these proceedings is wholly within Native Grant No. 187.

It is the plaintiffs contention that the plaintiff as reversioner has the right to recover damages for trespass. It is considered by the plaintiff that the plaintiffs rights depend entirely upon of it being a reversioner.

The fundamental issue for the determination of the Court is whether the plaintiff is in fact a reversioner with respect to the subject land and therefore has standing to bring these proceedings.

Section 8 of the Crown Lands Act provides:

When any native land which is been acquired by the Crown for public purposes under the provisions of the Crown acquisition of Land Acts or any other written law is no longer required for such purposes, the Minister, after consultation with the Cabinet, may, by order, declare such land to be native land and such declaration shall be recorded in the name of the unit from which it was acquired in the register of the native lands kept under the provisions of Section 8 of the Native Lands Act.

The plaintiff is indeed the landowning unit from which the land was acquired, however, the only evidence before the Court with respect to compliance with section 8 of the Crown Lands Act, is that on the 19th January 1999, there was a Cabinet determination that the subject land was no longer required for the original purpose of the grant. There is no evidence that the Minister has ordered in accordance with the provision of section 8. This being so there would appear to be no reversion to the plaintiff as section 8 has not been complied with. Cabinets determination is only one of the steps prescribed by section 8 to cause the land to revert to the reversioner.

It follows therefore at all relevant times the subject land vested in the Director of Lands and accordingly, the plaintiff has no standing to seek the orders sought in the Originating Summons.

Orders of the Court

1.      
Originating Summons is dismissed.

2.      
Plaintiff is to pay the defendants costs as agreed or assessed.
