Thirtieth session

<p>Agenda item 3
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 1 October 2015
</b></p>
<p><b>30/2. Human rights and unilateral coercive measures
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive
</p>
<p>measures adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the
</p>
<p>General Assembly,
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 27/21 of 26 September 2014 and
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 69/180 of 18 December 2014,
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to
</p>
<p>international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles
</p>
<p>governing peaceful relations among States,
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of
</p>
<p>all human rights, and in this regard reaffirming the right to development as a universal and
</p>
<p>inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights,
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its grave concern</i> at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures
</p>
<p>on human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that no State may use or encourage the use of any type of measure,
</p>
<p>including but not limited to economic or political measures, to coerce another State in order
</p>
<p>to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from
</p>
<p>it advantages of any kind,
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions
</p>
<p>have far-reaching implications for the human rights of the general population of targeted
</p>
<p>States, disproportionately affecting the poor and the most vulnerable classes,
</p>
<p>
 * Reissued for technical reasons on 22 October 2015.
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> by the fact that most current unilateral coercive measures have been
</p>
<p>imposed, at great cost, in terms of the human rights of the poorest and most vulnerable
</p>
<p>groups, on developing countries by developed countries,
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their basic
</p>
<p>means of survival,
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that long-term unilateral coercive measures may result in social
</p>
<p>problems and raise humanitarian concerns in the States targeted,
</p>
<p><i>Highlighting</i> the deep-rooted problems and grievances within the international
</p>
<p>system and the importance for the United Nations to give a voice to all members of the
</p>
<p>international community in order to ensure multilateralism, mutual respect and the peaceful
</p>
<p>settlement of disputes,
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its grave concern</i> that the laws and regulations imposing unilateral
</p>
<p>coercive measures have, in some instances, an extraterritorial effect not only on targeted
</p>
<p>countries but also on third countries, in contravention of the basic principles of international
</p>
<p>law, in a manner that will coerce the latter also to apply the unilateral coercive measures,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the final document of the sixteenth Conference of Heads of State or
</p>
<p>Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Tehran from 26 to 31 August 2012,1 and
</p>
<p>the final document of the seventeenth Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned
</p>
<p>Movement, held in Algiers on 28 and 29 May 2014, and those adopted at previous summits
</p>
<p>and conferences, in which States members of the Movement decided to refrain from
</p>
<p>recognizing, adopting or implementing extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or
</p>
<p>laws, including unilateral economic sanctions, other intimidating measures and arbitrary
</p>
<p>travel restrictions, that seek to exert pressure on non-aligned countries &#8211; threatening their
</p>
<p>sovereignty and independence, and their freedom of trade and investment &#8211; and to prevent
</p>
<p>them from exercising their right to decide, by their own free will, their own political,
</p>
<p>economic and social systems, where such measures or laws constitute flagrant violations of
</p>
<p>the Charter, international law, the multilateral trading system as well as the norms and
</p>
<p>principles governing friendly relations among States, and in this regard oppose and
</p>
<p>condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere with efforts to
</p>
<p>effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise, as called for by the General
</p>
<p>Assembly and other United Nations organs, and request States applying these measures or
</p>
<p>laws to revoke them fully and immediately,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14
</p>
<p>to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in
</p>
<p>accordance with international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade
</p>
<p>relations among States and impeded the full realization of all human rights, and that also
</p>
<p>severely threatened the freedom of trade,
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the General
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United
</p>
<p>Nations conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms
</p>
<p>of international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be
</p>
<p>promulgated, implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with
</p>
<p>all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and
</p>
<p>social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby
</p>
<p>creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and
</p>
<p>individuals under the jurisdiction of other States,
</p>
<p><i>Deeply disturbed </i>by the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the right
</p>
<p>to life, the rights to health and medical care, the right to freedom from hunger and the right
</p>
<p>to an adequate standard of living, food, education, work and housing,
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> by the disproportionate and indiscriminate human costs of unilateral
</p>
<p>sanctions and their negative effects on the civilian population, in particular women and
</p>
<p>children, of targeted States,
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are major obstacles to the
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that unilateral coercive measures have prevented humanitarian
</p>
<p>organizations from making financial transfers to States where they work,
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the necessity of examining the wide range of impact of unilateral
</p>
<p>coercive measures on international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as on the
</p>
<p>economy, peace, security and social fabric of States,
</p>
<p><i>Highlighting</i> the need to monitor human rights violations associated with unilateral
</p>
<p>coercive measures and to promote accountability,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on the institution-building of the
</p>
<p>Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the
</p>
<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his duties in
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
</p>
<p>Rights, which provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own
</p>
<p>means of subsistence,
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to stop adopting, maintaining or implementing unilateral
</p>
<p>coercive measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law,
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations
</p>
<p>among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which
</p>
<p>create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the
</p>
<p>rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human
</p>
<p>rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development;
</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in
</p>
<p>addition, threaten the sovereignty of States, and in this context calls upon all Member States
</p>
<p>neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective administrative
</p>
<p>or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or
</p>
<p>effects of unilateral coercive measures;
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain
</p>
<p>powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country,
</p>
<p>particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from
</p>
<p>exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and
</p>
<p>social systems;
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> that any unilateral coercive measure imposed
</p>
<p>necessarily runs counter to some provisions of the International Bill of Human Rights or
</p>
<p>peremptory norms and other provisions of customary law, and entails adverse consequences
</p>
<p>for the enjoyment of human rights by innocent people;
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also expresses its grave concern</i> that, in some countries, the situation of
</p>
<p>children and women is adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance
</p>
<p>with international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, </p>

<p>impede the full realization of social and economic development and hinder the well-being
</p>
<p>of the population in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women,
</p>
<p>children, including adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities;
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reiterates</i> its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to
</p>
<p>commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities arising from relevant provisions
</p>
<p>of the international law and human rights instruments to which they are parties by putting
</p>
<p>an immediate end to such measures;
</p>
<p>7. <i>Reaffirms</i> in this context the right of all peoples to self-determination by
</p>
<p>virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development;
</p>
<p>8. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total
</p>
<p>disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible
</p>
<p>with the Charter;
</p>
<p>9. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law
</p>
<p>concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the
</p>
<p>Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in
</p>
<p>its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State
</p>
<p>may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce
</p>
<p>another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign
</p>
<p>rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be
</p>
<p>used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be
</p>
<p>deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;
</p>
<p>11. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major
</p>
<p>obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, and in this
</p>
<p>regard calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive
</p>
<p>measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the
</p>
<p>principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries;
</p>
<p>12. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the
</p>
<p>increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application;
</p>
<p>13. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the
</p>
<p>World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly
</p>
<p>urges States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information
</p>
<p>society;
</p>
<p>14. <i>Stresses</i> the need for an independent mechanism of the United Nations
</p>
<p>human rights machinery for the victims of unilateral coercive measure to address the issues
</p>
<p>of remedies and redress with a view to promote accountability and reparations;
</p>
<p>15. <i>Urges</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due
</p>
<p>attention, within the scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and
</p>
<p>consequences of unilateral coercive measures and to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur
</p>
<p>on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in
</p>
<p>fulfilling his mandate;
</p>
<p>16. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the quantitative and qualitative documentation
</p>
<p>of the negative impact associated with the application of unilateral coercive measures in the </p>

<p>context of ensuring the accountability of those responsible for human rights violations
</p>
<p>resulting from the application of unilateral coercive measures against any State;
</p>
<p>17. <i>Acknowledges</i> the need to ensure that all relevant United Nations human
</p>
<p>rights treaty bodies and subsidiary organs of the Human Rights Council mainstream the
</p>
<p>issue of the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human
</p>
<p>rights and perform specific activities, such as during the review of periodic reports
</p>
<p>submitted by States to such bodies and under the universal periodic review;
</p>
<p>18. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the issue of the negative impact of
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures on human rights in its task concerning the implementation of
</p>
<p>the right to development;
</p>
<p>19. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the role of the Office of the United Nations
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights in addressing the challenges arising from unilateral
</p>
<p>coercive measures and their negative impact on the human rights of peoples and individuals
</p>
<p>who wish to realize their economic and social rights, including the right to development;
</p>
<p>20. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner, in discharging his functions in relation to
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay due attention and to give urgent
</p>
<p>consideration to the present resolution;
</p>
<p>21. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening of the first biennial panel discussion on the issue of
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures and human rights, and reaffirms its requests to the Office of
</p>
<p>High Commissioner to prepare and submit a report on the panel discussion, taking into
</p>
<p>account the practical ways and mechanisms proposed during it, including in particular with
</p>
<p>regard to the issues of remedies and redress with a view to promoting accountability and
</p>
<p>reparations;
</p>
<p>22. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the research-based progress report of the Human
</p>
<p>Rights Council Advisory Committee containing recommendations on mechanisms to assess
</p>
<p>the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and
</p>
<p>to promote accountability;2
</p>
<p>23. <i>Welcomes</i> the appointment of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact
</p>
<p>of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights at its twenty-eighth
</p>
<p>session, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 27/21;
</p>
<p>24. <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur,3 and
</p>
<p>requests him to focus on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights of victims and to address the issues of remedies and redress
</p>
<p>with a view to promoting accountability and reparations in his next reports to the Human
</p>
<p>Rights Council and the General Assembly;
</p>
<p>25. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in
</p>
<p>the performance of his tasks, and to provide all necessary information requested by him;
</p>
<p>26. <i>Urges</i> the High Commissioner, relevant special procedures of the Human
</p>
<p>Rights Council and the treaty bodies to pay attention, within the framework of their
</p>
<p>mandates, to the situation of persons whose rights have been violated as the result of
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures;
</p>
<p>27. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the assistance necessary to the
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur to fulfil his mandate effectively, in particular by placing adequate
</p>
<p>human and material resources at his disposal;
</p>
<p>28. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of the issue of negative impact of
</p>
