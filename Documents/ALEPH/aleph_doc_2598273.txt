DRILLING AND INDUCED POLARISATION SURVEYS
COMMENCING IN SEPTEMBER
Mount Jumbo 
 
The Mt Jumbo  gold  rich shear straddles EL38/3100 and ELA38/3127  and totals  greater 
than  1.3km  in  length.  A  number  of  intersections  are  recorded  Figures  3-6  and  Table  1. 
This shear zone is very prospective and appears as a NNE fault intersection off a NS fault 
that passes just  west  of the Wallaby 7Moz deposit.  This  shear zone has been drilled by 
Normandy Exploration Limited, between 1994 to  1996 within the Mount  Ajax E38/557 
and are summarised in annual reports for the period 7 October 1993 to 6 October 1996, 
GSWA WAMEX Reports A46159, 48654, 49933. 
 
Numerous high grade results are present with  34 intersections having over 2m @ 2g/t 
Some of the better intersections include 15m @ 2.4g/t from 97m in hole AXC013 (Fig.6 
and  Table  1)  and  4m  @  7.2g/t  from  104m  in  hole  AXC048  (Table  1)  and  the 
mineralisation  is  often  associated  with  gossanous  mineralisation  which  in  some  cases 
appear open at depth (Fig 5 and 6). A detailed ground magnetic survey (143km) has been 
completed over the 1.3km shear zone and over accessible parts of the interpreted Wallaby 
style intrusive.  
 
Three  lines  of  Induced  Polarisation  (I.P.)  are  shown  on  Fig  3.  These  lines  are  being 
carried out in September to characterise the gossanous gold rich shear zone encountered 
in the drilling and to also define the potential depth extent of this shear zone. There are at 
least  2  separate  gold  trends  that  are  being  mapped  by  this  I.P.  A  4-hole  RC  drill 
programme is planned for September 2016 to test for depth extensions of the northern 
part of the Mt Jumbo shear zone (Fig.3). 
  
A number of other prospective areas have been interpreted from aeromagnetics. Detailed 
cesium vapour ground magnetic surveys (472km) have  recently been carried out to help 
define the interpreted shear zones and intrusives. A subsequent field visit has prioritised 
the respective  areas  and  in  some cases initial  I.P. surveys  are  recommended. Additional 
drilling  will  be  carried  out  on  the  southern  part  of  the  Mt  Jumbo  Shear  Zone  and  other 
prospective  areas  outlined  once  the  Hawks  Nest  (ELA38/3127)  tenement  is  granted  in 
October-November.

Hawks Nest 3 
 
Hawks  Nest  3  (Fig.  7  and  8)  is  a  broad  zone  defined  by  surface  sericite  alteration  of  a 
porphyry  and  a  mafic  unit  with  an  unusual  carbonate  rich  sediment  which  have  been 
drilled  extensively  down  to  80m  vertically.  There  is  an  extensive  supergene  gold 
mineralisation  at  30-40m  depth  covering  an  area  of  400m  EW  and  300m  NS  with  17 
holes  having  values  above  1g/t  and  a  high  value  of  1m  @13g/t  from  22m  in  hole 
HNRC007  at  425176E  6825105N.  An  IP  line  is  planned  over  the  central  part  of  this 
supergene zone to help define the down dip extent and source of the supergene zone prior 
to  deeper  drilling  below  80m.  Previous  explorers  include  Metex  May  1999  Wamex 
Report A67631and Exodus Minerals Annual Report 97-98 Wamex Report A53924.

Hawks Nest 7 
 
The Marabou shear zone which is also called Hawks Nest 7 (Fig. 9) is 2.3km long and is 
well defined by a detailed cesium vapour ground magnetic survey completed recently. A 
number  of  anomalous  gold  intersections  are  present  along  this  shear  including  2m  @ 
110g/t from 38m within hole LJA0035 and 1m @ 3.6g/t from 44m in hole LJA0002. The 
shear  zone  is  defined  by  quartz  veins  and  disseminated  sulphides  and  by  a  conductive 
zone as well. Two lines of IP are planned here to help define the sulphides at depth prior 
to any further deeper drilling.

projected to surface, EM conductors and proposed I.P. survey.
Hawks Nest 4 
 
The  Hawks  Nest  4  area  has  well  defined  magnetic  mafic  rocks  which  are  disrupted  by 
WNW  structures.  The  southernmost  structure  has  a  number  of  historical  diggings 
containing quartz veins and ironstones. Sample HNR017 (Table 2) had a high rock chip 
value  of  51.7  g/t  Au  within  an  ironstone  on  surface  from  recent  sampling.  This  is  very 
encouraging and an IP line will be completed over this mineralised structural zone prior 
to drilling.

Hawks Nest 5 
 
Has a well-defined NS sheared strongly magnetic silicified banded magnetite-amphibolite 
unit that is up to 150m wide. A surface sample HNR08 from a working averaged 1.63g/t 
HNR06  (Table2)  on  the  interpreted  NS  shear  zone  (Fig.  11).  A  line  of  I.P  is 
recommended which will also cover part of the shear zone and some of the old Emerald 
diggings prior to any drilling.

anomalous rock chip sample and proposed I.P survey.
Hawks Nest 6 
 
Hawks  Nest  6  has  two  400m  diameter  circular  magnetic  anomalous  interpreted  mafic 
units that are broken up by NNW trending faults. The intersection of the NNW and NNE 
faults  is  seen  as  prospective  target  area  and  a  line  of  I.P.  is  planned  there  will  also 
straddle the northern circular feature.

NEW TENEMENTS AND BACKGROUND 
 
The  Leonora-Laverton  district  is  well  endowed  with  large  world  class  gold  deposits.  A 
regional  study  by  the  Company  has  so  far  identified  a  total  of  5  Project  areas  totalling 
272sq km (Fig.1 & 2) that have the potential to host large scale deposits. These tenements 
are within 50km of existing gold operations, opening the possibility for toll treating. The 
Gold  tenements  now  held  by  Magnetic  include:  Mt  Jumbo  E38/3100  and  P38/4201 
(17sqkm);  Kowtah  P39/8694-8697  and  P39/5617  (9sqkm);  Hawks  Nest  E38/3127 
(150sqkm) Mertondale E37/1258 (81sqkm); Christmas Well P37/8687-8694 (14sqkm). 
 
The objective of Magnetic Resources’ gold exploration program is to identify large gold 
deposits of 1Moz or greater utilising the geological and geophysical characteristics of the 
known  surrounding  deposits.  This  belt  is  well  endowed  with  over  34Moz  (mined  plus 
resources) being second to the Kalgoorlie region in WA. 
 
A number of very large deposits (Fig.1) are present including: Wallaby (>7.1Moz mined 
plus  resource),  Sunrise  Dam  (>10Moz  mined),  Granny  Smith  (>6Moz  mined),  Gwalia 
(7.3Moz  mined  plus  resource),  Westralia  (2.4Moz  mined  plus  resource)  and  Jupiter
(1.3Moz mined resource). The Mt Jumbo and Hawks Nest tenements are only 10km and 
20km north of the Wallaby deposit respectively. 
 
Work planned by the Company will be focused on extensions of any known mineralised 
zones within the tenements, identified by previous exploration, and large scale localised 
features  identified  by  geological  and  geophysical  interpretation,  that  are  prospective  for 
large scale deposits which appear to be largely untested. 
 
Initial work over targets  identified is expected to be will include gold soil geochemistry 
and ground magnetics, which in some cases can identify near surface mineralisation. The 
Company will also examine the effectiveness of any historical work including assessment 
of whether the drill depth was adequate.
