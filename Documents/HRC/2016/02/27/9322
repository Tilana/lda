<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component 
of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context, receives a large number of communications alleging violations of the right to adequate 
housing and related rights worldwide. Such communications are received from national, regional 
and international non-governmental organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations 
and other United Nations procedures concerned with the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the annual report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to 
States, responses received from States, observations of the Special Rapporteur, and follow-up 
communications and activities relating to earlier communications, from the period of 
1 December 2006 to 4 December 2007 and replies received for the period of 1 December 2006 
to 23 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters with one 
or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the allegations raised concerned 
the right to adequate housing as well as rights addressed under other mandates. 
</p>
<p>4. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total 
of <b>50 communications1</b> concerning the right to adequate housing to 25 States as well 
as <b>1</b> communication to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). 
Of these <b>51 communications</b> transmitted, <b>17 replies were received from Governments and 
1 from the UNMIK</b>.<b>2</b> In one case, a response was received<b> </b>on a case sent by the Special 
Rapporteur in preceding years. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur appreciates and thanks the concerned States and UNMIK for these 
replies. However, he regrets once again that the majority of Governments have failed to respond, 
or when they have, have done so in a selective manner that does not respond to all the questions 
arising from the communication. These communications remain outstanding and the Special 
Rapporteur encourages Governments to respond to every communication, and all concerns raised 
in each communication. 
</p>
<p>6. A large number of the communications in the period under review are related to cases of 
forced evictions. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under 
exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. In his 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>1
  </b>During this period the Special Rapporteur transmitted 26 Joint Allegation Letters, 10 Joint 
</p>
<p>Urgent Appeals, 9 Allegation Letters, 4 Urgent Appeals, and a document elaborated following a 
joint visit to Mexico regarding a specific case (entitled &#8220;Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones 
en materia de derechos humanos del proyecto Hidroelectrico La Parota&#8221;). 
<b>2
</b>  This number includes three replies received in Chinese which at the moment of finalizing this 
</p>
<p>report were under translation and which will be published in the next communications report. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>communications, the Special Rapporteur has referred the Governments to the Basic principles 
and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement that can be used as a tool to 
prevent human rights violations in cases where evictions are unavoidable.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a growing number of communications 
relates to threats, harassment, and imprisonment of human rights defenders and activists working 
on the right to adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur also notes that a large number of 
complaints and reports he receives relate to indigenous peoples and minorities, including Roma 
population.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>8. Through his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has sought to engage in a constructive 
dialogue with States and to provide practical and concrete solutions aimed at the realization of 
the right to adequate housing. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have to be 
understood in this context. In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur urges all States and 
other actors to respond promptly to his communications, to immediately take appropriate 
measures, to investigate allegations of the violation of the right to adequate housing and related 
rights and to take all steps necessary to redress the situation. 
</p>
<p>9. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply has 
been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where questions 
remain outstanding. The Special Rapporteur also invites the sources that have reported the 
alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this report, and send, when 
appropriate, follow-up information for further consideration of the cases.

</b></p>
<p>10. El 9 de Febrero 2007, el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n, envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n con respecto al sistema de provisi&#243;n del 
agua y saneamiento para la ciudad de Buenos Aires y sus alrededores. Los Relatores Especiales 
se felicitaron de que al rescindir el contrato de concesi&#243;n con la empresa Aguas Argentinas S.A. 
mediante Decreto 303/06, se hubiera hecho expresa menci&#243;n de que el agua es un derecho

<p>humano. Asimismo encomiaron la declaraci&#243;n efectuada del proyecto de ley sobre el marco 
regulatorio de Agua y Saneamientos de Argentina S.A. que fue aprobado por la C&#225;mara de 
Senadores el 13 de diciembre de 2006, en el sentido de que los principios del derecho humano al 
agua deben iluminar el nuevo marco regulatorio del servicio. En este sentido resulta preocupante 
que el proyecto de ley haya sido enviado al Congreso sin publicidad, y sin un previo debate 
participativo. A su vez, pareciera ser que el proyecto de ley no prev&#233; la consulta y participaci&#243;n 
de los usuarios y de las organizaciones de la sociedad civil respecto de las decisiones de la 
Agencia de Planificaci&#243;n que ser&#225; responsable de establecer y modificar los planes de de 
expansi&#243;n de los servicios, as&#237; como tampoco respecto de las que adopte la Autoridad de 
Aplicaci&#243;n, que tendr&#225; a su cargo la determinaci&#243;n de las tarifas. Los est&#225;ndares internacionales 
de derechos humanos estipulan con claridad que los costos del agua y el saneamiento deben ser 
asequibles para todos, incluso para los grupos desaventajados. En este sentido los Relatores 
Especiales pidieron al Gobierno la inclusi&#243;n, en el proyecto de ley, de una tarifa social. 
</p>
<p>11. El 22 de marzo de 2007, el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n, envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n respecto del desalojo violento de las 
familias campesinas ind&#237;genas del Lote 4, Pozo de Toba, Departamento J. F. Ibarra el 15 de 
noviembre de 2006 ordenado supuestamente por el juez Fernando Curet del Juzgado Civil de 
Cuarta Nominaci&#243;n de Santiago de Estero. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, esta orden no 
ten&#237;a ni fecha ni hora de emisi&#243;n y afect&#243; algunas familias que parecen hayan ejercido una 
posesi&#243;n pacifica y continua por mas de 20 a&#241;os. Las familias afectadas que forman parte del 
Movimiento Campesino de Santiago del Estero (Mocase-V&#237;a Campesina) denunciaron que el 
desalojo fue efectuado por 120 polic&#237;as armados que actuaron de parte de los productores de 
soja. Seg&#250;n estas informaciones, aunque en 1994 las autoridades judiciales reconocieron la 
posesi&#243;n natural de la tierra de los campesinos ind&#237;genas, desde entonces ha una creciente 
presi&#243;n por la adquisici&#243;n de dichas tierras, especialmente por los productores de soja. Para 
contrarrestar este problema, la C&#225;mara de Diputados del Parlamento argentino aprob&#243; el 1 de 
noviembre de 2006 la Ley 26160 que declar&#243; una moratoria durante cuatro a&#241;os para la tierra 
ocupada por comunidades ind&#237;genas y suspendiendo los desalojos durante ese mismo periodo. 
En este contexto el desalojo arriba descrito aparecer&#237;a ilegal. Adem&#225;s los informes recibidos 
indican que este desalojo ha impedido el acceso de las comunidades afectadas a los recursos de 
los cuales necesitan para su sustentamiento incluso el acceso a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada y 
suficiente y a recursos para obtener esta alimentaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>12. El 27 de marzo de 2007, el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente con respecto al desalojo 
de comunidades diaguitas<b> </b>de sus tierras ancestrales en la Provincia de Tucum&#225;n. El 2 de marzo 
de 2007, la polic&#237;a habr&#237;a procedido al desalojo de 22 familias ind&#237;genas de sus viviendas, 
ubicadas en las tierras ancestrales de la Comunidad ind&#237;gena de Los Cuartos en el Valle de Taf&#237;. 
Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, en el curso de dicho desalojo se habr&#237;an destruido las viviendas de estas 
familias, incluyendo el incendio provocado de algunas de estas. Asimismo, la polic&#237;a habr&#237;a 
hecho un uso excesivo de la violencia en contra de miembros de estas familias, incluyendo ni&#241;os, 
mujeres y ancianos, con un saldo de 15 comuneros heridos por el impacto de balas de goma. 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas el desalojo forzoso de la comunidad de Los Cuartos es 
consecuencia de la medida cautelar provisoria otorgada por la juez Emma Lidia de Nucci, del 
Juzgado Penal de Instrucci&#243;n II Nom, para asegurar los t&#237;tulos de dos familias que 
supuestamente cuentan con t&#237;tulos de dominio privado sobre las tierras ancestrales de la </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>Comunidad. El mismo d&#237;a, en una acci&#243;n supuestamente promovida por el Gobierno de la 
Provincia de Tucum&#225;n, la polic&#237;a Ecol&#243;gica de Montero, en coordinaci&#243;n con el Director de 
Flora y Fauna de dicho Gobierno, habr&#237;an allanado las viviendas de varias familias ind&#237;genas. En 
el curso de dicho allanamiento, supuestamente llevado a cabo sin orden judicial, los funcionarios 
policiales habr&#237;an roto las puertas de las viviendas allanadas, procediendo posteriormente a 
confiscar las artesan&#237;as de los comunitarios. Como consecuencia de dicha acci&#243;n, varios 
comuneros habr&#237;an resultado heridos de diversa consideraci&#243;n. Se informa que el &#225;rea objeto de 
los allanamientos forma parte de las tierras tradicionales del pueblo diaguita, aunque la 
comunidad carecer&#237;a de un t&#237;tulo formal reconociendo dicha propiedad. Se informa asimismo 
que esta &#225;rea es reivindicada por la Secretar&#237;a de Recursos Naturales para su propio uso. 
Adicionales procesos estar&#237;an en curso para desalojar a la familia Moya de la comunidad 
ind&#237;gena de Amaicha de Valle, a dos familias en la comunidad ind&#237;gena de Quilmas. En ambos 
casos, se alega que las parcelas pertenecen a las tierras tradicionales de la comunidad, ahora 
registradas a nombre de un terrateniente no ind&#237;gena, quien habr&#237;a procedido a la venta de 
parcelas a otro propietario privado. Una cuarta amenaza de desalojo se estar&#237;a llevando a cabo en 
contra de la familia Donato Nieva de la comunidad ind&#237;gena de Tolomb&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las 
informaciones recibidas, dicha familia se habr&#237;a visto forzada a suscribir un contrato de 
arrendamiento con los terratenientes que ostentan el t&#237;tulo privado sobre las tierras ancestrales de 
la comunidad. Una situaci&#243;n similar ha sido reportada en relaci&#243;n con aproximadamente otras 
20 familias de la vecina comunidad ind&#237;gena de Rodeo Grande. Al igual que en el caso de la 
comunidad de Tolomb&#243;n, las familias se habr&#237;an visto forzadas a suscribir convenios de 
arrendamiento con los detentadores de t&#237;tulos privados de propiedad sobre las tierras ancestrales 
ind&#237;genas, aprovech&#225;ndose del analfabetismo de las familias y de su ignorancia de las 
consecuencias derivadas de la suscripci&#243;n de dichos convenios. Seg&#250;n las informaciones, las 
familias diaguitas de la provincia de Tucum&#225;n carecen de t&#237;tulos de propiedad formal sobre sus 
tierras ancestrales, a pesar de sus numerosas denuncias y reclamos. 
</p>
<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>13. Por carta de fecha 4 de julio de 2007, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento urgente 
solicitado juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y el Relator 
Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los 
ind&#237;genas el 27 de marzo de 2007. El desalojo de las 22 familias de la Comunidad del Valle Taf&#237; 
ocurri&#243; el d&#237;a viernes 2 de marzo de 2007, en la localidad de Los Cuartos. La comunidad solicit&#243; 
la inscripci&#243;n de su personer&#237;a en el ano 2000 ante del Instituto Nacional Contra la Xenofobia, la 
Discriminaci&#243;n y el Racismo, obteniendo su registro reci&#233;n en el 2005. Es la segunda vez que se 
realiza un desalojo, ya hab&#237;a sucedido otro el 22 de Septiembre de 2006. Las tierras en las que 
habitaban las familias eran tierras de uso comunitario hasta hace unos anos. Con relaci&#243;n a las 
parcelas afectadas, de la documentaci&#243;n disponible de la comunidad surgir&#237;a que solo un sector 
seria materia de desalojo, por presunta propiedad de Ernesto Chenaut, el resto donde habitan 
17 familias seria espacio p&#250;blico. El juicio de desalojo se sustancia con el Juzgado Penal de 
Instrucci&#243;n N.&#176; 11 a cargo de la juez Emma Lidia de Nucci. Con relaci&#243;n a la comunidad y a los 
comuneros desalojados, se trata de gente oriunda del lugar en proceso de asumir su identidad 
ind&#237;gena. Con relaci&#243;n a las tierras, no se cuenta con documentaci&#243;n suficiente, pero de la 
existente surge que el juicio solo afectar&#237;a a cinco familias. Existe una inconsistencia entre la 
parcela por la cual se ordena el desalojo y la del desalojo efectuado, que es mayor, en principio. 
Los hechos ocurren cuando se encuentre vigente la ley N.&#176; 26610, que suspende los desalojos en 
las tierras que habitan las comunidades ind&#237;genas por el plazo de cuatro anos y ordena al </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>Instituto Nacional de Asuntos Ind&#237;genas (INAI) que en el t&#233;rmino de tres a&#241;os realice acciones 
necesarias a fin de relevar las tierras en las que habitan las comunidades ind&#237;genas, garantizando 
los derechos y la participaci&#243;n de las comunidades en el transcurso del programa de 
relevamiento territorial. El d&#237;a 12 de abril, Viviana Canet, de la Direcci&#243;n Nacional de Derechos 
Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales, Delf&#237;n Jer&#243;nimo, delegado del Pueblo Diaguita y 
representantes de la Comunidad del Valle Taf&#237; se reunieron. Los principales elementos que 
surgieron de la reuni&#243;n fueron: <i>a</i>) los comuneros son oriundos del valle y as&#237; vienen peleando el 
desalojo de las tierras en las que habitan desde el a&#241;o 2002; <i>b</i>) la comunidad se encuentra 
integrada por comunidades de base que van recuperando su vida comunitaria en el marco de un 
territorio que se ha convertido en el lugar de fin de semana de la burgues&#237;a tucumana y donde 
abundan nuevas y costosas edificaciones. Con relaci&#243;n a la ejecuci&#243;n del desalojo, la polic&#237;a 
desalojo la totalidad del predio, cuando se ordenaba una parcela. Adem&#225;s ha habido abuso de 
autoridad por las lesiones ocasionadas y la destrucci&#243;n de vivienda. La comunidad manifiesta 
que se quiso hacer la denuncia ante la polic&#237;a que se neg&#243; a recibirla. Finalmente, hubo un 
acuerdo entre el cacique de la comunidad y el Dr. Nievas con el Intendente del lugar, 
perteneciente a la l&#237;nea pol&#237;tica del vicegobernador de la provincia, con el objetivo de sancionar 
una ley de expropiaci&#243;n de la totalidad del predio. En base a este compromiso pol&#237;tico, el 
Dr. Nievas se entrevist&#243; con la juez, quien suspendi&#243; el desalojo (en octubre de 2006) para dar 
lugar a la ley. Dada la fecha de los hechos, y las circunstancias relacionadas a un conflicto 
pol&#237;tico entre el vicegobernador y el actual gobernador de la provincia de Tucum&#225;n, pareciera 
que esta situaci&#243;n tuvo incidencia directa sobre la decisi&#243;n del desalojo. En primer lugar, la 
Secretaria de los Derechos Humanos est&#225; solicitando informes a la jueza interviniente y 
notificando al Secretario de Derechos Humanos de la provincia de Tucum&#225;n para que brinde una 
soluci&#243;n conforme a derecho y respete los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas. En segundo lugar, 
se ha recibido denuncia de la Comunidad sobre el allanamiento de viviendas de varias familias 
ind&#237;genas que se dedican a la producci&#243;n y venta de artesan&#237;as en los Menhires del Valle de Taf&#237;, 
sin orden judicial y confiscaci&#243;n de mercader&#237;as, y se realizan en la actualidad las gestiones 
correspondientes para el encarecimiento de los hechos. En tercer lugar, respecto a los procesos 
de desalojo de las familias ind&#237;genas de sus tierras ancestrales que a continuaci&#243;n se detallan: 
familia Moya de Amaicha del valle; Rafael Marcos Gonz&#225;lez y Sra. De Caro de la comunidad 
ind&#237;gena de Quilmas: familia Donato Nieva de la comunidad ind&#237;gena Tolomb&#243;n y 20 familias 
de la comunidad ind&#237;gena rodeo Grande, la Direcci&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Econ&#243;micos, 
Sociales y Culturales no cuenta con denuncia alguna. Sin embargo, se ha solicitado informe a la 
comunidad de Quilmas, la que ha manifestado que si bien se han planteado estas situaciones, la 
comunidad ha intervenido para la restituci&#243;n de los predios a sus leg&#237;timos poseedores, y los 
comuneros se encontrar&#237;an actualmente en posesi&#243;n de los mismos. 
</p>
<p><b>Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>14. El Relator Especial le agradece al Gobierno por su detallada respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n 
conjunta de fecha 27 de marzo. El Relator Especial sigue monitoreando esta situaci&#243;n, en 
particular con lo que se refiere al resultado del proceso judicial relativo a la propiedad de las 
familias desalojadas de la comunidad de Los Cuartos, as&#237; como de los otros casos que fueron 
objeto de esta comunicaci&#243;n conjunta. En este sentido, los Relatores Especiales han envido una 
comunicaci&#243;n de seguimiento al Gobierno que ser&#225; incluida en el pr&#243;ximo informe sobre 
comunicaciones. </p>

<p>15. El Relator Especial lamenta que en el momento de realizarse este informe no haya recibido 
ninguna respuesta del Gobierno a sus comunicaciones de fecha 22 de marzo y 9 de febrero 
de 2007 y espera que se establezca un dialogo tambi&#233;n en relaci&#243;n con estos casos.

</b></p>
<p>16. On 1 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding forced evictions 
in Dhaka, as well as in other parts of the country that allegedly begun on 24 January 2007. 
According to information received, there were two types of ongoing evictions carried out in 
order to recover Government owned lands. The first concerned lands which had been taken up in 
the recent past by the political leaders of the past ruling Government, influential land grabbers 
and businessmen, and where they had illegally constructed various establishments, including 
offices of political parties, election camps, social clubs, shopping malls, factories, stone and 
brick crushing mills, etc. The second were part of measures for uprooting terrorism and restoring 
law and order, and reportedly concerned so far 24 slums in Dhaka and more than 40 slums in 
other divisional cities. Reports indicated that in Dhaka nearly 10,000 households have been 
evicted by Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) and Bangladesh Railway, while nearly 
3,000 households were evicted in other divisional cities. Reportedly, over 1,500 structures along 
railway tracks and in various other locations have been demolished including along the river 
banks of the Buriganga, Turag, Ichhamati, at Karwanbazar rail gate, Shyampur Kadamtala, 
Mirpur, Gendaria, Jurain and Shewrapara in Dhaka, Barolekha in Sylhet, Ashuganj in 
Brahmanbaria and Gafargaon in Mymensingh, and in Rajshahi. Allegedly, the evictees did not 
receive prior information, were not consulted and have not been provided with resettlement or 
rehabilitation. The communities affected are being evicted from Government lands where they 
have, in many cases, been living for more than 30 years. Clashes between evictees putting up 
resistance and police forces erupted in locations such as Chittagong resulting in various injuries. 
It is reported that these people now find themselves homeless, exposed to the heat during the 
day, and winter cold during nights, and suffering from hunger and disease, especially the 
children, women and elderly. In Dhaka, reportedly, the affected communities remain in the city 
in order to continue with their work and livelihood as far as possible, and therefore have either 
moved to open lands where available, in other slums, road sides, etc. The information received 
also relates to the eviction of street hawkers from various footpaths and roads at Gulistan, 
Phulbaria, Bangabandhu Avenue, Ramna Bhaban, Baitul Mukarram, Motijheel, Purana Paltan, 
Naya Paltan, Bijay Nagar, Kakrail, Malibagh, Moghbazar in Dhaka, among others. 
17. On 14 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the&#61472; Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression regarding Mr. Rabindra Ghosh, the President of the <i>Dhaka Chapter of the Human 
Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM),</i>a non-governmental organisation (NGO) 
dedicated to the promotion of human rights that has special consultative status with the 
United Nations. According to information received: On 7 August 2007, police officers came to 
the home of Mr. Ghosh in the Western Bazaar area of Moulovibazar town. They issued him with 
an arrest warrant, informing him that he had 24 hours to comply with the warrant and present 
himself at Bogra police station. The following day, Mr. Ghosh proceeded to the station, but was 
not arrested; he was instead threatened to be arrested should he continue his work. It is alleged </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>that the arrest warrant was ordered by Upazilla Nirbahi Officer, in reaction to Mr. Ghosh&#8217;s 
campaigning for the recovery of the historic Bhabani Temple at Bogora. The temple was 
reportedly destroyed by national armed forces on 13 February 2007, in violation of a High Court 
order to protect the building. The historic temple reportedly existed for hundred years and a 
minority community, including caretakers of the temple, lived in the premises for generations 
and were forcefully evicted when the building was demolished. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 11 January 2008, the Government replied to the above communication on the situation 
of Mr. Ghosh. The note verbal indicated that the allegations contained were groundless. 
According to the Government, Mr Rabindra Ghosh was not present at the Bhananipur Temple 
when the eviction was carried out by the Joint Forces in February 2007. Furthermore, the 
authorities report that a case was filed to the Court of the Assistant Judge concerning the 
evictions activities of the Joint Forces, which was rejected. No mention of torture was made in 
this case. The Government states that the arrest of Mr. Ghosh was connected to a complaint by 
the local Upazilla Nirbahi Officer over allegations that Mr. Ghosh had threatened him over a 
mobile phone. An investigation was carried out and upon completion, Non-FIR Prosecution 
No 31 dated 24 April 2007 as per Article 189 of the Penal Code was submitted to the Court. 
Mr. Ghosh appeared before the Court voluntarily and was then granted bail on appeal. The 
Government further asserts that the allegations concerning threats directed against Mr. Ghosh or 
his arrest by law-enforcement agencies is unfounded, as he has left Dhaka for California 
on 7 October 2007 and has not come back yet.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>19. On 7 March 2007, the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of the 
communication of 1 March 2007 and channelling it to the capital. However, the Special

<p>20. On 2 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning imminent 
forced evictions in central S&#227;o Paolo. According to information received, 468 families, 
representing 1,724 people including 315 children and 380 teenagers, who had been living in the 
derelict Prestes Maia building in central S&#227;o Paulo for over two years, were to be evicted before 
4 March 2007 by the municipal authorities, following the issue of a new order from a judge on 
the grounds that the building was not fit for human habitation in its present condition. 
Reportedly, the families had been scheduled for eviction on 15 April 2006, under a previous 
eviction order, but lawyers working for the Movimento Sem-Teto do Centro (MSTC), Homeless 
Movement of Central S&#227;o Paulo, lodged an appeal on the grounds that the families had been 
living in the building for over a year and therefore had rights as residents. The S&#227;o Paulo State 
Supreme Court had subsequently issued an order postponing the eviction indefinitely. Reports 
indicated that the evictions had been scheduled for 25 February 2007 and the affected families </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>were not going to be provided with secure tenure in adequate alternative accommodation, or 
compensation. Allegedly, the municipal government&#8217;s offer to the residents was to give them 
temporary accommodation in hostels, and provide some help transporting belongings there from 
Prestes Maia so as to clear the site for commercial development. Reportedly, the families 
complained that the authorities&#8217; offer fell far short of the undertaking given by the previous 
municipal government, which had agreed to re-house all the families in temporary 
accommodation while the Prestes Maia building was converted to flats for them to occupy. 
Furthermore, the authorities had allegedly rejected the lawyers&#8217; requests to include the families 
in recognized municipal or state programmes to provide financial support to homeless people. 
There was the concern that a lot of the families affected would have ended up living on the 
streets in central S&#227;o Paolo. Senior police officers reportedly met with the families and their 
representatives to discuss the conduct of the eviction, to ensure that none of the residents would 
be ill-treated. However, concerns were expressed regarding a possible confrontation with the 
military forces responsible for carrying out the evictions. 
</p>
<p>21. On 8 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people on the situation of Raposa Serra do Sol (RSS), in the 
state of Roraima, including the traditional lands of over 16,000 Ingariko, Macuxi, Patamona, 
Taurepang and Wapichana people. The situation in RSS was the subject of a joint 
communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing and by 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people on 18 March 2005, calling to address the demarcation of RSS as a matter of urgency. 
According to several reports received in recent years, the process of demarcation of Raposa Serra 
do Sol began formally in 1977, when the Funda&#231;&#227;o Nacional do &#205;ndio (FUNAI) began it first 
activities aiming at the identification of indigenous lands. The various delays in the process of 
demarcation and titling of RSS led to the filing of a petition before the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, which in March 2004 issued precautionary measures to protect 
rights of the indigenous communities of the area. Following the procedure established in 
Brazilian legislation, the demarcation of RSS was eventually ratified by Presidential Decree on 
15 April 2005. Inter alia, the Decree called for the removal of &#8220;non-indigenous occupants present 
in the area of Raposa Serra do Sol&#8221;, which should be carried out &#8220;within a reasonable 
timeframe,&#8221; and in any event, not over the deadline of a year after the approval of the 
Presidential Decree. It has been alleged that the measures taken to date by the Government have 
not led to the effective removal of powerful rice-growers, whose refusal to leave indigenous 
lands has increased the climate of tension in the area. The continued presence of rich 
rice-growers and producers in RSS with farms whose size ranges from 1,300 to nearly 
9,000 hectares, and the lack of effective measures to demarcate and title the indigenous territory 
have reportedly generated continued tension in the area as well as continuing deforestation and 
burning, soil erosion, water and soil contamination and illegal fishing which has affected 
communities&#8217; livelihoods and food security. It also appears that the rice-growers have built 
illegal dams and have carried out unsustainable agricultural practices. On 1 March 2007, the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights renewed the precautionary measures originally 
issued in December 2004, calling on Brazil to protect the indigenous communities of RSS. RSS 
was also the subject of a letter to Brazil dated 14 March 2007 from the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which expressed its concern with the situation. It is further 
reported that on 12 August 2005, a group of major rice-growers (Itikawa Industria e </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Comercio Ltda, Ivalcir Centenaro, Luiz Afonso Faccio, Paulo Cesar Justo Quartiero, and 
Nelson Massami Itikawa) filed an injunction at the Supreme Federal Court (STF), seeking the 
suspension of the Presidential Decree (MS. 25.483-1). This group has repeatedly opposed 
official notices and other administrative procedures of removal, and remain in the area to this 
day. In March 2007, FUNAI notified the remaining rice-growers personally that they would have 
to leave RSS by a new deadline of 30 April 2007. This decision was equally opposed by the 
same group of rice-growers, which filed a new injunction at the STF. On 3 May 2007, the STF 
issued a decision suspending the removal of the rice-growers and any land restitution to the 
indigenous communities, until a final decision is taken regarding the pending injunction of 
August 2005. Concern has been expressed that the recent Supreme Court decision will entail 
further delays in the process of demarcation and titling of RSS, and that the continuous presence 
of rice-growers in the area may lead to additional violations of the rights of the indigenous 
communities living in the area. Concern has also been expressed about the possibility that a 
forthcoming decision of the Supreme Court may invalidate the 2005 Presidential Decree, and 
thus the legal recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over their traditional lands in RSS, in 
favour of powerful economic groups with an interest in the area. 
</p>
<p>22. On 19 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders concerning the recent attack 
against members of indigenous communities of the Surum&#250; region, in Terra Ind&#237;gena Raposa 
Serra do Sol (RSS), in the state of Roraima. The case of RSS was the subject of a 
communication transmitted on 8 June 2007. At this regard the Special Rapporteur expresses his 
appreciation for the recent STF decision of 4 June 2007, overturning its earlier injunction and 
thus allowing the removal process to move forward. It has to be noted that the recent STF 
decision did not resolve all of the other pending legal challenges that are still before the Court in 
relation to the demarcation, titling, and removal process in RSS. Moreover, in spite of this 
favourable STF decision, the Government has not publicly announced a new expected date for 
the total removal of non-indigenous occupants pursuant to the Presidential Decree of 
15 April 2005. In addition, according to the information received there were new threats and 
attacks against members of the RSS indigenous communities reportedly perpetrated by 
non-indigenous occupants who are opposing the process of demarcation and titling of the 
indigenous land. It is reported that on 14 June 2007, seven members of the indigenous 
communities of the Surum&#250; region initiated an action of peaceful reoccupation of a traditional 
place known as Paruwani, part of the ancestral lands of the Makuxi indigenous people, located in 
the proximities of the rice farm &#8220;Dep&#243;sito e Canad&#225;.&#8221; As part of this action, they initiated the 
construction of housing structures in the area. Since the beginning of the reoccupation, they 
started to receive threats from agricultural workers from the neighbouring farm. On 
17 June 2007, at approximately 12.00, Mr. Anselmo Dion&#237;sio Filho, Tuxaua (traditional chief) 
from the Barro Community, was followed by a white car (L200) on the road accessing the 
Municipality of Uiramut&#227;. When he stopped at the road to the community, the white car also 
stopped, its passengers got out of the vehicle, and started filming. The passengers were identified 
as Mr. Paulo C&#233;sar Quarteiro (former prefect of the municipality of Paracaima), 
Mr. M&#225;rcio Junquiera (representative of the State of Roraima at the Federal Congress), and three 
other individuals. Tuxaua Anselmo asked these persons to leave the place and stop filming. After 
a tense discussion, they came back to their vehicle and moved to a distance of 50 m., where they </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>continued filming, and eventually left. On the same day, at approximately 2 p.m., two 
individuals, identified as Mr. Paulo C&#233;sar Quarteiro and Mr. An&#237;sio Pedrosa, driving the same 
white car, entered the indigenous communities&#8217; settlement into the Paruwani area, observed the 
situation, and left. A few minutes after, the white car, followed by a white 3/4 truck, carrying a 
group of men wearing balaclava helmets, and armed with guns, clubs, and knives broke into the 
settlement. They left the two vehicles and pointed their guns at them, shouting that, if they did 
not leave the area immediately, they would open fire; some of the gunmen fired their guns at the 
air. The members of the indigenous communities were forcibly taken into the truck, where they 
were made bow their heads and detained. While in detention, the gunmen reportedly turned 
around and burned the housing structures built by the indigenous communities in the location, 
along with their possessions. Subsequently, the gunmen drove the indigenous people to the 
proximities of the municipality of Uiramut&#227;, took them out of the truck and left. While on the 
road, they were pejoratively treated as &#8220;lazy&#8221; and &#8220;invaders,&#8221; and they were threatened that if 
they returned to the Paruwani area, they would &#8220;not be able to tell their story.&#8221; Concern has been 
expressed for the security of the members of RSS indigenous communities as a result of their 
peaceful defence of their traditional lands and their continuous calls for the demarcation and 
titling of their lands pursuant to the Presidential Decree of 15 April 2005, and that the continuous 
presence of rice-growers in the area may lead to additional violations of the rights of the 
communities living in the area. Particular concern is also expressed by the reported direct 
involvement of local and national authorities in the attack of 14 June 2007, which would support 
the powerful economic groups opposing the demarcation and titling of RSS lands. 
</p>
<p>23. On 9 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences,<b> </b>regarding the situation of the Guarani Kaiow&#225; 
community of Nhanderu Marangatu, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, including allegations 
regarding abuses perpetrated by private security guards contracted by local farmers. According 
to the information received, the Guarani Kaiow&#225; community of Nhanderu Maragantu, integrated 
by 500 members, have been gradually expelled from their traditional lands in Mato Grosso do 
Sul by the opening of large commercial farms. Since 1999, they lived in an area of 26 hectares 
on the margins of road MS 384, in tarpaulin shacks, in the access to the ranches Fronteira, 
Morreo Alto and Cedro. Since 2004, the Guarani Kaiow&#225; started to reoccupy their traditional 
lands then in hands of private owners, occupying an area of 400 hectares within the boundaries 
of several private farms. The Nhanderu Marangatu Indigenous Land was officially recognized by 
Presidential Decree of 28 March 2005, which ratified the demarcation previously undertaken by 
the National Indian Foundation (FUNIA) of the Guaran&#237; Kaiow&#225; traditional lands. The land 
demarcated included an area of 9,317 hectares within the municipality of Ant&#244;nio Jo&#227;o, in the 
State of Mato Grosso do Sul. The process of official recognition of the Nhanderu Marangatu 
indigenous land was however suspended by injunction of President of the Federal Supreme 
Court (STF) on July 2005, in response to an appeal filled by local farm owners, ordering the 
forceful eviction of the Guarani Kaiow&#225; settlement in the Fazenda. On 15 December 2005, the 
eviction took place with the support of more than 150 members of the armed forces, including 
Federal police and military police. During their eviction, several of their properties were reported 
to have been set on fire by private security guards contracted by local farmers. As a result of this 
eviction, the community was resettled in the earlier location of 26 hectares on the margins of the 
road MS 384, in precarious conditions. During their resettlement, they reportedly experienced </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>severe shortage of food and water, and unsanitary conditions, and numerous cases of 
malnutrition and maladies of the community&#8217;s children were reported. In August 2007, the 
Guarani Kaiow&#225; community, in the framework of an agreement between the authorities and the 
local ranchers, returned to occupy 100 hectares of theirs traditional lands within the area 
homologated by the Presidential Decree, in order to allow for the asphalting of road MS 384. In 
their current location, the community awaits the final decision of the courts in order to take 
possession of their traditional lands, as identified in the 2005 Presidential Decree. Following the 
information received, several human rights violations would have been perpetrated by private 
security guards employed by local farm owners against the members of the Guarani Kaiow&#225; 
community of Nhanderu Marangatu. It is alleged that these abuses have increased after the 
indigenous community was evicted from their traditional lands on 15 December 2005, and that 
are committed with the intention of intimidating community members against their attempts to 
recover their traditional lands. Reported abuses include the killing of Mr. Dorvalino Rocha, a 
45 years-old Guarani Kaiow&#225;, on 24 December 2005. Mr. Rocha was reportedly shot in cold 
blood by a security guard employed by the Fronteira farm. According to the information 
received, the reported abuses by security guards have increased since the community moved to 
their temporal resettlement within the private ranches of Nhanderu Marangatu, in August 2007. 
Since their resettlement, an approximate of 30 private security guards of the Gaspem company 
have been contracted by local landowners, have been deployed in the vicinities of the 
community&#8217;s encampment, leading to a situation of increased tension. Various episodes of 
sexual violence against Guarani Kaiow&#225; women by private security guards have been reported. 
On 12 October 2007, at approximately 10.00 am, a group of four security guards attacked 
Ms. Elisa Ramos and her husband, Mr. Ver&#237;ssimo Nunes, while they were searching for 
firewood. After the guards battered her husband, Ms. Ramos suffered an attempted rape. During 
the same day, at approximately 4.00 pm, a similar attack was suffered by Ms. Silvina Romero 
and her husband Mr. Armido Fernandes Vilhalva, in the company of their 9 years-old son. While 
Mr. Fernandes taken away and was severely beaten by the guards, Ms. Silvina Romero was hit 
with a rifle butt and thrown to the ground, were she received several blows and was subject to 
sexual violence, in front of her child. Reportedly, Ms. Romero eventually managed to escape, but 
she had to be hospitalized with strong pain on her chest. In addition, according to the allegations, 
private security guards have repeatedly harassed the indigenous community, including by firing 
shots in the air. In this connection, it is reported that, on 5 October 2007, security guards opened 
fire at a distance of 50 m from the community&#8217;s houses as a form of intimidation. On 
30 October 2007, security guards fired shots in the air near a group of children while they were 
playing. Moreover, it has been reported that the personnel of the neighbouring farms have 
continuously subjected the community to surveillance, taking films and pictures of community 
members in the distance. On 31 October, a police patrol reportedly irrupted during a ceremony 
being performed by the community in homage to the dead. The police&#8217;s operation was allegedly 
in response to denounces made by local ranchers, which claimed that the community was trying 
to invade ranch lands. 
</p>
<p>24. On 20 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning the situation of Ms. Elaine Guenze da Silva, acting State secretary of the National 
Union for Popular Housing, an organization defending the right to housing, overseeing the 
settling of families and monitoring public planning policy, government social programmes and 
the regulation of public finances. Following the information received, on 14 August 2007 at </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>approximately 8.30 am, armed members of the Municipal Guard of Curitiba forcibly evicted 
Ms. Elaine Guenze da Silva from the headquarters of the Force of a Greater Power Tenant&#8217;s 
Association in Villa Sambaqui and then demolished the building, without presenting any judicial 
order. It is alleged that the Municipal Guard were carrying out orders received from the Mayor of 
Curitiba, the President of the Foundation for Social Action (FAS) and the Municipal Secretary of 
Urban Planning. Construction materials and other items were also removed from the site. 
Following the information received, when Ms. Elaine Guenze da Silva protested, she was 
restrained by five Municipal Guards who proceeded to attack her with a club, handcuffing her 
and dragging her to a vehicle. Elaine Guenze da Silva was then detained and was later charged 
under Article 331 of the Brazilian Penal Code with &#8220;disrespecting authority&#8221;. Her hearing was 
scheduled for 22 November 2007.Concern is expressed that the forced eviction and detention of 
Ms Elaine Guenze da Silva, including the use of excessive force against her, may be related to 
her human rights activities, in particular her work to defend the right to housing in Brazil.

<p>26. On the 5 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food, regarding the received allegations that numerous cases 
of economic land concessions have encroached upon the rice fields and farm land of 
communities, depriving them of their source of livelihoods and leading to food shortages. For 
example, at a concession in Sre Ambel district, Koh Kong province (granted to two companies 
partly-owned by Senator Ly Yong Phat) the concession company has destroyed local villagers&#8217; 
rice fields and orchards to make way for a sugarcane plantation. Some villagers have lost all of 
their agricultural land: those whose rice fields were destroyed are currently surviving on rice 
from last year&#8217;s harvest, but do not know what they will do next year, when they have no rice 
remaining and no rice to harvest. Similarly, at the Global Agricultural Development and Asia 
World Agricultural Development concessions in Sambo district, Kratie province companies 
granted economic land concessions have destroyed villagers&#8217; agricultural land, which has 
affected their current and future livelihoods. These allegations claim that the activities of 
economic land concessions also restrict communities&#8217; access to forests, where they collect 
non-timber forest products to supplement their diet or to sell to earn a living. Without access to 
non-timber forest products, many communities will lose an important source of livelihoods. The 
Special Rapporteurs noted that cases of forced evictions in urban areas have negatively impacted 
on communities&#8217; livelihoods. In Phnom Penh, for example, the livelihoods of families have been 
compromised by their eviction from the Tonle Bassac area and relocation to sites far from the 
city. For example, in Andong, one of the relocation sites, it is reported that many families have </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>been deprived of their means of livelihoods due to the distance of the relocation site from Phnom 
Penh and the high cost of transport. Previously, they were reportedly able to sell food around 
central Phnom Penh. In addition, in Andong, water is not provided by the Government and 
people have to pay for it. 
</p>
<p>27. On 7 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on forced 
evictions and home demolitions in the coastal town of Sihanoukville that reportedly took place 
on 20 April 2007. According to this information, police forcibly evicted 117 families from the 
community of Mittapheap 4, in the coastal town of Sihanoukville, following a protracted land 
dispute started in 2006 when a complaint was filed with the Mittapheap 4 commune chief, 
claiming the villagers were &#8220;illegal squatters&#8221;. However it is alleged that no competent judicial 
authority has made a determination of the land ownership claim, as is required under the 
2001 Land Law of Cambodia, according to which, person(s) who have lived on a plot of land for 
more than five years without any land ownership-related disputes are entitled to ownership of the 
land. Allegedly, most of the affected villagers had been living on that land since 1985. Therefore, 
although the families concerned have fulfilled all the requirements relating to land ownership, 
they have never officially received the titles for the land from the government, despite their 
repeated requests. Reports also indicate that on the day of the eviction, the community was 
surrounded by armed security forces. Violent clashes between the police and members of the 
community followed with the police reportedly firing live ammunition in the air and into the 
ground, beating people with electric batons and dispersing them using water cannon, while some 
villagers defended themselves with machetes, bottles and barbed wire. This resulted in the injury 
of several people on both sides. The detainees have been charged under the UNTAC 
(United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) law, which is still in force, with &#8220;battery 
with injury&#8221; (article 41) and &#8220;wrongful damage to property&#8221; (article 52). On 2 May 2007, one of 
the detainees, a 16-year old fisherman, was released on bail, while the investigating judge turned 
down the defence lawyer&#8217;s request to release the other 12 detainees on bail as well. Reportedly, 
over 100 homes were destroyed during the evictions that took place on 20 April, leaving around 
200 to 300 villagers without shelter. Many of the forcibly evicted families are now living in 
destitution along the roadside of National Road 4 under tarpaulins provided by NGOs and have 
reportedly lost their meagre livelihoods, lack food and drinking water. According to the reports, 
local authorities began negotiations in 2006 with 17 of the families in an attempt to resettle them, 
but these families allegedly rejected an offer of US$500 per family or alternatively a plot of land 
in an area they perceived to be located too far from the sea for them to continue making a living 
from fishing. On 19 January 2007, over four months before the eviction, the Sihanoukville 
municipality reportedly issued an eviction order giving the villagers seven days&#8217; notice to clear 
the area. However, reports indicate that this eviction order was issued without any judicial 
oversight and was not preceded or followed by any consultation with most of the families 
concerned. The reports we received suggest that the forced evictions and house demolitions 
carried out were actions taken by the police and military police while executing a separate 
warrant issued by the Sihanoukville Municipal Court to search for illegal weapons. No such 
weapons were allegedly found. </p>

<p>28. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to any of his communications. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that forced evictions apparently continue to occur with regularity in 
Cambodia and that the recommendations contained in his mission report seem not to have been 
implemented.<b>5</b>

<p>29. Le 20 avril 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; un appel urgent au sujet d&#8217;expulsions 
forc&#233;es qui se d&#233;roulaient dans plusieurs r&#233;gions du Cameroun, incluant Yaound&#233; et Douala. 
D&#8217;apr&#232;s l&#8217;information re&#231;ue, le Conseil de la ville de Yaound&#233; a conduit des expulsions forc&#233;es 
depuis le mois de novembre 2006 dans les quartiers de Carri&#232;re, Mbankolo, Etetak, F&#233;b&#233; et 
Oyom-Abang. Selon l&#8217;information re&#231;ue, les hommes, femmes et enfants affect&#233;s se sont trouv&#233;s 
sans logement puisqu&#8217;aucune zone de relocation n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vue et qu&#8217;aucune compensation ne 
leur a &#233;t&#233; fournie. Des inqui&#233;tudes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant &#224; la sant&#233; de ces personnes, 
notamment &#224; l&#8217;approche de la saison des pluies. Tout en sachant que ces expulsions ont &#233;t&#233; 
dict&#233;es par le besoin d&#8217;adh&#233;rer aux r&#233;glementations urbaines et aux questions de s&#233;curit&#233;, 
l&#8217;information re&#231;ue indique que la mise en &#339;uvre de ces expulsions n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; conforme aux 
obligations internationales de l&#8217;&#201;tat. Selon d&#8217;autres informations re&#231;ues, des expulsions forc&#233;es 
ont &#233;galement lieu &#224; Douala, suite &#224; la d&#233;molition de certains immeubles. Suite &#224; la d&#233;cision du 
Conseil municipal d&#8217;&#233;largir certaines voies de passage, un certain nombre d&#8217;immeubles adjacents 
qui ne semblait pas d&#233;tenir de permis de construction ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;truits. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les rapports re&#231;us, 
il semblerait que cette politique viserait &#233;galement les banlieues de la ville. Il semblerait que le 
Gouvernement effectue ces d&#233;molitions de maisons et magasins, sans notification pr&#233;alable 
suffisant, n&#8217;attribuant aucune compensation et sans proposer d&#8217;alternative de relocalisation. 
Alors que certains r&#233;sidents auraient eu le temps de d&#233;monter leurs maisons de fa&#231;on &#224; 
sauvegarder des mat&#233;riaux et des affaires personnelles, d&#8217;autres n&#8217;auraient pas r&#233;ussi &#224; faire de 
m&#234;me. Par ailleurs, il semblerait que la population affect&#233;e payait fr&#233;quemment une taxe 
immobili&#232;re au Conseil municipal leur permettant d&#8217;utiliser les terrains occup&#233;s. D&#8217;apr&#232;s 
d&#8217;autres rapports re&#231;us, des r&#233;sidents de la province nord-ouest du Cameroun ont incendi&#233; 
300 maisons et ainsi forc&#233; des milliers de personnes &#224; fuir les villages de Bawock et 
Bali Nyongha en raison d&#8217;une dispute ancestrale au sujet des droits &#224; la terre pour pratiquer

<p>31. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders in relation to Mr. Liu Dehuo, 
Mr. Cui Yongfa, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, Mr. Chen Ningbiao, Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia 
and Mr. Guo Jianhua, human rights defenders working to protect their land from forced land 
annexation. On 10 April 2007, the District Court of Sanshan, in Nanhai County, Guangdong 
province sentenced to jail the above mentioned persons all charged with illegally obstructing an 
approved construction project in Sanshan District. Upon hearing the verdict all of the defendants 
announced that they would appeal the decision. According to reports, the seven defendants were 
detained by Nanhai police in June 2006 and have been in detention since then. They were 
charged with extortion and blackmailing the Yingshun Tank Farm, a gas and petrochemical 
company, which had reportedly taken over 1 hectare of land in Sanshan without official approval 
for use as a construction site. The company was reportedly requested to hand over 50,000-yuan 
to compensate villagers or the construction site plan would be exposed. However the company 
filed a complaint for blackmail against the defendants before making any payment. 
Mr. Liu Dehuo, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, Mr. Chen Ningbiao, Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia and 
Mr. Guo Jianhua were tried on 6 December 2006 without legal counsel. Mr. Yongfa&#8217;s wife acted 
as his legal representative. Concern is expressed that the aforementioned events form part of an 
ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in China. Concern is also expressed at reports 
that Mr. Liu Dehuo, Mr. Cui Yongfa, Ms. Shao Xiaobing, Mr. Chen Ningbiao, 
Mr. Chen Zhibiao, Mr. Shao Xixia and Mr. Guo Jianhua did not receive a fair trial.

<p><b>Response received

<p>32. By letter dated 31 July 2007, the Government replied to the above joint allegation letter 
The Government informed the case of extortion brought against Chen Ningbiao and other 
persons, numbering seven in all, was considered by the Nanhai district people&#8217;s court in Foshan 
city, Guangdong province, and on 10 April 2007, in accordance with the law, the court rendered 
its judgement in criminal case Nan Xing Chu Zi (Nanhai criminal court of first instance) 
No. 1913. The court found that the facts of the case were as follows: at about 6 a.m. on 
16 May 2006, Liang Mingji, a driver employed by Fanghua elementary school in the Liwan 
district of Guangzhou city, was driving the school bus (registration Guangdong A24695), 
transporting schoolchildren, when, at the Yidong Market intersection in the Sanshan area of 
Pingzhou, Guacheng neighbourhood, Nanhai district, he encountered Chen Ningbiao, sitting on 
his motorcycle, registration Y61470, and blocking the road. Liang sounded his horn and 
proceeded slowly forward, but Chen would not let him through, whereupon Liang brought his 
vehicle to a stop with a space of more than 10 centimetres between it and Chen&#8217;s motorcycle. 
Chen picked up a rock and used it to threaten Liang, preventing him from leaving, and, claiming 
that his motorcycle had been struck, demanded that Liang pay him 200 yuan compensation. 
When Liang refused to pay, Chen made telephone calls to Chen Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo and other 
residents of Sanshan village, totalling 10 in all, summoning them to his assistance. When 
Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo arrived at the scene, they saw that Chen Ningbiao&#8217;s motorcycle 
had sustained no damage, but the three men still gathered round the school bus and started 
making a commotion, pushing and shoving Liang Mingji and demanding that he pay the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>compensation, and also blocking the path of the traffic police who had come to investigate the 
incident. Following this, the owners of the bus, Zhao Jiandong and Zhao Jiannan, made their way 
to the scene, to find out what was going on. At this point, Chen Ningbiao let the air out of the 
bus&#8217;s tyres, to prevent it from proceeding into Sanshan, and threatened to smash it up, 
demanding 5,000 yuan in damages from the bus owners, while Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo 
noisily repeated his threats. Under duress, Zhao Jiandong and Zhao Jiannan agreed to pay 
3,500 yuan in compensation. On the suggestion of Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo, Chen Ningbiao 
used a false name, &#8220;Chen Yidong&#8221;, on the receipt slip. The plot of land situated in the area called 
&#8220;Meichong&#8221; in Pingzhounan village on Guacheng Street in the Nanhai district of Foshan city had 
been expropriated as State land on December 1997 by the Guangdong province cadastral office 
and was managed by the Nanhai district land resource centre. At a later date, because the land 
was not yet developed, it was allocated to the Nanhai farmer Li Bin for his use. In April 2006, 
Li Bin was granted permission to rent the piece of land to the Shunying fuel depot in Nanhai 
district. The general manager of the depot, Chen Zhujia, hired a digger to excavate a pond on the 
land for use as a fish farm. At about 9 a.m. on 20 May 2006, Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao, 
Cui Yongfa, Liu Dehuo, Guo Jianhua and other villagers from Sanshan, numbering more than 10 
in all, gathered at the fuel depot and started creating a disturbance, claiming that damage had 
been caused to the piece of land in &#8220;Meichong&#8221;, threatening to set fire to the digger and 
demanding compensation from the person who had rented it for the excavation of a fish-pond. 
The defendant Zhao Xiaobing then went up to a motor vehicle parked in front of the depot gates 
and threatened to let the air out of its tyres. Chen Zhujia was worried that the villagers might 
damage the fuel depot, so he pretended that the piece of land in question had been leased to 
someone else and undertook to go and call that person. All 10 and more of the defendants, 
Chen Ningbiao, Chen Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Guo Jianhua and the other villagers from Sanshan, 
forced their way on three separate occasions into the fuel depot and urged Chen Zhujia to go and 
fetch the person who had rented the land for use as a fish-farm. At about 3 p.m. that afternoon, 
Chen Zhujia realized that the safety of the fuel depot was under threat and was therefore 
constrained to try and find the depot&#8217;s legal adviser, Lin Jiaqing, and ask him to masquerade as 
the person who had rented the land for use as a fish farm and to enter into discussions with the 
villagers. Chen Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and other persons, claiming to be 
acting on behalf of the village, went up to Lin Jiaqing, standing on the embankment nearby, and 
demanded payment of damages. Basing the claim on the damage which Lin Jiaqing had 
allegedly caused to the plot of land, Liu Dehuo demanded that he pay 150,000 yuan in 
compensation. Chen Zhibiao and the other persons took up the same demands, but were met with 
refusal from Lin Jiaqing. Undeterred, Liu Duhuo, Cui Yongfa and the others, arguing that Lin 
had allegedly signed an &#8220;illegal agreement&#8221;, demanded that he pay them at least 75,000 yuan. In 
the meantime, Shao Xiaobing and a group of villagers dragged over some water pipes which 
they found lying around in the vicinity and used them to block the main gate into the fuel depot. 
They then continued creating a disturbance, shouting and threatening. Chen Ningbiao and 
Guo Jianhua then joined the other villagers on the embankment, demanding payment of 
damages. Chen Zhujia realized what consequences all this might have for the safety of the fuel 
depot and its operation and, under duress, suggested to Lin Jiaqing that he pay 50,000 yuan in 
compensation. After Chen Zhibiao and the other persons had received the payment of 
50,000 yuan, the villagers present at the scene were each paid out an amount of 200 yuan by 
Shao Xixia. It has been ascertained in addition that, before this piece of land in &#8220;Meichong&#8221; was 
expropriated, it had been the property of the Nanshan village collective and none of the seven 
defendants belong to that village collective. The Nanhai district people&#8217;s court in Foshan city, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>Guangzhou province, determined that Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo had engaged 
in two acts of extortion, to an amount of 53,500 yuan; that the defendants Cui Yongfa, 
Shao Xixia, Guo Jianhua and Shao Xiaobing had engaged in one act of extortion, to an amount 
of 50,000 yuan, and that the amounts obtained by extortion were substantial. In the course of 
jointly committing the offence of extorting money from the Shunying fuel depot, Chen Ningbiao, 
Chen Zhibiao, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and Shao Jianhua had played the main role 
and were therefore the primary culprits: they should be punished in a manner commensurate with 
the commission of the full offence; Shao Xiaobing had played a secondary role and was an 
accessory to the offence: in accordance with the law she should receive a lighter punishment. In 
accordance with the provisions of article 274, article 26, paragraphs 1, 3 and 4, and article 27 of 
the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, for the offence of extortion the defendants 
Chen Ningbiao, Chen Zhibiao and Liu Dehuo were sentenced to four years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment, the defendants Cui Yongfa, Shao Xixia and Shao Jianhua were sentenced to three 
years&#8217; and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment and the defendant Shao Xiaobing received a 
sentence of two years&#8217; and six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment. In the course of these 
proceedings, the court, acting in accordance with the law, informed the defendants of their right 
to receive the services of court-assigned defence lawyers or to appoint their own defence 
lawyers. Of the seven defendants in the case, Liu Dehuo, Cui Yongfa and Shao Xiaobing 
separately appointed defence lawyers (Cui Yongfa appointed two defence lawyers). After being 
notified by the court as required by law, Zhang Jiankang and Wang Quanzhang, the lawyers 
appointed by Liu Dehuo and Cui Yongfa, respectively, still failed to appear in court. 
Huang Liuxiao, the other lawyer appointed by Cui Yongfa, and Zhu Daohua, the lawyer 
appointed by Shao Xiaobing, did appear in court and participated in the proceedings. The other 
defendants did not appoint their own defence lawyers but, in court, in accordance with the law, 
all fully exercised their right to conduct their own defence. Article 34 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure of the People&#8217;s Republic of China stipulates as follows: &#8220;In the event that the 
defendant is blind, deaf or mute or is a minor, and has not appointed a defence lawyer&#8221; or &#8220;may 
incur the death penalty and has not appointed a defence lawyer, the people&#8217;s court shall 
designate a lawyer, who shall be duty-bound to provide legal assistance in that person&#8217;s 
defence&#8221;. The above-named defendants did not fall into the categories specified as necessitating 
the appointment or assignment by the court of defence lawyers. After the Nanhai district 
people&#8217;s court in Foshan city, Guangdong province, had passed sentence at first instance, the 
seven defendants lodged appeals within the time limit set by law. The case is currently being 
heard at second instance by Foshan city people&#8217;s intermediate court in Guangdong province.

<p>33. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing in 
relation to Ms.<b> </b>Mao Hengfeng, a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and 
forced evictions in Shanghai since 1989. According to information received: On 16 April 2007, 
Ms. Hengfeng was informed by the Municipal No.2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in Shanghai 
that her original sentence of two and half years was to be upheld. The court session lasted 
10 minutes during which time the judgment was read out. Neither Ms. Hengfeng nor her lawyer 
was authorized to present an argument in her defence and only family members were allowed to 
attend the hearing. On 12 January 2007, Ms. Hengfeng was sentenced to two and a half years in 
prison by Shanghai Yangpu District Court for allegedly damaging hotel property whilst in </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>detention by Shanghai&#8217;s Yangpu Public Security Bureau at a guest house in Beijing. It was 
alleged that Ms. Hengfeng had broken two table lamps in the guesthouse and she was 
subsequently arrested on 30 June 2006 on charges of &#8216;intentionally destroying property&#8217;. During 
the trial Ms. Hengfeng was prevented by prison guards, from verbally protesting against the 
mistreatment and abuse which she was subjected to whilst in detention. According to reports, 
prior to her trial on 16 April Ms. Hengfeng was detained in a small cell in which the floor was 
covered with excrement with the smell preventing her from sleeping. Reports also claim that 
prison guards had covered the only window in the cell. Ms. Hengfeng&#8217;s current conditions of 
detention are unknown.

<p>34. On 12 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Ms. Mao Hengfeng, a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and 
forced evictions in Shanghai since 1989. Ms. Mao Hengfeng was the subject of joint appeals sent 
on 10 May 2007, 1 February 2006 and on 5 January 2006. The Special Rapporteur notes 
Government responses received in this regard, including those dated 18 April and 14 June 2006. 
On 15 May 2007 at approximately 6 am, Ms. Mao Hengfeng was reportedly transferred from the 
police detention centre to prison, where she was left practically without clothing, beaten by 
police officers and placed in solitary confinement. Ms. Mao Hengfeng embarked upon a hunger 
strike to protest against her situation and reportedly she was subjected to forced-feeding on three 
occasions by prison guards who tied her hands and forced a tube down her throat. She was 
placed under constant surveillance by inmates that had been assigned the task by prison guards. 
These prisoners seem to have also been ordered to harass Ms. Mao Hengfeng and they proceeded 
to verbally abuse her. Ms. Mao Hengfeng is currently in poor health, suffering from high blood 
pressure and arthritis. These conditions are further aggravated by her inadequate living 
conditions since she has neither been provided with chairs, nor a bed and has to lie on the floor, 
often in cold and damp conditions. Ms. Mao Hengfeng was visited by her husband, on 
28 June 2007, who reported her ill-treatment and requested that the prison officials grant 
Ms. Mao Hengfeng&#8217;s lawyers access to prepare for her upcoming appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>35. By letter dated 15 August 2007, the Government sent a response to the above 
communication on Mao Hengfeng, female, born 1961, Shanghai city. The Government indicated 
that on 16 April 2007 she was sentenced by the Yangpu district people&#8217;s court to two years and 
six months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment for the offence of causing malicious damage to property, to 
run from 30 May 2006 to 29 November 2008. She is currently serving her sentence in the 
Shanghai women&#8217;s prison. Upon being admitted to prison, Mao underwent a physical 
examination which showed that, apart from an inclination to high blood pressure, all other 
indications were within the normal range. Mao is currently sharing a cell with two other women 
prisoners, she has not been sent to the punishment cells nor has she been placed in solitary 
confinement. Her eating and sleeping arrangements are normal. With regard to the issue of 
appeal, to date Mao has not submitted any written application, nor has she applied to see her 
lawyer, so there is no case here of the prison not allowing her to lodge an appeal. The prison </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>officers, acting in accordance with the law, treat the prisoners in a civilized manner. Mao enjoys 
her rights on the same footing as the other prisoners, including the right to health and the right to 
appeal. The allegation that Mao has been subjected to ill-treatment is not supported by the facts.

<p>36. On 27 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding Mr. Zheng Enchong and 
his wife Ms. Jiang Meili. Mr. Zheng Enchong is a human rights lawyer in Shanghai sentenced to 
three years&#8217; imprisonment on charges of &#8216;illegally providing State secrets overseas&#8217;. He was 
released on 5 June 2006 and has been under house arrest and subject to police surveillance ever 
since. On 5 July 2007, Mr. Enchong signed a petition, along with 100 other evicted 
house-owners from the neighbourhood of Dongbakuai and calling for a public trial of 
Mr. Zhou Zhengyi, the former president of Nongkai, a property development firm in Shanghai, 
who has been detained and faces charges of fraud and bribery. The petition also called for 
evictees to be allowed to attend the trial and testify as affected parties. According to information 
received: On 24 July 2007, Mr. Zheng Enchong went to the Shanghai Municipal Higher People&#8217;s 
Court with his wife, in order to register to attend the trial of Mr. Zhou Zhenghyi. On their arrival 
at the courthouse Mr. Zheng Enchong and Ms. Jiang Meili were reportedly surrounded by six 
police officers, namely Mr. Tang Wei, Mr. Wu Yanan, Mr. Qian Guoqiang, Mr. Wang Zhenlin, 
Mr. Li Wei and Mr. Feng Jianping. Mr. Tang Wei and Mr. Wu Yanan, with the help of the other 
officers, then proceeded to knock Mr. Enchong to the ground. They dragged Mr. Enchong along 
the ground for a distance of almost 200m while they subjected him to an assault which lasted for 
an hour. Mr. Enchong sustained injuries to his left hand in the assault which was observed by 
hundreds of residents in the vicinity. The police officers then allegedly forced 
Mr. Zheng Enchong and Ms. Jiang Meili into a taxi and went to the home of Ms. Jiang Zhongli, 
the sister of Ms. Jiang Meili, on the Baochang Road. Here they were met by five police vehicles 
and more than 30 police officers who prevented them from leaving. That same day, at 
approximately 9.00am, more than 50 displaced residents from the neighborhood of Dongbakuai 
presented themselves at the Shanghai Municipal Higher People&#8217;s Court in order to register to 
attend the trial of Mr. Zhou Zhenghyi. Security guards and police officers prevented them from 
entering the building. Concern is expressed that the aforementioned alleged harassment of 
Mr. Zheng Enchong may be as a result of his peaceful and legitimate human rights activities as a 
human rights lawyer in Shanghai. Further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Zheng Enchong and Ms. Jiang Meili. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>37. By letter dated 18 December 2007, the Government replied to the above communication. 
The Government informed that Zheng Enchong (male, born in September 1950, ethnic Han 
Chinese) was formerly a practising lawyer in Shanghai and that in March 2001, because he had 
conducted activities in breach of relevant provisions of the Lawyers&#8217; Act of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China, the Shanghai Judicial Bureau decided to revoke his licence. On 
28 October 2003, for the offence of unlawfully providing State secrets to bodies or persons 
outside the country, he was sentenced by the Shanghai intermediate people&#8217;s court No. 2 to three 
years&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment (to run from 6 June 2003 to 5 June 2006) and stripped of his 
political rights for one year. Zheng refused to accept the verdict and lodged an appeal. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>On 18 December 2003, after hearing the case at second instance, the Shanghai people&#8217;s high 
court dismissed the appeal and upheld the original verdict. On 5 June 2006, Zheng was released 
from custody on completion of his sentence (his sentence of one year&#8217;s deprivation of his 
political rights expired on 5 June 2007). The authorities underlined that following his release 
from custody, Zheng was not placed under house arrest. In relation with the trial of 
Mr. Zhou Zhengy the authorities specified that the second division of the Shanghai city people&#8217;s 
procurator&#8217;s office only filed charges against Zhou Zhengyi with the Shanghai people&#8217;s 
intermediate court on 17 August 2007 and that it was therefore not possible for anyone to have 
attended the trial at the Shanghai people&#8217;s high court on 24 July. The authorities also informed 
that the six persons named in the letter as being members of the police are not to be found among 
the judicial police of the Shanghai people&#8217;s high court. Finally, they indicated that at about 
9 a.m. on 24 July, dozens of people claiming to be forcibly relocated residents from 
&#8220;Dongbakuai&#8221; (&#8220;Lot East 8&#8221;) demanded to attend the trial of Zhou Zhengyi, but following a 
perusal of the schedule of court hearings, and confirmation and notification that the Shanghai 
people&#8217;s high court was not holding any hearings that day, the people that had gathered promptly 
withdrew, no one tried to gain entry to the court and the security guards and police did not need 
to take any preventive action.

<p>38. On 3 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples regarding the severe impact of resettlement 
programs and forced evictions implemented in Tibetan areas of the People&#8217;s Republic of China 
(PRC). According to the information received, tens of thousands of Tibetans are being negatively 
affected by nomad settlement and resettlement, land confiscation and fencing policies, which are 
mainly implemented in Golok (Guoluo) and Yushu districts of Qinghai province, but also in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other provinces that have large Tibetan populations, 
including Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan. Allegedly, these policies have had a very adverse impact 
on the traditional lifestyles in Tibetan areas, affecting directly the fabric of traditional Tibetan 
life and devastating the economy of these communities. The implementation of these policies 
contributes to the challenges that Tibetan cultural and religious identity face today. The reports 
received indicate that in many rural areas, inhabitants are evicted from their homes and forced to 
move into newly built, Chinese-style dwellings as a result of infrastructure projects, mining 
activities and hydropower projects. The government policies reportedly also include the forced 
resettlement of herders, who have been required to slaughter most of their livestock and move 
into newly built housing colonies or near towns, abandoning their traditional livelihoods and way 
of life. In addition, it is reported that both farmers and herders are told to take grassland and 
farmland in particular out of production in return for a guaranteed 10-year grain subsidy. The 
allegations received claim that displacement and forced resettlement resulted in hardship and 
lower standard of living for many herders and their families. According to these allegations, in 
certain areas with a usual holding of up to a hundred or more yaks, sheep and goats per 
household member, a limit of five livestock per household member has now been enforced and 
the exceeding stock has to be slaughtered or allowed to die. In addition, it is reported that for one 
yak over the limit allowed, herders have to pay a fine of about 1,000 yuan (USD 130). An 
estimated 2.25 million herders live with their herds in the Northern and Eastern regions of the 
Plateau. According to the information received, a number of public policies have affected 
herders&#8217; ability to maintain their livelihoods and usual access to food over the past 50 years and </p>

</p>
<p>particularly the Grassland Law adopted in 1985, the 1999 &#8220;convert farmland to forest&#8221; policy, 
the &#8220;revert pasture to grassland&#8221; and the &#8220;Do-it-Yourself Program&#8221;. This latter is implemented 
mainly in the TAR and allegedly it often forces the poorest to take on loans which they find 
difficult to repay, while the designs of the new housing do not allow Tibetans to continue to 
practice their traditional means to generate income. Reportedly, since the launch in 2003 of the 
&#8220;ecological migration policies,&#8221; the provincial government of Qinghai resettled 28,000 people 
and constructed 14 &#8220;migrant urban districts.&#8221; Moreover, in 2005, Du Ping, director of the 
Western Development Office under the State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet, stated that 
700,000 people in western China had been resettled since 2000 because it was &#8220;the most 
effective way to restore land to a healthy state.&#8221; The current government policies are apparently 
geared to introduce the affected populations into the urban economy for their benefit, but 
allegedly often result in greater impoverishment, dislocation and marginalization in the new 
communities. Housing opportunities and cash or food handouts are often offered in return for 
compliance with the policies, but allegedly the proposed compensations are not honoured in a 
timely way and may create dependency. Although in certain areas the environmental arguments 
for relocation may be compelling, authorities remain obligated to respect herders&#8217; right to an 
adequate standard of living, including adequate food, housing access to essential services and 
economic opportunities, as well as culturally adequate conditions in the new location. Although 
national legislation requires that those who are to be moved out from their land or to have their 
property confiscated must be consulted and eventually compensated for their losses and 
articles 41 and 111 of China&#8217;s Constitution guarantee the right to consultation as does the 
1989 Administrative Procedure Law, it is alleged that when relocation decisions are made, there 
is a lack of due process, including transparency, consultation in advance of planned relocations, 
and the right to challenge proposed relocations before an independent arbiter.

<p>40. On 9 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the Working 
Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression regarding the situation of Mr. Zheng Dajing, a petitioner and human rights defender. 
According to the information received: Mr. Zheng Dajing was arrested and detained on 
9 September 2007 by officials of the Public Security Bureau of Shiyan City, Yunxi County, 
Hubei Province, on criminal charges of &#8220;petitioning leading to disturbance of social order.&#8221; 
Mr. Zheng was believed to be held at the Yunxi Detention Centre, however, on 
18 September 2007 it appeared that Mr. Zheng is being detained at Yancao Station in Hongtai 
Yuansigou Village, where he has reportedly been beaten and subjected to other forms of 
ill-treatment. Yancao Station is reported to be an unofficial detention facility established by local 
authorities for the purpose of detaining petitioners. Before Mr. Zheng was arrested he had been 
forcibly returned from Beijing to his hometown on 7 September 2007 by unidentified officials 
believed to be from the Hubei Province. In Beijing he had met with other petitioners and </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>received information about the destruction of a village where other petitioners were living. Local 
Government officials in Beijing also attempted to forcibly return Mr. Zheng&#8217;s wife, 
Ms. Cao Xiangzhen, to the Hubei Province. Earlier, on 5 September 2007, Mr. Zheng published 
a letter addressing leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting on 8 and 
9 September 2007 about the human rights situation in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. His seven 
year old daughter and his wife were previously detained for 65 days in July 2006. Mr. Zheng has 
been petitioning for several years because his house was seized by the local Government. Since 
early 2007, Mr. Zheng has also actively helped hundreds of other petitioners and defended their 
rights. Concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zheng might solely be connected 
to his reportedly peaceful activities in defense of human rights. In view of his custody at a 
reportedly unofficial place of detention further concern is expressed as regards his physical and 
psychological integrity.

<p>42. On 5 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights defenders, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
regarding Ms. Mao Hengfeng, a well-known petitioner against family planning policies and 
forced evictions in Shanghai since 1989. According to information received, on 
13 September 2007, prison authorities reportedly ordered a fellow inmate to beat 
Ms. Mao Hengfeng in punishment for revealing that she had been held in solitary confinement 
for 70 days in July and August 2007. This was in violation of article 15 of the Chinese Prison 
Law which stipulates a maximum of 15 days for the solitary confinement of prisoners. 
Reportedly, Ms. Mao was badly bruised as a result of the beating. On 24 September 2007, prison 
authorities allegedly sent Ms. Mao to the Nanhui Prison Hospital. She had previously refused to 
undergo a medical examination for fear that she would be forcibly injected with drugs, as had 
happened when she was held in a psychiatric institution in the 1980s. At the Nanhui Prison 
Hospital Ms. Mao&#8217;s clothes were allegedly removed and she was tied to a bed and force-fed by 
other inmates. Ms. Mao&#8217;s husband, Mr. Wu Xuwei, was prevented from visiting<b> </b>her at the 
Shanghai Women&#8217;s Prison until 26 October 2007. During his supervised visit Ms. Mao was 
repeatedly silenced by prison guards when she attempted to inform him of having been force-fed. 
Concerns are expressed that the arrest, detention and aforementioned ill-treatment of 
Ms. Mao Hengfeng may be directly related to her peaceful work in defense of human rights in 
China. Further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Mao 
whilst she is in detention.

</b></p>
<p>45. On 1 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Independent Expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to education regarding living conditions in socially excluded localities in the 
Czech Republic, affecting mainly persons belonging to the Roma minority. According to 
information received: A recent study conducted for the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of 
the Czech Republic identified 310 socially excluded Roma localities in the country, 35 per cent 
of which have emerged in the last 10 years. Reportedly, these localities possess a considerably 
sub-standard quality of housing, which in turn affects negatively the quality of life and related 
human rights of these individuals, such as access to work, health care and education services. 
Furthermore, it is alleged that that Roma children do not receive the same standard of education 
as other pupils. According to the information received they have separated classes in regular 
schools, secondly they attend schools with a bad reputation regarding the education&#8217;s quality and 
finally more than a half of the population of Romani children attend schools for children with 
disabilities (zvl&#225;&#353;tn&#237; pomocn&#225; &#353;kola), now renamed as ordinary basic schools (z&#225;kladan&#237; &#353;kola). 
Moreover, it is reported that among the reasons why number of Romani children attend the 
special schools, there is that the diagnosis of mental capacity is carried out at an early stage 
(6 years old) and does not take into account children&#8217;s ethnic and social background and that 
schools prefer to label them as children with mental disabilities, in order to obtain extra financial 
resources. This is worsened by the fact that the new Education Act No. 561/2004 establishes that 
aliens are obliged to prove the lawfulness of their stay at the Czech Republic at the beginning 
school attendance at latest. In addition, Romani children are allegedly excluded from certain 
advantages allowed only to Czech and EU citizens, for example free educational services, such 
as counselling and accommodation facilities. Reportedly, 90 per cent of the municipalities where 
socially excluded communities are found do not have any concept or strategy of integration of 
Roma, while only 1 per cent has an explicit one. Furthermore, according to the information 
received, the system in place for providing public housing owned by municipalities is not 
transparent, and the criteria are often indirectly discriminatory, which may result in 
disadvantaged Roma communities being unable to obtain adequate housing. This situation is 
reportedly aggravated by the attitude of some regional representatives towards issues of social 
exclusion, which applied consciously or unconsciously, would lead to the perpetuation of 
existing problems of those Roma localities, thus reinforcing their social exclusion and even their 
segregation. As an illustration of this social exclusion, in the eastern town of Vset&#237;n, reportedly 
in an attempt to solve the problem of 42 (mostly Roma) families living in a big house in the 
centre of town which was in critical condition, the local government decided to demolish the 
house and resettle the inhabitants. It is alleged that most of the resettlements were carried out late 
at night, and without the families having prior knowledge of the housing conditions they were </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p>moving into. Some of the families were resettled in new flats on the outskirts of the town; 
however, these flats are allegedly situated next to the former waste dump in an area which is full 
of toxic substances and they are cut from the centre by an industrial zone. Furthermore, it is 
reported that the flats were built out of metal containers used for shipping, and shortly after the 
families moved in mould appeared inside given that the flats have inadequate air ventilation and 
are overpopulated. According to the information received, the rest of the families were moved 
some hundreds miles away into houses that have been described by experts and local public 
officials as uninhabitable, given that there is no potable water, roofs are full of holes, rafters are 
rotting, and the electricity distribution is unsuitable and even life-threatening.  
</p>
<p>46. On 21 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a second joint allegation letter with the 
Independent Expert on minority issues regarding housing conditions and evictions of Roma 
minority communities. According to information received, Roma communities in the Czech 
Republic face discrimination and various other violations of their right to adequate housing, 
including living in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions, being subjected to forced 
evictions and the alleged family disruption and institutionalization of Roma children as a result 
of these evictions, homelessness, and discrimination in the allocation of state or 
municipally-owned housing. It is reported that an amendment to the Civil Code (Law 
No. 107/2006 Coll, approved on 31 March 2006), has changed the rental housing regimes 
permitting unilateral increase of rent on flats. This law authorizes landlords to evict tenants 
without court approval under certain circumstances, and uses expressions that are not legally 
defined, such as &#8220;good behaviour&#8221;. Reportedly, little public discussion took place on the passage 
of Law 107/2006 and those at risk of being consequently evicted were not consulted and had 
little or no opportunity to prepare for these changes in their tenancy rights. Reports also indicates 
that prior to the enactment of these laws, in case of evictions of families with minor children, the 
courts could order that the landlord provide the evicted family with alternate accommodation (in 
some cases even permanent accommodation). Under the new law 107/2006, a court can only 
reach such a verdict if the tenant files a legal action to have the eviction reversed within 60 days 
of the eviction notice. Even though written eviction notices must instruct tenants of the option to 
file such a motion, socially disadvantaged tenants may not be able to use such an option without 
legal aid that is, in most cases, unavailable to them. Because of their economic situation, persons 
faced with eviction orders cannot in most cases afford legal counsel and must apply to the Czech 
Bar Association or an NGO for pro bono assistance which is scarce and underdeveloped. It is 
further reported that municipal and private landlords take advantage of Roma tenants&#8217; limited 
legal awareness. Reportedly, according to Czech law, once municipal property is transferred to a 
private owner, the terms of any existing leases remain in effect. However, it is alleged that in 
practice new private owners present new leases to the tenants, raise rents, and evict tenants 
unable to pay. New private landlords usually demand the new leases be signed without allowing 
the tenants to consult lawyers, and municipalities do not instruct the tenants about their right not 
to sign the new lease changing their rental conditions. Open-ended leases are also frequently 
changed to fixed-term leases without the tenants&#180; clear knowledge or agreement. In this context, 
the Czech Justice Ministry reportedly announced on 22 June 2007 that it will be proposing 
amendments to the Civil Code which would make it possible for landlords to evict tenants at will 
after a two-year notice. The bill would take effect after 2011, when rents are expected to be 
completely deregulated. Because of the discrimination and the vulnerable situation they face, 
Roma communities would very likely be one of the groups that will be particularly affected by 
these further changes in the Czech Republic legislation. Reports indicate that Roma communities </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>affected by evictions are sent to the outskirts or out of their town in large groups and often 
allocated housing in isolated areas. The information received reports cases of evictions with 
public expressions of racism and intentional discrimination by public officials in connection with 
the resettlement of Romani residents of city-owned property as part of the election campaigns of 
the politicians. For instance, it is reported that in the northern Moravian town of Bohumin, 
Mayor Petr Vicha announced in February 2005 that the city would purchase a hostel with 
250 inhabitants, mainly Roma tenants, with the intention of evicting them and renovating the 
property. Under pressure and harassment by officials, most residents left the building, but four 
families, who had always paid their rent and utilities bills, filed lawsuits against the eviction and 
obtained a preliminary injunction against it. The injunction specified that the landlord, the city of 
Bohumin, was obliged to maintain a number of services in function in the building for the 
duration of the injunction. In July 2005, the city countered the suit; the eviction was granted and 
the tenants then appealed. The preliminary injunction reportedly remained in effect pending the 
outcome of the appeals. During the course of these lawsuits, the city allegedly cut off the water 
and heat of the building. Even when exterior temperatures reached as low as minus 26 degrees 
Celsius, the heating was reportedly not resumed. The mail was also reportedly not properly 
delivered to these tenants. The families filed two complaints to have the original preliminary 
injunction enforced while waiting for their appeal to be heard. It is alleged that alternate 
accommodation was offered to families with children under the condition of separating children 
from their parents and institutionalisation of Roma children. The city also allegedly hired a 
private security company to prevent visits to the tenants, including their family members. On 
5 October 2005, several representatives of non-governmental organizations, as well as Deputy 
Public Defender of Rights and Czech Government Human Rights Commissioner Svatopluk 
Karasek were refused entry to the hostel for more than five hours, despite having being invited 
onto the premises by residents. Despite the fact that a court injunction permitted normal use of 
the facility by the residents, including the right to receive visitors, the Czech Police officers 
summoned to the scene declined to intervene on behalf of the residents and their visitors. The 
tenants were reportedly billed by the City for the security company&#8217;s services. In July 2005, the 
bill amounted to 76 549 Czech Koruna (approximately 2 580 euros) to be divided among the 
four families. It was also reported that the monthly rent previously charged per flat was changed 
to a per resident charge, i.e., if a six-member family lived in one flat, their rent increased 
six-fold. This situation forced families into debt and made them ineligible for social housing 
until the debt is paid. For the concerned families, the debt per tenant is the equivalent of 
thousands of Euro, and the court issued payment orders for the amounts within four days of the 
city filing suit in 2006. Objections were filed against the orders to pay, but almost a year later, 
hearings on those objections had reportedly yet to be scheduled. In this context, the four families 
gradually left the property without any alternative housing solution proposed by the city. As of 
June 2007, one family had moved in with relatives in Bohumin who have no electricity; one 
family was living in a single room in another hostel; one family was living in a hostel in Prague; 
and one family was in rental accommodation in the town of Ostrava. On 10 May 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter about the situation of the Roma in the Moravian 
town of Vsetin. Further information was received subsequent to this communication concerning 
eviction of Roma families in the Poschla neighbourhood on the edge of town, creating a racially 
segregated housing estate. Reports indicate that in October 2006, the town of Vsetin completed 
construction of housing comprised of metal containers in the Poschla neighbourhood on the 
outskirts of town, into which officials intended to move some of the 42 Romani families residing 
in a building slated for demolition in the centre. Reportedly, on 5 October 2006, the town of </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>Vsetin held an official opening of the Roma&#8217;s new housing area, which was attended 
by 40 municipal representatives from different towns of the Czech Republic, and presented to the 
press as a model project. Funding for the container housing had reportedly been provided in part 
by the State Fund for Construction. The container tenants received month-to-month contracts and 
Vsetin Mayor Jir&#237; Cunek has reportedly stated that anyone with whom the contract had to be 
terminated would be immediately &#8220;put out on the street.&#8221; It is further alleged that fees for 
electricity used for the heating in the buildings were charged at a very high rate. The information 
received also indicates that three of the relocated Roma families wrote letters to the Ombudsman, 
the President and a political party to draw attention to the policy of the Vsetin town towards the 
Roma community. On 13 October 2006, Mayor Cunek stated that Roma families, including these 
three &#8220;problematic&#8221; families, would be transported not just out Vsetin, but as far as 
230 kilometres. The Mayor stated that he has reached an agreement with the families by 
purchasing properties in isolated areas throughout the neighbouring Olomouc region and was 
providing them with loans to buy these houses. It has been alleged that some social workers 
employed by the city of Vsetin (with Council funding) have been telling the families that, should 
the parents refuse to sign the purchase agreements, they might end up in inadequate housing 
conditions, which may lead to the institutionalization of their children. Reportedly, these Roma 
families were forcibly transferred to villages throughout the Jesen&#237;k district. Children, 
accompanied by their fathers, were separated from their mothers during the travel. They report 
being left hungry after buses dropped them off in the middle of the night in front of their new 
&#8220;homes&#8221;, which are derelict farms. Olomouc regional officials were never notified that these 
families would be placed in these isolated premises. In addition, these areas have reportedly a 
very high rate of unemployment which may result in depriving the Roma families of a 
livelihood.

<p>48. On 21 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter on forced evictions in 
Qal&#8217;at Al-Kabsh, on informal housing settlement in the Cairo district of Zainhum. According to 
information received, a fire broke out in Qal&#8217;at Al-Kabsh on 20 March 2007, destroying more 
than 300 wooden shacks, leaving an estimated 1000 people (about 350 families) homeless. Not 
having been provided with alternative shelter or compensation, the victims demonstrated in front 
of Parliament on 21 March 2007. Reportedly, on the morning of 22 March 2007, the Egyptian 
security forces asked the residents to leave the remnants of their homes and to leave the area 
without prior notice, including the residents who were not directly affected by the fire. In 
reaction to protests by the resident&#8217;s opposition to this injunction, the security forces allegedly 
attacked the residents with teargas bombs, injuring a large number of people including children 
and elderly people. Although national authorities had promised alternative housing and 
emergency aid to the victims, out of 350 families whose homes were destroyed by the fire, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>only 200 families have been reportedly relocated to housing units in Al-Nahda and Al-Salam 
cities. The other 150 families remain without shelter and sleeping on the ruins of their shacks 
because of various problems related to the allocation of new houses, including corruption and the 
obligation for the families to show the housing contracts that were lost in the fire. Reports 
indicate a lack of consultation with the relocated families concerning the relocation sites. It has 
been reported that the cities of Al-Nahda and Al-Salam do not possess adequate public services 
such as sufficient transportation and that relocated people are far from their work places and 
sources of livelihood. Furthermore, on 29 May 2007, security soldiers, bulldozers and cleaning 
workers reportedly arrived to demolish the remaining houses. The information received indicates 
a lack of consultation with the affected residents and insufficient prior notice. For instance, in 
some cases families were reportedly informed that their houses were to be demolished just 
minutes before the bulldozers moved in. The detention of several residents who protested against 
demolitions has also been reported. It is alleged that the evictions are linked to a plan approved 
in 2001 to upgrade the area of Qal&#8217;at Al-Kabsh. Reports indicate that complaints were 
subsequently filed with the Attorney-General by more than a hundred residents of 
Qal&#8217;at Al-Kabsh.

<p>50. On 20 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Independent 
Expert on minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance regarding forced evictions of Roma 
communities in various locations around the country, including the city of Patras. According to 
reports received, since late July 2006, about 60 families, representing more than 400 persons, of 
the Riganokampos and Makrigianni Roma communities have been evicted in Patras without 
being given prior notice, offered alternative housing or adequate compensation. Reportedly, the 
Roma in Makrigianni settled there in 1996, while the Roma in Riganokampos have been living 
in that area for several decades going back to at least 1977. The order for these recent evictions 
was given by the deputy mayor of Patras and head of municipal social services unit. As a result, 
several Roma families allegedly have had no other option than to sleep and to live precariously 
in their cars, and in inadequate health and sanitation conditions, particularly for women and 
children. It has been reported that between 27 July and 25 August 2006, the Municipality of 
Patras reportedly demolished the homes of Roma families in the Makrigianni district who were 
absent for seasonal work, served the remaining families with notices of emergency police 
measures of eviction, and without waiting for their confirmation by a prosecutor proceeded to 
forced evictions. It is further reported that in June 2006, all Roma families of the Riganokampos 
district were referred to a criminal trial for illegal squatting on state land, and they were told to 
leave in August 2006 by a court order. These Roma families have reportedly never been 
provided with official documents attesting the legitimacy of their residences, and these evictions 
have been described by the authorities as &#8220;administrative acts of evacuation and expulsion in </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p>response to the unlawful occupancy of land and to arbitrary and illegal settlement of tracts of 
public land.&#8221; However, these actions were reportedly taken without proper administrative or 
legal procedure in the first case and despite the fact that in October 2005 magistrates had 
reportedly annulled as abusive such administrative protocols of eviction which were being 
requested at the time and the related criminal charges were dropped. Furthermore it has been 
reported that following his visit to the eviction sites in Patras in September 2006, the Council of 
Europe Commissioner for Human Rights stated that in his view the &#8220;procedures&#8221; for eviction 
were in total contradiction to human rights standards. Information received states that the 
Ministry of the Interior has secured a credit line of 320,000 euros to be used for the purchase of 
adequate land and settlement of the Roma families of these two communities, and that in the 
context of the Integrated Action Plan for the social inclusion of Greek Roma (IAP), 47 housing 
loans have been allocated until now to Greek Roma registered in the municipality of Patras, 
under favourable terms and under the guarantee of the Greek state. Additionally, a Special 
Committee has reportedly been set up within the administration of Western Greece with the task 
of identifying a suitable site to set up a permanent settlement for the Roma families. However, 
this body has not come up with any concrete solution for the permanent settlement of these 
families yet. While it has been reported that the municipality is renting apartments for 18 to 22 of 
the evicted families until the Government approves loan applications for them to buy their own 
homes, concerns have been expressed on the part of these families as to what will happen once 
the initial, financially subsidized period of rent is over, as they have no money to pay for the rent 
on their own. In addition, further reports indicate that most local Roma from these communities 
are sleeping rough, have left Patras or are looking for a home. Reportedly, these evicted families 
also face problems of discrimination to access adequate housing, that landlords are reluctant to 
rent them houses, thus forcing them to constantly change their place of residence. Allegedly, the 
relocation plans foreseen for the Patras Roma communities has failed because of strong local 
community reactions against the settlement of Roma families in their neighbourhoods. Concerns 
have been expressed that the situation is not being dealt with adequately and in a sustainable 
manner by the authorities for political and electoral reasons. In this context, it is reported that in 
an interview in a weekly newspaper published on 2 February 2007, the then Chief Appeals 
Prosecutor of Patras and now Deputy Supreme Court Prosecutor reportedly made discriminatory 
statements against Roma in connection with last year&#8217;s evictions and recommended similar 
eviction of immigrants who live in similar wretched settlements in that city. Reportedly, the 
evictions mentioned above seem to follow a pattern of forced evictions of Roma in Greece. In 
1997, about 2,000 Roma were allegedly expelled from a rundown district of Thessaloniki. 
Reportedly, they camped on the banks of the Gallikos River for three years before being 
relocated to a former military barracks. Furthermore, in 2003, about 200 Roma were removed 
from the affluent Athens suburb of Maroussi to make way for the Olympic complex before the 
2004 Games. Currently, about 200 Roma allegedly face eviction from a large site in Votanikos, 
central Athens, which is earmarked for the construction of a soccer stadium and the capital&#8217;s first 
mosque by 2009. While there are no official statistics available, it is estimated that there are 
200,000 to 300,000 Roma in hundreds of settlements across the country, at least half of them 
living in extreme poverty and inadequate housing conditions.

Relator Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas de desalojo 
forzoso con las que 74 familias campesinas del movimiento Tierra Nuestra MOCATIN situadas

esta informaci&#243;n, la comunidad de Los Limones habita desde el a&#241;o 1951 en un terreno ubicado 
dentro de las fincas bananeras de La Tela Railroad Company. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida los 
miembros de la comunidad han vivido all&#237; durante toda su vida, puesto que fueron trabajadores 
de la compa&#241;&#237;a o son descendientes de personas contratadas por la empresa. Se informa de que el 
grupo afectado esta constituido por 74 familias, con un total de 178 personas, entre ellos 
45 ni&#241;os y ni&#241;as. Los informes recibidos indican que en el a&#241;o 2005 la empresa quer&#237;a trasladar

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>54. On 23 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food on the threat of imminent forced evictions in the Nandigram rural 
area of East Midnapur district, West Bengal, where violent clashes between government security 
forces and villagers protesting against these evictions occurred in January and March 2007, that 
have resulted in numerous injuries and deaths. According to these allegations, on 31 July 2006, 
the State Government of West Bengal signed an agreement with an Indonesian corporation part </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>of the Salim Group to implement various developmental projects. It is alleged that the 
implementation of such plan will lead to the eviction of around 40,000 to 100,000 villagers who 
live in this area, mainly small and marginal farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural labourers, 
and that no compensation or rehabilitation package has been proposed to them so far. Allegedly, 
without access to these lands, their subsistence and livelihoods would be put in danger and the 
realisation of their right to food jeopardized, given that they would be unable to find alternative 
livelihood opportunities. In addition it is reported that approximately 80% of the population of 
Nandigram belongs to scheduled caste and minority communities, who lack access to adequate 
productive resources, education, health and other social facilities. It is reported that, following a 
notification issued by authorities at the neighbouring Haldia port identifying sites to be acquired 
for the SEZ in Nandigram, protests against the land acquisition process began on 3 January 2007 
and have intensified since then. Reportedly, on 3 January the police attacked a peaceful 
demonstration and on the night of 6 January, two villages (Sonachura and Tekhali) were attacked 
by an unidentified group, allegedly in connection to the ruling party in West Bengal, with bombs 
and guns, while allegedly the police refused to intervene even though they were informed at the 
time by local villagers. Reportedly at least 8 people died in January, including children, and at 
least 20 others have been injured. Petitions were introduced by the aggrieved peasants into the 
High Court and Apex Court, yet so far the state government has failed to arrest the culprits. 
Reports indicate that farmers have carried out attacks on local government offices in the area 
forcing them flee elsewhere. According to information received, on 13 March 2007, local 
villagers demonstrated in front of Nandigram Police Station and protesting the announced entry 
of the police in Nandigram, while engaging in religious rituals (conducting Puja or reading 
Quran), and warned against application of any force by the police. It is alleged that on 
14 March 2007, shortly after midnight, security forces consisting of state police, Rapid Action 
Force, Eastern Rifles and other West Bengal state security forces, about 5,000 men strong, 
entered the Nandigram area to restore the severed communication links with the region, which 
had been cut off by protesters who reportedly had set up road blocks on all access roads to it and 
had driven out all cadres of the governing state party transforming it into a &#8216;no-entry&#8217; zone for 
the state administration. It is further alleged that in the villages of Sonachura and Gokulnagar, 
these men fired tear gas, rubber bullets and finally live ammunition against the group of 
protesters, mainly women, trying to prevent their entry by forming a human shield. As a result, it 
has been reported that at least 14 villagers were killed and over 100 seriously injured were 
admitted to Nandigram Block Primary Health Centre and Tamluk Sub-Divisional Hospital. At 
the time of writing this communication there wasn&#8217;t a clear picture on the actual number of 
casualties which could range above 50 and allegedly injured and dead persons were carried to 
different locations in an attempt to cover up the actual number of casualties, some dead bodies 
having been thrown into the Haldi River. One report indicates that 27 bodies have been found on 
the banks of the river Haldi, and at least 19 persons are reported missing. Further reports indicate 
that many women in the villages were raped and that huts were demolished and burned down, by 
police forces and state government activists. In relation to these incidents, we would also like to 
make reference to the recent communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston, which provides further details on the alleged 
massacre of 14 March 2007 in Nandigram (UA G/SO 214 (33-24) IND 8/2007). The information 
received claims that the Calcutta High Court has ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation 
(CBI) to carry out an investigation into the events and a CBI team is reported to be at work in 
Nandigram, interviewing witnesses and collecting physical evidence. Reportedly, 10 people have 
been arrested so far with regard to the incident. It has also been reported that the state </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>government has ordered an executive inquiry by Burdwan Range Commissioner Balbir Ram into 
the incident, whose report will be submitted within 45 days. In a broader context, it appears that 
in a bid to boost national economic growth, the Central Government has been promoting SEZs 
across the country. In this regard, the reports received indicate that the West Bengal State 
Government plans to set up at least six other major industrial projects in the state, including 
SEZs, necessitating the acquisition of at least 10,000 hectares of land. Whilst noting that for the 
time being, the State Government has publicly expressed that no land will be acquired for 
industrialisation in Nandigram, interest is expressed in following the developments concerning 
these plans particularly as they relate to relocation and resettlement of small farmers and 
villagers. Concerns are also expressed that the alleged situation in Nandigram, as well as a 
similar situation occurring in Singur, Hooghly district, also in West Bengal, is symptomatic of a 
broader problem affecting not only the State of West Bengal but the rest of the country as well, 
and which would require changes at the federal policy level, in order for these problems not to 
re-emerge. With regard to the Singur case, which has already been the subject of a previous 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, on 22 August 2006 (AL 
Food (2000-6) IND 24/2006) it has been reported that in order to acquire land from the peasants 
in the area to be handed to a car manufacturing plant owned by Tata Motors, the government 
ordered the peasants to stop sowing paddy on their land and accept their decision to acquire the 
land and evict them, allegedly offering only a one-time monetary compensation not considered 
adequate. The situation there has also deteriorated over the past months, with reports stating that 
fences have already been erected around 997 acres of land with the use of police forces. 
Allegedly, following a period of increased violence, on 2 December 2006 the police beat up 
several villagers, set their homes on fire and arrested several people, and on 8 December 2006, 
they indiscriminately attacked protesters at a peaceful rally, injuring several protesters and media 
personnel. It is further reported that on 18 December 2006, a teenager activist was raped and 
murdered inside the fenced area. Information received states that the Supreme Court will review 
the land acquisition process since it is alleged that the state has not followed the proper 
procedures to acquire land to be given to the private company. However, 15,000 villagers remain 
under the threat of loosing their livelihood resources due to eviction from their lands. 
</p>
<p>55. On 7 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food on the farmers in Jagatsinghpur in the eastern state of Orissa, 
who protested against their proposed displacement for a new industrial project and have feared 
forced evictions at the hands of the police. According to these allegations, tensions have raised 
after approximately 1,000 police officers encircled Dhinkia, Nuagaon and Gadakujang 
panchayats in April 2007 apparently preparing to enter the area which has seen protests by 
farmers for the last 14 months. The farmers have reportedly protested against their displacement 
due to an integrated steel plant by the South Korean firm, POSCO, which could affect their 
access to adequate and sufficient food. It is reported also that the adivasis indigenous 
communities in Ghateha village, Rewa district, Madhya Pradesh, are at continuous risk of forced 
evictions involving use of violent methods over land disputes. According to these allegations, on 
19 April 2007 approximately 50 police vehicles and bulldozers under the direction of the police 
and Forest Department officials arrived at the village to evict villagers without a court order. 
Villagers resisted and during the confrontation it is alleged that police fired teargas shells and 
live bullets injuring six people. It is also alleged that villagers&#8217; thatched huts and other structures 
were destroyed with bulldozers or burnt down and property was looted. It is reported that these 
adivasis communities have been cultivating for at least four years the land in question which </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 35 
 
</p>
<p>amount to 375 hectares and upon which their livelihoods and access to sufficient and adequate 
food depend. In December 2006 the Parliament passed legislation recognizing the land rights of 
adivasis communities across the country. As a result in March 2007 the adivasis communities in 
Ghateha laid claims to this land by erecting thatched huts. While these communities claim that 
since 1974 the land has been categorized as non-forest land and they can therefore legally 
cultivate it, the State Forest Department contends that their action amount to encroachment on 
forest land. On 5 April 2007, the department framed charges of encroaching on forest land 
against 17 adivasis activists, nine of whom were subsequently arrested and detained in Rewa jail.  
</p><p>56. On 19 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples on 
the alleged threat of eviction of Adivasi families in the state of Chhattisgarh. According to the 
information received: Numerous Adivasi families face eviction from their traditional land due to 
the plan to construct a TATA steel plant in the Lohadiguda Block, Bastar District, Chhattisgarh. 
The Bastar District is home of the Gonds, Abhuj Maria, Darda Maria, Bison Horn Maria, 
Munia Doria, Dhruva, Bhatra, Halba and other Adivasi peoples, constituting 70 per cent of the 
population. These groups are protected by special legal safeguards following the declaration of 
the Bastar district as a Schedule Area (V) under the Indian Constitution. The construction of the 
TATA steel plant is allegedly the result of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed on 
4 June 2005 between TATA Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (TISCO), a part of the transnational 
company TATA Group, and the Industrial and Mineral Resources Department of Chhattisgarh 
State Government. The MoU will not reportedly become a public document until the TATA 
company has entered into a formal agreement with the State Government and all clearances have 
been granted as provided for in the memorandum. According to the allegations, the MoU 
provides that the Chhattisgarh State Industrial Development Corporation (CSIDC) will acquire 
an extension of 53,000 acres of private lands in the Lohadiguda Block, in Bastar district, close to 
Jagdalpur town. CSIDC will subsequently hand the land over to TISCO within a period of six to 
nine months after having received the formal application from the company, on a long-term lease 
of 99 years. The operation of the proposed steel plant would further involve the extraction of 
large quantities of iron ore, coal, dolomite, lime stone and other minerals; the pumping of an 
estimate of 35 million gallons of water per day from adjacent rivers; the construction of rail and 
road links, plants, pipe lines, residential colonies and other infrastructure. The reports brought to 
our attention claim that the area affected by the construction of the TATA steel plant belongs to 
the ancestral lands of ten Adivasis villages of Lohadiguda Block, including Dabapal, Dhuragaon, 
Bade, Paroda, Beliapal, Belar, Badanji, Takarguda, Sirisguda, Kumhali, and Chindgaon, that 
have traditionally relied on this land for their livelihoods and access to food. The proposed plant 
would result in the eviction of an estimated 1,500 families from these villages. Reportedly, nor 
the village council meetings nor the families directly affected by the plan have been consulted by 
the State Government before it took the decision of allocating their lands to this project. 
According to the reports, the compensation package offered by the authorities to the affected 
families is perceived to be insufficient to fully compensate for the loss of livelihood that the 
displacement would cause. In this connection, it is reported that compensation would be 
restricted to those families that can prove land ownership. This would allegedly exclude a large 
number of potentially affected families who are small sharecroppers and have not been found to 
be eligible to land titles. For those families that can provide such a title, the monetary 
compensation would be limited to 50,000 INR/acre for non-irrigated land, including grazing 
land; 76,000 INR/acre for non-irrigated single crop land; and 100,000 INR/acre for irrigated </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>double croup land. Payment for planted trees and other properties have not allegedly been 
included in the compensation packages. It is further reported that on 23 February 2007 a 
notification of land acquisition was published without giving the mandatory 30 days required by 
the law for filing objections, thus officially initiating the compulsory land acquisition process. 
On 4 March 2007, this process would have been suspended for unknown reasons. The potential 
displacement that the proposed plant construction would cause could also exacerbate the climate 
of insecurity that the members of tribal communities in the Bastar district have been living with 
and could contribute to fuel violent incidents. 
</p>
<p>57. On 23 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding attacks on the Dalit 
communities, particularly women, in Somebhadra District, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is reported 
that in Sonebhadra District, the poorest District in Uttar Pradesh with a large Dalit population, 
Dalit families have been cultivating and living in a Government&#8217;s waste lands, the 
Gram Sabha&#8217;s, for years. Reportedly, the land ownership has always been a conflicting issue 
between the Upper Caste controlling land resources and Dalits and tribes. Reports indicate that 
Dalits&#8217; reclaim of land has led to conflicts with forest officials and the Police, especially after the 
adoption of the &#8220;Schedule Tribe and other Forest Dwelling Communities (Recognition of Forest 
Rights) Act of 2006&#8221;. It is further alleged that since the Act is not yet operational, the forest 
department officials have been harassing the activists working for the rights of the forest 
dwellers and the tribes, with the aim to ensure that evictions take place before the clauses of the 
Act are enforced. Reportedly similar actions are taking place in other parts of the country 
including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. In this context, on 3 August 2007, 
Ms. Roma and Ms. Shanta Bhattacharya, two members of the National Forum of Forest People 
and Forest Workers (NFFPFW) who have been working in the Sonebhadra District for the past 
seven to eight years, were arrested in Robertsganj under charges of provoking Dalits and Tibals 
to encroach forest lands. They were arrested under section 120 (B) and 447 of Penal Code; they 
are in Mirzapur jail and their bail applications have been rejected at the Circle Judicial 
Magistrate. On 5 August 2007, Lalita Devi and Shyamlal Paswan were arrested from a local 
market in Rangarh, they are also in Mirzapur jail. As a consequence of these imprisonments, 
people have been staging a protest since 4 August in front of the District Magistrate (DM) office 
in Sonebhadra demanding immediate release of the activists. New charges have been brought 
against Ms. Roma under article 4 of the National Security Act on 10 August. Reports also 
indicate that on 10 August 2007, at around 9 p.m., the police attacked Dalit women in Chanduli 
Village, in Sonebhadra District, leaving fifteen women seriously injured. Two trucks loads of 
Police along with Upper Caste representatives of the locality descended on Chanduli village in 
Sonebhadra district. They were allegedly heavily armed, and demanded to see Bachchalal, an 
active member of the local organisation Kaimoor Kshetra Mahila Mazdoor Kisan Sangharsh 
Samiti (KKMMKSS). According to information received, when they did not find Bachchalal in 
the village, they started attacking women present in the village. Police and upper caste 
representatives barged into the house of Bachchalal and attacked his pregnant sister and 
sister-in-law; pulling them out and attacking them. In three hours, the police and upper caste 
representatives beat up around 15 women and destroyed their houses. At the time of the incident, 
there were very few male members in the village as most of them were staging a protest in front 
of the DM&#8217;s office in Sonebhadra against the arrest of Ms. Roma, Ms. Shanta Bhattacharya, </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 37 
 
</p>
<p>Lalita Devi and Shyamlal Paswan. This was allegedly the third attack of this kind against Dalits 
in less than two weeks and reportedly a consequence of the Dalits families&#8217; requests for land that 
started in the last two years, as a response to the forest department&#8217;s Government Resolution of 
2002-3 to clear forest lands from any encroachments. During the events, the police reportedly 
left the village giving an ultimatum to remove the bricks of the houses by 11 August 2007, or 
they would come back with the administrative order to destroy the houses.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 21 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people regarding forced evictions faced by 
several Bedouins indigenous communities in Israel and in territories under Israeli&#8217;s occupation. 
The Special Rapporteurs and the Independent Expert acknowledge receipt of the letter received 
from the Permanent Mission dated 9 August 2006 regarding the Bedouin village of Al-Sira, as a 
response to the communication sent by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people on 19 October 2006. 
The Jahalin Bedouins are mostly 1948 Palestinian refugees, originating from the area of 
Beersheva (Bir el Sabe&#8217;e) in the Negev (Naqab), Israel, and currently living in the West Bank. 
Since the implantation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank in the 1970s, it is reported that 
most have subsequently been internally displaced within the occupied West Bank allegedly as a 
result of threats and/or home demolitions. Particularly with regard to this Bedouin community, it 
is alleged that the establishment in 1976 of Ma&#8217;ale Adumin and its continued expansion since 
then has led to their recurring forced eviction and displacement away from the expanding 
settlement. On one occasion in 1997, reports state that even though a group of Bedouins had 
challenged the displacement in court, the army eventually forcibly evicted them to shipping 
containers onto the Jabal, next to the Jerusalem garbage dump in Abu Dis. Since the 
establishment of the permit regime in the mid-1990s and the construction of the Wall in 2002, 
access to markets in Jerusalem neighbourhoods, has been substantially reduced, further affecting 
the Bedouins&#8217; livelihood. According to recent reports, up to 2,700 members of the Jahalin 
Bedouin indigenous community in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are facing threats of 
forced evictions around the Jewish settlement of Ma&#8217;ale Adumin and near the villages of Anata, 
Abu Dis, and Al&#8217; Zaryya. The Jahalin Bedouin community, presently scattered among 
31 localities on the hills and roads in the desert, allegedly faces home demolitions, as well as 
restricted access to land and essential services, as a result of the construction of the Wall in the 
occupied West Bank and of the planned expansion of the current settlement of Ma&#8217;ale Adumin, 
east of Jerusalem. This expansion plan, called the E1 Plan, allegedly intends to appropriate 
approximately 12.5 square kilometers of the Palestinian villages of Al-Tur, Anata, Al Eizaryieh, 
Abu Dis, Al Essawyieh and Hizma. Together with the planned route of the Wall around the 
E1-Ma&#8217;aleh Adumim settlement block, it will apparently encompass, if implemented, 52 square </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>kilometers and over 50,000 Jewish settlers, de facto including this part of the occupied West 
Bank in Israel&#8217;s &#8220;Greater Jerusalem&#8221;. Reports received claim that these plans will require the 
displacement of these Bedouin communities outside of the route of the Wall. The Government 
reportedly claims that the shacks in which the Bedouin community live have been illegally built 
on &#8220;state land&#8221;, but there would be evidence to proof that the land belongs to the local 
communities. According to the reports, the Government has informed those affected that they are 
required to leave the area that will be encompassed by the Wall, and that it plans to displace 
them onto permanent clusters on lands belonging to the adjacent Palestinian villages of Abu Dis, 
Anata, Al &#8216;Zaryya, Eastern Sawahrah, Al Za&#8217;ym, and Sheikh Sa&#8217;ad, all on the eastern periphery 
of Jerusalem. These villages are said to be host communities to the Jahalin Bedouins who live 
semi-nomadically on the land. Nevertheless, the current residents are against the permanent 
settlement of the Bedouins landing the area. It is alleged that the displacement to these villages 
threatens the traditional semi-nomadic way of life of the Jahalin Bedouins, as according to the 
future plans, they will be effectively surrounded by the Wall, cutting them off from Jerusalem 
and from other parts of the West Bank. Reportedly, they have also expressed their wishes to 
remain in their homes and a strong desire to preserve their traditional way of life while 
improving their living conditions. In addition, reports received have alleged that one of the 
relocation sites envisaged today by the authorities is again located on the Jabal in Abu Dis, on 
the site of the Jerusalem garbage dump, which is still reportedly polluted and unsuitable for 
habitation. On the basis of further information received, similar concerns are raised with regard 
to the reported demolition of buildings and homes of Bedouin indigenous communities living in 
the unrecognized village of Attir-Umm al-Hiran in the Negev Desert, South Israel. The 
communities have reportedly lived in the Negev area for centuries. However, in 1965, the 
communities were forcibly removed by Israeli authorities, which failed to recognize their 
ancestral lands, and relocated them in Attir-Umm al-Hiran. According to the reports, on 
25 June 2007, a large contingent of Israeli police forces acting together with the Israel Border 
patrol and acting upon the direction of the Israeli Ministry of Interior and the National Security 
Council, proceeded to demolish 28 structures, including 25 houses in this village, leaving over 
150 Bedouin men, women and children homeless. These demolitions were allegedly carried out 
as part of a larger plan to resettle the Bedouin communities in one of seven Government 
townships, and also to build a town for Jewish settlers. Since 2005, the inhabitants of this village 
had allegedly been regularly presented with demolition orders from the Israeli authorities and 
had been asked to evacuate the village. They did reportedly not receive prior notice about the 
demolitions on the day nor were given time to remove their possessions from the buildings and 
their homes. On 24 June 2007, Israeli authorities reportedly informed one of the residents in the 
village that they would present on 25 June 2007 a compensation proposal with a view to 
obtaining their agreement to leave the village voluntarily. However, to date, no alternative 
housing or compensation has been allegedly provided. On the basis of further information 
received, concerns are also raised with regard to forced evictions of Bedouin indigenous 
communities in the Jordan Valley, east of the West Bank, much of which have been occupied by 
military facilities or have been taken over by Israeli settlements. According to this information, 
more than a hundred residents of the Bedouin indigenous villages of Hadidiya and Humsa, in the 
Jordan Valley, are facing threats of house demolition and forced eviction. On 10 April 2007, the 
residents of the Bedouin village of Haddidiya received demolition orders, asking them to leave 
their homes by 21 April. The same situation reportedly occurred in the nearby village of Humsa, 
where the residents received a written notice on 29 May 2007 ordering them to leave the area. It 
is reported that the official reason for the eviction orders is that this area is a closed military area, </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
</p>
<p>from which the Bedouin population is barred. Reportedly, on the morning of 13 August 2007, 
the demolition of several houses began in Humsa, including the houses of numerous families 
with a large proportion of children. According to reports, house demolition has been widely used 
as a mean to force Bedouins and Palestinians to leave the Jordan Valley. Reportedly, Bedouin 
families often receive the house demolition orders written in Hebrew, a language which most of 
the Bedouins do not understand or read. It is reported that sometimes house demolition orders 
are not directly given to the families but simply left on the soil and families often only know of 
the order when the army arrives to demolish their homes. Furthermore, it is alleged that Bedouin 
communities are forbidden from building permanent structures, and thus are forced to live in 
tents and shacks, which provide little shelter from the heat, cold and external elements, and they 
are not allowed to use infrastructure including wells and roads in the area, as these are for the 
exclusive use of the nearby Israeli settlements. It is also reported that the army does not allow the 
installation of basic services including running water, electricity and other essential facilities in 
the Bedouins villages. The army has reportedly set up military checkpoints and blockades which 
restrict the Bedouins&#8217; movements. Allegedly these restrictions and measures are intended to 
force the Bedouins out of the area.

<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>60. By letter dated 23 August 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 21 August 2007 by the Special Rapporteur jointly with Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Independent Expert on 
minority issues. The Government underlined that in one paragraph, the communication refers to 
the case of Bedouins in territories under Israeli occupation while the allegation letter also 
mentioned Bedouins living in Beersheva and the Negev which are located within Israel, and are 
not occupied territory. The Government also indicated that the allegation letter refers to &#8220;Naqab&#8221; 
instead of Negev and it specified that peoples who live inside Israel are Israeli citizens and not 
&#8220;Palestinian refugees&#8221;. The Government therefore requested a rectification from the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received on cases sent by the Special Rapporteur in preceding years 
</b></p>
<p>61. By letter dated 9 August 2007, the Government replied to the allegation letter transmitted 
by the Special Rapporteur on 19 October 2006 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and concerning the 
Bedouin village of Al- Sira, In 1980, following the peace accords with Egypt according to the 
<i>Negev Land Acquisition (&#8220;Peace Treaty with Egypt&#8221;) Law, 5740- 1980</i>, areas surrounding the 
Nevatim Airport were expropriated for the purpose of establishing military installations. The 
Bedouin residents living nearby were subsequently evacuated in 1983. Most resettled in the 
permanent Bedouin towns of Kseife and Araara, while some moved to the Bedouin town of 
Rahat, or to other areas in the centre of Israel. Additionally, in 1980 a fence was erected around 
Al-Sira area, and it was made clear to residents that the land was henceforth expropriated and 
that at some point they would have to relocate according to law. Nevertheless, residents of the 
Al-Sira community began to dismantle the fence surrounding the area. Residents furthermore 
petitioned the Supreme Court requesting it to abolish the land expropriation. However on the 
recommendation of the Supreme Court&#8217;s president, the petition was revoked. In September 2006, 
the State initiated action against illegal construction in the area of Al- Sira and inspectors from 
the Ministry of Interior visited the village in order to identify the owners of the illegal dwellings. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>However, due to the fear of penal proceedings, it has been found that in the majority of cases 
residents are neither present nor willing to declare in which of the building they reside. In 
addition, out of respect for the special status of Bedouin women, State officials do not pressure 
women to identify themselves. Al-Sira is situated on State land. The Bedouin residents claiming 
ownership of that land are either very old or have passed away. As those who built illegally were 
more often distant relatives, rather than the ownership claimant themselves, it has proved almost 
impossible to ascribe illegal buildings to specific persons. Efforts were made to identify building 
owners and initiate proceeding against them using data available via other inspection units, such 
as the Bedouin Administration and the Green Police. An <i>ex parte</i> demolition is issued as a final 
resort, and only when it is impossible to file an indictment against the owners under the usual 
circumstances, or when every other alternative has been exhausted. Unless a resident identifies 
the illegal building within two-week period, a request will be submitted to the Magistrates Court 
to render and<i> ex parte</i> demolition order. In any case, such an order becomes valid only after 
having posted a demolition notice for 30 days, during which time the owner of the building is 
entitled to submit a reservation. The owner is further entitled to contest the demolition order and 
raise his own claims during the court hearing. In the case of Al-Sira, demolition orders were 
rendered by the Magistrates Court according to article 212 to the <i>Planning and Building Law</i>, 
and were procedurally posted on the illegal buildings. The residents of the buildings were given 
an extended period to submit an application for reversing the judgement, but most opted not to 
approach the court.

</b></p>
<p>63. On 18 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Independent Expert on Minority Issues 
and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, concerning incidents of evictions of Roma communities in Rome and 
Pisa which allegedly would form part of a pattern of discrimination against Roma communities. 
According to the information received, Roma communities in Italy face discrimination and 
violations of their right to adequate housing, including being subjected to forced evictions. 
Reportedly, on 19 July 2007, the Italian police in cooperation with the Romanian police forcibly 
evicted approximately 1000 Roma from a settlement in Via dell&#8217;Imbarco, Magliana suburb, 
Rome. Earlier in July 2007, the police and the municipal wardens forcibly evicted approximately 
100 Romanian Roma from a settlement in Bagno di Tivoli, near Rome. During both operations 
personal belongings and dwellings were allegedly destroyed. Following an official visit to 
Romania of the Rome&#8217;s mayor, Mr. Walter Veltroni, an agreement was signed between the 
Italian and Romanian governments whereby the police of these countries would collaborate 
concerning the eviction, identification and repatriation of Roma of Romanian origin living in </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 41 
 
</p>
<p>settlements in the city of Rome. Despite the declaration that this would be a plan for &#8220;voluntary 
return&#8221;, there are allegations that the intention is to repatriate Roma settlers forcibly. It has also 
been reported that the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Franco Frattini, stated 
that &#8220;it is not true that European citizens cannot be repatriated&#8230; There is a very clear directive, 
valid for all citizens of the European Union that provides for the expulsion for all those who 
cannot prove to have adequate means of subsistence to live in a dignified way&#8221;. This statement 
has been allegedly used by politicians in anti-Roma speeches. For instance, the mayor of Verona, 
Mr. Flavio Tosi, who had previously been sentenced to two months imprisonment for racist 
propaganda against Roma, used the above statement to affirm that many of the Romanian Roma 
living in a &#8220;nomad camps&#8221; can be repatriated. The Special Rapporteur received also information 
concerning the case of four Romanian Roma children, Lenuca, Danchiu, Dengi and Eva, who, on 
11 August 2007, died in a fire that burned down, for reasons yet unknown, in the hut where they 
were temporarily living with their parents in Livorno, following their forced eviction from Pisa 
in May 2007. Following the information received, their parents are currently in detention, 
charged with abandonment of minors and parental negligence. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received  
</b></p>
<p>64. By letter dated 21 December 2007, the Government of Italy replied to the joint allegation 
letter sent on 18 October 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Independent Expert on minority issues and the 
Special Rapporteur on racism. The Government first noted that the question of the living 
conditions of the Roma populations, as laid down in the Consolidated Text 286/1998 as amended 
and integrated by Act 189/2002, was a competence of Local Bodies and that local institutions 
were still proceeding with the adoption of all pertinent interventions. Within this framework, 
several initiatives aiming at setting up small camps and/or focus on integration measures are in 
the process of being implemented in different part of the country as in Naples, Milan, Rovereto 
and Rome. More specifically, in the case of the Municipality of Rome, it was noted that actions 
aimed at the reception and integration of Roma communities have been increased and 
strengthened. The Government informed that the &#8220;Pronta Accoglienza&#8221; (Welcome reception 
centres) received thousands of Roma people while <i>ad hoc</i> structures have been realized 
specifically for mother and child groups. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement located 
in &#8220;Magliana&#8221; - Via dell&#8217;Imbarco - Rome (July 19, 2007), the Government informed that the 
Roman police, in agreement with the Municipality, the &#8220;Nucleo Assistenza Emarginati&#8221; 
(Outcasts Assistance Nucleus) and the Municipal Police carried out the removal of a Roma 
illegal settlement located under an overpass, in an area subjected to overflow and that was found 
in appalling hygienic and sanitary conditions. A decision to intervene had been previously 
agreed within the Provincial Committee for Public Order and Security and had been repeatedly 
requested by the Municipal Agency for Electricity and Water in order to allow urgent 
maintenance works close to the settlement. Evacuation of the area was carried out with medical 
units, charity institutions and sanitation experts. The Government informed that the removal 
affected about 500 (not 1.300) people belonging to a Romanian ethnic group who, being 
informed about the impossibility to remain in an unsafe area, voluntarily moved away. Just a few 
of them, who did not intend to leave the premises, immediately received assistance from the 
Roman Social Service. Following the event, the police and social workers intervened in order to 
assist the more disadvantaged categories, like the mothers and children. Concerning the removal 
of a Roma settlement in &#8220;Bagni di Tivoli&#8221;, former &#8220;Stacchini&#8221; powder warehouse 
(July 26, 2007), the Government reported that, according to a decision taken by the &#8220;Illegal </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>Roma Settlement Issues Working Group&#8221; of the local &#8220;Prefettura&#8221;, the police, the Carabinieri, 
the Civil Protection and other competent offices of the Tivoli Municipality carried out the 
removal of an illegal settlement within the private area of the former powder warehouse. This 
action had been made necessary as a consequence of requests by the owner of the site and other 
private citizens. During the intervention, 80 Romanian citizens have been requested to pick up 
their belongings and leave the place. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement in Pisa 
(May 2007), the Government reported that the removal of a small community from the so-called 
&#8220;CEP&#8221; area in Pisa had been planned and carried out by the Municipal Police of Pisa. Goods of 
subsistence and meal tickets were supplied and the only family with minors was assisted. An 
alternative accommodation at a nearby landlord in the area has been offered to this family. The 
Government underlined that this family was not one of the families involved in the terrible 
episode occurred in Livorno. Furthermore, in 2002, the city of Pisa started a specific programme 
called &#8220;Le Citt&#224; Sottili&#8221;, mainly aimed at the final closure of the Roma settlement. Four out of 
five Roma camps have been definitely closed. At the time the government sent this 
communication, there were still two areas where some family groups had been temporarily 
accommodated and various housing possibilities had been already foreseen for them. In the area 
of Coltano, they have started to build up a village in order to accommodate by the spring 2008 
about 15 family groups. The Government specified that out of 572 Roma citizens coming from 
various regions of the Balkans the half benefited from the programme &#8220;Le Citt&#224; Sottili&#8221; and were 
offered an adequate housing and that another relevant number was well-placed in temporary 
solutions. The Government also reported that each single family group was backed by a specific 
project in order to cope with the integration process autonomously and that all persons still 
staying within the settlement and in the transition areas were supported with targeted 
interventions. The Government also indicated that all the children in the age of compulsory 
education had entered a school and had a sufficient level of attendance and that all of these 
projects have been approved by the social cooperative societies and local associations. As to the 
Roma from Rumania, during the summer 2004, after the removal of illegal settlement in Pisa, the 
authorities detected hazardous situations for the health of some minors and consequently five 
Romanian Roma family groups were resettled along the line drawn with &#8220;La Citt&#224; Sottile&#8221;. Two 
of these family groups then decided to move autonomously. In April 2005, after the fire of a 
warehouse, 11 families were accommodated in temporary facilities within the Municipality of 
San Giuliano Tm. In spring/summer 2006, the Municipality joined the programme and paid for 
those families who benefited from the above mentioned projects. In its reply the Government 
noted that after the arrivals of a number of Roma from Rumania, especially at the beginning of 
2007, several situations of marginalization and poverty arose in the territory of Pisa. By the end 
of 2006, the &#8220;IRRMA&#8221; (&#8220;Regional Intervention against Marginality&#8221;) project started. This 
project was developed by the Tuscany Regional Administration in cooperation with the &#8220;CNCA&#8221; 
(Reception Communities National Coordination Board), managed within the Pisa territory by the 
social cooperative &#8220;Il Cerchio&#8221; and aiming to taking care of the Romanian Roma. It was added 
that two family groups had been supported for housing projects along with a number of people 
looking for employment, and this with good results. The Government indicated that the 
Municipality of Pisa was committed to activating further interventions addressed to family 
groups with a sufficient income to guarantee an integration path, and/or had a particular health 
situation. It was also reported that actions would be developed with the commitment to closing 
the illegal settlement and preventing the creation of new ones. Concerning the events of Livorno 
(August 11, 2007), the Government reported that around midnight, the Fire Brigade was 
requested to extinguish a fire in the outskirts of the town, where three huts made of wood and </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 43 
 
</p>
<p>plastic were on fire. The charred corpses of four children were found and identified, according to 
their parent&#8217;s statements, as Romanians of 4, 7, 8 and 11 years of age. Late in the night, the 
police arrested the parents of the victims who were questioned by the judge and finally they were 
considered guilty of child abandonment and consequently of their death. Following investigation, 
and despite the parents&#8217; allegations, there would be no responsibility of a third person and the 
possibility of a racist or a xenophobic attack has been excluded. The authorities also specified 
that the victims weren&#8217;t living temporarily in Livorno because of their forced eviction from Pisa 
and that just the householder of one of the family groups could have been present in Pisa and 
been removed. Concerning Non-Discrimination, the Government recalls that besides article 3, 
c.2 of the Italian Constitution, the Law decree No. 286/98 settled the procedures for civil action 
against discriminatory acts due to racial, ethnical, national or religious reasons committed by a 
private or by the public administration. It was noted that this decree established measures of 
social integration as the organization of training courses tailored for public officers and private 
corporations in charge of foreign citizens or working in the immigration field. The government 
also explained that the National Office against Racial Discrimination (UNAR), was offering free 
legal consulting to victims of discrimination who report to competent jurisdictional authorities. 
Periodical meetings with the Rom associations have permitted to this Office to play an 
intermediation role and to determine the main sectors of potential intervention by the State or by 
the local Authorities, including housing, health and legal status. Finally, the Government 
mentioned the very recent agreement signed in Bucharest, on 20 December 2007, by the Italian 
Minister for Social Solidarity and the Romanian Minister of Labour. It was explained that this 
agreement would aim to establish a partnership in order to reduce, in both countries, the level of 
poverty of Romanian citizens, in particular Roma people. It was finally noted that this agreement 
is providing the utilization of national and European funds for the implementation of joint 
projects in the fields of labour, education and housing.

<p>66. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Independent 
Expert on minority issues, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights of 
Internally Displaced Persons, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on thousands of 
men, women and children from the Hmong ethnic minority, who have been living in hiding in 
the jungle and on the run from the military, have been driven to destitution and lack food, water, 
clothing, housing and medical care. According to these allegations, these persons are unable to 
cultivate crops because they fear that it would make them easily detectable by the military 
particularly from the air. They reportedly live from what they can gather in the forest although it 
is alleged that they do not pick up any visible quantity of wild fruit in certain areas in order to 
evade being found and do not hunt animals. The information received indicates a high level of 
malnutrition within this group particularly of children who have reportedly distended bellies, 
bleached hair and skinny frames as a result. The reports brought to our attention also claim that </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>regular violent attacks around and on encampments and its inhabitants have led to continuous 
displacement which affects their right to an adequate standard of living including shelter, 
drinking water and food. According to these reports, armed attacks by the military on people in 
the jungle have occurred on many occasions while they forage for food including roots and 
husks. For example, it was reported that in one of these incidents, in April 2006, 17 children 
were among the 26 people who were killed while they were searching for food. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>67. By letter dated 3 August 2007, the Government replied to the joint letter sent 
on 10 May 2007 by the Special Rapporteur, the Independent Expert on minority issues, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, 
and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food. The Government commented that the 
information contained in the communication is completely false and unfounded. There has never 
been either a policy or practice of the Lao PDR Government to deprive its own people of their 
right to an adequate and equitable standard of living. On the contrary, international reports from 
the United Nations and international assistance agencies confirm that the Government of the 
Lao PDR has put into implementation a long- term socio-economic development strategy with a 
view to moving the country out of least developed status by the year 2020. This strategy aims to 
achieve the overall policy objectives of the Lao PDR to bring about the health and prosperity to 
all Lao ethnic people regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, religion, language and social 
status. The Government further stated that under the current Sixth Year Socio-Economic 
Development Plan, poverty reduction remains the priority of the Lao Government in line with its 
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The Government of the Lao PDR 
has in so far adopted 11 major programs and 111 projects to implement this plan, which are 
designed with strong public participation in order to promote the social-economic and cultural 
rights of all our ethnic people, including Hmong. The Government brought also to the attention 
the adoption of the Prime Ministerial Decree on the Establishment of Villages and Communes 
for Development issued on 7 May 2007. In addition the Government has promoted various 
domestic and foreign investment projects throughout the country, especially in the region of 
Nakai plateau located in central Laos. For example with regard to the Nam Theun 2 hydropower 
project, all ethnic people living near the project site enjoy the opportunity to attain permanent 
employment and to improve their living conditions. On the international scene, the 
Lao Government has also carried out a humanitarian policy towards all Lao citizens, living 
legally and illegally abroad. LAO PDR takes pride in monitoring a purposefully high degree of 
ethnic diversity (including numerous Hmong) within all levels all authority, the civil service and 
the armed forced. Therefore, the claims about discrimination towards the Lao Hmong are 
incongruous with the reality.<b>

Kampong Berembang located in Jalan Ampang. Sources indicate that the police supported by the 
Ampang Jaya local council enforcement unit, the Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya (MPAJ) used 
force to disperse the crowd at the demolition site and one villager, Norhasliana binti Osman, was 
reportedly beaten unconscious. In addition, on 22 and 23 November 2006, the agents of the 
MPAJ allegedly tried to demolish the praying room which is the last structure which remains 
intact in the village where the former residents continue to live in tents and makeshift houses. 
According to reports, 50 families who had lived on the disputed land for more than 30 years 
were forcefully evicted before their alternative homes were completed under Selangor&#8217;s policy

<p>resoluciones judiciales. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, a pesar de las resoluciones judiciales, actualmente 
se encuentra en construcci&#243;n la carretera que comunica Tunzingo con el poblado de 
San Isidro Gallinero, y que atraviesa el n&#250;cleo agrario de Cacahuatepec, y para ello se habr&#237;a 
introducido maquinaria en los terrenos comunales de Cacahuatepec. Asimismo, se informa de los 
planes para construir la carretera entre Dos Arroyos y Los Huajes, Altos del Camar&#243;n, Agua de 
Perro y La Venta, que contar&#237;a ya con un presupuesto asignado. Seg&#250;n las informaciones, un 
grupo de personas, que se habr&#237;an identificado como miembros de un comit&#233; para la 
construcci&#243;n de la carretera, se habr&#237;an presentado en el n&#250;cleo Dos Arroyos en diciembre de 
2006 para comunicar que abrir&#237;an un nuevo camino de la Autopista del Sol a la localidad y para 
dialogar con los due&#241;os de los terrenos que se ver&#237;an afectados. Seg&#250;n las informaciones 
recibidas, la construcci&#243;n de estas carreteras no estar&#237;a siendo llevada a cabo por la CFE, sino 
por el Gobierno de Guerrero. Se alega que las autoridades estatales estar&#237;an sirviendo de 
conducto a la CFE para llevar a cabo estas obras, y que su mediaci&#243;n ser&#237;a una maniobra para 
evadir el cumplimiento de las resoluciones judiciales mencionadas. Se alega tambi&#233;n que, aun si 
estos dos caminos fueran obras del Gobierno del Estado, ser&#237;an ilegales, ya que ni el Gobierno 
estatal ni el Gobierno federal cuentan con los convenios de ocupaci&#243;n previa que exige la 
Ley Agraria para la realizaci&#243;n de trabajos relacionados con La Parota, y que los terrenos 
ejidales y comunales que ser&#237;an afectados con las obras de las carreteras no han sido expropiados 
ni han cobrado el derecho de v&#237;a. Junto con la situaci&#243;n de desacato a las resoluciones judiciales 
que protegen a las comunidades afectadas por la construcci&#243;n de la represa, se han recibido 
alegaciones en torno a supuestas inconsistencias existentes en los documentos preparatorios del 
proyecto. As&#237;, los datos relativos al n&#250;mero de personas afectadas por la construcci&#243;n de la 
represa proporcionados por el Gobierno (3.039) no concordar&#237;an con la cifra que sostienen los 
comuneros y ejidatarios que habitan la zona (25.000), ni con la Manifestaci&#243;n de Impacto 
Ambiental (MIA) del Proyecto de 2004, que indica que unas 2.488 personas se ver&#237;an afectadas 
en localidades totalmente inundadas, y otras 7.697 personas en localidades inundadas 
parcialmente. Espec&#237;ficamente, el poblado de Dos Arroyos, ubicado en el Municipio de 
Acapulco y con una poblaci&#243;n de 2.100 habitantes, que se ver&#237;a inundado parcialmente, no fue 
incluido en la lista de poblados afectados aportada por el Gobierno. Tambi&#233;n se alega que no se

Construcci&#243;n, Coordinaci&#243;n de Proyectos Hidroel&#233;ctricos de la CFE. Dicho documento se 
referir&#237;a a la dotaci&#243;n de mejores viviendas a los afectados, pero no mencionar&#237;a la restituci&#243;n de 
tierras de cultivo ni la indemnizaci&#243;n. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, no existir&#237;a 
ninguna experiencia precedente en el pa&#237;s en la que los reubicados por las presas hayan mejorado 
sus condiciones de vida gracias a las formas de compensaci&#243;n derivadas de proyectos, cit&#225;ndose 
los ejemplos de las represas de El Caracol (1986), Los Huites (1994), y El Caj&#243;n (en curso). 
Asimismo, algunos de los afectados por la construcci&#243;n de la represa declaran no haber recibido 
informaci&#243;n suficiente sobre el proyecto por parte de la CFE que les permita valorar los costos y 
beneficios del proyecto. En la misma MIA (cap&#237;tulo IV sobre el impacto socioecon&#243;mico del 
proyecto, en la parte llamada &#8220;elementos cr&#237;ticos&#8221;) se reconoce que &#8220;[a] pesar de los esfuerzos 
realizados por la CFE, la labor informativa no ha podido transmitir con claridad los impactos que </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1

</p>
<p>sufrir&#237;a cada una de las comunidades&#8221;. En relaci&#243;n con la Reuni&#243;n P&#250;blica de Informaci&#243;n sobre 
la MIA que tuvo lugar el 24 de agosto de 2004, se alega que este mecanismo es de naturaleza 
eminentemente ambiental y que por lo tanto no tom&#243; en cuenta las afectaciones sociales del 
proyecto, incluyendo cuestiones agrarias o de derechos humanos, y que por consiguiente no 
puede considerarse como un procedimiento v&#225;lido de consulta en relaci&#243;n con todos los aspectos 
del proyecto. Esta situaci&#243;n de falta de informaci&#243;n no favorecer&#237;a las negociaciones que se 
llevar&#225;n a cabo pr&#243;ximamente con las partes afectadas, y habr&#237;an generado un clima de 
confusi&#243;n e incertidumbre en las comunidades, contribuyendo a la divisi&#243;n al interior de las 
mismas. Los Relatores Especiales fueron tambi&#233;n informados de que se hab&#237;an producido 
m&#250;ltiples irregularidades en las asambleas comunales y ejidales convocadas para la discusi&#243;n del 
proyecto al interior de las comunidades afectadas. Se alega que en las asambleas realizadas, los 
campesinos incluidos en las listas (padrones) de los que tienen derecho al voto constituyen un 
porcentaje m&#237;nimo de la poblaci&#243;n, ya que las listas no se encuentran actualizadas y s&#243;lo toman 
en consideraci&#243;n a las personas que tienen derechos agrarios sobre las tierras y no a los 
poseedores, avecinados y ciudadanos en general que viven en la zona. Asimismo, de acuerdo con 
las informaciones recibidas, cuatro de las asambleas realizadas (Bienes Comunales de 
Cacahuatepec y ejidos Dos Arroyos, Los Huajes y La Palma) habr&#237;an sido impugnados y sujetos 
a procedimientos administrativos, habi&#233;ndose producido supuestas violaciones a los 
procedimientos establecidos en la Ley Agraria. Entre otras se menciona: que las convocatorias 
no fueron circuladas en los n&#250;cleos agrarios que deb&#237;an participar en ellas; que no fueron 
expuestas en lugares visibles y no se expidieron en los tiempos previstos por la ley; que se 
impidi&#243; con el uso de la fuerza p&#250;blica la participaci&#243;n de los campesinos opositores al proyecto; 
que no se verific&#243; el qu&#243;rum establecido para que legalmente se votara la expropiaci&#243;n de las 
tierras; y que las asambleas no se llevaron a cabo, seg&#250;n establece la ley, en los lugares 
tradicionales sino en municipios aleda&#241;os. Por &#250;ltimo, se han recibido alegaciones en relaci&#243;n 
con la situaci&#243;n de inseguridad, hostigamiento y manipulaci&#243;n que sufren los afectados, y que no 
les permitir&#237;a trabajar y emprender los proyectos productivos de desarrollo que les permitir&#237;an 
mejorar su econom&#237;a campesina. La defensa emprendida desde hace tres a&#241;os, seg&#250;n se alega, 
los ha obligado a abandonar el trabajo, las actividades cotidianas y las familias, y a vivir 
constantemente bajo presi&#243;n y temor de ser desalojados en contra de su voluntad. 
</p><p>72. El 19 de octubre de 2007, el Relator Especial, conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los pueblos ind&#237;genas 
envi&#243; el documento &#8220;Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones en materia de derechos humanos 
del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de La Parota&#8221;. Este documento, fruto de las distintas opiniones e 
informaciones recabadas durante la visita efectuada por los dos Relatores Especiales entre el 7 y 
el 11 de septiembre de 2007 para analizar el impacto sobre los derechos humanos de las obras de 
construcci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota, incorpora una serie de observaciones y 
recomendaciones dirigidas al Gobierno de M&#233;xico.

<p><b>Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones en materia de derechos humanos  
del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de La Parota, Estado de Guerrero, M&#233;xico 
</b></p>
<p>74. &#8220;El desarrollo de un proyecto de la magnitud del de la Hidroel&#233;ctrica La Parota, en virtud 
del cual, entre otras cuestiones, posiblemente se inundar&#225;n 14.000 hect&#225;reas de tierra y se 
reubicar&#225; un total de 4.000 personas pertenecientes a 15 n&#250;cleos de la poblaci&#243;n, sin duda </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>requiere ser estudiado desde muchas perspectivas y analizarse en toda su complejidad. Esto 
implica que no sean relevantes s&#243;lo los aspectos t&#233;cnicos del proyecto, sino tambi&#233;n el impacto 
social, humano y ambiental que se producir&#225; en caso de llevarse a cabo. De manera particular, la 
experiencia internacional nos demuestra que generalmente los desalojos o desplazamientos de 
personas a causa de proyectos de desarrollo tienen serias implicaciones en un conjunto amplio de 
derechos humanos. Los Principios b&#225;sicos y directrices sobre los desalojos y el desplazamiento 
generados por el desarrollo, presentados en 2007 por el Relator Especial sobre el derecho a una 
vivienda adecuada como elemento integrante del derecho a un nivel de vida adecuado 
(A/HRC/4/18, anexo I), se&#241;alan que en este tipo de proyectos con frecuencia son vulnerados los 
derechos humanos a la vivienda adecuada, a la alimentaci&#243;n, al agua, a la salud, a la educaci&#243;n, 
al trabajo, a la tierra, a la seguridad de la persona, a la seguridad del hogar, a la libertad de tratos 
crueles, inhumanos y degradantes, a la libertad de circulaci&#243;n y al medio ambiente. En virtud de 
los compromisos internacionales que ha contra&#237;do en materia de derechos humanos, el Estado 
mexicano ha asumido la obligaci&#243;n general de implementar las medidas y pr&#225;cticas necesarias 
para salvaguardar los derechos humanos de las personas con motivo de la realizaci&#243;n de este tipo 
de proyectos de desarrollo. En este sentido el objetivo principal de la visita de los dos Relatores 
Especiales fue el de analizar si en el caso del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota el Gobierno ha 
tomado las medidas necesarias para garantizar que los derechos humanos de las personas 
afectadas directa e indirectamente por la construcci&#243;n del Proyecto no se ver&#225;n 
irremediablemente vulnerados. Despu&#233;s de hacer una visita al lugar y valorar objetivamente la 
informaci&#243;n recibida de las autoridades responsables y de diversas organizaciones de la sociedad 
civil, as&#237; como los testimonios de las personas que habitan las comunidades que posiblemente 
ser&#225;n afectadas, los dos Relatores Especiales consideraron que existen algunas inconsistencias en 
las medidas que el Estado mexicano ha adoptado con el fin de garantizar los derechos humanos 
de las personas afectadas por la realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota. 
</p>
<p><b>Derechos a la informaci&#243;n, a la consulta y al consentimiento previo, libre e informado 
</b></p>
<p>75. El derecho a la informaci&#243;n se reconoce en diversos instrumentos internacionales que el 
Estado mexicano ha ratificado, como el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos y en 
la Convenci&#243;n Americana de Derechos Humanos. Adem&#225;s de ello se encuentra consagrado en el 
art&#237;culo sexto de la Constituci&#243;n y reglamentado en la Ley Federal de Transparencia y Acceso a 
la Informaci&#243;n. P&#250;blica Gubernamental (LFTAIPG). Las obligaciones del Estado con respecto al 
derecho de la persona a buscar y recibir informaci&#243;n incluyen no s&#243;lo la obligaci&#243;n negativa de 
no restringir ni obstaculizar el ejercicio de este derecho, sino, tambi&#233;n, una obligaci&#243;n positiva 
defacilitar el acceso a la informaci&#243;n que obre en poder de las distintas autoridades e 
instituciones p&#250;blicas. El Convenio N.&#186; 169 de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional del Trabajo (OIT) 
sobre pueblos ind&#237;genas y tribales en pa&#237;ses independientes, de 1989, ratificado por M&#233;xico, 
establece el derecho de los pueblos ind&#237;genas a ser consultados mediante procedimientos 
apropiados y en particular a trav&#233;s de sus instituciones representativas, cada vez que se prevean 
medidas legislativas o administrativas susceptibles de afectarles directamente. Las consultas 
llevadas a cabo en aplicaci&#243;n de este Convenio deber&#225;n efectuarse de buena fe y de una manera 
apropiada a las circunstancias, con la finalidad de llegar a un acuerdo o lograr el consentimiento 
acerca de las medidas propuestas. Por otra parte, la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los 
derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, promovida por M&#233;xico en el Consejo de Derechos Humanos, 
afirma en su art&#237;culo 10 que no se proceder&#225; a ning&#250;n traslado sin el consentimiento libre, previo 
e informado de los pueblos ind&#237;genas interesados. En relaci&#243;n con el Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico 
La Parota, la Comisi&#243;n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) ha elaborado un conjunto de documentos </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 49 
 
</p>
<p>que contiene informaci&#243;n sobre diversos temas, tales como la situaci&#243;n socioecon&#243;mica de los 
municipios y n&#250;cleos agrarios que ser&#237;an afectados; la delimitaci&#243;n de las tierras que ser&#237;an 
inundadas; la superficie que ser&#237;a afectada por las obras de construcci&#243;n; el n&#250;mero de viviendas 
que ser&#237;an reubicadas total o parcialmente; el cronograma de actividades de construcci&#243;n y los 
compromisos que se han adquirido con las comunidades en cuanto a la realizaci&#243;n de obras de 
compensaci&#243;n. Sin embargo, en base a las entrevistas y reuniones que los Relatores Especiales 
sostuvieron con los diversos actores, tanto a favor como en contra de la realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto 
Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota, pueden afirmar que la informaci&#243;n generada por la CFE no ha logrado 
realmente llegar de una manera clara y precisa a los pobladores de la zona que se ver&#237;a afectada. 
Incluso, las autoridades de la propia CFE han reconocido que sus estrategias de informaci&#243;n a la 
poblaci&#243;n no han sido eficaces. Los estudios sobre impacto ambiental e impacto social del 
proyecto, encargados por la CFE a instituciones acad&#233;micas reputadas, no han sido dados a 
conocer, ni han sido debatidos p&#250;blicamente por los interesados. Para que las personas puedan 
decidir sobre si est&#225;n a favor o en contra del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota, el cual, sin duda 
tendr&#237;a un impacto definitivo en sus vidas, es necesario que cuenten con informaci&#243;n veraz y 
objetiva y que esta informaci&#243;n provenga de manera directa de las autoridades responsables del 
proyecto. Existen ciertos temas claves sobre los que las personas no han sido informadas y que 
constituyen una condici&#243;n necesaria para poder adoptar una decisi&#243;n libre e informada, 
incluyendo el monto de la indemnizaci&#243;n por las tierras que posiblemente les ser&#225;n expropiadas, 
el lugar preciso en el que ser&#225;n reasentadas las familias afectadas, y si se les dotar&#225; o no de 
tierras para el cultivo. Para obtener el acuerdo de la poblaci&#243;n afectada, las autoridades han 
promovido en los distintos n&#250;cleos agrarios (ejidos y comunidades de bienes comunales) las 
asambleas agrarias correspondientes, pero este proceso ha sido denunciado en repetidas 
ocasiones por una parte de la poblaci&#243;n por haber adolecido de diversas irregularidades, con la 
consecuencia que se han producido profundas divisiones sociales y pol&#237;ticas en estos pueblos, 
con instancias de violencia y la intervenci&#243;n injustificada de la fuerza p&#250;blica. Recientemente, un 
Tribunal Unitario Agrario del estado anul&#243; algunas de estas asambleas por las mismas razones. 
</p>
<p><b>Derecho a la participaci&#243;n 
</b></p>
<p>76. El derecho a participar en la direcci&#243;n de los asuntos p&#250;blicos se reconoce en el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. La observaci&#243;n general 7 (1997) del Comit&#233; de 
Derechos Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales sobre el derecho a una vivienda adecuada (p&#225;rrafo 
1 del art&#237;culo 11 del Pacto): desalojos forzosos, se&#241;ala que el derecho a una vivienda adecuada, 
reconocido en el Pacto y la consecuente prohibici&#243;n de los desalojos &#8220;forzosos&#8221; exige que entre 
las garant&#237;as procesales necesarias para que sea justificable un desalojo figure una aut&#233;ntica 
oportunidad de consultar a las personas afectadas y recuerda que la obligaci&#243;n de los Estados de 
utilizar todos los medios apropiados para promover el derecho a una vivienda adecuada incluye 
la de velar por que se estudien en consulta con los interesados todas las posibilidades que 
permitan evitar el recurso a la fuerza en relaci&#243;n con los desalojos. Los Principios b&#225;sicos y 
directrices sobre los desalojos y el desplazamiento generados por el desarrollo establecen que de 
la mano del derecho a la informaci&#243;n, las personas que podr&#237;an verse afectadas tienen el derecho 
de participar y ser tomados en cuenta a lo largo de todo el proceso de planeaci&#243;n e 
implementaci&#243;n de los proyectos basados en el desarrollo. En el caso del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico 
La Parota, los Relatores Especiales pudieron constatar que las personas de las comunidades 
afectadas adquirieron conocimiento del proyecto una vez que &#233;ste ya estaba completamente 
definido y s&#243;lo cuando la CFE empez&#243; a realizar los primeros trabajos en la zona para iniciar el 
proyecto. A&#250;n hoy en d&#237;a entre las comunidades existe un gran desconocimiento en torno a lo </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p>que suceder&#225; con el Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico. Esta situaci&#243;n genera especulaciones y rumores que 
terminan por incrementar los niveles de tensi&#243;n social en la zona. Este factor habla por s&#237; mismo 
de la poca transparencia con la que parecen haber sido tomadas las decisiones acerca del 
Proyecto. 
</p>
<p><b>Estudio de impacto social y humano 
</b></p>
<p>77. Por otra parte, los Principios y directrices a los que se ha hecho alusi&#243;n recomiendan que 
antes de proceder a la realizaci&#243;n de un proyecto de desarrollo que implique el desplazamiento y 
desalojo de personas se deben elaborar estudios amplios e integrales sobre sus efectos sociales y 
sus consecuencias en los derechos humanos de las personas que ser&#225;n afectadas. Este tipo de 
estudios son indispensables para asegurar que los costos sociales, humanos y ambientales que 
implica un proyecto de esta magnitud no sean desproporcionados en relaci&#243;n con los beneficios 
que se intentan alcanzar, pero, sobre todo, para que las personas puedan tener alguna certeza de 
lo que pasar&#225; con ellos y cu&#225;l ser&#225; su situaci&#243;n socioecon&#243;mica una vez que se realice el 
proyecto. En su visita, los Relatores Especiales pudieron constatar que tanto las personas que 
est&#225;n a favor como las que est&#225;n en contra del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico coinciden en un punto 
que tambi&#233;n es reconocido por las autoridades. Ambos grupos denuncian que viven en una 
situaci&#243;n de marginaci&#243;n y abandono y, por lo tanto, coinciden en demandar mayores 
oportunidades de desarrollo en la regi&#243;n. La divergencia radica en que aquellos que est&#225;n a favor 
ven el proyecto como la &#250;nica alternativa que tienen para el desarrollo de sus comunidades y 
para mejorar el nivel de vida de sus familias, mientras que para los que est&#225;n en contra el 
Proyecto acabar&#225; con las &#250;nicas fuentes de riqueza que tienen - la tierra y el r&#237;o - y trastocar&#225; por 
completo el esquema vital de sus comunidades. El hecho es que, debido a la inexistencia de un 
estudio de impacto social que pueda proyectar las consecuencias que el Proyecto tendr&#225; en la 
vida de las personas y en el ejercicio de sus derechos, las comunidades no pueden saber con 
certeza si la realizaci&#243;n del proyecto tendr&#225; un impacto positivo o negativo en su propio 
desarrollo. Todo se reduce a una cuesti&#243;n de confianza en las promesas que las autoridades 
federales y locales les han hecho, pero que est&#225;n lejos de constituir un convenio negociado con la 
plena participaci&#243;n de las comunidades afectadas. 
</p>
<p><b>Obligaci&#243;n de agotar todas las alternativas 
</b></p>
<p>78. La prohibici&#243;n de los desalojos forzosos definida como parte del derecho a una vivienda 
adecuada establece que aquellos proyectos de desarrollo que impliquen el desalojo o 
desplazamiento de personas deber&#225;n ser excepcionales. Por lo tanto, se requiere que, antes de ser 
aprobados, el Estado busque otras alternativas a trav&#233;s de las cuales se puedan satisfacer las 
necesidades que justifican este tipo de proyectos sin necesidad de desplazar a las personas de su 
lugar de residencia. Asimismo, se debe conceder un espacio para que las personas posiblemente 
afectadas puedan tambi&#233;n proponer alternativas a la realizaci&#243;n del proyecto. En la entrevista 
que los Relatores Especiales sostuvieron con los directivos de la CFE, se les inform&#243; que existen 
varias alternativas para satisfacer las demandas de energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica de M&#233;xico para los pr&#243;ximos 
a&#241;os. Incluso les comunic&#243; que en sustituci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota se hab&#237;an 
iniciado ya los trabajos de construcci&#243;n de otra central hidroel&#233;ctrica denominada &#8220;La Yesca&#8221; en 
los Estados de Nayarit y Jalisco. En este caso nadie tendr&#237;a que ser desplazado ni desalojado. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 51 
 
</p>
<p>79. Por lo dem&#225;s, una de las principales consecuencias previstas de la construcci&#243;n del 
proyecto de La Parota ser&#237;a la transformaci&#243;n del r&#233;gimen de aguas del r&#237;o Papagayo, que tendr&#237;a 
efectos considerables sobre la vida de alrededor de 25.000 personas que habitan en la regi&#243;n 
afectada. Es seguro que esta transformaci&#243;n tendr&#237;a consecuencias a mediano y largo plazo sobre 
el desarrollo econ&#243;mico y social de toda la zona. En septiembre de 2007, durante la visita de los 
Relatores Especiales, una juez de distrito con sede en Guerrero, concedi&#243; un amparo al Centro 
mexicano de Derecho Ambiental en nombre de las comunidades de la zona, mientras se resuelve 
por la v&#237;a judicial el asunto de la falta de un estudio completo de impacto ambiental y la supuesta 
inconsistencia de la obra de La Parota con la legislaci&#243;n nacional en materia de aguas y medio 
ambiente. Mientras se lleva adelante el juicio, la juez inst&#243; a la CFE suspender toda actividad en 
la regi&#243;n afectada. 
</p>
<p>80. Independientemente del objetivo principal del Proyecto, que es el de generar energ&#237;a 
el&#233;ctrica, un desarrollo regional de tal magnitud tendr&#237;a que hacerse con la plena participaci&#243;n y 
en beneficio de la poblaci&#243;n local como indican las normas internacionales. Nada de esto ha sido 
planteado hasta ahora abiertamente a la poblaci&#243;n afectada, y ni las autoridades federales ni las 
estatales informaron a los Relatores Especiales de proyectos alternativos bajo consideraci&#243;n. Se 
mencionan, eso s&#237;, en t&#233;rminos generales los posibles beneficios que obtendr&#237;a la poblaci&#243;n de 
nuevas actividades econ&#243;micas como ser&#237;an la pesca y el ecoturismo, o la producci&#243;n y 
comercializaci&#243;n de v&#237;veres para alimentar a la creciente poblaci&#243;n del polo tur&#237;stico de 
Acapulco y Punta Diamante. Pero la CFE parece subestimar las complejidades y la problem&#225;tica 
asociadas a una profunda transformaci&#243;n de la vida econ&#243;mica y social de las comunidades que 
implicar&#237;a este megaproyecto regional. 
</p>
<p><b>Marco institucional 
</b></p>
<p>81. Una cuesti&#243;n que ha llamado la atenci&#243;n de los Relatores Especiales se relaciona con el 
entramado institucional que se ha desarrollado en torno al Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota. 
Aunque la CFE tiene como principal objetivo la generaci&#243;n de electricidad para satisfacer las 
necesidades del pa&#237;s, en este caso concreto ha tenido que asumir competencias y facultades que 
rebasan por mucho su objetivo fundamental. En su visita, los Relatores Especiales pudieron 
constatar que la CFE ten&#237;a que ocuparse de asuntos de vivienda, salud, trabajo, agricultura, 
comunicaciones y transportes, o medio ambiente, entre otros. La preocupaci&#243;n de los Relatores 
Especiales al respecto se dirige a la falta de presencia o de coordinaci&#243;n con las dependencias del 
Gobierno Federal responsables de estos temas, as&#237; como con la cuesti&#243;n de si debido a su propia 
naturaleza institucional la CFE cuenta con el mandato, las capacidades y experiencia para asumir 
la responsabilidad en estos temas. Por otra parte, tambi&#233;n llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n de los Relatores 
Especiales la aparente falta de participaci&#243;n de otros organismos que, por raz&#243;n del posible 
impacto el Proyecto, deber&#237;an de acompa&#241;ar el proceso, como son la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los 
Derechos Humanos, la Comisi&#243;n de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos del Estado de Guerrero o 
la Comisi&#243;n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas. 
</p>
<p><b>Consideraciones generales sobre los proyectos de desarrollo que implican el 
desplazamiento de personas 
</b></p>
<p>82. Tanto el Gobierno del Estado de Guerrero como la CFE consideran al Proyecto 
Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota no s&#243;lo como un centro generador de electricidad, sino tambi&#233;n como 
un catalizador de desarrollo econ&#243;mico en una de las regiones m&#225;s pobres de M&#233;xico. Aunque </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>no se pone en duda que la eventual realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto puede constituir un importante foco 
de atracci&#243;n para la inversi&#243;n econ&#243;mica el tema central que los Relatores Especiales desean 
subrayar es si megaproyectos de desarrollo de este tipo realmente constituyen la mejor estrategia 
para alcanzar un desarrollo regional y, as&#237;, mejorar la vida de las comunidades desde una 
perspectiva de derechos humanos. Uno de los principios fundamentales de la Declaraci&#243;n sobre 
el derecho al desarrollo, de 4 de diciembre de 1986, es que la persona es el sujeto central del 
desarrollo y que, por lo tanto, debe ser el participante activo y el principal beneficiario de &#233;l. De 
manera m&#225;s espec&#237;fica, el Convenio N&#186; 169 de la OIT y la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas 
sobre los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas reconocen el derecho de los pueblos ind&#237;genas a 
determinar y elaborar prioridades y estrategias para el ejercicio de su derecho al desarrollo. En 
t&#233;rminos pr&#225;cticos esto implica que el tipo de desarrollo que debe ser promovido por los Estados 
debe respetar y promover los derechos humanos de las personas en una forma equitativa. Por 
otra parte, los Estados que se han comprometido a respetar los est&#225;ndares internacionales de 
derechos humanos no pueden imponer a las comunidades y pueblos ind&#237;genas sus propios 
conceptos y estrategias de desarrollo, sino que, de manera conjunta, deben buscar las estrategias 
y alternativas que de mejor manera puedan promover el desarrollo regional de la zona de acuerdo 
a las propias prioridades establecidas por las personas ind&#237;genas. Seg&#250;n informaci&#243;n del 
CONAPO, las comunidades que habitan la zona afectada por la realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto 
Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota se encuentran en un contexto de alta a muy alta marginaci&#243;n. Esta 
realidad no debe considerarse como una justificaci&#243;n para llevar a cabo este tipo de proyectos de 
desarrollo. Por el contrario, se trata de una se&#241;al para asegurarse que este tipo de proyectos no 
traer&#225; como consecuencias indirectas graves violaciones a los derechos humanos. Esta 
preocupaci&#243;n es producto de estudios recientes realizados a nivel mundial, como el Informe final 
de la Comisi&#243;n Mundial de Presas de 2000, que han demostrado que generalmente los costos 
sociales y ambientales de las presas los asumen en mayor medida las comunidades directamente 
afectadas, mientras que los beneficios son para otros sectores de la poblaci&#243;n del pa&#237;s que se 
encuentran en mejores condiciones socioecon&#243;micas. Los impactos negativos suelen ser a&#250;n m&#225;s 
dr&#225;sticos en aquellas personas que sufren de un contexto de discriminaci&#243;n en sus sociedades, 
tales como las mujeres, los adultos mayores, las personas discapacitadas y las personas 
ind&#237;genas. Sin duda la construcci&#243;n del proyecto hidroel&#233;ctrico generar&#237;a miles de empleos 
directos temporales y actividades secundarias durante un tiempo limitado. La derrama financiera 
(se habla de centenares de millones de d&#243;lares de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica durante unos 
cinco a&#241;os) atraer&#237;a a la zona a muchas personas de distintas partes del pa&#237;s. Este fen&#243;meno tiene 
tendencia a generar presiones inflacionarias considerables, como lo demuestra la experiencia en 
otras partes del mundo, lo que a su vez acelera la desigualdad social y la marginaci&#243;n de una 
buena parte de la poblaci&#243;n. A menos que se prevean a tiempo las medidas para mitigar estos 
efectos, el resultado de este proceso sobre la vida de las personas y la estabilidad de las 
comunidades ser&#237;a muy preocupante. Los Relatores Especiales no tuvieron constancia de que 
estas consideraciones hayan sido tomadas en cuenta en las decisiones en torno al Proyecto. Lo 
anterior los lleva a subrayar la necesidad que perciben de que en M&#233;xico se inicie un proceso 
m&#225;s amplio de discusi&#243;n acerca de las mejores estrategias para promover el desarrollo humano 
equitativo y sustentable, y en las que se considere tambi&#233;n la importancia que a nivel mundial 
est&#225;n tomando diversos proyectos de desarrollo regional a peque&#241;a escala y en el que las propias 
comunidades pueden seguir conservando y gestionando sus recursos naturales. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Recomendaciones 
</b></p>
<p>83. En base a las anteriores consideraciones, los Relatores Especiales solicitan al Gobierno de 
M&#233;xico que hasta no haber satisfecho plenamente las cuestiones que aqu&#237; se han abordado y 
haberse dado todas las garant&#237;as de que los derechos humanos de las personas afectadas ser&#225;n 
respetados, y haberse analizado seriamente todas las alternativas posibles, se suspendan los 
trabajos de realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota. Parte del conflicto y la tensi&#243;n 
generada entre las comunidades se debe al vac&#237;o legislativo relacionado con los mecanismos para 
hacer efectivo el derecho a la consulta de las comunidades afectadas. Por ello se acudi&#243; a otras 
figuras jur&#237;dicas supletorias que, al no adecuarse estrictamente a la naturaleza y fines del derecho 
a la consulta, generaron mayores inconformidades y disputas jur&#237;dicas. En este sentido, 
quisi&#233;ramos destacar la necesidad de reglamentar el derecho a la consulta que se encuentra 
reconocido en el art&#237;culo 6 del Convenio N.&#186; 169 de la OIT, y en los art&#237;culos 18 y 19 de la 
Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas; el derecho a no 
ser desplazados forzosamente, regulado en el art&#237;culo 16 del Convenio y en el art&#237;culo 10 de la 
Declaraci&#243;n; as&#237; como los diversos aspectos recogidos en el art&#237;culo 2 de la Constituci&#243;n 
mexicana en relaci&#243;n con los pueblos y comunidades ind&#237;genas. Los Relatores Especiales 
tambi&#233;n consideran necesario que el Gobierno mexicano cuente con una pol&#237;tica exhaustiva 
sobre el tema de los posibles desalojos con motivo de proyectos de desarrollo que se adecue a los 
est&#225;ndares internacionales que se han asumido a nivel internacional en materia de derechos 
humanos. Actualmente las comunidades que viven en la regi&#243;n se encuentran divididas y 
enfrentadas por causa de la construcci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota. Hemos podido 
constatar que en ocasiones la agresi&#243;n verbal y la descalificaci&#243;n mutua entre los grupos 
polarizados generan niveles peligrosos de tensi&#243;n y conflictividad social. Los Relatores 
Especiales consideran que independientemente de la suspensi&#243;n de la realizaci&#243;n del Proyecto es 
necesario promover un proceso de di&#225;logo y reconciliaci&#243;n entre las comunidades. A este 
respecto, agradecen la confianza que les ha expresado el Gobernador del Estado de Guerrero al 
solicitar sus buenos oficios para facilitar espacios de di&#225;logo entre las comunidades, propuesta a 
la que estamos dispuestos a dar seguimiento en consulta con las autoridades mexicanas 
correspondientes y la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos 
Humanos. Finalmente, los Relatores Especiales quieren destacar la urgencia de fortalecer los 
programas de desarrollo social y humano en la zona. Llama la atenci&#243;n de los Relatores 
Especiales el que a menos de 50 kil&#243;metros del desarrollo tur&#237;stico de Acapulco y Punta 
Diamante se pueda encontrar una zona con niveles de marginaci&#243;n tan altos. Aunque los 
Relatores Especiales sean concientes de las m&#250;ltiples necesidades que tiene el Estado de 
Guerrero y los problemas presupuestarios que enfrenta para promover el desarrollo en distintas 
regiones, consideran que el Estado mexicano tiene la responsabilidad de asegurar las condiciones 
y tomar las medidas necesarias para ampliar las oportunidades de desarrollo de las personas y las 
comunidades que viven en la regi&#243;n fortaleciendo el acceso y disfrute de sus derechos humanos, 
en especial, de sus derechos econ&#243;micos, sociales y culturales.&#8221;

<p><b>Comentarios y observaciones del Gobierno de M&#233;xico en torno al documento  
&#8220;Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones en materia de derechos humanos  
                              del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de la Parota&#8221;                                
</b></p>
<p>85. M&#233;xico mantiene una pol&#237;tica de apertura y cooperaci&#243;n con los &#243;rganos y mecanismos 
internacionales de derechos humanos. En el marco de dicha pol&#237;tica y con motivo de la visita 
relativa al Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota, el Gobierno de M&#233;xico organiz&#243; las diversas 
entrevistas que sostuvieron el Relator Especial sobre una vivienda adecuada como elemento 
integrante del derecho a un nivel de vida adecuado y el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas con las autoridades federales y 
estatales competentes; otorg&#243; las facilidades necesarias para visitar el sitio del Proyecto; y 
entreg&#243; a los Relatores Especiales informaci&#243;n amplia y completa sobre los distintos aspectos del 
mismo.  
</p>
<p>86. El Gobierno de M&#233;xico coincide con los Relatores Especiales en que los grandes proyectos 
de desarrollo requieren ser estudiados desde diversas perspectivas y valorados en toda su 
complejidad y que dichos proyectos deben partir del respeto a los derechos humanos de las 
personas que de una u otra forma resulten afectadas.  
</p>
<p>87. En el caso particular del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota, la CFE inici&#243; a mediados de la 
d&#233;cada de los ochenta los primeros estudios de campo y an&#225;lisis preliminares de ingenier&#237;a, para 
determinar su viabilidad t&#233;cnica y econ&#243;mica. No obstante, no fue sino hasta el a&#241;o 2002 cuando 
se determin&#243; que el Proyecto era prioritario para el Sistema El&#233;ctrico Nacional, ello, debido a su 
cercan&#237;a a la zona central del pa&#237;s, la de m&#225;xima demanda, y por ser una fuente de energ&#237;a 
limpia; en consecuencia se incluy&#243; en el Programa de Obras e Inversiones del Sector El&#233;ctrico. 
Esta situaci&#243;n origin&#243; la necesidad de complementar algunos estudios t&#233;cnicos faltantes para 
integrar la ingenier&#237;a de licitaci&#243;n pero, particularmente, los correspondientes al impacto 
ambiental, de acuerdo con la Ley General del Equilibrio Ecol&#243;gico y la Protecci&#243;n al Ambiente 
(LGEEPA) as&#237; como la evaluaci&#243;n de impacto social.  
</p>
<p>88. En ese mismo a&#241;o (2002), se llevaron a cabo las primeras reuniones formales con diversas 
autoridades estatales y municipales y se visitaron algunas comunidades del &#225;rea de influencia del 
Proyecto, todo ello, con la finalidad de informar acerca de su posible construcci&#243;n y solicitar los 
permisos para poder realizar los estudios. Es preciso destacar que en todos los casos se 
obtuvieron las anuencias de las autoridades y de la poblaci&#243;n para estas actividades. Tambi&#233;n 
cabe se&#241;alar que aunque al interior de la CFE estuviera definido el inter&#233;s por realizar el 
Proyecto, son las autoridades competentes del &#225;mbito federal y estatal las que expiden los 
permisos necesarios para la construcci&#243;n y para ello se requieren muchos estudios y trabajos 
espec&#237;ficos que permitan integrar los expedientes que sustentan las solicitudes respectivas.  
</p>
<p>89. Los estudios de impacto ambiental iniciaron a principios del a&#241;o 2003 y fueron realizados 
por la Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico (UNAM) a trav&#233;s del Programa Universitario 
del Medio Ambiente (PUMA). En su momento, se solicit&#243; la participaci&#243;n de esta prestigiada </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 55 
 
</p>
<p>instituci&#243;n con la finalidad de asegurar la calidad de los estudios y para que los grupos de inter&#233;s 
de la sociedad mexicana tuvieran la plena seguridad de la total imparcialidad de los mismos. 
Empero, este estudio ha sido descalificado por los grupos opositores, los cuales nunca aportaron 
elementos t&#233;cnicos que hayan sustentado sus cr&#237;ticas. De conformidad con la LGEEPA, la 
Manifestaci&#243;n de Impacto Ambiental del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota fue presentada a la 
Secretar&#237;a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, dependencia que dict&#243; a finales de 2004 el 
Resolutivo favorable mediando 14 t&#233;rminos, 11 condiciones y cuatro recomendaciones. Dichos 
estudios fueron sometidos al procedimiento de evaluaci&#243;n por parte de la Secretar&#237;a de Medio 
Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT), realiz&#225;ndose una reuni&#243;n p&#250;blica de 
informaci&#243;n el 24 de agosto del 2004, con la participaci&#243;n de los diversos actores interesados en 
el proyecto.  
</p>
<p>90. En el mes de julio de 2003, un grupo opositor de uno de los 19 n&#250;cleos agrarios implicados 
en el Proyecto bloque&#243; el acceso al sitio de la cortina al personal encargado de los estudios. 
Desde entonces, este grupo se ha negado a establecer un di&#225;logo constructivo y respetuoso con la 
CFE, a partir del cual pudieron haberse implementado los mecanismos que aseguraran que todas 
las comunidades de los Bienes Comunales de Cacahuatepec involucradas tuvieran el acceso a la 
informaci&#243;n veraz y objetiva del proyecto, tal y como se hizo en el resto de los n&#250;cleos agrarios, 
salvo el de Colonia Guerrero, y con base en ello decidir libremente respecto a aceptarlo o 
rechazarlo, tal y como lo han se&#241;alado los Relatores Especiales.  
</p>
<p>91. Es un compromiso del Gobierno mexicano en general y en particular de la CFE impulsar 
los proyectos de infraestructura en un marco de sustentabilidad, raz&#243;n por la cual para el 
desarrollo del Proyecto se ha planteado la importancia de realizar las acciones necesarias para 
generar oportunidades para mejorar la calidad de vida de la poblaci&#243;n involucrada y para 
conservar y recuperar la calidad ambiental y los recursos naturales. Es decir, el proyecto es 
concebido no tan s&#243;lo como generador de energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica sino tambi&#233;n como detonador del 
desarrollo aprovechando su efecto multiplicador. En este sentido, durante el desarrollo de los 
estudios encargados a la UNAM, se observ&#243; la necesidad de realizar esfuerzos adicionales para 
atender adem&#225;s de la variable ambiental los aspectos sociales, toda vez que el grueso de la 
poblaci&#243;n que se asienta en el &#225;rea de influencia se encuentra en situaci&#243;n de pobreza extrema, 
tal y como lo indican los &#237;ndices de marginalidad del CONAPO en sus &#250;ltimos informes. Para 
ello, se definieron con especialistas de la Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Guerrero los alcances para 
elaborar el Plan de Desarrollo Integral, involucrando, entre otros aspectos, los temas 
relacionados con la reubicaci&#243;n de los nuevos poblados y la restituci&#243;n de actividades 
productivas para garantizar los derechos a la vivienda adecuada, a la alimentaci&#243;n, al agua, a la 
salud, a la educaci&#243;n, al trabajo, a la tierra, a la seguridad, a la incorporaci&#243;n de las mujeres y los 
j&#243;venes y a la conservaci&#243;n del medio ambiente. En general, lo que se pretende es que durante el 
per&#237;odo de construcci&#243;n de la cortina, se vayan creando las condiciones para que sean los 
habitantes de la zona los primeros beneficiados y quienes aprovechen las nuevas condiciones que 
se crear&#225;n. Para concretar tal propuesta se pusieron en marcha proyectos productivos 
demostrativos, se capacit&#243; en oficios que requerir&#225; la construcci&#243;n de la presa (mec&#225;nica, 
electricidad, alba&#241;iler&#237;a carpinter&#237;a) as&#237; como en aquellos que pueden tener una gran demanda 
(cocina, corte y confecci&#243;n, peluquer&#237;a) por la cantidad de trabajadores que se concentrar&#225;n en la 
obra.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>92. El Plan de Desarrollo Integral ha implicado un intenso trabajo con las comunidades para 
alcanzar su definici&#243;n, logrando finalmente la participaci&#243;n de la gran mayor&#237;a de los habitantes, 
incluyendo a ni&#241;os, mujeres y adultos mayores. En particular, se ha incorporado a la poblaci&#243;n 
en todas las etapas de definici&#243;n de dise&#241;o de viviendas, poblados, proyectos productivos, 
formas de organizaci&#243;n y participaci&#243;n de la comunidad, actividades de recuperaci&#243;n y 
conservaci&#243;n del medio ambiente. Por ello ha requerido de mayor tiempo del originalmente 
previsto. Conviene volver a destacar que s&#243;lo en dos comunidades, Arroyo Verde y Colonia 
Guerrero, este esfuerzo no ha podido fructificar en virtud del rechazo intolerante hacia las 
acciones emprendidas por la CFE.  
</p>
<p>93. El Plan de Desarrollo Integral, en su versi&#243;n regional, ha sido presentado al Gobierno del 
Estado adem&#225;s de siete planes para igual n&#250;mero de localidades que ser&#225;n reubicadas, ello para 
establecer estrategias conjuntas e involucrar a las dem&#225;s dependencias federales y municipales 
que act&#250;an en la zona de influencia. Tambi&#233;n se tiene considerada su presentaci&#243;n y discusi&#243;n en 
amplios foros democr&#225;ticos de participaci&#243;n ciudadana. Debe subrayarse que la CFE y las 
autoridades estatales respectivas siempre han insistido en que el proyecto s&#243;lo se llevar&#225; a cabo 
si las comunidades as&#237; lo deciden, con pleno ejercicio democr&#225;tico de sus libertades. Debido a la 
complejidad del proyecto, a&#250;n no hemos logrado la aceptaci&#243;n del total de las comunidades 
involucradas, pero se continuar&#225; con esta labor hasta lograr que el proyecto sea aceptado por 
todas ellas.  
</p>
<p>94. Cabe destacar que las propuestas contenidas en el Plan de Desarrollo Integral han tomado 
en cuenta las recomendaciones que han realizado diversos organismos internacionales para la 
ejecuci&#243;n de este tipo de proyectos, incluyendo la Comisi&#243;n Mundial de Presas, el Banco 
Mundial, la Comisi&#243;n Econ&#243;mica para Am&#233;rica Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL), los objetivos de 
desarrollo del Milenio, la OIT y las experiencias de reubicados por construcci&#243;n de presas en 
M&#233;xico, as&#237; como aspectos de presupuesto participativo, sobre todo en lo relativo a la 
conformaci&#243;n de Consejos de Desarrollo Comunitario, toda vez que ello garantizar&#237;a una 
permanente participaci&#243;n de los habitantes durante las distintas fases que implicar&#225; el proceso de 
construcci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, el citado Plan se orienta a la posibilidad de optimizar los recursos 
p&#250;blicos en los diferentes niveles de Gobierno, necesarios para abatir problemas como la pobreza 
extrema y los problemas de marginaci&#243;n existentes en la zona, a fin de establecer las bases 
encaminadas a lograr un desarrollo sustentable.  
</p>
<p>95. De los estudios existentes a la fecha se desprende que de las 14.200 hect&#225;reas de tierra que 
ser&#225;n inundadas, s&#243;lo son utilizadas aproximadamente 2.800 hect&#225;reas, toda vez que son terrenos 
con pendientes superiores a los 35 grados lo cual hace pr&#225;cticamente imposible su uso. En la 
zona del embalse, de acuerdo al censo de poblaci&#243;n y vivienda 2000 y al conteo 2005, as&#237; como 
a los censos realizados por la Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Guerrero, el n&#250;mero de personas que 
ser&#237;an reubicadas es de 3.095, distribuidas en 14 localidades. Otro resultado relevante de los 
estudios, es que debido a las condiciones naturales de la regi&#243;n y la forma en que son utilizados 
los recursos naturales por la poblaci&#243;n, se ha producido una degradaci&#243;n y p&#233;rdida de los 
recursos, en especial del suelo y la biodiversidad, sin que los habitantes logren satisfacer sus 
necesidades.  
</p>
<p>96. Se ha puesto especial atenci&#243;n en que las reubicaciones no impliquen transformaciones 
radicales de la forma de vida de las personas que ser&#225;n reubicadas, as&#237; como de aqu&#233;llas que de 
una u otra forma sufrir&#225;n alg&#250;n tipo de afectaci&#243;n. A la fecha, se tienen determinadas 11 de </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 57 
 
</p>
<p>las 14 localidades que ser&#225;n reubicadas y se cuenta con actas de validaci&#243;n de las asambleas 
generales de dichas localidades. Cabe se&#241;alar que los sitios propuestos no est&#225;n a m&#225;s de 
un kil&#243;metro de donde actualmente se encuentran; algunas s&#243;lo se mover&#237;an 50 metros. Los 
sitios de reubicaci&#243;n fueron propuestos por los propios habitantes y despu&#233;s sometidos a una 
rigurosa evaluaci&#243;n por parte de la Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Guerrero, para despu&#233;s de hacer la 
evaluaci&#243;n, volverlos a someter a reconsideraci&#243;n por parte de la Asamblea, momento en el cual 
se determina el sitio de reubicaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>97. Para el adecuado seguimiento del Plan de Desarrollo Integral, el Gobierno del Estado de 
Guerrero ha propuesto la creaci&#243;n del Consejo de Desarrollo para el &#225;rea de influencia del 
Proyecto, el cual se integrar&#237;a por representantes de los distintos consejos de desarrollo 
comunitario que se conformar&#225;n en cada comunidad del &#225;rea de influencia, adem&#225;s de los 
representantes de cada dependencia federal, estatal y municipal. Dicho consejo ser&#237;a el &#243;rgano de 
decisi&#243;n del conjunto de programas y proyectos que se tengan contemplados para el &#225;rea de 
influencia y que posibiliten alcanzar los objetivos del Plan de Desarrollo Integral.  
</p><p>98. Cabe aclarar que la CFE no ha iniciado el proceso de licitaci&#243;n, ni ning&#250;n trabajo 
constructivo de la presa. Los &#250;nicos trabajos realizados en el &#225;rea de influencia se han restringido 
a estudios e informaci&#243;n requerida para diversos tr&#225;mites de autorizaci&#243;n, as&#237; como para concluir 
los dise&#241;os de ingenier&#237;a. Aunque se han llevado a cabo algunas obras de desarrollo social en las 
comunidades, a petici&#243;n expresa de las autoridades y pobladores, no ha mediado para ello el 
requerimiento de apoyos o acuerdos favorables hacia el Proyecto a cambio de las obras 
realizadas.  
</p>
<p>99. El gobierno de M&#233;xico coincide plenamente en la necesidad de promover un clima de 
conciliaci&#243;n entre los habitantes del &#225;rea de influencia del Proyecto, condici&#243;n fundamental para 
el desarrollo de toda el &#225;rea. Las diferencias se han dirimido por los cauces legales pertinentes, 
mientras que el Gobierno, tanto federal como local, trabaja responsablemente para encontrar las 
coincidencias, en un marco de respeto a las decisiones de las mayor&#237;as.  
</p>
<p>100. El Gobierno de M&#233;xico quiere agradecer a los Relatores Especiales el inter&#233;s que han 
mostrado en el tema de los derechos humanos de los habitantes de la regi&#243;n donde se ubica el 
Proyecto y las reflexiones que han tenido a bien compartirle. Todas ellas son de gran utilidad 
para que las autoridades competentes complementen el estudio de impacto social y con ello 
mejorar las pr&#225;cticas de informaci&#243;n y discusi&#243;n del Plan de Desarrollo Integral en las 
comunidades. 
</p>
<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n enviada 
</b></p>
<p>101. El 16 de noviembre de 2007, el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y el Relator 
Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n, envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n con respecto a la 
situaci&#243;n de la comunidad huichola (wix&#225;rika) de Bancos de San Hip&#243;lito, en el Municipio de 
Mezquital, Estado de Durango. La situaci&#243;n del pueblo huichol (wix&#225;rika) fue referida en el 
informe sobre la visita a M&#233;xico del Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas en 2003, como uno de los casos m&#225;s destacados 
de comunidades ind&#237;genas que &#8220;no poseen seguridad jur&#237;dica en cuanto a la tenencia de la tierra, 
por la lentitud y la corrupci&#243;n que ha caracterizado a los tr&#225;mites agrarios, as&#237; como los intereses </p>

</p>
<p>de diversos particulares&#8221; (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.2, p&#225;rr. 20). La situaci&#243;n del derecho a la tierra 
de las comunidades huicholas (wix&#225;rika) fue asimismo objeto de una reclamaci&#243;n ante el 
Consejo de Administraci&#243;n de la Oficina Internacional del Trabajo en virtud del art&#237;culo 24 de la 
Constituci&#243;n de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional del Trabajo, en la que se alegaba la violaci&#243;n por 
M&#233;xico de las disposiciones del Convenio N.&#186; 169 sobre pueblos ind&#237;genas y tribales en pa&#237;ses 
independientes (GB.272/7/2). De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida la comunidad de Bancos 
de San Hip&#243;lito es una comunidad wix&#225;rika que se encuentra ubicada en el Municipio de 
Mezquital, en el Estado de Durango. Desde tiempos inmemoriales, la comunidad de San Hip&#243;lito 
form&#243; parte de la misma unidad territorial de la vecina comunidad de San Andr&#233;s Cohamiata. 
Las tierras de ambas comunidades fueron reconocidas en un t&#237;tulo virreinal otorgado por la 
Corona Espa&#241;ola en 1725. Sin embargo, seg&#250;n se informa, tras el procedimiento de confirmaci&#243;n 
y titulaci&#243;n de bienes comunales de San Andr&#233;s Cohamiata, Bancos de San Hip&#243;lito qued&#243; 
segregado y sin reconocimiento sobre su territorio, el cual fue otorgado a un n&#250;cleo de poblaci&#243;n 
formado por colonos mestizos, San Lucas de Jalpa, por Resoluci&#243;n Presidencial de 28 de julio de 
1981, posteriormente confirmada por acta de posesi&#243;n y deslinde de 28 de julio de 1981. San 
Lucas de Jalpa, que carecer&#237;a de presencia ancestral en el territorio, habr&#237;a asumido desde 
entonces tanto la titularidad de las tierras como la representaci&#243;n agraria de Bancos de San 
Hip&#243;lito. A pesar de esta situaci&#243;n irregular, la comunidad ind&#237;gena de Bancos continuar&#237;a 
usando sus tierras tradicionales, de conformidad con su derecho consuetudinario, usos y 
costumbres, en un &#225;rea aproximada de 10.720 hect&#225;reas, que se encuentran dentro de las tierras 
formalmente reconocidas a San Lucas de Jalpa. En dicha &#225;rea, seg&#250;n los informes, los miembros 
de la comunidad de Bancos practican todav&#237;a la agricultura rotativa, de acuerdo con criterio de 
pertenencia a linajes familiares tradicionales. Dicha actividad agr&#237;cola procura a esta comunidad 
acceso a los alimentos necesarios para su subsistencia y est&#225; &#237;ntimamente vinculada con 
ceremonias y ofrendas en lugares sagrados, que se considera que refuerzan las relaciones 
rec&#237;procas con el mundo natural y con sus ancestros. Existir&#237;a una correlaci&#243;n entre los centros 
ceremoniales, los lugares sagrados y el n&#250;mero de rancher&#237;as, cuyo gran n&#250;mero y dispersi&#243;n 
ser&#237;an la consecuencia de la topograf&#237;a accidentada, de la escasez del agua y de la dispersi&#243;n de 
la agricultura itinerante. Desde 1968, las autoridades de Bancos habr&#237;an emprendido una serie de 
acciones legales ante las autoridades mexicanas para lograr el reconocimiento formal de sus

<p>104. On 4 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the 
Independent Expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people 
concerning indigenous and minority population, located around the Royal Chitwan National Park 
(RCNP), in Nawalparasi District, gazetted in 1973 and declared a World Heritage Site by the 
United National Education and Science Organization (UNESCO) in 1984. According to the 
information received the Ramandar settlement in Makawanpur District, Manahari, where there 
are approximately 1,200 households, is mostly composed of Tamang and Chepang (Tsepeng) 
indigenous communities and Dalits. According to this information, these families were resettled 
in 2002 in this area as a result of displacement caused by floods and landslides. It is reported that 
the new settlement area for the above communities provides space for housing but does not have 
adequate areas for food cultivation. Due to the public policy introduced in 1995 whereby forests 
are attributed to the responsibility of certain communities, the inhabitants of the Ramandar 
settlement are no longer able to access the nearby forests of Manakama and Churia Regia, which, 
for example, have been put at the disposal of the Pashupati/Manakamana and Babargunj 
communities respectively. It is also reported that, despite the presence of several tube wells 
within walking distance, the residents of the Ramandar settlement are denied access to the wells 
and must obtain its water from a nearby stream where the water is reportedly murky and dark. 
The primary source of food is a type of root (tarrow) which is obtained by digging down to a 
depth of approximately five feet; this root is boiled and mashed, sometimes mixed with rice if 
available and salt. It is reported that the community is often able to eat this meal two times a day </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>but often they have enough for one meal per day. Although some find work as agricultural 
labourers, this work appears to be unreliable and available for two or three months per year. It is 
reported that the men earn Rs.100 per day ($1.50 CDN) and the women earn half that amount, 
which is less than the prescribed minimum wage. This situation seems to be exacerbated by the 
lack of participation by Ramandar settlers in local resource benefit sharing schemes and limits 
their ability to qualify as agrarian reform beneficiaries further limiting their ability to access 
sufficient food. Concern has been expressed that the residents of the Ramandar settlement, and 
particularly children, could face risk of starvation during the monsoon period due to the extreme 
poverty, marginalisation and chronic food insecurity they have suffered. According to the 
information received there have been inadequate responses from local authorities and no 
government representatives or aid agencies has evaluated the situation nor had any emergency 
food aid been received. In addition concerns are expressed with regard to the situation of the 
Piprahar indigenous community (Majhi-fisherman and Bote-boatman) who has lived for decades 
as fishers on the vicinities of RCNP. The community&#8217;s primary source of food was traditionally 
the fish caught in the Narayani River, supplemented by fruits, yams, roots and vegetable 
gathered from the nearby forest, and with cash earned from work as ferryman and panning for 
gold in the river sands. It is alleged that these means of securing adequate food for the 
community were lost with the establishment of RCNP. According to the allegations received, 
RCNP has a mandate to protect and breed crocodiles, which require abundant amounts of fish to 
survive and, to this end, the park&#8217;s authorities declared a ban on fishing in the Narayani River, 
thus limiting the Piprahar community&#8217;s traditional fishing practices. It appears that the Piprahar 
community has now only access to fishing in the tributary streams, which does seem to provide a 
sufficient amount of fish to fulfil their dietary requirements. It also appears that additional 
restrictions on the size of fishing nets were introduced, and that in some cases fishing nets of 
these communities were burnt by the authorities. Families caught fishing in the river and 
collecting vegetables in the nearby forest experienced beatings and fines. The problems seems to 
be exacerbated by a downstream dam located across the border inside India, which reportedly 
blocks the natural migration of fish during the winter and sweeps them away during the annual 
monsoon season, thereby further decreasing fish stock levels, as well as by the establishment of a 
paper mill and a brewery located upstream on the bank of the river, which have been releasing 
waste directly into the river killing fish and further decreasing the amount and size of fish 
available. In addition, it is reported that the traditional means of supplementing have also been 
lost, including the prohibition of gold-panning and that, while some members of the community 
have been able to adapt to new means of livelihoods such as porters, labourers and workers in 
agricultural fields, others who try to derive their livelihoods from their traditional economies are 
unable to access sufficient and adequate food. Following the information received the buffer 
zone benefits under the park&#8217;s benefit-sharing schemes do not accrue to community members, 
partly because they do not participate in user committees and partly because the benefit-sharing 
projects are irrelevant to the community&#8217;s needs. Finally, the situation of the Pripahar 
community seems to have deteriorated as a result of the displacement of the community due to 
the flooding of late 2006, which have forced them to abandon their settlement on the river banks 
and resettle in the nearby highlands in extremely poor and temporary conditions, and they have 
reportedly received no appropriate humanitarian assistance. </p>

<p>106. On 11 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning two 
evictions in Manila, one scheduled for October 15 and the other presumably after the end of 
Ramadan. According to the information received the first threatened eviction concerned a group 
of slum dwellers residing along an &#8220;estero&#8221; (canal) called Tripa de Gallena Estero in Pasay, in 
the Manila local districts Barangay 43 and 46. According to this information, on 19 August 2007 
the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, together with security officials, destroyed 
extensive properties and dwellings in Barangay 46. As a consequence, the majority of the almost 
150 affected families remained in situ, in extremely precarious living conditions. Following the 
information received, this eviction would have affected an additional 148 families in 
Barangay 43. Following the threats of eviction, these families proposed to be resettled in the 
neighbouring municipality of Montalban which appears to be willing and able to accommodate 
their request. At the time of sending the urgent appeal this proposal appeared to be blocked at the 
level of the Home Guarantee Corporation, an institution under the National Housing and 
Development Authority (HUDCC).Following the information received the second eviction 
would have affected the Mosque community, located in Pasay, district of Manila. These people 
have reportedly been living on a plot of reclaimed land since 1992. Evictions of this community 
allegedly began in 1999, but the eviction actions increased consistently during 2007. Allegedly 
there are plans for developing this area with malls and a casino. Following the information 
received, in January 2007, four people belonging to this community were shot during a raid by 
security authorities and three of them apparently died later. It is also reported that at the time of 
sending the urgent appeal any criminal investigation would have been undertaken nor any 
disciplinary proceedings against the perpetrators. It has also been alleged that in June 2007 
authorities ordered the &#8220;voluntary demolition&#8221; of 700 houses, and shut down the main access 
road. In addition, they would have surrounded part of the Mosque area, including the path 
leading to the local school and disconnected water and electricity. An application for mobile 
water provision was rejected by authorities, who justified the decision with the fact of the closed 
access road. As a result, there have reportedly been seven cases of malaria among the children 
living there, as well as instances of heat exhaustion. Moreover around thirty children would have 
been withdrawn from school, due to the fact that the route providing access to it is now very 
long. Following last June eviction, around half of the community appears to have left and taken 
up rental accommodation in the area, but the rest stayed and set up shanty accommodations 
around the walls of the mosque. According to the information received there are 376 families 
living in the Mosque area and on 15 October 2007 a court should have reviewed a temporary 
injunction against further evictions and deciding whether to extend it or not. Allegedly, the 
above mentioned families have not been offered alternative accommodation and it also appears 
that in the view of the relevant authorities they should go back to Mindanao, where they are 
from. </p>

<p>108. On 30 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the 
KwaZulu-Natal Elimination and Prevention of Re-emergence of Slums Bill, 2006. According to 
the information received, the Provincial Bill was recently approved by the KwaZulu-Natal 
Legislature and is currently awaiting signature by the KwaZulu-Natal Premier to enter into force. 
The Special Rapporteur has been informed that certain provisions of the Bill may contradict both 
international obligations on the prohibition of forced evictions and human rights guaranteed by 
the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, in particular section 26(1), 26(2), 26(3) and 
28(1). The Special Rapporteur notes that the Bill refers to of the &#8220;control and elimination of 
slums&#8221; and focuses on land owners to prevent informal occupation and in cases of existing 
informal occupation to institute eviction procedures. The purported aim of the Bill, however, 
seems to contradict the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from Unlawful Occupation of Land 
Amendment Bill (PIE), which focuses on establishing rights for informal occupiers, and 
protecting them from forceful and undignified eviction. It has been further alleged that the Bill 
does not foresee a comprehensive plan regarding alternative land available which was set out in 
the Constitutional Court decision in the <i>Republic of South Africa v. Grootboom</i> (CCT 11/00) 
case. The formulation of the Bill: &#8220;In the event of a municipality deciding to make available 
alternative land or buildings for the relocation of persons living in a slum...&#8221; seems to suggest 
that the municipality may not have an obligation in this regard. Furthermore, there seems to be 
no requirement for consultation with the persons that would potentially be affected by these 
decisions. This may be in contradiction with the national housing policy &#8220;<i>Breaking New 
Ground</i>&#8221; (2004) which promotes a cooperative and participatory approach to informal settlement 
in-situ upgrade programme. According to information received also other provinces are 
considering the adoption of similar bills. As the Special Rapporteur had to finalize its report 
within two weeks, he would have been grateful if the Government could have provided him with 
information on the position of the Government in regard to this Provincial legislation and 
whether it had been foreseen that the constitutionality of the Bill and its compliance with 
international obligations would have been reviewed. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>109. By letter dated 30 October 2007, the Government replied to the above communication. The 
Government firstly informed the Special Rapporteur that the project of law KwaZulu-Natal 
Elimination and Prevention of Re-emergence of Slums has already been signed into law by the 
Premier, having been assented to on 18 July 2007 and, thereafter, duly published in the 
KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette No.22 (Notice No.4) on 2 August 2007 as the KwaZulu-Natal 
Elimination and Prevention of Re-emergence of Slums. Before responding to the specific queries 
submitted by the Special Rapporteur, the authorities summarized this Act. They indicated that in 
essence, the purpose of the Act is to progressively eliminate &#8220;slums&#8221;, which are defined in </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 63 
 
</p>
<p>section 1 of the Act as:&#8221; overcrowded or squalid land or buildings occupied by predominantly 
indigent or poor persons, without security of tenure and with poor or non-existent infrastructure 
or sanitation, and &#8220;slum conditions&#8221; has a corresponding meaning.&#8221; Amongst the measures 
introduced by the Slums Act to prevent the re-emergence of slums there are: the prohibition of 
unlawful occupation of land or building without the consent of the owner or person in charge 
thereof; the prohibition of sub-standard accommodation to persons for financial benefit; a 
provision which entitles municipalities to order unscrupulous landlords who provide 
sub-standard accommodation to other persons for financial gain to effect the necessary 
improvements or repairs thereto, failing which to institute proceedings for the eviction of the 
occupants thereof; the obligation for any owner or person in charge of vacant land or building to 
take reasonable steps to prevent the unlawful occupation thereof. It was also specified that it was 
deemed necessary to establish the extent of the slum problem throughout the KwaZulu-Natal 
Province before taking the necessary and appropriate steps to address it. Therefore, before the 
programme for the elimination of slums in terms of the Slums Act can commence, each 
Municipality is required to prepare and submit to the MEC a status report containing, inter alia, 
the number of existing slums within its area of jurisdiction, together with its proposed 
programme for the elimination thereof. Thereafter, in order to enable the MEC to monitor the 
progress made by municipalities in their slum elimination programmes, each municipality is 
required to submit to the MEC a progress report for each financial year reflecting, inter alia, the 
steps taken by such municipality in the implementation of its slum elimination programme in 
that financial year, as well as the improvements made in the living conditions of the people 
concerned as a result thereof. The MEC is, in turn, required to report to the KwaZulu-Natal 
Legislature on the progress made by municipalities province-wide in that regard. In relation with 
the possibility that the Act contravenes international and constitutional provisions on forced 
evictions, the authorities indicated that the Act does not contain any provision for the forced 
eviction of slum dwellers. Instead, it specifically provides that any eviction pursuant to its 
provisions must be carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions of the PIE Act, the 
Constitution, and any other national legislation protecting the housing or occupational rights of 
persons. The implementation of the Slums Act will therefore not result in a wholesale or 
apartheid-style eviction of people from informal settlements before alternative land has been 
found or secured for their relocation. In the event of an eviction of people from an informal 
settlement being considered necessary by a municipality in the public interest, such as the need 
to protect life or health of the persons concerned, the Slums Act makes provision for the 
establishment of transit areas by municipalities within their areas of jurisdiction, and also gives 
them the right to expropriate land for that purpose should this become necessary. They further 
informed that &#8220;elimination of slums&#8221; in terms of the Slums Act is to occur progressively and is 
intended to operate alongside the sustainable housing development process embarked upon by 
the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the KwaZulu-Natal Province, in terms of 
the Constitution, the National Housing Act as well as the KwaZulu-Natal Housing Act, No.12 of 
1998 (&#8220;the KZN Housing Act&#8221;), so as to ensure the replacement of slums with adequate housing 
and to avoid anyone being rendered homeless as a result of the slum elimination programmes to 
be adopted by municipalities in terms of the Slums Act. They also underlined that any progress 
made by the KZN Provincial Government in the provision of adequate housing to the existing 
slum dwellers is continuously undermined by land owners who fail to prevent unlawful 
occupation of their land or premises thus perpetuating the existence or re-emergence of slums. 
Invariably, such owners end up taking no responsibility for the provision of basic services to the 
unlawful occupiers concerned and, in some instances, resort to exploiting them for financial gain </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>by charging them exorbitant rentals for the &#8220;unlawful&#8221; occupation of their land. Concerning the 
necessity to foresee a plan regarding alternative land available, the authorities specified that in 
addition to the sustainable housing development process embarked upon by the KZN Province in 
terms of the KZN Housing Act, the Slums Act also provides for the upgrading of slums to render 
them fit for human habitation and, where necessary, the relocation of slum dwellers to alternative 
land, if available, or to a transit area pending the acquisition of alternative land or buildings for 
their permanent occupation or accommodation. As to the requirement for consultation with the 
persons potentially affected by such decisions, the Slums Act requires each municipality to 
submit to the MEC a status report setting out, inter alia, the extent of slums within its area of 
jurisdiction, together with its proposed programme for the elimination thereof. Such programmes 
will then be assessed by the MEC on an annual basis, who will, in turn, require each 
municipality to consult with any persons affected by its programme as one of the prerequisites 
for the financing of such programme in accordance with the regulations made by the MEC in 
terms of the Slums Act.

According to the information received, on 28 September 2007, a group of civil society 
organizations representing shack dwellers in the eThekwini Municipality organized a march to 
deliver a memorandum to the Mayor presenting their views on housing and land issues that was 
affecting the city. According to reports, although the march was legal and peaceful, it was

the protesters. Allegedly, two participants were severely injured, one of which was allegedly 
struck by a rubber bullet at close range. Fourteen participants of the march would have been

police officers at his home in Farraig village, Halfa municipality, Northern Sudan. No arrest 
warrant was produced and no reasons were given why Mr. Ibrahim was taken to an unknown 
place. His arrest followed incidents on 13 June 2007, when Sudanese security forces allegedly 
killed and injured civilians in the Farraig village by shooting at them during a non-violent 
demonstration against the construction of the Kajbar Dam in the area. On that occasion, several 
individuals were arrested and detained in Dongola, the capital of the northern State, and in

<p>115. On 21 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter on the Merowe Dam 
and on the construction of another hydro-electric Dam in the Kajbar area, both located in the 
northern Nile valley in the Sudan. In regard to the Merowe Dam, the Special Rapporteur referred 
to his communications dated 5 July 2006, 25 August 2006 and 9 October 2006 for which no 
answer has been provided to date. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive information on 
forced evictions and violence as a result of the implementation of the Merowe Dam project. It is 
reported that this dam located at 350 km north of Khartoum, and reportedly due to be completed 
by the end of 2009, is principally funded, in addition to the Sudanese Government, by the China 
Export Import Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the 
Development Funds of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, and the Sultanate of Oman. The 
project is being executed by Chinese and European companies, including Harbin (China), 
Lahmeyer International (Germany), Alstom (France) and ABB (Switzerland). Reports indicate 
that some 44,000 people remain to be relocated, approximately 86 per cent of them belonging to 
the Manasir community, and 14 per cent to the Amri community. In responding to community 
protests, security forces have reportedly used live ammunition during the policing of protests, 
leading to killings and injuries. Construction of the dams is reportedly coordinated by the Dam 
Implementation Unit, a government agency which was previously part of the Ministry of 
Irrigation and Water Resources and became an independent agency directly answerable to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 66 
 
</p>
<p>President in September 2005. It is reported that, as a technical implementation body, the Dam 
Implementation Unit, has often taken key decisions without consulting with or informing 
affected communities. It is further alleged that the Dam Implementation Unit was responsible for 
the measures resulting in the sudden flooding of land inhabited by the Amri community in 
August 2006, without prior warning to the affected community. Concerns have been expressed 
that this was a deliberate move to force people out who were opposing the relocation. While the 
relocation of the Hamadab community was completed in 2003, reports indicate that in the 
Merowe area, opposition to the dam project by the local communities mounted after the 
relocation of the Hamadab community and revealed unresolved problems. Reportedly, the 
government failed to provide adequate infrastructure and services in the relocation area, and 
failed to pay in full the compensations agreed for lost assets. The relocation areas were not 
suitable for agriculture and the irrigation system was not operational, leaving the agricultural 
community largely without revenue or livelihoods. It is further reported that the government 
failed to address these concerns effectively and has generally responded with repressive 
measures. This situation has contributed to the fact that the other communities fear to suffer the 
same fate if they are to be relocated. As stated in the previous communications dated 5 July 2006 
and 25 August 2006, reports have indicated violence by members of security forces and other 
official agencies toward members of the Amri community opposing the forced relocation, and 
human rights defenders and journalists working on this issue. In his communication dated 
9 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur related allegations of deliberate flooding of the region in 
order to force people out. A recent rise in water levels has raised fears that there may be a 
repetition of the flooding of 2006, which left a large number of people temporarily without food, 
shelter and medical care, to force the remainder of the Amri community to move although 
community concerns regarding adequate compensation have not yet been addressed. It is further 
reported that after the flooding of the area in August 2006, the community was relocated to the 
resettlement area and flaws in the planning process became apparent, as some 800 families were 
reportedly not allocated housing and were forced to seek shelter with relatives. Some of them 
have apparently occupied unallocated houses in the relocation area. In addition, community 
representatives have complained about the poor soil quality and the ineffectiveness of the 
irrigation system. According to recent reports by community leaders, the housing allocation 
problems have yet to be addressed by the implementing authorities and parts of the community 
will not be entitled to compensation for lost land, trees and assets. Some 6,000 people belonging 
to the Amri community remain on their original land and reportedly refuse to be relocated 
although rising water levels may lead to a flooding of the area in the coming weeks. In recent 
days the Special Rapporteur has received reports that current flood levels are higher than those 
normally caused by seasonal flooding at this time of year, and that this would have been caused 
by parts of the hydropower dam being shut in order to raise water levels. Community members 
have reported that three houses have already been destroyed, and that other houses are 
surrounded by water, with flood levels continuing to rise. Reports indicate that no warning had 
been received by the community that the land they inhabit would be flooded at this particular 
time. In July this year, government-run schools in the Amri area had reportedly failed to open for 
the current school term and school buildings were dismantled in an apparent effort to force 
community members to move to the relocation site of New Amri where new schools are 
available. The closure of the six primary schools has affected some 200 students, in addition to 
some 75 children who were to start school this year. According to reports, medical facilities have 
been closed since the relocation in August 2006, forcing residents to travel some 70 km to the 
nearest medical facilities in Karima. The largest group among the affected communities, the </p>

</p>
<p>Manasir, is reportedly scheduled to be relocated at the end of 2007. However, the Special 
Rapporteur has received reports that, despite repeated requests, the community has not been 
provided with clear information as to when their relocation is scheduled to take place and 
whether the terms of relocation which they negotiated with local government authorities will be 
respected. Tension with the authorities rose during the first half of 2007 after the authorities 
appeared to retract an earlier agreement that the Manasir could be relocated to an area on the 
shore of the dam reservoir chosen by the vast majority of them, instead of the desert areas which 
had originally been designated by the authorities. It is reported that only few people from the 
community accepts to be relocated to the sites identified by the authorities. According to reports, 
between March and May 2007, six representatives of the Manasir community were detained for 
close to two months without charge or trial while negotiations about possible relocation sites 
were ongoing, and there were clashes between security forces and members of the community. 
Reports further indicate that on 12 June 2007 the authorities conducted a survey to assess how 
many community members prefer to relocate to the shore of the reservoir and how many would 
relocate to the settlements which have already been constructed by the dam authorities. The 
survey reportedly concluded that more than two thirds of the Manasir community prefers to 
relocate to the shore of the reservoir, but community representatives have expressed that they are 
not certain their choice will be respected. This is due, in part, to ongoing struggles between 
different government authorities. Although a 2006 presidential decree transferred all 
responsibility for relocation of the Manasir to the regional authorities of River Nile State, the 
Dam Implementation Unit reportedly continues to claim authority over the project, fuelling 
tensions with the Manasir community. In the Kajbar area, located 650 km north of Khartoum, the 
construction of another dam reportedly requires the displacement of an estimated 10,000 people 
belonging to the Mahas, a Nubian community. According to public information sources, the 
Kajbar dam is budgeted at 200 million US Dollars and will be funded by the Government of 
Sudan (25 per cent) and the Government of China (75 per cent). Local residents have reportedly 
opposed the construction and have mobilized large-scale protests against the start of construction 
work. Reportedly, community leaders dispute the economic rationale for the dam project and 
demand that all construction is halted until a new, transparent assessment is made. Reports 
indicate that this situation has generated violence, and resulted in loss of lives and injuries. For 
instance, it is alleged that in mid-June 2007, four civilians were killed and some 11 injured when 
security forces fired live rounds of ammunition into a crowd of protesters. Recent reports 
indicate that seven people remain detained without charge and without access to legal counsel on 
account of their opposing the dam project, or of their links with people opposing the project. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteurs refers to the communication dated 25 July 2007 that he sent 
jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on the arrest of a community&#8217;s 
representative and use of violence against opponents to the project. 
</p><p>116. On 24 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, on 
the detention of Mr. Hisham Abbas, and the detention and subsequent release of 
Mr. Nazmi Mohamed Hamed, Mr. Nayif Mohamed Hamed, Mr. Al Khatib Mohamed Selim, 
Mr. Maisara Izzeldin Mohamed Munowar, Mr. Faroug Nuri, Mr. Daoud Suliman,

</p>
<p>Mr. Mamoun Abdel Aziz, Mr. Abdel Razig, and Mr. Samil Mohamed Samil. All of the named 
individuals are members of the Committee against the Building of the Kajbar Dam (CABKD). 
Mr. Osman Ibrahim is the spokesperson for the Committee. He was the subject of an allegation 
letter sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on torture, or other cruel, 
inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
a component of the right to an adequate standard of living; and the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, on 25 July 2007. A communication was also sent on 21 August 2007 by the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing on the alleged impact of the Kajbar Dam on the human rights of 
the population. According to information received, between 27 and 29 August 2007, 
Mr. Hisham Abbas was reportedly arrested in Wadi Halfa City on his way to Egypt and at the 
time of sending the urgent appeal he was detained in Wadi Halfa. Furthermore, 
Mr. Nazmi Mohamed Hamed, Mr. Nayif Mohamed Hamed, Mr. Al Khatib Mohamed Selim, 
Mr. Maisara Izzeldin Mohamed Munowar, and Mr. Faroug Nuri were arrested in Dongola while 
Mr. Daoud Suliman and Mr. Isam Mohamed Fagir were arrested in Kerma. According to reports, 
they were detained in Dongola, under the supervision of the National Intelligence and Security 
Forces. They were all released on 13 September 2007. In addition, Mr. Osman Ibrahim, 
Mr. Ezzeldeen Idris, Mr. Abdel Hakim Nasor, Mr. Mamoun Abdel Aziz, Mr. Abdel Razig, and 
Mr. Samil Mohamed Samil were also arrested and later released. Concern is reiterated that the 
arrests and detention of Mr. Hisham Abbas, Mr. Nazmi Mohamed Hamed, Mr. Nayif Mohamed 
Hamed, Mr. Al Khatib Mohamed Selim, Mr. Maisara Izzeldin Mohamed Munowar, 
Mr. Faroug Nuri, Mr. Daoud Suliman, Mr. Isam Mohamed Fagir, Mr. Osman Ibrahim, 
Mr. Ezzeldeen Idris, Mr. Abdel Hakim Nasor, Mr. Mamoun Abdel Aziz, Mr. Abdel Razig, and 
Mr. Samil Mohamed Samil may be related to their work for the defence of human rights, in 
particular the human rights of the communities which are at risk of being affected by the 
Kajbar Dam. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response from the Government to the joint urgent 
appeal of 25 July 2007. He will continue to monitor the situation, and remains concerned about 
the situation of Dr Mohammed Jalal Hashim. 
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication of 21 August 2007, or several 
previous communications on the impact of hydro-electric projects on the right to adequate 
housing of communities in the Merowe and Kajbar area. As expressed in a press statement 
issued on 27 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur continues to monitor and to be deeply 
concerned by the situation of the communities affected by the hydro-electric projects in those 
areas.<b>7</b>

<p>120. Le 24 ao&#251;t 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial envoy&#233; une carte de all&#233;gation concernant la 
situation du logement &#224; Gen&#232;ve ainsi que des cas d&#8217;expulsions qui s&#8217;y sont d&#233;roul&#233;es ou qui sont 
pr&#233;vus dans les mois &#224; venir. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, la crise du logement &#224; Gen&#232;ve est 
durable et profonde entrainant une sp&#233;culation immobili&#232;re intense. Les loyers repr&#233;senteraient 
entre un quart et un tiers du budget des m&#233;nages et augmenteraient plus rapidement que les 
salaires. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les rapports re&#231;us, le taux de logements vacants est rest&#233; &#224; un niveau tr&#232;s bas 
(environ 0.20 %) ces cinq derni&#232;res ann&#233;es. De plus, l&#8217;offre de logements sociaux &#224; Gen&#232;ve ne 
semble pas en mesure de satisfaire la demande et la liste d&#8217;attente pour la location de logements 
sociaux ne cesserait de s&#8217;allonger. De plus, les rapports indiquent aussi que les demandes pour 
des logements locatifs, dans les secteurs publics et priv&#233;s, requi&#232;rent d&#8217;importantes garanties de 
type salarial et bancaire, ce qui repr&#233;sente un obstacle pour les personnes &#224; bas revenus pour 
acc&#233;der &#224; un logement convenable. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les rapports re&#231;us, le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral aurait coup&#233; les 
pr&#234;ts directs pr&#233;vus par la loi f&#233;d&#233;rale encourageant le logement &#224; loyer ou &#224; prix mod&#233;r&#233; (LOG) 
entr&#233;e en vigueur le 1er octobre 2003. Ces aides directes, pr&#233;vues afin d&#8217;encourager la 
construction de logements, ont &#233;t&#233; suspendues jusqu&#8217;en 2009,, augmentant les difficult&#233;s des 
collectivit&#233;s publiques de faire face aux besoins en logement de la population. Dans ce contexte, 
le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a &#233;galement re&#231;u des informations concernant des expulsions &#224; Gen&#232;ve. 
Selon les rapports re&#231;us, la premi&#232;re expulsion a eu lieu le 10 juillet 2007 au b&#226;timent situ&#233; au 
4 rue de la Tour, Gen&#232;ve-Plainpalais. Ce b&#226;timent &#233;tait occup&#233; depuis 2001 et abritait &#233;galement 
une biblioth&#232;que et une cr&#232;che autog&#233;r&#233;e fr&#233;quent&#233;e par une quinzaine d&#8217;enfants. Selon la 
source, cette expulsion se serait d&#233;roul&#233;e sans jugement d&#8217;&#233;vacuation et sans qu&#8217;aucune d&#233;cision 
d&#8217;expulsion n&#8217;ait &#233;t&#233; annonc&#233;e par &#233;crit aux individus concern&#233;s. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, 
la police serait arriv&#233;e le 10 juillet 2007 &#224; 10h dans le b&#226;timent et aurait emmen&#233; les r&#233;sidents au 
poste de police pour proc&#233;der &#224; un contr&#244;le d&#8217;identit&#233; sans invoquer une expulsion comme motif. 
Pendant ce temps, le propri&#233;taire serait arriv&#233; sur les lieux contr&#244;l&#233; par la police avec un huissier 
de justice qui aurait d&#233;clar&#233; le b&#226;timent vide, ceci malgr&#233; la pr&#233;sence d&#8217;un r&#233;sident. &#192; leur retour, 
les habitants se seraient vus refuser l&#8217;acc&#232;s au lieu et &#224; leurs effets personnels par la police. De 
plus, il semble que les habitants n&#8217;aient pu r&#233;cup&#233;rer qu&#8217;une partie de leurs biens apr&#232;s plusieurs 
jours, le reste ayant &#233;t&#233; endommag&#233; ou d&#233;truit lorsque les lieux ont &#233;t&#233; vid&#233;s. Les informations 
indiquent qu&#8217;aucune solution alternative de relogement, ni de compensation n&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; propos&#233;es 
aux personnes expuls&#233;es et que celles-ci sont actuellement sans domicile. La seconde expulsion a 
eu lieu le 23 juillet 2007 dans les b&#226;timents dit du Rhino situ&#233;s au 12-14 boulevard de la Tour et 
au 24 boulevard des Philosophes, Gen&#232;ve-Plainpalais. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, ces 
b&#226;timents ont &#233;t&#233; continuellement occup&#233;s depuis 1988 par 60 &#224; 80 personnes avec de faibles 
revenus et comportaient un caf&#233; et des locaux accueillant diverses activit&#233;s culturelles. Dans ce 
cas &#233;galement, il semble que l&#8217;expulsion se soit effectu&#233;e sans jugement d&#8217;&#233;vacuation alors 
qu&#8217;une proc&#233;dure civile &#233;tait encore en cours, le Tribunal des baux et loyers devant encore se 
prononcer sur ce cas. De plus, il semblerait qu&#8217;aucune d&#233;cision d&#8217;expulsion n&#8217;ait &#233;t&#233; notifi&#233;e par 
&#233;crit aux individus concern&#233;s. Selon les rapports, les autorit&#233;s auraient bas&#233; leur intervention, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 70 
 
</p>
<p>entre autre, sur une d&#233;cision administrative qui aurait &#233;t&#233; prise pour des probl&#232;mes de salubrit&#233;, 
de s&#233;curit&#233; et d&#8217;habitabilit&#233;. Cette d&#233;cision administrative d&#8217;&#233;vacuer semble &#234;tre en contradiction 
avec le rejet du tribunal f&#233;d&#233;ral d&#8217;une d&#233;cision d&#8217;&#233;vacuation bas&#233;e sur ces motifs dans un cas 
similaire. D&#8217;apr&#232;s l&#8217;information re&#231;ue, au alentour des 14h, la police serait entr&#233;e dans les 
b&#226;timents en cassant des fen&#234;tres et aurait ensuite retenu les r&#233;sidents pr&#233;sents dans les b&#226;timents 
jusqu&#8217;&#224; 18h avant de proc&#233;der &#224; l&#8217;&#233;vacuation qui a eu lieu par mauvais temps et sous une forte 
pluie. Selon les rapports re&#231;us, aucune solution alternative appropri&#233;e de relogement permanent 
n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; propos&#233;e aux habitants. Des pr&#233;occupations ont &#233;t&#233; en particulier exprim&#233;es concernant le 
relogement des femmes enceintes et des familles avec enfants qui n&#8217;auraient actuellement 
toujours pas de logement permanent. D&#8217;apr&#232;s certaines d&#233;clarations publiques, le Gouvernement 
aurait annonc&#233; que sa responsabilit&#233; s&#8217;arr&#234;tait &#224; loger les personnes le premier soir suivant 
l&#8217;expulsion. Il semblerait qu&#8217;avant l&#8217;expulsion, l&#8217;&#201;tat de Gen&#232;ve ait propos&#233; des alternatives &#224; 
certains habitants, mais que celles-ci auraient &#233;t&#233; inadapt&#233;es. Suite &#224; cette expulsion, certains 
r&#233;sidents qui travaillaient dans les b&#226;timents n&#8217;ont actuellement plus de locaux pour travailler et 
ont, par cons&#233;quence, perdu leur seul revenu de subsistance, diminuant leur chance de pouvoir 
acc&#233;der &#224; un logement convenable. De plus, des pr&#233;occupations ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant &#224; la 
possibilit&#233; pour une des personnes expuls&#233;es atteinte d&#8217;un cancer de pouvoir poursuivre son 
traitement m&#233;dical de mani&#232;re suivie et convenable. De mani&#232;re similaire, des informations ont 
&#233;t&#233; re&#231;ues concernant une prochaine &#233;vacuation du b&#226;timent situ&#233; au 13 rue de l&#8217;Arquebuse, 
Gen&#232;ve-Plainpalais. Ce b&#226;timent est un lieu d&#8217;habitation et de travail pour une trentaine de 
personnes &#224; faibles revenus depuis 1994. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, les r&#233;sidents auraient 
re&#231;u un ultimatum de la part du repr&#233;sentant du propri&#233;taire le 26 juillet 2007 qui stipule que si 
les habitants quittent les lieux avant le 10 ao&#251;t 2007, le propri&#233;taire retirerait sa plainte pour 
violation de propri&#233;t&#233;. Suite &#224; cela, le vendredi 27 juillet, le procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral aurait envoy&#233; un 
fax afin d&#8217;avertir les habitants qu&#8217;aucune proc&#233;dure criminelle ne serait pris &#224; l&#8217;encontre des 
r&#233;sidents s&#8217;ils quittaient les lieux avant le 4 septembre 2007. Les informations indiquent 
l&#8217;absence de jugement d&#8217;&#233;vacuation, privant ainsi les r&#233;sidents d&#8217;une possibilit&#233; de le contester. 
De plus, aucune solution alternative de relogement n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; propos&#233;e, malgr&#233; les demandes des 
r&#233;sidents pour de nouveaux lieux de travail et d&#8217;habitation. De plus, les rapports indiquent qu&#8217;un 
nombre important de b&#226;timents ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;vacu&#233;s &#224; Gen&#232;ve sans que cela aient cr&#233;&#233; de nouveaux 
logements malgr&#233; la crise actuelle. &#192; titre d&#8217;exemple, les Villas des Nations, qui &#233;taient 
anciennement occup&#233;es par une soixantaine d&#8217;&#233;tudiants &#224; travers la coop&#233;rative de logement 
pour personne en formation, auraient laiss&#233; place &#224; un terrain vague. De m&#234;me, l&#8217;ancien b&#226;timent 
dit &#171; H&#244;tel California &#187;, dans le quartier des P&#226;quis &#224; Gen&#232;ve, qui logeait 120 personnes, serait 
toujours inoccup&#233; trois ans apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;vacuation des r&#233;sidents. En ao&#251;t 2004, les occupants avaient 
quitt&#233; le b&#226;timent d&#232;s que le propri&#233;taire avait re&#231;u l&#8217;autorisation officielle de les transformer en 
logements sociaux et en un h&#244;tel quatre &#233;toiles. Trois ans plus tard, le b&#226;timent est, selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, toujours inoccup&#233; et les travaux se seraient arr&#234;t&#233;s depuis plus de deux ans. 
En outre, les rapports indiquent que Gen&#232;ve poss&#233;derait de nombreux b&#226;timents inoccup&#233;s et 
inusit&#233;s malgr&#233; les besoins de la population.

le 24 ao&#251;t 2007 par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial pour le logement convenable. Le gouvernement a 
pr&#233;cis&#233; qu&#8217;en Suisse, les comp&#233;tences en mati&#232;re de logement sont, selon la th&#233;matique, du 
ressort des autorit&#233;s f&#233;d&#233;rales ou de celui des autorit&#233;s cantonales. Concernant la suspension de 
l&#8217;octroi des pr&#234;ts directs encourageant le logement &#224; loyer ou &#224; prix mod&#233;r&#233;s, les autorit&#233;s </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 71 
 
</p>
<p>f&#233;d&#233;rales ont r&#233;pondu que suite &#224; une d&#233;cision du Parlement dans le cadre du programme 
d&#8217;all&#232;gement budg&#233;taire de 2003, les articles 12 et 24 LOG, qui constituent la base l&#233;gale de 
l&#8217;octroi des pr&#234;ts directs, n&#8217;&#233;taient plus appliqu&#233;s jusqu&#8217;&#224; fin 2008. Cependant, les autorit&#233;s 
f&#233;d&#233;rales ont fait savoir que la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration encourageait la construction de logement &#224; travers 
des aides indirectes et que le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral avait pr&#233;vu de nouveaux moyens financiers pour les 
aides indirectes. Par contre, ce dernier aurait propos&#233; de renoncer aux pr&#234;ts directs. Les questions 
li&#233;es aux r&#233;centes expulsions ainsi qu&#8217;&#224; la situation du logement &#224; Gen&#232;ve ont &#233;t&#233; transmises aux 
autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes, soit la R&#233;publique et canton de Gen&#232;ve. Dans sa r&#233;ponse, le Conseil 
d&#8217;&#201;tat genevois note qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;expulsions d&#8217;occupants illicites d&#8217;appartements et non 
d&#8217;&#233;victions forc&#233;es, puisque les expulsions en question &#233;taient intervenues &#224; l&#8217;issue de 
proc&#233;dures judiciaires conforment &#224; la l&#233;gislation f&#233;d&#233;rale (art. 46 Cst. F&#233;d.) prot&#233;geant le 
propri&#233;taire d&#8217;un immeuble contre la violation de domicile (art. 186 du Code civil). Le Conseil 
d&#8217;&#201;tat a not&#233; que dans certains cas, les autorit&#233;s cantonales ont d&#233;cid&#233; de tol&#233;rer une atteinte 
temporaire aux droits des propri&#233;taires de logements qui refusaient de mettre leurs biens sur le 
march&#233;, les laissant d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment vides dans un contexte de p&#233;nurie aigu&#235;. Ainsi, le Conseil 
d&#8217;&#201;tat et le Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral, l&#8217;autorit&#233; comp&#233;tente en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;vacuations, sont convenus de 
ne faire &#233;vacuer par la force des logements occup&#233;s de mani&#232;re illicite seulement pour permettre 
leur remise en location imm&#233;diate ou leur remise en &#233;tat par des travaux pouvant &#234;tre entrepris 
sans d&#233;lai. Selon le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat, c&#8217;est en fonction de ces principes que les immeubles au 
boulevard de la Tour 12 et 14 et au boulevard des Philosophes 24 (&#8220;squat Rhino&#8221;) ont pu &#234;tre 
occup&#233;s &#224; partir de 1988, bien que les propri&#233;taires aient d&#233;pos&#233; des plaintes p&#233;nales et des 
demandes d&#8217;&#233;vacuation. Toujours selon lui, c&#8217;est &#233;galement en fonction de ces principes et, de 
surcroit, en application d&#8217;une d&#233;cision administrative rev&#234;tue de la force ex&#233;cutoire, que les 
squatters ont finalement &#233;t&#233; expuls&#233;s le 23 juillet 2007. Les nouveaux propri&#233;taires, d&#233;sireux de 
remettre les appartements en &#233;tat et de les offrir &#224; la location, avaient obtenu les autorisations &#224; 
cet effet en septembre 2005. Le 19 octobre 2005, des avis de la police cantonale affich&#233;s sur les 
portes de l&#8217;immeuble invitaient les habitants &#224; lib&#233;rer les lieux pour le 22 novembre 2005. Suite &#224; 
cette d&#233;cision, les squatters ont d&#233;pos&#233; des recours afin de tenter de se maintenir dans les lieux. 
Ils ont finalement &#233;t&#233; expuls&#233;s en juillet 2007, moyennant l&#8217;intervention des forces de l&#8217;ordre. 
Selon le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat, sur les 22 squatters, une douzaine a &#233;t&#233; relog&#233;e par la Ville de Gen&#232;ve. Il 
a not&#233; que par ailleurs, en date du 3 septembre 2007, le Tribunal des baux et loyers a d&#233;bout&#233; les 
anciens squatters de Rhino qui plaidaient l&#8217;existence d&#8217;un bail tacite entre eux et les 
propri&#233;taires. Le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat a &#233;galement relev&#233; qu&#8217;une proposition de relogement collectif 
avait &#233;t&#233; fournie aux squatters de Rhino, d&#232;s le mois de novembre 2005. Cette proposition fut 
d&#233;clin&#233;e car l&#8217;immeuble propos&#233; ne se situait pas en ville. Le Conseil d&#8217;&#180;&#201;tat a ajout&#233; que 
diverses autres propositions avaient &#233;t&#233; faites en vue du relogement des squatters. Concernant le 
cas du &#8220;squat de la Tour&#8221; (rue de la Tour 4), le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat a not&#233; que les autorit&#233;s ont agi 
dans la l&#233;galit&#233; &#233;tant donn&#233; qu&#8217;une plainte p&#233;nale pour violation de domicile avait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e

l&#8217;ex&#233;cution de travaux. Selon le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat, seul a fait d&#233;faut un avertissement pr&#233;alable clair 
aux squatters, bien que non obligatoire. Cependant, selon le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat, un tel avertissement 
serait souhaitable &#224; l&#8217;avenir. Concernant l&#8217;occupation de l&#8217;immeuble situ&#233; &#224; la rue de

comme atelier et espace de rencontres culturelles. Une plainte pour violation de domicile avait 
&#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e. Les occupants ont quitt&#233; les lieux le 20 septembre 2007 sans opposer de r&#233;sistance

<p>logement, le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat a pr&#233;cis&#233; que la mise &#224; disposition de logements est une de ses 
priorit&#233;s et que les &#233;vacuations d&#8217;immeubles squatt&#233;s participent &#224; cette politique. Le 
gouvernement cantonal soutient la mise en place d&#8217;une nouvelle politique de logement. Cela 
s&#8217;est traduit par l&#8217;adoption, le 24 mai dernier, d&#8217;une loi pour la construction de logements 
d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique, soit destin&#233;s aux cat&#233;gories de la population qui en ont le plus besoin. 
L&#8217;objectif vis&#233; est d&#8217;avoir un parc de logements d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique de 15 % du parc de logements 
locatifs et ce en 10 ans. Un cr&#233;dit d&#8217;investissement de CHF 300 millions a notamment &#233;t&#233; allou&#233; 
par le parlement pour soutenir cette ambition. Le Conseil a ajout&#233; qu&#8217;au niveau cantonal, le 
budget de l&#8217;&#201;tat atteint CHF 65 millions d&#8217;aides directs en faveur du logement social. Ces aides 
prennent la forme de subventions et d&#8217;allocations. Le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat a donc consid&#233;r&#233; que les 
autorit&#233;s fournissaient un effort important bien que l&#8217;ampleur de la demande ne permettait pas de

<p>123. On 30 October 2007 the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning evictions 
in Dushanbe. According to information received, evictions have been occurring in Dushanbe, as 
a result of the authorities&#8217; plans to revive a Soviet-era design for the reconstruction of the city 
center, which would divide Dushanbe into three concentric circles. It is reported that this design 
would envision an almost complete elimination of private homes from the innermost circle (the 
so-called &#8216;first circle&#8217;). Reportedly, under this plan all houses, including private ones which are 
less than three-floors high, are to be demolished and later replaced by large condominium 
buildings. Historically, the centre of the city has primarily consisted of private houses and 
buildings that are rarely higher than two floors. It is reported that in the 1990s, at the end of the 
Soviet era, new legislation allowed people to buy their apartments and houses, most of which 
were Government property in the Soviet period. This did not entail however property over the 
land on which these buildings are erected. Many took this opportunity to buy their homes. While 
the general plan of reconstruction of the city has been officially suspended until 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur has been informed that in some cases, residents of small houses in the first 
circle have already started to receive eviction notifications, providing short periods for their 
relocation. Although the growing city needs seem to require new living space and poorly built 
houses, many of them constructed during the 1992-1997 civil war, should be demolished, city 
officials have not reportedly thought carefully enough about the ambitious redevelopment 
project, especially given the dearth of private investors that would be needed to turn this plan 
into reality. Despite the fact that national law provides for fair compensation to residents who are 
evicted for public and governmental needs, reportedly the evictees have been offered smaller 
apartments in the outskirts of the city whose estimated price seems lower than the current market </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 73 
 
</p>
<p>value of their real estate property in the city centre. There are also allegations that some of the 
buildings provided by city authorities for resettlement are unsafe. According to these allegations, 
in certain cases it seems impossible to live in the apartments that are provided without substantial 
repairs. In addition there does not seem to be any water supply in these apartments. It is reported 
that according to Article 32 of the Constitution and the Housing law code in these situations, the 
families should have been provided with accommodation in the same area as their previous 
houses were, or alternatively adequate monetary compensation. Reportedly, the value of 
apartments provided by the city authorities can be estimated to be less than 5 per cent of the 
value of the evictees&#8217; original houses. It is also reported that the situation is further complicated 
by the absence of provisions on land property in national legislation and absence of independent 
assessment of real estate value in the city centre. There are allegations that in some instances 
land from which people were evicted for public needs was later sold for commercial use. The 
Special Rapporteur has been informed that a group of affected residents wrote an open letter to 
the President complaining about these evictions and their proposed resettlement outside the city 
boundaries on land that used to be a cemetery, reportedly inadequate for housing and with no 
infrastructure or public services. These residents also claim that they will not be provided with 
any compensation to cover the difference in price for the properties. In addition they claim that 
they do not have sufficient financial resources to build new houses to replace their current ones 
and that, although many high-ranking government officials also reside in the first circle of the 
city centre, their houses are not due for demolition. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note 
that the mayor&#8217;s office on 20 March 2007 has publicly announced that redevelopment will be 
carried through a regular public consultation process and that realization of the General City 
Reconstruction Plan within the so-called &#8220;first circle&#8221; will be carried out gradually and in strict 
abidance with national legislation and that the housing rights of citizens would not be infringed. 
According to the mayor&#8217;s statement, Mr. Makhmadasaid Ubaydullayev, people who were 
evicted from their houses in the city centre without being provided adequate compensation for 
their property, and were resettled in the outskirts of the city, will reportedly receive 
accommodation within the city centre upon completion of reconstruction of the city or will be 
provided with plots of land for house construction in the Khovaron area in the outskirts of 
Dushanbe. It is envisaged, however, that the reconstruction will be carried out by private 
construction companies based on independent investors&#8217; projects and therefore the newly 
constructed property seems unlikely to be state owned. The Special Rapporteur also brought to 
the attention of the Government information received on allegations of forced evictions as a 
result of the construction of the new Presidential Residence, the Youth House, and other 
buildings declared to be of public necessity. According to these allegations, 13 families living in 
Somoni district in Dushanbe were informed by officials of the mayor&#8217;s office that their houses 
were to be demolished to expand the nearby residence of the President, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, 
without any prior notice. During a meeting with the Deputy Head of the Department of Housing 
of the mayor&#8217;s Office, Mr. M. Muladjanov, these families were informed that they had to leave 
urgently their residences and resettle on the city outskirts, where they would receive apartments 
on the top floors of a nine-storey building. Reportedly, the city administration officials also 
informed them that the issue had been long settled and so no other relocation alternatives were 
possible. According to the reports received, a parking lot for visiting dignitaries was, for 
example, planned to occupy the area where the house of the Halimov family stood. It is reported 
that, for their relocation, officials offered them a 40-square meter apartment on the edge of the 
city, although the family house occupied approximately 300 square meters. The officials 
reportedly explained that the compensation procedure took into account the size of living </p>

</p>
<p>quarters, and not additional space such as kitchens, courtyards, verandas, and storage rooms. The 
Special Rapporteur also noted that in recent years the whole country has reportedly been facing 
regular electricity cuts, especially during winter seasons, which have mostly affected districts in 
the outskirts of Dushanbe where the affected families are allegedly supposed to be relocated. As 
a result of these cuts elevators in multi-storey buildings do not work most of the time, causing 
great inconveniences and distress to persons with physical disability or serious health conditions 
and elderly, when they are not offered accommodation on ground floors. There also seems to be 
a problem with the tap water which cannot reach upper floors. In the inner city center, where the 
affected families are allegedly being evicted from, the situation is reportedly better as electricity 
is provided constantly and the low buildings have no problems with the supply of tap water.

<p>125. On 10 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture, and Special Rapporteur on the right to health concerning 149 Lao 
Hmong people at Nong Khai Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), of whom 90 are children and 
babies. All of them have been recognized as refugees by UNHCR. According to the information 
received, the Hmong group was arrested by immigration police in Bangkok on 
17 November 2006. On 8 December 2006, the group was transferred from Bangkok to Nong 
Khai IDC. On 30 January 2007, the authorities attempted to deport them to Laos, but failed due 
to strong resistance by the group. On 12 and 29 June 2007, seven Lao Hmong men escaped from 
Nong Khai IDC. Following these escapes in early July, immigration officials have applied 
stricter measures toward the Lao Hmong which resulted in deterioration of their conditions of 
detention. All of them are confined to tiny cells, without access to daylight and are not allowed 
to leave the cells. They have no access to clean, potable water but have to drink water from 
bathrooms inside the cells. These restrictions, as well as limited access to medical care, have 
caused the spreading of diseases, such as rashes, diarrhoea, respiratory infections and fever, 
especially among children. Furthermore, contact with the outside world is not permitted as any 
visits or phone calls are allowed. Ten video cameras, directly connected to Bangkok 
Immigration, have been installed to monitor detainees&#8217; activities.

del asentamiento &#8220;24 de Junio&#8221;, ubicado en Camino Repetto entre Domingo Mora y Toledo 
Chico a la altura del kil&#243;metro 16 de Camino Maldonado, en Montevideo. Seg&#250;n las 
informaciones recibidas, este asentamiento habr&#237;a empezado a establecerse el 24 de junio del a&#241;o 
2002 en el marco de la crisis econ&#243;mica. Con anterioridad a esa fecha varias familias habr&#237;an 
empezado a pagar a una empresa que promov&#237;a el terreno como apto para la realizaci&#243;n de 
cooperativas de vivienda enmarcadas en el supuesto &#8220;Proyecto Piri&#8221;. Este proyecto de vivienda 
nunca se habr&#237;a realizado y la empresa promotora se habr&#237;a retirado con el dinero que varias 
familias hab&#237;an pagado. Por otro lado, seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, de igual manera un 
grupo de habitantes del asentamiento habr&#237;an pagado y continuar&#237;an pagando a particulares 
fracciones de terrenos, promocionados como aptos para construir, donde habr&#237;an asentado sus 
viviendas. Se infiere que varias familias habr&#237;an sido objeto de manejos de especuladores que les 
habr&#237;an cobrados por terrenos que no se encuentran legalmente habilitados para construir. Seg&#250;n 
las alegaciones recibidas este desalojo habr&#237;a sido determinado por el Juzgado de Paz

<p>128. Por carta de fecha 23 de enero de 2008, el Gobierno contest&#243; a la carta de alegaci&#243;n 
transmitida por el Relator Especial. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que el asentamiento irregular &#8220;24 de 
junio&#8221; se compone de 389 lotes, de los cuales hay 351 edificados y 38 bald&#237;os. El Gobierno 
subray&#243; que el asentamiento se ubica en una zona rural, en cuyo terreno existe una cantera, es 
cruzado por cables de alta tensi&#243;n y se trata de una zona inundable. Se informa tambi&#233;n que en el 
asentamiento viven 410 familias compuestas por 323 hogares y que seg&#250;n un relevamiento 
realizado por sus propios habitantes a la fecha habr&#237;a una poblaci&#243;n de aproximadamente 5.000 
personas, entre ellos 2.400 ni&#241;os, mientras que seg&#250;n un censo realizado en 2004 por el Instituto 
Nacional de Estad&#237;stica, en el asentamiento habitar&#237;an aproximadamente 2.800 personas. El 
Gobierno considera que la poblaci&#243;n que habita este asentamiento se encuentra en una compleja 
situaci&#243;n de pobreza y precariedad y se&#241;al&#243; que los pobladores eval&#250;an como muy escasa la 
cobertura de los servicios sociales de la zona y que no est&#225;n conformes con la calidad del 
servicio que se presta. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n se&#241;al&#243; que el asentamiento presenta problemas en 
relaci&#243;n con su situaci&#243;n urbano-ambiental, principalmente en lo que se refiere a los efluentes 
domiciliarios, a la caminer&#237;a al interior del asentamiento, a las condiciones topogr&#225;ficas del 
suelo, a la presencia de un curso de agua y de l&#237;neas de alta tensi&#243;n. El gobierno precis&#243; que la 
titularidad de los predios es privada y corresponde a un conjunto de padrones ubicados 
mayoritariamente en &#225;rea rural, pertenecientes a diferentes propietarios. El Gobierno ha 
expresado p&#250;blicamente su enorme inquietud por el asentamiento &#8220;24 de junio&#8221;, dada la cantidad 
de familias involucradas en un eventual desalojo y por las dificultades en alcanzar soluciones a 
corto plazo, como podr&#237;a ser la adjudicaci&#243;n de viviendas a los damnificados. El Gobierno </p>

<p>municipal de Montevideo ha decidido mantener dicho predio como zona rural dado que los 
mismos quedan excluidos del proceso de urbanizaci&#243;n, descart&#225;ndose por lo tanto, la posibilidad 
de expropiaci&#243;n habida cuenta de que los padrones no son regularizables, precisamente por ser 
de uso rural. No obstante el Gobierno aclar&#243; que el programa de Asentamientos Irregulares est&#225; 
impedido de actuar en aquellos sentamientos localizados en tierras privadas para proceder a su 
regularizaci&#243;n y menos aun en zona rural. Antes las distintas notificaciones efectuadas por el 
Poder Judicial sobre el desalojo de los ocupantes, la Intendencia Municipal de Montevideo ha 
estado participando de varias instancias con otros organismos del estado para evitar el desalojo 
forzoso. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que ha considerado como necesaria la participaci&#243;n de todas las 
partes involucradas en este conflicto, tanto publicas como privadas y que entendi&#243; que la 
soluci&#243;n definitiva al problema habitacional de las personas ocupantes el asentamiento &#8220;24 de

a las acciones emprendidas por la Intendencia Municipal y la labor de mediaci&#243;n efectuada por la

solucionar este problema les fueron entregadas tierras a los propietarios reclamantes, a cambio 
del terreno ocupado por el asentamiento &#8220;24 de junio&#8221;, evitando as&#237; el desalojo de sus ocupantes, 
en canje, un predio municipal u otro predio estatal de igual valor. Adem&#225;s se ha realizado un

<p>130. On 12 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food on resettlement plans for those displaced by the Son La 
Hydropower Project, which are inadequate thus threatening people&#8217;s access to livelihoods and 
food. According to these allegations, on 12 November 2002, the National Assembly approved 
the construction of this project which is expected to submerge 24,000 hectares of land, including 
8,000 hectares of agricultural land and 3,000 of rich forested areas and which requires a large 
resettlement of people. By 2010 the project is expected to displace 91,000 people or 
18,968 households in the three provinces of Son La, Lai Chau and Dien Bien. The allegations 
received claim that although a resettlement master plan exists, specific guidelines have not been 
developed and implemented by local authorities in a timely manner. As a result it is reported that 
many people are resettled before necessary infrastructure is in place. It appears that the land 
which will be given to those displaced will be taken from host communities, potentially leading 
to inter-community conflicts. The information received also indicates that resettled communities 
are not being given adequate assistance in transitioning from their former method of farming 
(wet rice cultivation) to other forms of agricultural production which does not help them in </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 77 
 
</p>
<p>creating an environment for food self-sufficiency. In addition the allotment of 400 square meters 
of residential land (including garden plots) to each household in rural resettlement sites 
regardless of family size does not appear to be adequate to large families. It is reported also that 
in some resettled sites, people have poor quality drinking water and serious water shortages 
during the dry season. The Special Rapporteur with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
brought also to the attention of the Government the allegations they received that hydro dams on 
the upper Srepok River might affect the access to livelihoods and food of the Cambodian 
villagers who are expected to be affected by hydro operations upstream. According to these 
allegations, the livelihoods of an estimated 11,000 people, mostly ethnic minorities living along 
the Cambodian stretch of the Srepok River may be seriously disrupted by a series of dams that 
Electricity of Viet Nam plans to build on this river within five years. The largest dam, Buon 
Kuop, has been reportedly under construction since 2003 and is expected to be completed in 
</p><p>2008. It is reported that people residing along the downstream area of the Srepok River base their 
subsistence economy on available resources in the area and rely on water, cultivation land and 
forest. The reports claim that the communities living downstream of the Srepok River may not 
be able to practice riverbank gardening if there are unpredictable water level fluctuations due to 
the dams. Paddy production may also be impacted by the construction of the dams if early wet 
season water levels are low and water may not be channelled to areas away from their river. In 
addition it appears that the barriers imposed by the dams may result in considerable impact on 
fish both in terms of reduction in biomass production and species diversity. This may lead to 
protein deficiency especially in growing children as there appears to be no available alternative 
to replace fish as a major protein source, considering that wildlife hunting is regulated and 
domestic animals are raised mainly for selling.

</b></p>
<p>131. By letter dated 7 March 2007, the Permanent Mission of Vietnam in Geneva replied to the 
above communication and it informed that to ensure better living conditions for the resettled 
persons was a consistent policy of Vietnam, when the Government commenced the construction 
of hydropower projects. With regard to the Son La Hydropower Project, right at the beginning of 
the process to work out the detailed resettlement plans, the provincial administrations organized 
fact finding missions for the displaced persons to the planned resettlement sites. After the fact 
finding missions, the displaced persons voluntarily made commitments to resettle at their chosen 
sites and only then the detailed resettlement plans were approved by the local administration. 
The infrastructures were built before the displaced persons resettled. The Government indicated 
that there have been no signs of potentially conflict between the displaced communities and the 
host ones. There were no cases that the resettled persons do not have agricultural land, even 
though due to complicate procedures in some localities the provision of land took time. In 
addition to the land compensation, the resettled households were provided with financial 
assistance for the purchase of food, fuel and electricity for the first two years. The Government 
further reported that ensuring sufficient water supplies was a must in planning resettlement sites. 
The Government reported that the life of most of the resettled persons is much better in 
comparison with their life before the resettlement. With regard to the hydro dam on the upper 
Srepok River, Vietnam always prioritizes sustainable development projects benefiting all parties. 
The report of the SWECO- Grover consulting company clearly stated that the dam could 
improve the living conditions of the communities living in the area and have positive influences 
on the environment. </p>

<p>132. On 23 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint follow-up letter of allegation with the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food on the resettlement plans for those displaced by the Son 
La Hydropower Project. The Special Rapporteur thanks for the Government reply on 
7 March 2007 his communication dated 8 December 2007. Concerning the resettlement plans for 
those displaced by the Son La Hydropower Project, it is alleged that in many instances basic 
infrastructure was not ready and in many sites the water systems were not in place before people 
moved. According to these allegations the main problem with these resettlement plans remains 
the lack of sufficient arable land for all the displaced. According to information received people 
are concerned that when government&#8217;s support for food, electricity and fuel ends they will have 
no viable means of food production and income particularly those who moved far away and who 
can no longer reach their fields, receive less fertile land in the resettlement area and face lower 
crop yields and incomes. This may reportedly lead to greater food insecurity and changes in 
livelihood as many will not be able to cultivate the same crops they once grew. Host 
communities have also reportedly been affected as many of their members have to share their 
farmland with those who are being resettled and may have to change their livelihoods and means 
to procure food. The Special Rapporteurs were also informed that the inclusion of gardens in 
residential land, the differences in the notion of &#8220;family&#8221; among the different ethnic minorities 
and the disparity between the actual land area in use and that in official records of the commune 
land administration, has posed serious constraints in the process of land compensation and 
allocation. It is also reported that construction has contaminated water sources in some 
resettlement areas like for example, in Pa So village, Phong Tho district, Lai Chau province. 
Concerning the hydro dams on the upper Srepok River, the Special Rapporteurs understand that 
this cooperation strategy, launched at a Summit held between the Prime Ministers of Cambodia, 
Laos and Vietnam in October 1999, aims at building a &#8220;triangle of development&#8221; in the shared 
3S river basin. They also understand that at the most recent Fourth Summit on the economic 
triangle, which was held in Da Lat town, Lam Dong province, Vietnam on 5 December 2006, it 
was agreed to establish a ministerial-level Joint Coordination Committee. However according to 
the allegations received there has not yet been any civil society participation within this process. 
It is reported that Srepok River is a critical resource for at least 11,000 people in communities 
along the river in the Cambodian provinces of Ratanakiri, Sting Treng and Mondulkiri and that 
hydro development as currently planned may have serious negative impacts on people&#8217;s 
livelihoods and food security. In addition the first major flood on the Sesan River caused by the 
Yali Falls Dam, caused loss of lives and swept away property, livestock and crops in dozens of 
communities downstream in Viet Nam and Cambodia. It is also reported that in this case 
SWECO underestimated the downstream effects of Yali and subsequent dams on the Sesan River 
and that compensation has yet to be provided to the affected villagers. Concerning the SWECO 
Groner&#8217;s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) it is reported that this is not a complete EIA 
and it fails to comply with international as well as Vietnamese and Swedish standards related to 
dam projects. 
<b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>133. By letter dated 22 August 2007, the Government replied to the above communication 
outlining that it always aims at &#8220;better living conditions in the resettlement sites&#8221; to encourage 
and compensate for the resettlement of the displaced persons and support them to quickly 
integrate with their new communities. The Government indicated that the resettlement sites meet </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
 page 79 
 
</p>
<p>the requirements on production and residential land, electricity, water and other indispensable 
structure. Concerning land there are no cases that resettled persons are not provided with 
agricultural land and left with no means of livelihood and procuring food after resettlement. 
Apart from the compensation for land, the resettled households are provided with financial and 
technical support for building their houses, education, procurement of food and production. All 
the resettled persons are provided with enough water supply. Drinking water quality at some 
sites may not meet the required standards due to the fact that the water supply system is still 
under the finalization process. Concerning PASO village (Phong Thao district, Lai Chau 
province this is a new town and still under construction, so that it is difficult to avoid temporary 
dust pollution. A provisional drinking water supplies has been built to provide water to the 
villagers. With regard to the hydro dams on the upper Srepok River the contract with the 
Swedish company SWECO for an environmental impact assessment EIA aims at ensuring the 
objectiveness of the EIA report. During the last three years, the National Mekong Committee of 
Vietnam (MRC) regularly monitored the water quality of this area. At the beginning of 2007 the 
MRC reported that there was no toxin in the water. This result was sent to the Cambodian side 
for reference. Currently, the construction of the hydropower projects on the Vietnamese side 
have begun, the water flow has not been intervened; no reservoirs and dams have been built. 
Therefore, there cannot be any impact to the water quality that can influence the health of the 
people and domestic animals. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>134. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response from the Government to his 
communications. He hopes that continued dialogue will result in the resolution of the human 
rights issues faced by people affected by the construction of the hydroelectric projects. The 
Special Rapporteur continues to monitor the situation with interest.

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>135. As a follow-up to previous communications, on 10 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur 
sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, the Special 
Rapporteur on toxic wastes and the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, concerning the issue 
of the camps for internally displaced persons affected by lead contamination in northern 
Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;. The Special Rapporteurs thanked for the reply dated 11 April 2006 
concerning a previous communication (dated 27 March 2006) and which indicated certain 
positive measures and developments. However, requests for information in the letter of 
27 March 2006 on the provision of emergency medical treatment to affected persons were only 
briefly addressed in the Government&#8217;s response. In the meantime according to the information 
received the &#381;itkovac/Zhikovc and Kablare/Kablar camps have been closed after their 
inhabitants voluntarily moved to the Osterode camp (mainly between March and July 2006), but 
that up to 150 individuals still remain in the &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; camp. Furthermore it is 
reported specialized medical treatment for some of the residents of the Osterode camp 
commenced at the end of August. The medical evidence revealing widespread lead poisoning 
among persons belonging to Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minority groups who lived in or still </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 
page 80 
 
</p>
<p>live in the &#381;itkovac/Zhikovc, &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; and Kablare/Kablar camps, appears to 
be both unanimous and overwhelming. The Special Rapporteurs appreciate the work of UNMIK 
with respect to closing down these three contaminated camps, and relocating the majority of 
IDPs to the Osterode camp. However, it is alleged that Osterode camp is also located on 
contaminated soil. Furthermore, it is alleged that with the exception of members of the Mustafa 
family who have received treatment in Germany with the assistance of several NGOs, children 
affected by lead poisoning did not start to receive medical treatment until late August and that 
many remain to be treated.  
</p>
<p><b>Response received  
</b></p>
<p>136. By letter dated 16 April 2007, the UNMIK replied to the urgent appeal transmitted 
on 10 January 2007 by the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
health, the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment on human rights and the Independent 
Expert on Minority Issues concerning the camps for internally displaced persons affected by lead 
contamination in northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;. The UNMIK informed the Special Rapporteurs 
that the construction of two apartment blocks at Roma Mahala able to accommodate 24 families 
had been completed and that two similar apartments&#8217; blocks would have been completed by 
31 July 2007 for a total of 48 families. 12 of these apartments are earmarked for Cesmin 
Lug/Llug&#235; residents. At the time of sending this communication 170 Roma, Ashkalis or 
Egyptians persons had moved to Roma Mahala from camp Osterode and Cesmin Lug/Llug&#235;, as 
well as 130 Roma, Ashkalis or Egyptians from Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia. This left 
395 Roma, Ashkalis or Egyptians individuals living at Camps Osterode and 100 living at Cesmin 
Lug/Llug&#235;. Camp Osterode remains a Mitrovic&#235;/Mitrovica Municipality. Cesmin Lig/Llug&#235; is 
managed by UNMIK Administration Mitrovica (UAM) which provides the services of a full 
time nurse who operates a clinic that provides primary health care services to the remaining RAE 
community. UNMIK also informed that due to the prevailing political situation in the northern 
part of Mitrovbic&#235;/Mitrovica, Serbian politicians have clearly reiterated that they will not accept 
forced relocation under any circumstances. The UNMIK stated that the force closure of Cesmin 
Lug/Llug&#235; is impractical at this time but every effort is made by UNMIK to convince the 
remaining occupants to move voluntarily to Roma Mahala. 37 private houses have been 
constructed/reconstructed under the patronage of Danish Refugee Council with funds provided 
by the Swedish Government and the European Agency for Reconstruction. 20 more houses 
would have been occupied on 30 June 2007 as more Roma, Ashkalis and Egyptians households 
will occupy their former houses. Out of the 130 mentioned above, 49 individuals have moved 
into private housing and 81 into completed two apartment blocks; all from Montenegro and the 
Republic of Serbia. UNMIK also informed that the United Nations Development program would 
have taken over the Roma Mahala project from the UNMIK Department of Civil Administration, 
effective 1 June 2007. The UNDP will be responsible for the planning, execution and canvassing 
of potential donors in the second phase of the Roma Mahala project. On health issues, the 
UNMIK affirmed that the Camp Osterode is monitored periodically for lead contamination by 
the World Health Organization and UAM technical experts. Camp Osterode is a former Serbian 
Logistic Base occupying premises that are covered in concrete or asphalts. The WHO Chelation 
Therapy Clinic has been in operation since March 2006 and out of a population of 100 children, 
has treated 37 children with 12 children needing second phase therapy. The other children were 
able to recover through additional food supplements. The clinic will be removed to 
Roma Mahala on completion of the ambulanta presently completing construction. Public health </p>

</p>
<p>services are being offered to the Roma, Ashkalis and Egyptian communities at health clinics and 
public hospitals located in the southern and northern parts of Mitrovic&#235;/Mitrovica Municipality. 
The aim is to provide integrated health services and improved living conditions at Roma Mahala. 
UNMIK plans to hand over Camps Osterode to a successor organization by the end of 2007.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>137. The Special Rapporteur thanks the UNMIK for its reply to the joint allegation letter 
transmitted on 10 January 2007. He will continue to monitor the situation, and particularly the 
condition of Roma, Ashkalis and Egyptians families and individuals that are still living at 
Camps Osterode and at Cesmin Lug/Llug&#235;.
