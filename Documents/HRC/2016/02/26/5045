10 March 2010, and the renewed commitment to the implementation of the Convention

</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly</i> <i>concerned</i> that sexual violence and sexual<b> </b>abuse against children occurs 
in all regions of the world in various forms, contexts and settings, including by family 
members, that are all detrimental to child development and convinced that urgent and 
effective national action and international cooperation is needed to prevent and eradicate 
these violations,  
</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly</i> <i>concerned</i> also about the persistence of the practices of the sale of 
children, child slavery, the commercial sexual exploitation of children, child prostitution, 
sexual abuse and child pornography in many parts of the world, especially as fostered by 
the increasing use of the Internet and new technologies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> about the high incidence and appalling levels of brutality of rape 
and other forms of sexual violence committed against children, in the context of and 
associated with armed conflict, including, in some instances, the use or commissioning of 
rape and other forms of sexual violence to humiliate, dominate, instil fear and disperse 
and/or forcibly relocate a population,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to treat all forms of sexual violence and sexual abuse against 
children as criminal acts, punishable by law, as well as the duty to provide access to just 
and effective remedies and specialized assistance to victims, including medical, 
psychological and legal assistance, as well as effective counselling and social services, in a 
manner that is age-, gender- and disability-sensitive, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all forms of sexual violence and abuse against children in

against children should be prevented from working with children until such time as national 
mechanisms establish that they no longer pose a risk of harm to children; and, in this 
regard, encourages States to share relevant information, as appropriate, relating to 
conviction for offences of sexual violence against children, with a view to improving

existing national human rights institutions or general ombudsperson offices, that are 
sufficiently funded and accessible to children, which should play a key role in the

universal realization of rights of child victims of sexual violence and abuse; 
</p>

in order to prevent further victimization; 
</p>
<p> (k) To address the gender dimension of all forms of sexual violence and abuse 
against children and incorporate a gender perspective in all policies adopted and actions

violence at different ages and in different situations;  
</p>
<p> (l) To ensure the meaningful participation of children in all matters and
