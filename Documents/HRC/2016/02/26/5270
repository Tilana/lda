<p><b>12/&#8230;  Human rights and access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions of the Council on human rights and access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, resolution 7/22 of 28 March 2008, in which the Council 
created the mandate of independent expert on human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> relevant provisions of declarations and programmes with regard to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation adopted by major United Nations conferences and summits, 
and by the General Assembly at its special sessions and during follow-up meetings, inter alia, the 
Mar del Plata Action Plan on Water Development and Administration, adopted at the 
United Nations Water Conference in March 1977, Agenda 21, adopted at the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992, and the Habitat Agenda, adopted at 
the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in 1996,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with interest </i>of regional commitments and initiatives<b> </b>promoting the further 
realization of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
including in the Protocol on Water and Health, adopted by the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe in 1999, the European Charter on Water Resources, adopted by the 
Council of Europe in 2001, the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first Africa-South America 
summit in 2006, the message from Beppu, adopted at the first Asian-Pacific Water Summit 
in 2007, the Delhi Declaration, adopted at the third South Asian Conference on Sanitation 
in 2008, and the Cairo Declaration, adopted at the fifteenth summit of Heads of State and 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to implement fully 
the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing, in that context, the resolve of Heads of State 
and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to halve, by 2015, 
the proportion of people unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water, and to halve the 
proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as agreed in the Johannesburg Plan of 
Action, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 884 million people lack access to safe drinking water 
and that over 2.5 billion do not have access to basic sanitation,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that international human rights law instruments, including the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entail obligations for States parties in 
relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, <b> </b></p>

strategies and development plans;  </p>

 <p></p>

</p>

with other stakeholders, in order to address the lack of access to sanitation in a comprehensive

<p> (<i>d</i>) To ensure and promote access to information for, and the full, free, and meaningful 
participation of, local communities in the design, implementation and monitoring of such plans

of access to sanitation; 
</p>
<p>6. Also r<i>ecognizes</i> the important role of international cooperation and technical 
assistance played by the specialized agencies of the United Nations system, international and 
development partners as well as donor agencies, and stresses that more should be done when 
supporting efforts of States to address the lack of access to sanitation, and urges development 
partners to adopt a human rights-based<b> </b>approach when designing relevant development 
programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action;<b> </b></p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue to report on an annual basis to the 
Council and to submit an annual report to the General Assembly; </p>

expert in the discharge of her mandate, and to respond favourably to her requests for information 
and visits;

in accordance with its programme of work.
