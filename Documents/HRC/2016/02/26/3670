<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the potential of sport as a universal language that contributes to 
</p>
<p>educating people on the values of respect, diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means 
</p>
<p>to combat all forms of discrimination and promote an inclusive society, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that sport and major sporting events can be used to promote 
</p>
<p>awareness, understanding and the application of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing further</i> the potential of sport and major sporting events in contributing 
</p>
<p>to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and noting that, as declared at 
</p>
<p>the 2005 World Summit, sport has the potential to foster peace and development and to 
</p>
<p>contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding among peoples and nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the contribution of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>Sport for Development and Peace and the United Nations Office on Sport for Development 
</p>
<p>and Peace to identify synergy and complimentarity between sport and the work of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations to promote the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means to 
</p>
<p>combat all forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its eighteenth session (A/HRC/18/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the need to combat discrimination and intolerance where they occur 
</p>
<p>within and outside the sporting context, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 9/14 of 18 September 2008, in which 
</p>
<p>the Council urged the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take 
</p>
<p>measures, in consultation with various international sporting and other organizations, to 
</p>
<p>enable them to contribute to the struggle against racism and racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the imperative need to engage women and girls in the practice of sport 
</p>
<p>for development and peace and, in this regard, welcoming activities that aim to foster and 
</p>
<p>encourage such initiatives at the global level,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that special attention needs to be paid to ensuring non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, including the equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms by persons with disabilities, including their active participation in all aspects of 
</p>
<p>society, including sports, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging </i>the potential of sport and major sporting events to educate the youth 
</p>
<p>of the world and to promote their inclusion through sport practised without discrimination 
</p>
<p>of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires human understanding, tolerance, fair 
</p>
<p>play and solidarity,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging also</i> the benefits of regular sport, physical activity and play in the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
</p>
<p>mental health and as a means to prevent and treat illness and disease,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/4 of 18 October 2010, on sport as a 
</p>
<p>means to promote education, health, development and peace, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>emphasized and encouraged the use of sport as a vehicle to foster development and 
</p>
<p>strengthen education for children and young persons; prevent disease and promote health, 
</p>
<p>including the prevention of drug abuse; empower girls and women; foster the inclusion and 
</p>
<p>well-being of persons with disabilities; and facilitate social inclusion, conflict prevention 
</p>
<p>and peacebuilding, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution 64/4 of 19 October 2009, on the 
</p>
<p>building of a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal and, in this 
</p>
<p>context, welcoming the adoption on the same date of resolution 64/3, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly invited the International Olympic Committee to participate in its sessions and 
</p>
<p>work in the capacity of observer,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the valuable contribution that the appeal launched by the 
</p>
<p>International Olympic Committee for an Olympic Truce could make towards advancing the 
</p>
<p>purposes and principles of the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need to observe, within the framework of the Charter, the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Truce, individually and collectively, throughout the period beginning with the start of the 
</p>
<p>Games of the XXX Olympiad and ending with the closing of the XIV Paralympic Games, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the hosting of the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic 
</p>
<p>Games in the cities of London and Rio de Janeiro, respectively, the hosting of the 2014 
</p>
<p>Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi and the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in 
</p>
<p>PyeongChang, and stressing the opportunity to make use of these events to promote 
</p>
<p>awareness of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights among those watching and 
</p>
<p>participating and of how the principles of the Olympic Charter, aimed at, inter alia, non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, equality, inclusion, respect and mutual understanding, relate to the 
</p>
<p>Declaration and can translate into all aspects of society,  </p>


<p><i> Recognizing</i> therefore the need to reflect on the value of relevant principles 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Olympic Charter and on the value of good sporting example in achieving 
</p>
<p>the universal respect for and realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its nineteenth session, a 
</p>
<p>high-level interactive panel discussion to highlight, examine and suggest ways in which 
</p>
<p>sport and major sporting events, in particular the Olympic and Paralympic Games, can be 
</p>
<p>used to promote awareness and understanding of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the application of the principles enshrined therein;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to liaise with relevant special procedures, States and other stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to ensuring their participation in 
</p>
<p>the above-mentioned panel discussion;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.  
</p>
<p><i>37th meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i> 30 September 2011 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
