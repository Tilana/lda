Gwalla ventilation study : wl/ ﬁgarbara
A ventilation PFS has been completed and a feasibility study will
now compare the following options (all figures approximate at
+/—20% study accuracy):

(A) Increase ventilation infrastructure (on surface) and install
two 4.5m ventilation shafts to 1,500 mbs in two sections,
project capex $65 million, allows mining to at least 2,000 mbs
and extendable to 2,200 mbs with additional $10 million
capexl

(B) 'Do nothing’, project capex Snil, allows mining to base of
2016 Reserve at a reduced rate per annum

1. The project metrics are based on the PFS and subject to the assumptions contained therein.
The results may change as the feasibility studies progress.

Gwalia ventilation study : L ﬁéarbara

> The Gwalia life of mine plan used for the 2016 Ore Reserves and Mineral
Resources includes capital expenditure for the Option A ventilation upgrade.

> As a consequence of incorporating the proposed Option A ventilation
upgrade, Reserves and Resources at 30 June 2016 have increased by 297 koz
and 938 koz respectively below 1,740 mbs, and the mine plan has been
extended from 1,740 mbs to 1,940 mbs (in FY24).

> The PFS indicates that at current gold prices and internal discount rates
Option A is accretive to Company value.

> An investment decision is anticipated in December 2016. The current
indicative project timeline involves detailed engineering, preliminary work
(including underground development) and procurement to June 2017, with
shaft construction to commence in earnest in Ql September 2018, and a
construction period of 2 -2 1/2 years.
