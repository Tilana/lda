In re-examination DW-1 stated I paid $9000.00 to clear the account.

Analysis of the Evidence

From the evidence of the Plaintiff and the Defendant it is clear that they had an agreement for a van to be acquired in the name of the Defendants. The 2nd Defendant held a Mini bus permit. There is also no evidence disputing that the Plaintiff contributed $10,000.00 towards the deposit of the van. The Plaintiff was the guarantor of the finance arrangement that the Defendants had with Carpenters. 

The Court has the benefit of the Finance Debtor System, Ledger Account Enquiry (of Carpenters) of the Defendants which was submitted by the Plaintiff. This shows the payments made, account balance, balance due, arrears and with corresponding dates. 

The crucial evidence that this Court wishes to draw to the attention of the Partys is:-

-       
No written agreement. (by plaintiff)
-       
On face value. (by Plaintiff)
-       
For 3 years. (by Plaintiff)
-       
Van taken away from Plaintiff sometime in September 2007. (by Plaintiff) 
-       
Plaintiff agreed to pay deposit of $10,000 for the van. (by Plaintiff)
-       
Pay Defendants $50 per week (by Plaintiff)
-       
All payments and maintenance by the plaintiff ( by Defendant)
-       
Duration of finance by Carpenters was 3 years. (by defendant)

The Ledger Account Enquiry submitted by the Plaintiff shows arrears of $2979.22 as at 21st March 2007. Account Balance at that date was $10,801.18. The Plaintiff also tendered evidence that he fitted new engine in the van. This is supported by receipts dated 3rd May 2007 and 7th May 2007 respectively. The Plaintiffs evidence was that the van was taken by the Defendants in September 2007. This therefore means that the Plaintiff still had the vehicle with him when the engine broke-down in May 2007. The Plaintiff also gave evidence in November the van was back on the road. The next day the Defendants took it. The documentary evidence of the receipts of the change of engine do not reconcile with the dates given by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff cannot claim for the repairs to the engine

From the Defendants evidence he cleared the arrears with Carpenters. The Plaintiff in PE-8  his recollection of agreement writes that the van was re-possessed in November 2007. And balance due to Carpenters was $9000.00 in November 2007. This supports the Defendants assertion that the Plaintiff was no up to-date with the Payments to Carpenters and was in arrears. The finance term was 3 years and by November 2007 was to have been paid in full as the loan was taken in November 2004. 

The Defendant has tendered evidence to prove that he cleared the arrears due to Carpenters. The Courts finds that the Plaintiff did not make regular payments to Carpenters.

There is no evidence in this case as to what is supposed to happen after the expiry of the 3 year term when the Plaintiffs lease of the mini-bus finished. Was he to be refunded his $10,000.00 by the Defendants? The Plaintiff who is educated and knowledgeable knew the risks of the investment. He paid a deposit for the Van and had use of the van for almost 3 years. He paid the defendants and made payments to Carpenters. At the end of the 3 year loan term for the van Carpenters was still owed $9000.00 which was to be paid by the Plaintiff. This later was cleared by the Defendant. The Plaintiff now cannot claim the $10,000.00 deposit he paid for the van. The Court finds that there was no agreement for refund of the deposit after the 3 year period. 

The Plaintiff also made payments to Carpenters from the money earned in his use of the van. The Plaintiff knew the Defendants were legal owners of the vehicle and he was paying off for their van from the money he earned in using the van. The Plaintiff cannot now claim the deposit, the payments made and any money he spent on his use of the vehicle. The Plaintiffs claim fails. 

The Partys have the right to appeal.
