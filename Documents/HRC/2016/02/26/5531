<p><b>11/&#8230;  Trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 and 63/194 of 
18 December 2008, and also its resolution 8/12 of 18 June 2008, in which the Council extended 
the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and declarations, 
including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention, and 
recalling the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of 
the Prostitution of Others, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that women and girl victims are often 
subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their 
gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these forms of 
discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the 
enjoyment of them, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted 
international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of 
origin, transit and destination for it to be eradicated, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent 
trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for 
their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of 
trafficking in women and children, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of existing legislation, the 
lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics and the lack of 
resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in 
persons in some parts of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and 
reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and 
multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full 
enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, 
transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, presented to the Council at its tenth session, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation also </i>of the report of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the latest developments within the United Nations 
relating to combating trafficking in persons and on the relevant activities of the Office, and 
taking note of<b> </b>the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, presented to the Council at its tenth session, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime Open-ended Interim Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, 
held in Vienna on 14 and 15 April 2009, and the recommendations resulting therefrom, and the 
interactive dialogue on the theme &#8220;Taking collective action to end human trafficking&#8221; of the 
General Assembly, held on 13 May 2009, which included a discussion on the advisability of a 
global plan of action against human trafficking, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming especially</i> the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies and 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the vulnerability of victims to 
human rights violations, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Affirms</i> that it is essential to place the protection of human rights at the centre of 
measures taken to prevent and end trafficking in persons, and to protect, assist and provide 
access to adequate redress to victims, including the possibility of obtaining compensation from 
the perpetrators; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The high number of people, especially women and children, in particular from 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition, who are being trafficked to 
developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and others 
who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard for 
dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international 
law and contrary to international standards; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the purposes of 
exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation, for trafficking in 
women as brides and for sex tourism, for child pornography, paedophilia and any other forms of 
sexual exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and the 
denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> Governments: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To take appropriate measures to address the root factors, including external factors, 
that encourage trafficking in persons for prostitution and other forms of commercialized sex, </p>

 <p></p>
<p>forced marriages and forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 
removal of organs, including by strengthening existing legislation or by considering the 
enactment of anti-trafficking legislation and the adoption of national plans of action; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and penalize 
traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by imposing sanctions 
against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without making accusations by, or the 
participation of, the victims of trafficking a precondition to the prosecution of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full respect for 
their human rights, including, where appropriate, through legislation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To provide resources, as appropriate, for the comprehensive protection and 
assistance to victims of trafficking, including access to adequate social, necessary medical and 
psychological care and services, including those related to HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal 
assistance in a language that they can understand and helplines, and to cooperate in this regard, 
as appropriate, with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not 
penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as a result of 
actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are victims of exploitation, 
and encourages Governments to provide trafficked persons with access to specialized support 
and assistance, regardless of their immigration status; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To devise, enforce and strengthen effective gender- and age-sensitive measures to 
combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking, especially in women and children, including for 
sexual and labour exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy that integrates 
a human rights perspective, and to draw up, as appropriate, national plans of action in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that 
fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in persons, including the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>demand created by sex tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and to enhance, in this 
regard, preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked 
persons and to ensure their accountability; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To establish mechanisms, where appropriate, in cooperation with the international 
community, to combat the use of the Internet to facilitate trafficking in persons and crimes 
related to sexual or other forms of exploitation, and to strengthen international cooperation to 
investigate and prosecute trafficking facilitated by the use of the Internet; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration, criminal justice 
and other relevant officials, including personnel participating in peacekeeping operations, in 
preventing and responding effectively to trafficking in persons, including the identification and 
treatment of victims with full respect for their human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To conduct information campaigns for the general public, including children, aimed 
at promoting awareness of the dangers associated with all forms of trafficking and at 
encouraging the public, including the victims of trafficking themselves, to report on instances of 
trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To support allocation of the necessary resources, as appropriate, in cooperation with 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to strengthen preventive action, in 
particular education for women and men, as well as for girls and boys, on the human rights of 
women and children, gender equality, self-respect and mutual respect; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) To consider setting up or strengthening a national coordinating mechanism, for 
example, a national rapporteur or an inter-agency body, with the participation of civil society, 
including non-governmental organizations, to encourage the exchange of information and to 
report on data, root causes, factors and trends in trafficking;  
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) To enhance information-sharing and data-collection capacities as a way of promoting 
cooperation to combat trafficking in persons, including through the systematic collection of sex- 
and age-disaggregated data; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>n</i>) To enhance cooperation with each other and with relevant intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations to ensure effective prevention and countering of trafficking in 
people, and to consider strengthening existing regional cooperation and mechanisms aimed at 
combating trafficking in persons or to establish such mechanisms where they do not exist; 
</p>
<p> (<i>o</i>) To consider signing and ratifying, as a matter of priority, in the case of Governments 
that have not yet done so, and for States parties to implement relevant United Nations legal 
instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and 
the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing the Convention, and to take immediate 
steps to incorporate provisions of the Protocol into domestic legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to continue to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and to consider responding favourably to 
requests to visit their countries, and to provide all necessary information related to the mandate 
to enable the mandate holder to fulfil the duties of the mandate effectively and, in this regard, 
expresses its appreciation to the large number of Governments that provided responses to the 
initial questionnaire on trafficking developed by the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> Governments to include information on measures and best practices to 
combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in their national reports submitted 
for the universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Encourages </i>Governments to take into account, as a useful tool to integrate a human 
rights-based approach, the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1) developed by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, including, as appropriate, in the formulation, review and 
implementation of legislation, policies and programmes aimed at preventing and eradicating 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and providing assistance to victims; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to provide or to support, within 
existing resources, training at the national level for all stakeholders on the integration of a human 
rights approach into the prevention and response to trafficking in persons, including the 
identification and treatment of victims with full respect for their human rights; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to enhance its efforts within the

resources, and in close coordination with the Special Rapporteur, a two-day seminar aimed at 
identifying opportunities and challenges in the development of rights-based responses to 
trafficking in persons with a view to acknowledging emerging good practices and further 
promoting the practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking, with the participation of Governments, the Special Rapporteur
