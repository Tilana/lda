<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report analyses the progress made by Guatemala in implementing recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions following his 
visit to Guatemala from 21-25 August 2006 (A/HRC/4/20/Add.2). Guatemala has seen a 
significant rise in its homicide rate since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Particularly concerning 
are the continued attacks on human rights defenders, increases in the killings of women, and the 
emergence of new targets (public transit operators) of unlawful killings. The State continues to 
inadequately investigate and respond to unlawful killings. Much needed improvements to the 
criminal justice institutions, witness protection, budget allocation, and fiscal policy have not 
been implemented. Significant improvement has been achieved with the establishment of the 
International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The CICIG has the potential 
to improve criminal investigation and prosecution procedures, witness protection, and to assist 
the State in implementing necessary national security legislation. </p>

<p><b>I.  METHODOLOGY 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report analyses the progress made by Guatemala in implementing recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions following his 
visit to Guatemala from 21-25 August 2006 (A/HRC/4/20/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with past practice,<b>1</b> the follow-up report was compiled based on information 
provided by the Government, as well as through consultation with domestic and international 
civil society, and by reference to publicly available reports and materials.<b>2</b> The Special 
Rapporteur requested from the Government and from civil society actors information on what 
steps had been taken to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur. Information 
on the non-implementation of recommendations was also sought. In addition, information was 
sought on the current state of the phenomenon of extrajudicial executions in the country, and 
particularly on whether and how the situation had improved, deteriorated or remained static since 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. 
</p>
<p>3. This follow-up report and the follow-up report on the Philippines (A/HRC/11/2/Add.8) 
constitute an important component to one of the principal working methods of the Special 
Rapporteur - conducting country visits to investigate allegations of violations of the right to 
life. Country visits provide an opportunity for the Special Rapporteur to ascertain the facts on a 
first-hand basis, to analyse in detail the forms and causes of unlawful killings, and to engage in 
constructive dialogue with the country concerned. Following the visit, the Special Rapporteur 
prepares a detailed report on his findings, including recommendations directed at reducing 
unlawful killings and promoting accountability. Country visits can only achieve their full 
potential if Governments give real consideration to these recommendations. Accordingly, the 
Commission on Human Rights requested States to carefully examine recommendations and to 
report to the Special Rapporteur on actions taken on the recommendations (res. 2004/37). 
</p>
<p>4. In order to assess the extent to which States had implemented recommendations, in 2006, 
the Special Rapporteur initiated follow-up reports on visits conducted. The first follow-up 
report (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2) concerned the recommendations made by his predecessor,

report (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3) was issued on the first two missions conducted by Special Rapporteur 
Philip Alston - Sri Lanka and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to officials of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, and to Sarah Knuckey, Joanna Edwards, and Wade McMullen from New York 
University School of Law, for their assistance in the preparation of these reports. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur visited Guatemala from 21-25 August 2006 and published his final 
report on 19 February 2007. In his report, the Special Rapporteur examined the severe security 
crisis in Guatemala, a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, and where the 
perpetrators of grave crimes rarely face justice. He noted that Guatemala bears responsibility for 
this crisis, both <i>directly</i> - through killings by State actors - and <i>indirectly</i> - through the State&#8217;s 
failure to protect its citizens and prosecute perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>7. The report emphasized that Guatemala stood at a crossroads: it could either establish a 
working system of criminal justice based on human rights and the rule of law, or it could fall 
back on the <i>mano dura</i> (hard-handed) tactics of the past by broadening police discretion and 
reducing civil liberties in pursuit of &#8220;security&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur attributed the existence 
of the crisis to a lack of political will within the State, which had failed to enact important 
legislation required by the Peace Accords and to allocate sufficient funds to enable its criminal 
justice system to function properly.<b>3</b> He recommended that Guatemala undertake stronger efforts 
to end impunity, including by: reforming and expanding the criminal justice system to 
effectively investigate and prosecute murders; adopting the legislation required to implement the 
International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala and the package of security related 
legislation necessary to realize the Peace Accords; establishing a witness protection programme; 
and increasing the funds allocated to the institutions of the criminal justice system. 
8. This follow-up report documents the continued deterioration of the security situation in 
Guatemala since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2006 mission. The types and quantities of killings 
have increased. Social cleansing, the murder of women, lynchings, attacks on human rights 
defenders, and prison violence continue to be significant problems. The year 2008 also saw the 
rise of a new category of violence: attacks on conductors of public transit. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Peace Accords, which were signed in 1996, provided a comprehensive plan for 
</p>
<p>transforming Guatemala from a country that relied on brutal counter-insurgency tactics to one 
that maintained order while fully respecting the civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights of all of its citizens. The Accords consisted of a series of agreements dealing with human 
rights, the establishment of a truth commission, the rights of indigenous peoples, the agrarian 
situation, the role of the armed forces, the terms of a ceasefire, the constitutional and electoral 
regime, the integration of guerrilla forces, and mechanisms for verifying compliance with the 
agreements. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>9. Guatemala has inadequately responded to these unlawful killings, and the country 
continues to suffer from a high rate of impunity. The main causes for this continue to be 
deficiencies in the police, prosecutorial, and justice systems, and the refusal of witnesses to 
testify due to the danger of reprisals. Guatemala has not succeeded in addressing any of these 
factors. As a result, approximately 98 per cent of crimes continue to go unpunished. 
</p>
<p>10. However, and despite this sobering picture, various steps taken over the last year by 
President Alvaro Colom suggest that there are reasons to be optimistic that Guatemala has begun 
moving towards reform. Colom&#8217;s administration, which took power in January 2008, has made 
efforts to vet the police force and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, and remove those found 
not to be acting in the public interest. Some steps have been taken to address the problems of 
witness protection and national security. Importantly, Guatemala established the International 
Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which is tasked with investigating and 
prosecuting clandestine security groups. CICIG has already begun investigations in several 
cases, and has been working with the Government to reform the justice system. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>11. In 2001, there were 3,230 homicides in Guatemala. By 2006, the year that the Special 
Rapporteur visited Guatemala, this had increased to a startling 5,884. In 2007, there was a 
slight drop, to 5,781. But in 2008, the number of homicides had increased dramatically again, 
to 6,292 - making last year the deadliest year since the signing of the Peace Accords.<b>4</b> This 
represents a 95 per cent increase between 2001-2008, and an average of 17 killings per day. 
During the second half of 2008, which was significantly more violent than the first, the homicide 
rate averaged 20 killings per day. At least 687 of the victims were women, and 591 victims were 
children or adolescents. Over 10 per cent appear to have signs of torture.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>12. A large threat to peace and security in Guatemala is the presence of regional organized 
criminal groups involved in the drug trade. Guatemala&#8217;s geographic location - halfway between 
the growers in the South and the buyers in the North - and its weak institutions, combined with 
the near total impunity for serious crimes, leave it in serious danger of becoming a narco-State. 
For this reason, the actions that the Government chooses to take at this time are particularly 
crucial.

<p>signs of torture, for a total of 10.81 per cent of those analysed; the methods of torture included 
burning, mutilation, sexual violence, elimination of an opportunity to resist binding and gagging 
the victim, stoning, and strangulation. </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  TYPES OF KILLINGS 
</b></p>
<p>13. In his report, the Special Rapporteur indicated several particularly problematic types of 
killings that occur in Guatemala: social cleansing; lynching; femicide; attacks targeting people 
for being gay, lesbian, transgender or transsexual;<b>6</b> attacks on human rights defenders; and 
violence against those in prisons. In addition, in the last few years a new form of violence has 
taken hold - attacks against conductors of public transit. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Social cleansing 
</b></p>
<p>14. The phenomenon of social cleansing persists, with detailed studies by NGOs suggesting 
that approximately 8-10 per cent of killings are carried out with the aim of &#8220;weeding out&#8221; 
suspected gang members and other criminals. While social cleansing is often carried out by 
organized criminal groups, often with the support of local authorities and private security 
agencies, investigations by the Procuradur&#237;a de los Derechos Humanos (PDH) and NGOs found 
continued involvement in at least some of these cases by police forces, both directly and 
indirectly.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>15. In his 2006 report, the Special Rapporteur found credible evidence of the involvement by 
the Divisi&#243;n de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal (DINC) of the Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil (PNC) in social 
cleansing. He found that while the killings were more than just the actions of a few rogue 
officers, they had not &#8220;risen to the level of officially-sanctioned policy&#8221;.<b>8</b> After the PNC was 
implicated in the murder of three Salvadorian Parliamentarians in March 2007, the Minister of 
the Interior was removed from office, along with over 1,900 police officers. Some civil society 
interlocutors have noted that this signalled a positive shift in the culture of the police leadership. 
</p>
<p>16. Nonetheless, the State has not given the absolute and categorical rejection to these forms of 
extrajudicial executions that the Special Rapporteur recommended in his report.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Lynching 
</b></p>
<p>17. The PDH reports that there were 18 individuals killed by lynching in 2008. While this 
represents a reduction on the average numbers (23 to 54) killed in the period 1996-2001, 
there has been little change since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2006 visit. In 2006 and 2007, there 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Updated information on attacks in Guatemala against those perceived to be gay, lesbian, 
</p>
<p>transgender or transsexual was not provided.

</b>  See PDH Report, p. 210 (&#8220;En [la &#8216;limpieza social&#8217;] no se puede descartar la participaci&#243;n de

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  For example, two police officers accused of having assassinated a group of alleged delinquents 
</p>
<p>in September 2007 are currently being prosecuted. However, there has been no investigation or 
prosecution of the leadership structures within the National Police or the Interior Ministry from 
the prior administration, who are suspected to have been involved in these tactics. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.7

</p>
<p>were 18 and 20 lynchings respectively. In his 2007 report, the Special Rapporteur had analysed 
MINUGUA&#8217;s 2002 extensive study of the phenomenon and supported its reasoned 
recommendations.<b>10</b> As was the case when the Special Rapporteur visited Guatemala in 2006, the 
majority of lynchings continue to be carried out against individuals suspected of being 
responsible for robberies. However, the Special Rapporteur is aware of no measures taken to 
address these killings. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Femicide 
</b></p>
<p>18. In 2008, an estimated 722 women were murdered in Guatemala. The number of such 
killings has dramatically risen over the last eight years (303 women were reported killed 
in 2001). The majority of women killed are between 16 and 30 years old, and are killed by 
strangulation.<b>11</b> Approximately 14 per cent of victims show signs of torture, and 
approximately 13 per cent show signs of sexual abuse.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>19. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2007 report, he noted that the causes of the dramatic upward 
trend in the murder of women were poorly understood, and he called for further research so that 
tailored strategies could be adopted to reduce violence against women. Unfortunately, the causes 
of femicide are still not properly understood, and the State has failed to identify the causes of this 
rapid increase in violence. The justice system continues to fail to adequately investigate and 
prosecute such cases.<b>13</b> Police continue to demonstrate a gender bias in the early stages of 
investigations, discrediting the victim either by blaming her for the crime, claiming she is a 
member of a gang, speculating about her sexual history or alleging that she is a prostitute. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2008, Congress passed the Law Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against 
Women.<b>14</b> The law criminalizes any form of economic, sexual, psychological, and physical 
violence against women. The law is a step in the right direction, drawing resources and attention 
to a growing problem, and has resulted in an increase in complaints from women and requests 
for protection. However, the law lacks clear and uniform guidelines, which is inhibiting its 
implementation. Furthermore, while there has been an increase in the resources to deal with 
these complaints, most of the progress that has occurred has been concentrated in the capital.

</p>
<p><b>D.  Attacks on human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>21. Human rights defenders continue to operate in an environment characterized by fear and 
intimidation. They are regularly subjected to death threats as well as physical attacks. In both 
2007 and 2008, there were approximately 200 attacks on human rights defenders.<b>15</b> In 2008, 
there were 12 reported killings of human rights defenders. Such killings have pervasive effects 
across society - spreading fear and creating a severe chilling effect on human rights work 
throughout the country. The greatest threats remain against those working in the areas of 
economic and social rights, and those seeking accountability for past atrocities. Attacks against 
human rights defenders are still not adequately investigated, and requests for protection are met 
with slow and insufficient responses.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>22. In January 2008, the Government created a unit (the Institute for the Analysis of Attacks 
against Human Rights Defenders) within the Interior Ministry to study the patterns of attacks on 
human rights defenders. A human rights unit in the DINC was also created to respond to 
complaints of threats and intimidation. While these were justly celebrated achievements, the 
heads of each of the new units were recently removed from office, and the future of both 
initiatives is currently uncertain. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Violence against prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>23. Prisons continue to be sites of torture and killings. The Government reported 31 violent 
deaths in prison between 2007 and 2008. Many of these were at the hands of other inmates, 
particularly members of youth gangs. In one incident, which demonstrates the complex 
relationship between prisons, organized crime, and security, three Salvadorian members of the 
Central American Parliament and their driver were kidnapped in February 2007, a few hours 
after entering the country with a Guatemalan security detail. They were tortured and shot, and 
their bodies were later found on a ranch outside Guatemala City. The weapons used were 
registered to the Criminal Investigations Division (DINC) and investigations pointed to police 
officers who were allegedly members of an organized crime unit operating within the PNC.<b>17</b> 
Four police officers were arrested in conjunction with the case and sent to the maximum-security 
prison, El Boquer&#243;n. However, shortly before they were to give testimony to the FBI on the case, 
the officers were attacked, their throats were slit and they were shot inside their cells. These 
assassinations were originally attributed to a group of gang members within the prisons; 
however, they were later cleared. Nonetheless, two of the formerly accused were among seven 
inmates tortured and killed in the Pavoncito jail.<b>18</b> The case remains unsolved. 
</p>

</p>
<p>24. As discussed by the Special Rapporteur in his original report, the fact that prisoners are 
killed by fellow inmates does not absolve the State of legal responsibility for the deaths under 
international law.<b>19</b> First, the circumstances of some cases suggest that prison wardens were 
either directly or indirectly involved in the abuses. Second, the State has a due diligence 
obligation to take measures to prevent murders, and the custodial context permits the State to 
take unusually effective measures to prevent abuses by private actors. The Special Rapporteur 
has received no information to indicate that the State has taken any steps to fulfil these 
obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Attacks on public transit operators 
</b></p>
<p>25. The last few years have seen the surge of a new wave of violence - against conductors of 
public transit, their assistants, and business owners. The focus of the violence has been on bus 
drivers in the capital. In 2008, 165 drivers and 12 co-pilots were assassinated. The deaths of five 
drivers were reported in the first two weeks of 2009 alone. These assassinations are attributed to 
the <i>maras</i>, who extort money from bus drivers, sometimes on a daily basis. If the money is not 
paid, the driver and/or the assistant are assassinated. Killings were usually committed in front of 
passengers in broad daylight, often on busy streets. 
</p>
<p>26. To the knowledge of the Special Rapporteur, the State has taken no specific measures to 
study or address these killings. The motives for the killings are assumed to be largely financial, 
and the rapid rise in effect of impunity for prior killings, and the ease with which money can 
continually be extorted. While the killings may have a financial motive, they also have the 
political effect of destabilizing the State and contributing to the general sense of insecurity in 
Guatemala. Each assassination sparks protests by other drivers, which in turn paralyses the 
public transport system and leaves thousands without a way to get to work. As such, it has the 
effect of creating social unrest and undermining the Government, which has been slow to 
respond. CICIG has now begun investigating these assassinations, and should continue this 
important work, bring prosecutions, and continue the process of dismantling the gangs 
responsible. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ASSESSMENT OF REFORM MEASURES UNDERTAKEN 
</b></p>
<p>27. To address the high rates of unlawful killings and impunity in Guatemala, the Special 
Rapporteur recommended a number of reforms to the criminal justice sector, witness protection, 
the method of investigations, the role of foreign donors, and fiscal policy. As might be assumed 
given the worsening security situation over the last few years, these reforms have been only 
partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Establishment of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala  
</b></p>
<p>28. In his February 2007 report, the Special Rapporteur supported the establishment of the 
International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). While not a panacea for 
addressing impunity, it had the potential to play an important role in pushing cases through the 
</p>

</p>
<p>criminal justice system. The CICIG was subsequently established, and began its work in 
January 2008.<b>20</b> The CICIG&#8217;s mandate is to investigate and dismantle violent criminal 
networks.<b>21</b> It is not a replacement for Guatemala&#8217;s criminal justice institutions; rather, it may 
carry out investigations and act as a complimentary prosecutor, helping to bring representative 
cases to trial in national courts. The stated goal of the CICIG is not just to prosecute these cases 
but also to strengthen the national criminal justice system and demonstrate that it can be made to 
work.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>29. To date, there are important reasons to be optimistic about CICIG&#8217;s work. It has signed 
cooperation agreements with the Office of the Public Prosecutor and the Ministry of the Interior. 
These have allowed the CICIG to create a Special Prosecution Unit which is able to bring cases. 
The Minister of the Interior assigned 30 members of the National Civil Police (PNC) to CICIG, 
to create a joint PNC-CICIG police force. The existence of this joint police force is designed to 
facilitate the investigation of the cases CICIG chooses to pursue. Together with the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, CICIG provided these 
officers with training on how to investigate extrajudicial executions, the use of firearms, and the 
function of the police in respecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>30. In his August 2006 report, the Special Rapporteur noted the dysfunctional relationship 
between the police and the Office of the Public Prosecutor. In a step towards combating this, the 
CICIG has encouraged the creation of joint investigative teams, with the hope that, as the CICIG 
international staff are gradually replaced, these police officers and prosecutors will be able to 
take over an increasing amount of the work of the CICIG. 
</p>
<p>31. CICIG is currently investigating approximately 20 open cases and is prosecuting 4 cases 
together with local officials. The cases focus on targeting the clandestine networks within 
Guatemala; they include a gunfight between narco-trafficking groups which led to at least 
11 deaths and several injuries in Zacapa province, which is being brought in conjunction with the 
Special Prosecutor for Drug Activities. Because the CICIG&#8217;s mandate is to assist with the 
investigation and prosecutions, each of these cases also helps train the local police and 
investigators working on the case. In addition, the pursuit of each case functions to build 
capacity and trust in Guatemala&#8217;s justice system. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  The Secretary-General appointed a Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Spain, 
</p>
<p>Carlos Castresana Fern&#225;ndez, as Commissioner. Currently the staff is made up of a diverse, 
mostly international staff, with the hope that the number of Guatemalan staff will be increased in 
the future. See CICIG report, &#8220;One Year Later&#8221;. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  CICIG&#8217;s functions include &#8220;determining the existence of illegal security groups and 
clandestine security structures, collaborating with the State in dismantling of such groups and 
structures, promoting the investigation, criminal prosecution and punishment of crimes 
committed by their members, and recommending to the State the adoption of public policies for 
eradicating such groups and structures and preventing their re-emergence&#8221;. CICIG report , &#8220;One 
Year Later&#8221;.

</b>  CICIG report, &#8220;One Year Later&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>32. While CICIG should continue to receive strong support, neither Guatemala nor the 
international community should fall into the trap of seeing CICIG as &#8220;the&#8221; solution to 
Guatemala&#8217;s failing criminal justice system. While its international staff and independent 
funding have guaranteed a certain level of independence, it still faces obstruction from police 
and government officials. CICIG has the power to file criminal and/or administrative complaints 
against civil servants who contribute to impunity by interfering with their investigations. While 
progress is being made in this area, corruption extends through all sectors of society in 
Guatemala, including the legislative and executive branches. Since CICIG&#8217;s power only extends 
to civil servants, its efficacy as a method for eradicating corruption outside of the PNC and the 
judiciary is limited. More importantly, CICIG must be seen as one component of a package of 
necessary reforms to the criminal justice sector. CICIG&#8217;s mandate is limited to organized crime 
syndicates, and so it cannot address other sources of crime. While it is positioned to contribute to 
the training of police and prosecutors, the numbers are small, and do not represent the form of 
change necessary to effect structural reform. CICIG&#8217;s term will expire in September 2009. While 
Guatemala should extend its mandate for a second two-year term, this should serve as a reminder 
that CICIG is a temporary solution to a lasting problem. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Efforts to reform the police and the prosecution service 
</b></p>
<p>33. Together with encouraging the establishment of the CICIG, the Special Rapporteur also 
recommended that Congress should greatly increase the funds allocated to the criminal justice 
institutions, should reform and expand the PNC and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, and 
address the dysfunctional relationship between the public prosecutors and the police. 
</p>
<p>34. The expansion and increase in resources to the criminal justice institutions that the Special 
Rapporteur recommended have not occurred. Rather, the police force continues to be 
understaffed, underfunded, and undertrained. Corruption and ineffectiveness are widespread. The 
dysfunctional relationship between the PNC and the Office of the Prosecutor continues to stymie 
effective coordination and prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>35. However, there have been some efforts at reform of the police force directed at reducing 
the number of unlawful killings. The killings of the Salvadorian Parliamentarians were seen as 
public evidence of the reach of the various clandestine security networks within the State itself. 
As a result of the public outcry, both the Minister of the Interior and the head of the PNC were 
removed from their positions in March 2007. The new administration then instituted three purges 
of the PNC, eventually removing a total of 1,929 individuals. Unfortunately, despite evidence of 
the involvement of the DINC, only 27 of those removed were from this division. 
</p>
<p>36. Despite the purges, the PNC continues to be implicated in serious abuses. For example, the 
Office of Professional Responsibility of the National Civil Police (PNC) reported that they had 
investigated 32 accusations of killings involving PNC personnel and determined that PNC 
personnel were responsible for the deaths in 18 of the 32 cases (with 14 cases remaining under 
investigation). Particularly well-known cases include that of Mario Caal, who was killed by the 
use of excessive force by PNC officers, and the relatives of the mayor of Ocos, San Marcos, for 
which three officers from the Department of Criminal Investigation (DINC) were accused. In 
another well-known case, the PNC were implicated in the kidnapping and eventual execution of 
a group of adolescents. While this shows the difficulty in reforming the police, the State must 
continue to vet and remove officers who cannot fulfil the requirements of a democratic police </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>force. At the same time, current officers must receive training and the resources required to 
function effectively. While the establishment of the CICIG-PNC force is a useful step, the 
30 officers involved make up only a small fraction of the total police force and cannot make up 
for a lack of training in the rest of the organization. 
</p>
<p>37. The Office of the Public Prosecutor has also begun an internal review process. The 
installation of a new Attorney-General in August 2008 brought about a review of the Office&#8217;s 
members and the removal of 10 public prosecutors. These changes have increased the level of 
transparency and collaboration of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, resulting in the creation of an office to 
develop investigations with CICIG and the creation of a work plan designating priority topics. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reforms to witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>38. In his first report, the Special Rapporteur stressed the importance of instituting an effective 
witness protection programme. Without it, witnesses would continue to be too afraid to testify, 
especially in cases involving abuses by State actors. Since his visit, the Ministry of Justice 
approved in 2007 the Regulations on the Law of Protection of Subjects, Proceedings and Persons 
Connected with the Administration of Criminal Justice,<b>23</b> which establishes the regulations and 
organs governing witness protection. To the knowledge of the Special Rapporteur, the law has 
however been left without the structure that would allow it to be effectively applied. 
</p>
<p>39. As a result, CICIG has focused strongly on the need to improve security for witnesses and 
members of the judiciary who are involved in high profile cases and is working with the 
Government to completely rebuild the witness protection programme. The CICIG is currently in 
the process of trying to create special, high security courts to deal with cases involving 
transnational criminal networks, which are currently not being prosecuted because of security 
concerns. The courts would be located in the capital of Guatemala, but would have jurisdiction 
over crimes committed throughout the country, particularly crimes committed in the border areas 
where there are drug-affiliated gangs. In addition to the creation of the special courts, CICIG has 
suggested allowing witnesses to testify via video conference, and recommended the creation of a 
maximum-security prison to hold former criminal members who are testifying against their 
colleagues. Such measures would assist greatly in protecting witnesses, and thereby enable the 
successful prosecution of perpetrators. The Government should work with CICIG to ensure the 
implementation of these reforms. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  National security legislation 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the package of security-related legislation 
needed to realize the Peace Accords be implemented. In partial fulfilment of that 
recommendation, in 2008, Congress approved the Law on the National Security System 
Framework,<b>24</b> the objective of which is to establish regulations to coordinate activities relating to 
domestic and foreign security and intelligence. The Framework creates a National Security

<p>Council, tasked with defining and getting approved the Strategic Security Agenda and the 
Strategic Security Plan and coordinating the various agencies responsible for national security 
issues.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>41. However, Guatemala has not finished implementing the package of legislation much 
needed to bring crime under control. While CICIG is working with the State and various civil 
society organizations to reform and implement security related legislation, Guatemala has still 
not passed the Law on Arms and Munitions, which would limit the number of weapons each 
individual could buy, despite the fact that it has been pending in Congress for six years. 
Guatemala has also failed to pass the Law on Private Security. Both of these laws are necessary 
in order to address the causes of violence in Guatemala, where over 80 per cent of killings are 
committed with firearms, and where private security officers are well known to be involved in 
social cleansing. The Law on the National Intelligence System is also currently pending. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Fiscal policy and the role of foreign donors 
</b></p>
<p>42. In his February 2007 report, the Special Rapporteur concluded that the crisis in relation to 
extrajudicial executions could be attributed in part to the Government&#8217;s failure to behave in a 
fiscally responsible manner, and to tax sufficiently so that adequate resources could be allocated 
to the police and justice systems. There have been some improvements in the allocation of 
resources, including a 70 per cent budget increase between 2006 and 2009 to the PDH. However, 
Guatemala has not made the changes to its fiscal policy recommended by the Special 
Rapporteur. The State has acknowledged that the low budgets of the PNC, the prison system and 
the judicial system need to be improved. Given the increase in the prison population, the current 
budget for the prison system is not sufficient to provide for even basic services for prisoners. The 
low salaries of police and prison guards leave them vulnerable to corruption and the influence of 
criminal organizations. 
</p>
<p>43. The establishment of CICIG has in some ways made the situation more complex. CICIG is 
funded entirely by international donations; as a result, any improvements that it is making are not 
part of Guatemala&#8217;s budget. There is thus a danger that the State will allow CICIG to replace its 
own functions rather than provide the resources necessary to build its own institutions. 
Moreover, without a change in its fiscal policy, Guatemala will not have the resources to 
continue the work CICIG is doing when the CICIG&#8217;s short mandate is over. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>Since August 2006, the security situation in Guatemala has deteriorated in nearly 
every category. Furthermore, many of the reforms under consideration at the time of the 
Rapporteur&#8217;s original mission have still not been implemented.</b>

<p>45. <b>As was the case when the Special Rapporteur visited Guatemala, the policies that 
need to be pursued to improve the security situation and improve accountability for crimes 
are well known to Guatemalans. It is crucial that Guatemala renew the mandate of the 
CICIG, which is set to expire in September of this year, so that it can continue to dismantle 
violent criminal networks. Guatemala needs to develop a responsible fiscal policy, and 
allocate sufficient funds to the chronically underfunded criminal justice institutions. It also 
needs to ensure that funds are set aside so that Guatemala can continue CICIG&#8217;s work, 
without full reliance on international donations. Priority should also be given to improving 
witness protection, and Guatemala should work with CICIG to establish the necessary 
safety mechanisms. Guatemala should also continue to implement the pending national 
security legislation, particularly the Law on Arms and Munitions and the Law on Private 
Security.</b> </p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF FOLLOW-UP TO EACH RECOMMENDATION 
</b></p>
<p><b> Many kinds of violence afflicting Guatemala are poorly understood, impeding efforts 
to craft solutions and mobilize coalitions for change; 
</b></p>
<p><b> Continuities between current violations and those from the period of armed 
confrontation are surprisingly widespread and should be the cause of great concern among 
both the national and international community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> The resort to executions of suspects and other persons considered socially undesirable 
as a strategy for ensuring order and reducing crime should be absolutely and categorically 
rejected at every level of Government; 
</b>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> While there is insufficient information to reliably determine how many killings are 
committed by State agents versus private individuals, both appear to be widespread. Any 
strategy to confront these killings must have two prongs: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Relentlessly root out the practice of social cleansing by government bodies; 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reform and expand the criminal justice system - especially the PNC and the 
Ministerio P&#250;blico - to effectively investigate and prosecute murders; 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p> <b>A lack of political will and of resources allocated to criminal justice has made 
effective crime control impossible. Guatemala must fully accept the scope of State 
responsibility under international law and take the necessary measures - including costly 
measures - to bring crime under control in a manner that is effective and just; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Congress should enact the legislation required to implement CICIG and the 
package of security-related legislation needed to realize the Peace Accords 
</b></p>
<p>There has been significant progress on this recommendation, but it has not been fully 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Congress should greatly increase the funds allocated to the institutions of the 
criminal justice system</b> 
</p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.</p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b> A witness-protection programme adequate to address the needs and fears of 
witnesses, including victims, to human rights violations in which the State or other 
powerful actors are implicated should be set up. This might be established under the 
supervision of the PDH; 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> The counterproductive division of responsibility for conducting investigations 
between the Ministerio P&#250;blico and the PNC must be ended. Establishing a system of 
investigative prosecutors is one possibility that should be considered; 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> Foreign donors are playing a complex, and in some ways problematic, role: rather 
than funding projects that the State cannot afford, they are funding projects that the State 
has simply opted not to be able to afford. Insofar as these projects benefit those with the 
least power over the legislative agenda, such foreign assistance is commendable. Moreover, 
foreign assistance makes up a relatively small proportion of the Government&#8217;s budget, and 
its withdrawal would not necessarily stimulate more responsible fiscal policies. 
Nevertheless, the donor community should carefully consider whether its assistance is 
doing as much as possible to push the State to assume its own responsibilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> At the end of the day, even the crisis in relation to extrajudicial executions can be 
attributed in good part to the Government&#8217;s failure to behave in a fiscally responsible 
manner. The refusal of the elites to raise the overall level of income derived from taxation 
to a level at which an honest and effective police force and system of justice can be 
afforded, along with a system which respects core economic, social and cultural rights, has 
produced predictable and sometimes disastrous results. After all, even Governments get 
what they pay for. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.
