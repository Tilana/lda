REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Various statements and information contained in or 
incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement that express a belief,
expectation, or intention, or that are not statements of historical fact, are 
&#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and Section 21E of the 
Exchange
Act. These forward-looking statements include statements, projections and 
estimates concerning our future financial position, operations, performance, 
business strategy, oil and natural gas reserves, drilling program, capital 
expenditures, liquidity
and capital resources, the timing and success of specific projects, outcomes and
effects of litigation, claims and disputes, derivative activities and potential 
financing. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as
&#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;predict,&#148; 
&#147;believe,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; 
&#147;potential,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;foresee,&#148; 
&#147;plan,&#148; &#147;goal&#148; or
other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of performance. We have based these 
forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about 
future events and
their potential effect on us. These statements are based on certain assumptions 
and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of 
historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well 
as other factors
we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
materially from those implied or expressed by any forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus 
supplement, or
if earlier, as of the date they were made. We disclaim any obligation to update 
or revise these statements unless required by law, and we caution you not to 
rely on them unduly. While our management considers these expectations and 
assumptions to be
reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic,

engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and 
natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve
estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such 
data and the
price and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the 
results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of 
estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change
the schedule
of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve 
estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are 
ultimately recovered. </P>

independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development,
exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core 
operations are focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West 
Texas. Our legacy in
the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological 
trends. We are also at the forefront of applying new technologies, such as 
horizontal drilling and enhanced completion techniques, throughout our three 
core operating
areas: the New Mexico Shelf, the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin. In the 
New Mexico Shelf, we primarily target the Yeso formation with horizontal 
drilling; in the Delaware Basin, we use horizontal drilling to target the Bone 
Spring formation
(including the Avalon shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale 
formation; and in the Midland Basin, we target the Wolfcamp and Spraberry 
formations with horizontal drilling. Our strategy remains focused on drilling 
and exploration
activities on our multi-year project inventory and pursuing acquisitions that 
meet our strategic and financial objectives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt;

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into a purchase and sale agreement 
to acquire from Reliance Energy, a privately held, Midland-based energy company,
all of the
seller&#146;s interest in certain oil and natural gas properties and related 
assets located in the Northern Midland Basin (the &#147;Acquisition&#148;). The 
purchase agreement provides for the sale and transfer by the seller of its 
interests in
approximately 40,000 net acres for an aggregate purchase price of $1.625 
billion. The properties have an average of 99% working interest (75% NRI) with 
minimal leasehold obligations. The properties to be acquired have an estimated 
current net
production of approximately 10&nbsp;MBoepd from 44 horizontal and 326 vertical 
producing wells.<I> </I>Based on the estimates of our internal reserve 
engineers, we estimate that there were approximately 43 MMBoe of proved reserves
associated with
these properties as of June 30, 2016, of which 69% were proved developed. These 
reserve estimates were made in accordance with current SEC rules and regulations
regarding oil and natural gas reserve reporting, including using average
first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC 
guidelines. The consideration for the Acquisition will consist of $1,137.5 
million in cash (which we intend to fund from a portion of the net proceeds of 
this offering) and
either an additional $487.5 million in cash or 3.96 million shares of our common
stock pursuant to an option exercisable by either us or the seller to elect to 
require that a portion of the consideration be paid in our common stock (the 
&#147;Stock
Consideration&#148;), subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We 
anticipate exercising this option and paying a portion of the Acquisition 
consideration in our common stock. If the election to pay a portion of the 
consideration as Stock
Consideration is made, we have agreed pursuant to the purchase agreement 
governing the Acquisition to file a registration statement to register the 
resale from time to time of the Stock Consideration under the Securities Act 
upon the closing of the
Acquisition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

<TD>We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately 
$1,154.2 million (or $1,327.4 million if the underwriters exercise their option 
to purchase additional shares in full), after deducting estimated fees and 
expenses. We
intend to use the estimated net proceeds from this offering to (i) finance part 
of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition, subject to the 
closing of the Acquisition, and (ii) fund part of the redemption of our 7.0% 
Notes, with
any remaining balance to be used for general corporate purposes, including 
funding future capital expenditures associated with our acquisition, exploration
and development activities. Consummation of this offering, however, is not 
conditioned upon
the completion of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated, we 
intend to use the net proceeds after the funding of a portion of the redemption 
of our 7.0% Notes for general corporate purposes, including funding future 
capital
expenditures associated with our acquisition, exploration and development 
activities. The underwriters or their affiliates may be holders of the 7.0%

size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concho anticipates it could generate a 
net
operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) in 2016. Utilization of this NOL depends on 
many factors, including our ability to generate future taxable income, which 
cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended
(&#147;Section 382&#148;), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount 
of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has 
undergone an &#147;ownership change&#148; (as determined under Section 382). An 
ownership change
generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are
each deemed to own at least five percent of our stock change their ownership by 
more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a 
rolling
three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were 
to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under
Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our equity at the time of 
the
ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in 
Section 382, and potentially increased for certain gains recognized within five 
years after the ownership change if we have a net built-in gain in our assets at
the time of
the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later 
years. We cannot assure you that we will not have an ownership change as a 
result of this offering, which would result in an annual limitation under 
Section 382.
However, even if we did have an ownership change as a result of this offering, 
we do not believe that such limitation would prevent our utilization of our 
anticipated 2016 NOL or any other tax attribute prior to their expiration. 
Future ownership
changes or future regulatory changes could limit our ability to utilize our 
NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, 
this would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows if we attain 
profitability.

any distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. However, in the
event we do make distributions of cash or other property on our common stock, 
such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes to the
extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined 
under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions 
exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will 
be treated as
a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder&#146;s tax 
basis in our common stock and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or 
exchange of such common stock. See &#147;&#151;Gain on Disposition of Common 
Stock.&#148;
Subject to the withholding requirements under FATCA (as defined below) and with 
respect to effectively connected dividends, each of which is discussed below, 
any distribution (regardless of whether classified as a dividend for U.S. 
federal income
tax purposes) made to a non-U.S. holder on our common stock generally will be 
subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30 percent of the gross amount of 
the distribution unless an applicable income tax treaty provides for a lower 
rate. To
receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must provide the
applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or 
other applicable or successor form) certifying qualification for the reduced 
rate. If,
after the end of a given year, it is established that a distribution made to a 
non-U.S. holder qualified as a return of capital rather than a dividend for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such non-U.S. holder generally can obtain a refund 
of any
amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for a refund with the 
IRS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-

the United States) generally will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates 
and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined 
under the Code). Such effectively connected dividends will not be subject to 
U.S. withholding
tax if the non-U.S. holder satisfies certain certification requirements by 
providing the applicable withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI 
certifying eligibility for exemption. If the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S.

also be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30 percent rate or such lower rate

a 30 percent withholding tax on any dividends paid on our common stock and on

occurs after December 31, 2018), in each case if paid to a &#147;foreign 
financial
institution&#148; or a &#147;non-financial foreign entity&#148; (each as defined
in the Code) (including, in some cases, when such foreign financial institution 
or non-financial foreign entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the
case of
a foreign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with 
the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments, and to collect and provide 
to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account 
holders of
such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such 
institution, as well as certain account holders that are non-U.S. entities with 
U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity 
certifies that it
does not have any &#147;substantial United States owners&#148; (as defined in 
the Code) or provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification (in 
either case, generally on an IRS Form W-8BEN-E) identifying the direct and 
indirect
substantial United States owners of the entity, or (iii) the foreign financial 
institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption
from these rules and provides appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-
8BEN-E).
Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an 
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing these rules may be 
subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be 
eligible for refunds or
credits of such taxes. For example, if a dividend payment on our common stock is
both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax 
discussed above under &#147;&#151;Distributions,&#148; the withholding under

sales of the common stock, which
involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of common 
stock than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares
of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. 
Short sales
may be &#147;covered&#148; shorts, which are short positions in an amount not 
greater than the underwriters&#146; option referred to above, or may be 
&#147;naked&#148; shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount. 
The underwriters may
close out any covered short position either by exercising their option, in whole

determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of 
shares available
for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters 
may purchase shares through the option. A naked short position is more likely to
be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure
on the
price of the common stock in the open market that could adversely affect 
investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters 
create a naked short position, it will purchase shares in the open market to 
cover the position.

REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Various statements and information contained in or 
incorporated by reference into this prospectus that express a belief, 
expectation, or
intention, or that are not statements of historical fact, are &#147;forward-
looking statements&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and Section&nbsp;21E of 
the Exchange Act.
These forward-looking statements include statements, projections and estimates 
concerning our operations, performance, business strategy, oil and natural gas 
reserves, drilling program, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital 
resources, the
timing and success of specific projects, outcomes and effects of litigation, 
claims and disputes, derivative activities and potential financing. Forward-
looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as 
&#147;estimate,&#148;
&#147;project,&#148; &#147;predict,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; 
&#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148; 
&#147;could,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;foresee,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; 
&#147;goal&#148; or other words that convey
the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of performance. We have based these forward-looking statements on our
current expectations and assumptions about future events and their potential 
effect on
us. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in
light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current 
conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe 
are appropriate
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those implied
or expressed by any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date of this prospectus, or if earlier, as of the date they
were
made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements unless 
required by law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. While our 
management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they 
are inherently
subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other 
risks, contingencies and uncertainties relating to, among other matters, the 
risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
our subsequent SEC filings, as well as those factors summarized below: </P> <P

engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and 
natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve
estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such 
data and price
and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the results of 
drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates 
that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the 
schedule of any
further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may 
differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.

underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account for resale to the
public, either on a
firm commitment basis or a best efforts basis. The underwriters may resell the 
securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated 
transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined 
at the time
of sale. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through 
underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or 
directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless we inform you 
otherwise in the
prospectus supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the 
securities will be subject to certain conditions. The underwriters may change

reallowed or
paid to dealers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

offering through underwriters, the underwriters may purchase and sell the 
securities in the open
market. These transactions may include overallotment and stabilizing 
transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in 
connection with the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid, 
which means that selling
concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers for the offered
securities sold for their account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the 
offered securities are repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or covering 
transactions.
These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of
the offered securities, which may be higher than the price that might otherwise 
prevail in the open market. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue these
activities at any time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

of resale. We will include in the prospectus supplement the names of the dealers
