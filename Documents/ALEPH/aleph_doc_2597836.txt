ARTICLE II
THE CREDITS
Section 2.01 Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make
Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that
will not result in (i) such Lender’s Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (ii) the Total Credit
Exposure exceeding the total Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, any Borrower may borrow, prepay and re-borrow Revolving Loans.
Section 2.02 Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of
Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s
failure to make Loans as required.
(b) Subject to Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as
the Company, on behalf of itself, Expro-Intl. or MOCL, may request in accordance herewith, and each Lender at its option
may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that each ABR
Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000
and not less than $5,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal
to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at
the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of six Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings
outstanding.
40
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company, on behalf of itself, Expro-Intl. or MOCL, shall
not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
Section 2.03 Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Company shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing;
provided that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
contemplated by Section 2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative
Agent and signed by the Company. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following
information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the applicable Borrower and the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
(ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
(iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”; and
(v) the location and number of the applicable Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply
with the requirements of Section 2.06.
If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an
ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then the
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. If no Borrower is
specified, the Company shall be the applicable Borrower. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount
of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

Section 2.04 [Reserved].
Section 2.05 Letters of Credit.
(a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit from any Issuing Bank, for the Company’s own account, the account of Expro-Intl., MOCL, Expro-USA or another
Loan Party, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank, at any time and from
time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Company (on behalf of itself, Expro-Intl. or MOCL) to, or entered into by a Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any
Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation hereunder to issue, and shall not issue, any Letter of Credit the proceeds of
which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in
any country or territory that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions or (ii) in any manner that would
result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement.
(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of
Credit by any Issuing Bank (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been
approved by such Issuing Bank) to such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, but in any event no less than three Business Days) a
notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the
date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section 2.05), the amount of
such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary
to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Company,
Expro-Intl. or MOCL, as applicable, also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in
connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only
if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure
shall not exceed $200,000,000, (ii) no Lender’s Credit Exposure shall exceed its Commitment, (iii) the Total Credit
Exposure shall not exceed the total Commitments, and (iv) the LC Exposure of any Issuing Bank shall not exceed its
Letter of Credit Commitment. The Company may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the Letter of Credit
Commitment of any Issuing Bank with the consent of such Issuing Bank; provided that the Company shall not reduce the
Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank if, after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in clauses
(i) through (iv) above shall not be satisfied.
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the applicable Issuing
Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or
extension; provided that, to the extent such date would extend beyond the date referred to in
42
CREDIT AGREEMENT
the immediately succeeding clause (c)(ii), such Letter of Credit shall, concurrently with, or prior to, the effectiveness of
such renewal or extension (as applicable), be cash collateralized in a manner (and in such amount) acceptable to the
applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion) and (ii) subject to the parenthetical in the immediately preceding clause (i),
the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
(d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank that issues such Letter of Credit or the Lenders,
such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a
participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank that
issues a Letter of Credit hereunder, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such
Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this
Section 2.05, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.
(e) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the
Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that the
Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such
payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
applicable Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Revolving Borrowing. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the applicable Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the applicable Borrower, in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt
by the Administrative
43
CREDIT AGREEMENT
Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their
interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any
LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan
and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f) Obligations Absolute. The applicable Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph
(e) of this Section 2.05 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other
event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section 2.05, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the applicable Borrower’s
obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related
Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of
Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in
the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice
or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing
thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of
any Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the
applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law)
suffered by a Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts
and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly
agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with
respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of
Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept
and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of
Credit.
44
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(g) Disbursement Procedures. An Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand
for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any
failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such
Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the
reimbursement is due and payable at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans and such interest
shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable; provided that, if the applicable Borrower
fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.12(c)
shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except
that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 to
reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i) Replacement of Issuing Bank.
(i) Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any
such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay
all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the
effective date of any such replacement, (A) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (B) references herein to
the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing
Bank at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders, in which
case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(i)(i).
(j) Cash Collateralization. If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the
Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has
been accelerated, Lenders
45
CREDIT AGREEMENT
with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding that the Borrowers cash
collateralize the outstanding LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph, (ii) any Borrower is required to cash collateralize
the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(b) or cash
collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.10(c), or (iii) any Borrower is required to cash
collateralize a Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.19, then the applicable Borrower shall deposit in
an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an
amount in cash equal to such LC Exposure or the excess attributable to such LC Exposure, as the case may be, as of
such date, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash
collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without
demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described
in clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have
exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest
earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to
the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the applicable Borrower
for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement. If the applicable Borrower is required to provide an amount
of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or pursuant to Section 2.19 as the result
of a Defaulting Lender, and the Borrowers are not otherwise required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess
attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(b), then such amount (to the
extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after all Events
of Default have been cured or waived or the events giving rise to such cash collateralization pursuant to Section 2.19
have been satisfied or resolved.
(k) Existing Letters of Credit. On the Availability Date, each of the letters of credit listed on Schedule 2.05 shall be
deemed to have been issued as Letters of Credit under this Agreement by the Issuing Bank specified for such Letter of
Credit on Schedule 2.05, without payment of any fees otherwise due upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, and such
Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Lender, and each Lender
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from such Issuing Bank, a participation, to
the extent of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage, in such Letter of Credit.
46
CREDIT AGREEMENT
Section 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof solely by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the
account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so
received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative
Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing
that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
clause (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in
the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.
Section 2.07 Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type
or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor,
all as provided in this Section 2.07. The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election
by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such
election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Company.
47
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect
to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
(v) If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then
the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing
prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the
end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.
Section 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall
terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$5,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the Total Credit Exposure would exceed the total
Commitments.
48
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,
specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section 2.08
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that
such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by
the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
(d) If, on any date when the total Commitments exceeds $1,000,000,000, the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive
Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event, then the total Commitments shall be reduced automatically
(without any further action) by an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that (i) no such reduction
shall be required under this Section 2.08(d) with respect to (A) any Asset Sale of Surplus Inventory of the Company or
any Subsidiary for fair market value, the Net Cash Proceeds of which from all such Asset Sales since the Effective Date
does not exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate, or (B) any Asset Sale of Oil and Gas Properties or the Equity Interests in
Subsidiaries owning Oil and Gas Properties, the Net Cash Proceeds of which from all such Asset Sales since the
Effective Date does not exceed $75,000,000 in the aggregate; and (ii) if, after giving effect to any such reduction, the total
Commitments would be less than $1,000,000,000, then the total Commitments shall instead be reduced pursuant to this
Section 2.08(d) by an amount necessary (up to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds) so that after giving effect to such
reduction, the total Commitments equal $1,000,000,000. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
Section 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity
Date.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from a Borrower for the account of the Lenders and
each Lender’s share thereof.
49
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable
Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested
by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative
Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the
order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered not, to such payee and its registered
assigns).
Section 2.10 Prepayment of Loans. (a) Subject to any breakage costs payable pursuant to Section 2.15, each
Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing made to it in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 2.10.
(b) If at any time the Total Credit Exposure exceeds the total Commitments (including after giving effect to any reduction
of the total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.08(d)), then, the Borrowers shall, without notice or demand, immediately
(i) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, and (ii) if any excess remains (or
would remain) after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, cash collateralize such excess as
provided in Section 2.05(j). Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be applied ratably to
the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowings. Prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be
accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and breakage costs to the extent required by
Section 2.15.
(c) In the event that the aggregate LC Exposure exceeds the sum of all Letter of Credit Commitments then in effect, the
Borrowers shall, without notice or demand, immediately replace outstanding Letters of Credit or cash collateralize
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j), in an aggregate amount
sufficient to eliminate such excess.
(d) The Company, on behalf of itself, Expro-Intl. or MOCL, shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed
by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder, (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment
of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of
prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a
conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment
may be revoked if such notice of
50
CREDIT AGREEMENT
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving
Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.12 and breakage costs to the extent required by Section 2.15.
Section 2.11 Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility
fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or
unused) during the period from and including the Availability Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment
terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then
such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender’s Credit Exposure from and including the
date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Credit
Exposure.
(b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with
respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the
interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Availability Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at
the rate of 0.20% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure of such Issuing Bank (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Availability Date
to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure of such Issuing Bank, as well as such Issuing Bank’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.
(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the
times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
(d) Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first
such date to occur after the Availability Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable
on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be payable within ten days
after demand. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December
of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
51
CREDIT AGREEMENT
after the Availability Date; provided that any fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be
payable on demand. All fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a
leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative
Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and
participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid hereunder shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
Section 2.12 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period
in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the
applicable Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of
overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding
paragraphs of this Section 2.12 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.12.
(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the
case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph
(c) of this Section 2.12 shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other
than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal
amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on
such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year),
and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative
Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 2.13 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate
and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such
Interest Period; or
52
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or
maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as
promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of
any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be
ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other
Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
Section 2.14 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any
compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account
of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any
Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense
(other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
or
(iii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making,
continuing, converting or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase
the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other
Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender,
such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of
such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by
53
CREDIT AGREEMENT
such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing
Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or
such Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to
capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or
such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section 2.14 shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower
shall pay such Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that
the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.14
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions
and of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 2.15 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other
than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d)
the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate
each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i)
the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at
the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the
last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A
54
CREDIT AGREEMENT
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
Section 2.16 Payments Free of Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except
as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable
withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then
the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax
is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.16) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties. Each Loan Party shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
(c) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d) Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten
days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to
be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten days after
demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Loan Parties
have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of
any Loan Party to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such
Lender, in each case, that are payable
55
CREDIT AGREEMENT
or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent
to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount
due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (e).
(f) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to
payments made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative
Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company, on behalf of itself, Expro-Intl. or MOCL, or the
Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or
the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver
such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative
Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 2.16(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Company is a U.S. Person,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), an executed IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt
from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x)
with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, an executed IRS Form W-8BEN
E or IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
“interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any
56
CREDIT AGREEMENT
other applicable payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN E or IRS Form W-
8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or
“other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming that its extension of credit will generate U.S. effectively connected income,
an executed IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “ten percent shareholder” of any Borrower within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a
“U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) an executed IRS Form W-8BEN E or IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form
W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN E, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit C-2 or Exhibit C-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as
applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such
Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for any Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations
under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause
(D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
57
CREDIT AGREEMENT
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in
any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in
writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including by the
payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to
such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving
rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest
(other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying
party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to
this clause (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the
event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this clause (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an
indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable
net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise
to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional
amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified
party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
(i) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.16, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term
“applicable law” includes FATCA.
Section 2.17 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each
payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements,
or of amounts payable under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on
any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent
at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15 or
58
CREDIT AGREEMENT
2.16 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute in like
funds as those received any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date
for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of
principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first,
towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with
the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving
such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by
the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the
amount of such participation.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment
is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the applicable
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.
59
CREDIT AGREEMENT
In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal
Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Sections 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b),
2.17(d) or 10.03(c) then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i)
apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
Lender’s obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold such
amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for,
and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses
(i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) if any Defaulting Lender shall have
failed to fund all or any portion of any Loan (each such Loan, an “Affected Loan”), each prepayment of Loans by any
Borrower under Section 2.10 shall be applied first to such Affected Loan and the principal amount and interest with
respect to such payment shall be distributed (x) to each Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender (each, a “Non-Defaulting
Lender”) pro rata based on the outstanding principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all Non-Defaulting Lenders, until
the principal amount of all Affected Loans has been repaid in full and (y) to the extent of any remaining amount of such
prepayment, to each Lender pro rata in accordance with such Lender’s Applicable Percentage, and (ii) each payment
made by the applicable Borrower on account of the interest on any Affected Loans shall be distributed to each Non-
Defaulting Lender pro rata based on the outstanding principal amount of Affected Loans owing to all Non-Defaulting
Lenders.
Section 2.18 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes
or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking
its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Sections 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost
or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to
pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

CREDIT AGREEMENT
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified
Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.16, or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort,
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse
(in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights (other than its
existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 2.16) and obligations under this Agreement to an
assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and
if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank) which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee
(to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other
amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation
or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a
waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and
delegation cease to apply.
Section 2.19 Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the
following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a).
(b) the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the
Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or
other modification pursuant to Section 10.02); provided that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting
Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender
affected thereby.
(c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in
accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only (x) to the extent that such reallocation does not, as to
any non-Defaulting Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lender’s Credit Exposure to exceed its Commitment and (y) the
conditions set forth in Section 4.03 are satisfied at such time;
61
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within
one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks
only the Borrowers’ obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial
reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as
such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with
respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash
collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to
the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable
Percentages;
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to
clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender
hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the
portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable
under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing
Banks and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(vi) subject to Section 10.17, no reallocation pursuant to clause (i) shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any
claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increase exposure following such
reallocation; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any
Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure
will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the
Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and LC Exposure related to any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit
shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting
Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Lender Parent shall occur following the Effective Date and
for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in
fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, such Issuing
Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall have entered
into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease
any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
62
CREDIT AGREEMENT
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Banks each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the
Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall
purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in
order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:
Section 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly

any Borrower or any other Person), except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will
not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or

of the Transactions, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect other than (i) the
recording and filing of the Security Instruments as required by this Agreement and (ii) those third party approvals or
consents which, if not made or obtained would not cause a Default hereunder, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect or do not have an adverse effect on the enforceability of the Loan Documents, (c) will not
violate or result in a default under the Existing Notes, any indenture pursuant to which any Existing Notes are issued, the
Existing Credit Agreement or any other indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its

(ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, certified by its chief financial
officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations

such Subsidiary to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of each such
Property in an amount in excess of the working interest of each Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve
Report that is not offset by a corresponding proportionate increase in the Company’s or such Subsidiary’s net revenue
interest in such Property.

necessary to conduct normal operations are being maintained in a state adequate to conduct normal operations, and
with respect to such of the foregoing which are operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in a manner
consistent with the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ past practices (other than those the failure of which to maintain in
accordance with this Section 3.05(d) could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).
Section 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that,
if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse

Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with
all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding
standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all material respects with the
presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has (a) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the Code in respect of any Plan,

that has resulted or could result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the
Code, or (c) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under
Section 4007 of ERISA that are not past due.
Section 3.11 Disclosure. The Company has disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or
other restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum
nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered
hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Company represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the
time. There are no statements or conclusions in any Reserve Report which are based upon or include misleading
information or fail to take into account material information regarding the matters reported therein, it being understood
that projections concerning volumes attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and the Subsidiaries and
production and cost estimates contained in each Reserve Report are necessarily based upon professional opinions,
estimates and projections and that the Company and the Subsidiaries do not warrant that such opinions, estimates and
projections will ultimately prove to have been accurate.

arrangement (other than capital leases creating Liens permitted by Section 6.03(b) or Section 6.03(e), but then only on

purports to restrict its ability to grant Liens to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on or in respect of their Properties

dividends or making any other distributions in respect of its Equity Interests to the Company or any Subsidiary, or

Liens, to the extent any such Permitted Liens would have priority over the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent

Agreements to, or does not, maintain possession of such Collateral.
(b) Each Mortgage is effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties,
legal and valid Liens on all the real property described therein. When the Mortgages are filed in the applicable county

ARTICLE IX
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with each
Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. In addition to
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Borrower and each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agent is or
may be an agent, arranger and/or lender under the Existing Credit Agreement, other loans or other securities and waives
any existing or future conflicts of interest associated with its role hereunder and in such other transactions.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied
duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by any Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with
this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection
herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth
herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
103
CREDIT AGREEMENT
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally
or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying
thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance
with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or
more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform
any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If
no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within
30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may,
on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the
same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while it was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such
resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, including in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to
any successor Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and letters
of credit and not investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in
making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
104
CREDIT AGREEMENT
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to
make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public
information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrowers and their respective
Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in
deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder.
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to release any Collateral that is
permitted to be sold or released pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents and to release any Guarantor from the
Guaranty Agreement to which it is a party pursuant to the terms thereof and further agrees that any determination with
respect to the inclusion or exclusion of any asset as Collateral, including without limitation, pursuant to Section 5.12,
shall be made by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability in
respect thereof). Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver
to the Company, at the Company’s sole cost and expense, any and all releases of Liens, termination statements,
assignments or other documents reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any sale or other disposition
of Property to the extent such sale or other disposition is permitted by the terms of Section 6.11 or is otherwise authorized
by the terms of the Loan Documents.
No Lead Arranger or Lender identified on the cover page of this Agreement (other than the Administrative Agent) shall
have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders in their capacity as such. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lead Arranger or Lender identified on the cover page
as a “syndication agent” or “co-documentation agent” (or any similar title) shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
relationship with any Lead Arranger or any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
the Administrative Agent, any Lead Arranger or any other Lender so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or
in taking or not taking any action hereunder.
The Guaranteed Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders,
to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of
some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either
directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted
under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or
any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or
acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent
(whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid
and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Guaranteed Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the
Administrative Agent at
105
CREDIT AGREEMENT
the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated
claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such
claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the
contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition
vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the
Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid
to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles (ii) each of the Guaranteed Parties’ ratable interests in the Obligations which were
credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for
the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the
governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to
such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed,
directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or
their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition
vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the
limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 10.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative
Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Guaranteed Parties,
ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited
partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such
acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to
the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason
(as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle
exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall
automatically be reassigned to the Guaranteed Parties pro rata and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued
by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any
Guaranteed Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the
Obligations of each Guaranteed Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause
(ii) above, each Guaranteed Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the
Guaranteed Party (and/or any designee of the Guaranteed Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments
issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation
of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such credit bid.

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by
any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this

(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (x) an Assignment and
Assumption or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference
pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are
participants), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in
which the assignee designates one or more Credit Contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain

made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and
applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.
For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the term “Approved Fund” and “Ineligible Institution” have the following
meanings:
“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or
investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or
managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or
manages a Lender.
112
CREDIT AGREEMENT
“Ineligible Institution” means (a) a natural person, (b) a Defaulting Lender or its Lender Parent, (c) a company, investment
vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof or (d) the
Company or any of its Affiliates; provided that, such company, investment vehicle or trust shall not constitute an Ineligible
Institution if it (x) has not been established for the primary purpose of acquiring any Loans or Commitments, (y) is
managed by a professional advisor, who is not such natural person or a relative thereof, having significant experience in
the business of making or purchasing commercial loans, and (z) has assets greater than $25,000,000 and a significant
part of its activities consist of making or purchasing commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary
course of its business.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section 10.04, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease
to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16,
Section 10.03 and Article IX). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 10.04.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of
its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register (which register may be in electronic
form) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and
stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference
pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are
participants), the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04 and any written consent
to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of
113
CREDIT AGREEMENT
this Section 10.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information
contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make
any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d), Section 2.05(e), Section 2.06(b), Section 2.17(d) or
Section 10.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and
record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with
all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded
in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”), other than an Ineligible Institution, in all or a portion
of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) each
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant,
agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such
Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14, Section 2.15 and
Section 2.16 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.16(f), it
being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.16(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender) to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section 10.04; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.18 as if it were an
assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.14 or Section 2.16, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to
receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after
the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Company’s
request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of
Section 2.18(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as
an non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant
and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the
Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any
portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s
interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other
114
CREDIT AGREEMENT
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank or an central bank, and this Section 10.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
Section 10.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by any Borrower herein and
in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or a Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as
the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16,
Section 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and
the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
Section 10.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of
which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to (i) fees payable to the Administrative
Agent and (ii) the reductions of the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank constitute the entire contract among
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have
received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.
115
CREDIT AGREEMENT
(b) Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other
electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words of
like import in or relating to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical
delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for
in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York
State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act; provided that nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept electronic signatures in
any form or format without its prior written consent.
Section 10.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 10.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
Section 10.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal

court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.
(c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.09. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law.
(e) In furtherance of the foregoing, MOCL hereby irrevocably appoints the Company, with an office on the date hereof at
the address specified in Section 10.01, as its authorized agent with all powers necessary to receive on its behalf service
of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to the Loan Documents in any of the courts in and of the State of New York. Such service may be made
by mailing or delivering a copy of such process to MOCL in care of the Company at the Company’s above address and
MOCL hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Company to accept such service on its behalf and agrees that the
failure of the Company to give any notice of any such service to MOCL shall not impair or affect the validity of such
service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. If for any reason the Company shall
cease to act as process agent, MOCL shall appoint forthwith, in the manner provided for herein, a single successor
process agent qualified to act as an agent for service of process with respect to all courts in and of the State of New York
and acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to bring any action or proceeding against MOCL or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions. To the
extent that MOCL has or hereafter may acquire any right of immunity from jurisdiction of any court on the grounds of
sovereignty or otherwise with respect to itself or its property, MOCL hereby irrevocably waives such immunity for itself
and for its property in respect of all of its Obligations under the Loan Documents.

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL

Information and any other information, notices, reports or other communications received from any Person pursuant to
this Agreement to the agents, arrangers and lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement.

applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in
respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 10.14 shall be
cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased

law of the United States or any State thereof, such Lender may notify the Administrative Agent and disclaim any benefit
of such Lien to the extent of such illegality; provided, that such determination or disclaimer by such Lender shall not

shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of
any EEA Resolution Authority.
