<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 On the basis of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first-hand experience and extensive 
research, the present report examines the widespread but understudied phenomenon of 
election-related killings. On the basis of the extensive case studies contained in the 
appendix, the Special Rapporteur adopts a definition of election-related killings, surveys 
the limited academic research on election-related violence and provides an overview of the 
perpetrators, victims, timing, motive, methods and effects of election-related killings. He 
also analyses the most significant types of election-related killings, considers the approach 
of election monitors and concludes with specific recommendations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions examines the widespread, but understudied, phenomenon of election-related 
killings. He draws upon his extensive first-hand experience in investigating and reporting 
on killings around the world, as well as upon extensive research undertaken specifically for 
this purpose. 
</p>
<p>2. Election-related killings violate not only the right to life but also the right to 
participate in the democratic process, as well as a range of other human rights. They have 
featured prominently in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country fact-finding missions, his 
communications to Governments and regular monitoring work. Such killings have occurred 
on a large scale in many of the countries to which the Special Rapporteur has carried out 
fact-finding missions, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Kenya, Nigeria and the Philippines. Prominent recent incidents include the massacre in the 
Philippines, in November 2009, of 57 relatives and supporters of a gubernatorial candidate 
by a rival candidate&#8217;s private militia; the death of at least 1,113 civilians in post-election 
December 2007&#8211;January 2008 protests in Kenya; and the killing of protesters by police and 
militia forces in the Islamic Republic of Iran following contested elections in June 2009. 
</p>
<p>3. Reports by human rights and election monitors, as well as the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
country reports, provide an important analysis of election-related killings in a wide range of 
countries. The appendix contains a summary of the most relevant case studies that have 
arisen, especially over the past three years. There has, however, been little cross-national 
research. Detailed typologies of election-related killings have not been set out, and the 
dynamics of the main forms of such killings across the world have not been closely 
analysed. As a subject of academic study, &#8220;election-related killings&#8221; barely exist, although 
the broader subject of election-related violence has experienced important recent growth. 
</p><p>4. In part II of the report, the Special Rapporteur proposes a working definition of 
election-related killings. In part III, he surveys the limited academic research on election-
related violence and reviews the main areas of focus and findings of the field. Drawing 
upon the country case studies in the appendix in part IV he sets out his general findings on 
the perpetrators, victims, timing, motive, methods and effects of election killings. In part V, 
he then analyses the most significant types of election killings: killings by security forces 
during election protests; killings by insurgents; killings of political candidates; killings of 
supporters of a rival candidate or party; rival supporter-on-supporter killings; and the 
State&#8217;s use of the death penalty. In part VI, he examines election monitoring reports and 
guidelines, which need to be strengthened in terms of their coverage of election violence. 
The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with general findings and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to Sarah Knuckey, Director of the Project on 
Extrajudicial Executions at the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, New York 
University School of Law, for her superb work in the preparation of the report. He is also 
grateful for country research prepared by Wade McMullen, Anna de Courcy Wheeler, 
Rupert Watters, Hina Shamsi, Nishant Kumar and Danielle Mourabak. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Defining election-related killings 
</b></p>
<p>6. There is no accepted definition of &#8220;election-related killings&#8221;. Closely related 
definitions of electoral violence, however, prove useful in analysing the scope of election 
killings by illuminating common elements and in pointing towards a working definition.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>7. Many definitions of election violence rely strongly on an intent or motive element. 
In these definitions, violence is &#8220;election violence&#8221; if it is carried out with the intent to 
influence the election in some way. H&#246;glund, for example, notes that: 
</p>
<p>In essence, electoral violence is separated from other forms of political violence by a 
combination of timing and motive. The time aspect relates to violence carried out 
during the election period. The objective of electoral violence is to influence the 
electoral process and in extension its outcome.1 
</p>
<p>Similarly, Laakso writes that: 
</p>
<p>Electoral violence by definition has to be seen as an activity motivated by an attempt 
to affect the results of the elections &#8211; either by manipulating the electoral procedures 
and participation or by contesting the legitimacy of the results.2 
</p>
<p>In one of the most influential and important global studies of electoral violence, Fischer 
defines electoral conflict and violence as: &#8220;any random or organized act to intimidate, 
physically harm, blackmail, or abuse a political stakeholder in seeking to determine, delay, 
or to otherwise influence an electoral process&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>8. Haid concisely wrote that electoral violence is &#8220;violence employed to affect electoral 
outcomes&#8221;.4 A comprehensive 2009 report by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) on elections and conflict, primarily authored by academic Timothy Sisk, defines 
election-related violence more broadly as &#8220;acts or threats or coercion, intimidation, or 
physical harm perpetrated to affect an electoral process or that arise in the context of 
electoral competition&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p>9. Much election-related violence is indeed motivated by a desire to influence the 
conduct or outcome of an election in some way, and definitions emphasizing or relying on 
intent capture many of the cases of killings that the Special Rapporteur has investigated. 
Such definitions would clearly encompass, for example, assassinations of a rival candidate, 
killings by insurgents designed to disrupt an election, or killings of citizens to intimidate 
voters to vote a particular way. However, the category of electoral killings also goes 
beyond those killings motivated by an intention to influence an election. This is particularly 
the case with killings in the context of riots or protests. While some protests may be 
intended to influence or change electoral outcomes, others are motivated by indignation, 
anger or disappointment with a result, and are not necessarily intended to change that result. 
This is even more so for killings in the context of protests. Killings between private citizens 
in the midst of protests may be better explained, for instance, by the complex dynamics of 
crowd behaviour or mob violence. More significantly, many killings during riots are 
committed by security forces while attempting to (legitimately or otherwise) pacify or end a 
protest. There are many types of such security force killings (e.g., intentional targeting of 
perceived enemies of a regime, identified by their presence at the protest, or the excessive

<p>use of force caused by failures in training on crowd control), but few are well captured by 
definitions that emphasize a motive to affect election results. 
</p>
<p>10. A focus on the motivation also fails to clearly capture Government trials and 
executions of individuals for their election-related activities. Following the 2009 elections 
in the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, individuals were charged, tried, convicted and 
sentenced to death for their involvement in post-election protests against the Government. 
These deaths were intimately linked to conduct during and after the elections and should 
thus be considered election-related killings.  
</p>
<p>11. Consequently, a more inclusive definition is in order. For the purposes of the present 
report, election-related killings may relate to election processes or outcomes. They include 
killings: (a) designed to influence, or to prevent attempts to influence, an election outcome; 
(b) that arise in the context of election processes; or (c) that seek to promote or hinder 
election-related activity. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Review of academic research on election-related violence 
</b></p>
<p>12. Until recently, there has been little academic research on the specific subject of 
election violence. While there has been a tremendous amount of writing on elections 
generally, and on political violence generally, there has been little on the intersection of 
these two fields: election-related violence.6 Research gaps that have been generally 
identified include work on the causes and effects of election violence, cross-national 
studies, efforts to understand the specific forms or variations of violence, work that is both 
theoretical and case-oriented, and research on the scope, gravity and timing of election 
violence.7 
</p>
<p>13. Scholarly work on the subject of election violence has grown significantly in recent 
years. The analysis that follows maps the concerns and findings of this growing field, in 
terms of the timing of election violence; the perpetrators of violence; the targets and 
victims; motives; method, means or form of violence; causes and enabling conditions; 
extent; and effects.8

<p><b> A. Timing 
</b></p>
<p>14. Election violence has often been classified as occurring in one of three phases: pre-
election, on election day(s), or post-election.9 Fischer has proposed a more detailed five-
phase typology: during the voter registration process; during the campaign; on election day; 
when results are announced; and in what he calls &#8220;representation conflict&#8221;.10 UNDP also 
proposes a more detailed election cycle division: 18 months to 3 months prior to election 
day; 3 months prior to election day; election day; the period between voting and the results 
announcement; and post-election.11 Bekoe, in describing where tensions arise in the election 
process, notes that they can occur &#8220;when decisions are made about who possesses the right 
to vote; when and if one can exercise the right to vote; which candidates are eligible to 
represent particular groups; the integrity of the registry; the credibility of the results; or the 
process for filing grievances&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p>15. Many authors note that, while significant attention is often paid by election monitors 
and the media to election day, most violence actually occurs either before or after that day, 
and that the election day itself &#8220;often is remarkably peaceful&#8221;.13 Many such statements have 
not, however, been empirically based. Thus, Bekoe makes an important contribution by 
examining fatalities in 110 national elections from 1990 to 2005 in Africa. She found that 
election day is the &#8220;least volatile stage in the three months before and three months 
following the election&#8221;.14 She found that 11 per cent of fatalities (by stage) occurred on 
election day, 46 per cent pre-election, and 43 per cent post-election. She hypothesized that 
countries had an interest in keeping election day calm because of the attention the media 
and election monitors paid to it and the affect that negative publicity could have on foreign 
relations and aid.15 Importantly, however, she notes that while election day was not the 
most violent stage, it was the &#8220;most violent day&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>16. In another detailed study, Newman analysed over 5,000 terrorist attacks between 
2000 and 2005, and found that, in general, &#8220;the frequency of terrorist attacks increases 
closer to the actual election date. This is true of both pre-election as well as post-election 
violence ... [and attacks are] almost evenly distributed before and after an election&#8221;.17  
</p><p>17. Some recent work has also begun to map the relationship between the stage of the 
election and the types and perpetrators of violence. UNDP, for instance, sets out in general 
terms the different types of violence that may occur in each of their five election phases.18  
</p>
<p>18. Country-specific case studies have also addressed the timing of election violence. In 
Patino and Velasco&#8217;s study of election violence in the Philippines, for example, they found 
that most violent incidents and deaths occurred during the campaign period, but that

<p>incidents also occurred before the campaign period, on election day and in the period 
embracing the processes of counting, canvassing and proclaiming results.19  
</p>
<p><b> B. Perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>19. General studies have identified the categories of the perpetrators of election 
violence. H&#246;glund has noted that violence can be committed by &#8220;State actors (military and 
police), political parties, guerrilla/rebel groups, and militia and paramilitary groups.&#8221;20 
Similarly, Laakso notes that perpetrators might include Government forces (notably the 
police and army), supporters of either the Government or opposition groups, spontaneous 
demonstrators and even rebel organizations.21 UNDP, in setting out an initial typology of 
actors, lists political parties and candidates; citizens; the State (police, army); non-State 
security forces (rebels, militias, vigilantes); and organizations of citizens.22 Work has also 
examined the identity and interests of perpetrators in more detail in specific country case 
studies, including on Sri Lanka,23 Zimbabwe24 and the Philippines.25 
</p>
<p>20. A small amount of work draws broader conclusions about the type and extent of 
violence by particular perpetrators. Importantly, a number of writers have noted that much 
evidence suggests that political parties are frequently responsible for election violence.26 In 
a largely theoretical study, Chaturvedi hypothesized that the party with &#8220;less initial political 
support will resort to more political violence&#8221;.27 
</p>
<p>21. In groundbreaking research on elections in Jamaica, Haid examines the relationships 
between politicians and criminal organizations, and how &#8220;variation in these organizations 
might affect the type, tenor, duration and effects&#8221; of election-related violence.28 
</p>
<p><b> C. Targets and victims 
</b></p>
<p>22. H&#246;glund, drawing upon Fischer&#8217;s analysis, concludes that the targets of election 
violence can be &#8220;electoral stakeholders (voters, candidates, election workers, media and 
monitors), electoral information (registration data, vote results, ballots, campaign material), 
electoral facilities (polling and counting stations), and electoral events (campaign rallies, 
travelling to a polling station)&#8221;.29 
</p><p>23. There is little detailed cross-national analysis of the targets and victims of electoral 
violence. With respect to electoral stakeholders or victims specifically, Rapoport and 
Weinberg give some cross-national examples of killings of political candidates, voters and

<p>party workers.30 Country case studies provide more detail on victims. In a study of post-
election violence in Kenya, de Smedt provides detail on the targets of violence in the 
Kibera slum.31 In H&#246;glund and Piyarathne&#8217;s detailed study on Sri Lanka, they found that 
many victims had been politically active during the election, and had themselves been 
involved in violence.32 They also found that more victims had supported the opposition 
parties, and that &#8220;party activists belonging to the lower class &#8212; from either party &#8212; were 
victims of more serious violence than the local elites&#8221;.33 Robinson and Torvik, in a study of 
violence in Zimbabwe, hypothesized that much of the violence in elections there &#8220;was 
aimed not at the core supporters of Mugabe&#8217;s opposition, but rather at the swing voters&#8221;.34 
They reasoned that violence was a more effective strategy than attempting to give the swing 
voters &#8220;policy favours&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p><b> D. Motive 
</b></p>
<p>24. As explained above, motive is often one of the key factors differentiating election-
related violence from other violence. Rapoport and Weinberg note that, &#8220;most of the time, 
violence is designed to influence elections by intimidating voters and striking candidates 
down. But violence can prevent an election from taking place or a victor from taking charge 
of the Government.&#8221;36 Similarly, H&#246;glund and Piyarathne explain that violence can be used 
for a number of reasons: &#8220;to hinder people from voting, to prevent candidates from 
campaigning, to display discontent with election results, or to overturn the outcome of the 
election&#8221;.37 In setting out motives in a different form, H&#246;glund writes that some &#8220;actors 
object to elections of any sort &#8230; [others] try to prevent or postpone elections &#8230; [others] 
want to influence the outcome of the election&#8221;.38 Violence may be used to &#8220;suppress 
opposition turnout or disrupt opponents&#8217; campaigns&#8221;.39 
</p>
<p>25. Some research has specifically focused on the relationship between the motives for 
violence and vote buying. Kasara notes that Kenyan politicians may use election &#8220;violence 
as a substitute for political inducements, such as vote buying&#8221;.40 She found that politicians 
encouraged violence that changed the voter/ethnic composition of an area to &#8220;create 
winnable parliamentary seats&#8221;.41 In a detailed study of this phenomenon in Jamaica, Haid 
hypothesizes that: 
</p>
<p>The violence used to affect electoral outcomes may be viewed by a candidate as 
either substitutable for or complementary of clientistic vote buying &#8230; Sometimes 
spending on violence is used instead of non-violent activities because it is believed

<p>that violent campaign activities will be more effective in ensuring victory than the 
same amount of resources spent on clientistic vote buying and patronage promises.42 
</p>
<p>26. Other work has focused on the motives of specific forms of violence, such as riots. 
Wilkinson and Haid, for example, in studying ethnic riots in India, found that politicians 
used them to &#8220;increase the salience of one ethnic dimension, and within that dimension one 
particular cleavage and category, so as to build a winning political coalition, split the 
opposition, and raise the turnout among their party&#8217;s core supporters&#8221;.43 
</p>
<p><b> E. Method, means or form 
</b></p>
<p>27. The general forms of election violence have often been set out in various typologies: 
&#8220;riots, demonstrations, civil wars, terrorist campaigns, military coups, and assassinations&#8221;.44 
Fischer refers to &#8220;threats, verbal intimidation, hate speech, disinformation, physical assault, 
forced &#8216;protection&#8217;, blackmail, destruction of property, or assassination&#8221;.45 UNDP notes that 
election violence can include &#8220;assassination of opponents or spontaneous fisticuffs between 
rival groups of supporters &#8211; and threats, coercion, and intimidation of opponents, voters or 
election officials&#8221;.46 Haid notes that election-related violence can &#8220;involve rioting 
(permitted or instigated), looting (spontaneous or orchestrated), intimidation (of voters or 
campaigns), assassination (of candidates or their staffs), or direct partisan conflict (with 
irregular or regular forces)&#8221;.47 In summarizing the types of electoral violence in the United 
Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, Shwartz sets out the following forms: assault, 
murder, attempted murder, beatings, looting, arson, threats of violence, bombings, 
disruption of campaign rallies, torture, arbitrary detention, abduction, chasing away voters 
from polling stations, rape, hate speeches, closure of party offices.48 
</p>
<p>28. Country case studies often provide more detail on specific types of violence.49 Very 
little research focuses on one specific form of election violence and studies it globally. 
Newman&#8217;s paper on terrorist acts is an important exception.50 
</p>
<p><b> F. Extent 
</b></p>
<p>29. Several studies have sought to calculate the extent of election violence. In an oft-
cited study, Fischer found that 24.5 per cent (14 of 57) of countries that held elections in 
2001 experienced electoral violence.51 Bekoe found that, of 110 elections in Africa from 
1990&#8211;2005, 24.5 per cent (27 elections) were accompanied by election-related deaths.52

</b></p>
<p><b> G. Causes and enabling conditions 
</b></p>
<p>30. Research has addressed causes or conditions of election violence in general terms, as 
well as in detail with respect to specific country case studies. 
</p>
<p>31. UNDP provides the longest list of potential causes, addressing specific factors 
related to context (e.g., ethnic rivalries), process, relationship factors, political factors (e.g., 
weak governance, lack of political party capacity), media (e.g., biased media), 
administrative inadequacies (e.g., inaccurate voter lists), corruption, and security and 
policing (they include four factors: &#8220;reactionary policing&#8221;, &#8220;police inaction to apprehend 
culprits&#8221;, &#8220;lack of capacity to investigate&#8221; and &#8220;availability of small arms&#8221;).53 H&#246;glund 
identifies various causes of election violence, including clientism and patrimonialism, 
elections taking place after conflict and where parties have not yet been fully demobilized, 
a culture of violence and impunity, the type of election, the electoral system design, and the 
nature of the election administration.54 
</p>
<p>32. In Schwartz&#8217;s work on the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, he 
found that causes of violence included a lack of faith in the electoral commission or its 
independence; lack of awareness of the electoral process; political repression; forced 
disenfranchisement of opponents; poverty; lack of funding for the electoral process; and 
incitement.55 
</p>
<p>33. A study of the Philippines found that relevant factors included the monetary and 
other benefits of public office, which cause politicians and their supporters to kill rivals; the 
fact that public office allows politicians to &#8220;protect&#8221; their organized criminal activity 
(gambling, drugs, logging); long existing family/political rivalries; the widespread presence 
of private militias run by politicians; and the weakness of the State.56 Work on violence in 
the Kibera slum in Kenya after the 2007 elections pointed to paternalism and &#8220;big man&#8221; 
politics, in combination with socio-economic factors and ethnic rivalries.57 Another study of 
the same period found that &#8220;more violence occurred in locations that had a greater effect on 
the overall electoral competitiveness of a parliamentary constituency&#8221;.58 Similarly, studies 
of Gujarat found that Hindu-Muslim riots were a planned element in a larger electoral 
strategy, and that they &#8220;broke out disproportionately in the most competitive seats&#8221;.59 
Bekoe&#8217;s study of elections in Africa found that the largest number of election-related deaths 
occurred in countries where ethnicity was politicized.60 
</p>
<p>34. Some studies have addressed the relationship between development or poverty and 
election violence. One such study noted that, while it is generally accepted that electoral 
violence is most linked to developing countries, most States have at some point experienced 
varying degrees of election violence.61 In discussing this point further, Laakso explains the 
reasons why poverty may be a factor in election violence (e.g., the ease with which poor 
youth might be mobilized to violence), but shows that numerous poor countries have not 
experienced violence, and that others experiencing growth have had violence. She

</p>
<p>concludes that poverty is clearly a relevant factor, but &#8220;should not be seen as &#8230; [a] 
sufficient cause for violence&#8221;.62 
</p>
<p>35. Some work has included analysis of whether the type of election (e.g., national, 
local, presidential or parliamentary) affects violence levels. In one study of elections in 
Africa, Bekoe did not find a difference in the presence of election-related deaths in different 
types of elections (comparing general, parliamentary, non-concurrent presidential and 
parliamentary).63 
</p><p>36. A major topic of analysis has been the relationship between the process of the 
election and violence. This includes manipulation or fraud in the electoral process, 
particularly in terms of rigging the outcome, and post-election violence. Violence is 
common following fraudulent elections in Africa.64 UNDP posits that one of the &#8220;common 
understandings&#8221; about election violence is that, &#8220;those elections considered to be free, fair, 
and transparent are less likely to experience electoral violence than those where allegations 
of mismanagement or deliberate cheating are prevalent&#8221;.65 In contrast, however, Laakso 
observes that &#8220;the elections that were declared free and fair by election observers were no 
less violent than elections that were not declared free and fair&#8221;.66 
</p>
<p><b> H. Effects 
</b></p>
<p>37. Election-related violence clearly has immediate effects on individual and community 
rights and security, and can result in physical harm or death, and property damage. Beyond 
this, a number of studies have attempted to analyse the extent to which violence had 
broader affects, especially on democracy and participation in democracy. 
</p>
<p>38. Election violence can reduce voter turnout, affect voter registration, prevent 
candidates from running for office, increase divisions in society or even prevent or 
postpone an election from taking place at all.67 A detailed study of the consequences of 
election violence in Sri Lanka concluded that &#8220;violence directly influenced political 
participation, voter turnout and voters&#8217; mobility [and that] fear and frustration linger[ed] for 
years after the violence occurred&#8221;.68 It found that individuals refrained from voting because 
of violence, and that party supporters went into hiding before and after the election.69 A 
similarly detailed study of evidence from Gujarat found that Hindu-Muslim riots led to 
notable vote swings in later elections.70 
</p>
<p>39. UNDP notes that election violence can also hinder economic and other development: 
&#8220;incidents of violence undermine government legitimacy, scare away domestic foreign 
investors, and result in low levels of social trust&#8221;.71

<p><b> IV. Typology of election-related killings 
</b></p>
<p>40. The country studies in the appendix provide a basis for broader conclusions about 
the characteristics and features of election-related killings. The most common types of 
election-related killings are examined in detail below in part V. This section sets out 
typologies of election-related killings, providing cross-national detail on perpetrators, 
victims, motives, methods, locations, timing and effects. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Identity of the perpetrator 
</b></p>
<p>41. The country case studies indicate that the perpetrators of election-related killings 
include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; State security forces, including the regular police, specialized police units, army, 
intelligence or republican or presidential guards 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Armed non-State pro-Government actors, including paramilitaries, militias and 
gangs 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Armed non-State actors linked to or controlled by politicians or political parties, 
including militias, civilian armed forces, private armies, bodyguards and gangs 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Armed non-State anti-Government actors, including insurgents, terrorist groups, 
rebel groups, anti-Government elements or separatists 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Criminal gangs, especially groups involved in the trafficking of weapons or drugs 
and that often have a degree of territorial control 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political leaders or political candidates, generally acting through armed State or non-
State actors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Civilian supporters of a political candidate or party 
</p>
<p><b> B. Identity of the victim 
</b></p>
<p>42. The victims of election-related killings include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political leaders or candidates 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Members or supporters of a political candidate or party 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Family members of political candidates or members of a political party 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Potential or actual voters for a rival party 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political activists 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protestors and demonstrators 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Journalists 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bystanders 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Witnesses to an election-related killing 
</p>
<p>&#8226; State security force members, police or military (domestic, foreign or international) 
&#8226; Bodyguards or private armed forces of a political leader or candidate </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13553 
</p>
<p><b> C. Motive for the killing 
</b></p>
<p>43. The following motives can be identified: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To spread fear through the electorate to inhibit voting generally and thereby disrupt 
or discredit the electoral process 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To spread fear among political candidates generally, to prevent them from running 
for office 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To neutralize the political threat of a particular rival candidate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To neutralize the threat of a rival party 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To spread fear among election officials to disrupt the electoral process 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent potential voters from registering to vote 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent supporters of a candidate or party from hanging political posters, 
distributing leaflets or participating in other political campaigning 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To pressure voters to vote for a particular candidate or party 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To punish perceived supporters or voters of a particular candidate or a party, or to 
punish them for voting at all 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To quell a public protest or prevent public political expression 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To physically steal ballots or disrupt ballot counting 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To force voters to leave a particular area 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent a potential coup 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To punish a citizen for having participated in a political protest 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To strengthen organized criminal influence over political candidates or parties 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent information about a fraudulent process or violence from being publicized 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent election-related human rights fact-finding or advocacy 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prevent a witness to violence from testifying 
</p>
<p><b> D. Method or means of killing 
</b></p>
<p>44. Diverse means were employed, often depending on both the perpetrator and the 
motive: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Most incidents involved victims being shot to death by security forces, militias or 
others with firearms, including handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In countries experiencing armed conflict or where there is an active insurgency or 
terrorist group, victims were often killed by the detonation of various explosive 
devices. Insurgents generally used improvised explosive devices, whether suicide, 
vehicle-borne or roadside devices; there was also some use of grenades and 
landmines. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In other incidents, especially involving clashes between rival party supporters, 
victims were beaten, hacked, stabbed or burned to death. </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Location of killing 
</b></p>
<p>45. Election-related killings occur especially at election-related events or sites: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political rallies 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Public or street demonstrations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Homes or offices of political candidates or party members 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political party offices 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sites of voter registration 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Polling sites 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On transport (cars, buses) to polling sites, voter registration sites or political rallies 
&#8226; Government buildings 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Public places where citizens gather (for example, markets) 
</p>
<p><b> F. Stage of the election 
</b></p>
<p>46. Killings occurred at all stages of the election cycle: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Pre-election.</b> Some killings occur even before an election date has been announced 
(e.g., when an election has been postponed, or during attempts to force a 
Government to hold an election). Killings also occur during voter registration and 
the political campaign period. The most common types of killings pre-election are 
killings of political rivals, killings by insurgents to disrupt the election process and 
killings of protestors by State forces. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Election-day.</b> While numerous authors have noted that election-day itself can often 
be calm, this observation should not be overstated. The Special Rapporteur has 
recorded election-day killings in recent elections in Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, 
Iraq, Nepal and Pakistan. Election-day killings were especially experienced by 
countries experiencing an armed insurgency, and often occurred near voting sites. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Election run-off.</b> Killings have been documented in the period between an initial 
election and a run-off to determine the winner in an allegedly close race. Such 
killings were often carried out to intimidate voters to influence voter preferences. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Post-election.</b> Killings were committed before and after the announcement of 
election results, while votes were being counted and, in some cases, many months 
after the election. Common types of killings in this period include killings by State 
forces of post-election protestors; killings of voters by State forces, militias or 
insurgents to punish them for having voted for a rival or at all; and killings of 
witnesses to prevent them from testifying. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Effect 
</b></p>
<p>47. The effects of the killings documented in the country case studies are difficult to 
analyse in detail owing to a lack of comprehensive country information. In addition to the 
obvious loss of life, the consequent harm to victims&#8217; families and community, and 
generalized insecurity, the following effects were observed:

<p><b> V. Analysis of detention-related killings 
</b></p>
<p>48. The section below provides detailed analysis of the most significant and common 
types of election-related killings.72 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings by the security forces during election protests 
</b></p>
<p>49. The experience of the Special Rapporteur indicates that one of the most frequent and 
important types of election killings are those by State security forces (generally police, but 
sometimes military) against demonstrators and bystanders in the context of election-related 
public demonstrations or protests. 
</p>
<p>50. Election-related protests are generally held shortly after the day of voting or after the 
election results are announced. Citizens are often protesting perceived electoral fraud and 
the announced election results. Such protests were held in early 2007 in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo; in December 2007 to January 2008 in Kenya; in March 2008 in 
Armenia; in November 2008 in Nigeria; in July 2009 in Mongolia; and from June to 
December 2009 in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In some cases, protests have been directed 
at a Government that refused or postponed elections, or that broke pre-election promises, as 
occurred in February 2009 in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, where an anti-Government protest was held 
after the Government again postponed elections delayed since 2005; and in September 2009 
in Guinea, where a protest was held against the military junta, including against indications 
that the junta leader would break his pledge not to run in presidential elections. Through 
early 2010 in Thailand, protests were held in an attempt to force the Government to hold 
early elections. 
</p>
<p>51. Some protests are planned or strongly instigated by opposition politicians or 
political parties, while others are a relatively spontaneous reaction by voters to anger at 
electoral processes and outcomes. In most cases, protests were a combination of 
spontaneous citizen protest and organized political activity. In nearly all cases surveyed, the 
protestors were supporters of the party or leader not in Government or that lost an election. 
In some cases, supporters of both the Government and of the opposition protested and 
rioted, as witnessed in Kenya and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>72
 Each of the country examples or incidents referred to in this section come from the country survey 
</p>
<p>summarized in the appendix. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>52. Election protestors may be unarmed and peaceful, or they may be engaged in street 
riots involving significant property damage, or even violence against other civilians or 
security forces. In those cases, where supporters of both the Government and the opposition 
protested, there were high levels of civilian-on-civilian violence, often linked not only to 
political differences but also to existing religious or ethnic cleavages (see paras. 77&#8211;81 
below). 
</p><p>53. The circumstances in which the lethal use of force by security forces is permitted are 
strictly circumscribed by international human rights law: the force must be necessary and 
proportionate to the threat posed, and intentional lethal force is only permitted where it is 
necessary to protect life.73 Killings by security forces during a protest may be lawful 
responses to a violent individual or group in a crowd or protest; for example, where 
protestors are armed and threatening or involved in violence, it may be entirely appropriate 
for the police to respond with force to protect other citizens or themselves. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, however, indicates that there have been many 
instances of excessive or indiscriminate force by the security forces in violation of 
international law during their policing of an election-related protest. It is also clear that, 
when such killings occur, they can often take place in large numbers: in Kenya, at least 400 
killed by police; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 100 killed by police and 
army; in Guinea, where an estimated 150 were killed by security forces, including by the 
presidential guard; in Nigeria, at least 90 killed by security forces; and in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, where between 30 and 70 people were killed by police, revolutionary 
guard and Basij militia. 
</p><p>55. In almost all cases surveyed, victims were killed by being shot by the security 
forces; in a smaller number of cases, they were beaten or stabbed to death by the 
authorities. Many of the shootings were in circumstances where police opened fire on a 
crowd, and protestors were killed relatively indiscriminately. In some incidents, victims 
were individually targeted and shot at close range, or executed immediately following being 
detained. 
</p>
<p>56. Pre-election violence or election-day violence does not appear to be a good predictor 
of post-election violence of this type. In fact, in a number of the incidents studied, the pre-
election and election-day stages were relatively calm (for example, as seen in Armenia, 
Kenya and Mongolia). 
</p><p>57. The causes and motives of the lethal shootings vary from case to case. In some 
cases, it is likely that the police lacked the appropriate use of force guidelines, training, 
experience and equipment to control the crowd lawfully and appropriately. Poor and violent 
policing of protests or riots is not limited to the election context, and is a common problem 
around the world, often caused by legal, technical, planning and training deficiencies. In 
such cases, the killings might be the result of excessive and unlawful force, but not 
necessarily politically motivated, nor part of a broader attempt to suppress political 
opposition and restrict freedom of expression. In these circumstances, the Government 
should immediately make clear public statements against the killings and commit to a full 
investigation. The Government, with international assistance where appropriate, should 
undertake an independent review of the events to determine the causes of the violence and 
necessary reforms. Investigations in such cases should aim to review the individual and 
structural causes or conditions for the killings in full, including whether the police use of 
force guidelines comply with the international law on the use of force; whether the police 
have any and appropriate plans for crowd-control situations; whether police have

</p>
<p>equipment and weapons appropriate for crowd control; the role of police intelligence; 
whether there were failures in the police command and control; and what orders were given 
to police. The Waki Commission in Kenya is a notable example of such an investigation, 
which carried out an in-depth inquiry of killings by police during post-election violence, 
and proposed a range of reforms to improve the ability of police to respond lawfully. 
Inquiries like the Waki Commission are unfortunately an all too rare occurrence.74 
</p>
<p>58. It is especially important in such cases that individual perpetrators, as well as any 
responsible commanding officers, be investigated and prosecuted. Police are often not held 
to account for unlawful killings during protests because of accountability deficiencies that 
affect investigations or prosecutions generally, such as a lack of independence in police 
internal affairs, poor policing oversight or corruption or resource issues in the criminal 
justice system.75 The country may need to take special steps following security force 
killings during a protest to ensure that the police responsible are investigated, such as by 
creating a special task force or requesting the assistance of international investigators. 
Countering impunity for police abuses is a key step in deterring and reducing future abuses.  
</p>
<p>59. In other cases, as in the incidents examined in Guinea, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the killings are politically motivated: the 
security forces are closely controlled by political leaders, and are used to unlawfully 
suppress opposition movements or political expression. The security forces may be 
deployed, for example, to shut down even a peaceful political protest, and may use violence 
to do so. In extreme cases, the protests provide an opportunity for leaders to use the security 
forces to intentionally kill members or supporters of the political opposition. Particularly 
important in the context of politically motivated security force killings are those forces 
(especially elite units, or presidential or republican guards) which are either composed of 
individuals personally loyal to a leader or whose command structure is politicized. As a 
result, they can easily be used for personal or political purposes. It is very unlikely in these 
cases that training or technical reforms will, without significantly more, effectively reduce 
abuses by the security forces. 
</p>
<p>60. Reducing killings of this form depends almost entirely on whether external actors 
(e.g., donor countries, diplomats, the United Nations, regional organizations, international 
civil society) or internal actors (e.g., opposition leaders or parties, domestic civil society, 
the public) can successfully influence the political will of leaders in the short term (to 
inhibit their violent deployment of Government forces) and long term (to institute reforms 
to depoliticize the country&#8217;s security forces). Depoliticization may require structural 
changes to recruitment processes for the particular security force, to encourage the 
development of a force that is broadly representative and not composed solely of those 
personally loyal to a leader. Often, the command structure of the force may need to be 
reformed so that the force (particularly where it is a republican guard) is integrated into the 
regular command structure of the army and not subject to the personal control of a political 
leader. 
</p>
<p>61. Where the killings are politically motivated, the Government should also be 
encouraged by the international community to set up an independent commission to review 
the incident. However, if there is political control over the security forces, generally it will 
be unlikely that an independent commission will be created by the Government or that its 
findings will be released or followed up by the Government. The international community 
may be able to push for its own independent commission, as occurred in Guinea following 
the &#8220;Bloody Monday&#8221; massacre.

</p>
<p>&#8226; Candidate or party mobilization of public protests 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A tradition or culture of public political demonstrations 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by insurgents 
</b></p>
<p>63. Election-related killings by insurgents or other rebel groups present an entirely 
different set of problems. A rebel group&#8217;s broad aims are to fundamentally change the 
structure of the State or the type of government, to oust the present Government or to create 
an autonomous region or separate State. In choosing to seek these outcomes through 
violence rather than through non-violent political means, they are generally opposed to 
elections as such. They do not view elections as a legitimate means to determine State 
authority, and they use the election period to undermine the Government and democratic 
processes; thus, their election-related actions are often directed towards spreading fear 
among voters, candidates, party supporters and election officials, disrupting and 
discrediting the electoral process or election day, and punishing voters. Before the March 
2010 elections in Iraq, for instance, Al-Qaida in Iraq released a statement that the elections 
were &#8220;illicit&#8221; and that they would attempt to &#8220;prevent these elections&#8221; using &#8220;primarily 
military means&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>64. While violence by rebel groups occurs regardless of the presence of elections, their 
violence often increases during the election cycle. The elections held in Afghanistan in 
August 2009, for example, saw a marked increase in attacks by anti-Government elements, 
and suicide bombings and other attacks also increased in both Iraq and Pakistan before 
elections. Election-day was generally not peaceful in those countries studied with insurgent 
activity: for example, in Afghanistan, 31 civilians, including 11 election officials, as well as 
29 security force members, were killed on the day of voting (20 August 2009); killings 
occurred on each of the five election days in India in April and May 2009; killings occurred 
in Papua, Indonesia, on its 9 April 2009 voting day; and at least 40 were killed on election 
day in the 2010 elections in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>65. Because the insurgent group&#8217;s intent is essentially to spread fear through the 
electorate, random and unpredictable election violence during the election cycle might 
often be expected. The case studies above provide examples of what appear to be random 
or entirely indiscriminate insurgent killings during the election cycle, and these are difficult 
to distinguish from insurgent violence more generally (e.g., roadside bombs killing civilians 
on their way to a wedding in Helmand, Afghanistan). The case studies do indicate, 
however, that election-related insurgent attacks often aim at particular election-related </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-13553 
</p>
<p>locations or categories of victim. Thus, for example, strikes have often taken place at 
polling stations and political rallies, or while individuals have travelled to or from election-
related locations or events. They have often targeted political candidates, election officials 
and party members or candidate campaigners. In Afghanistan, for example, candidates and 
their staff were especially targeted in the pre-election period; they were subjected to 
widespread intimidation and attacks at their homes, or attacks while travelling to or from 
election events. In Colombia, approximately half of the election-related killings were of 
political candidates; and before the February 2008 elections in Pakistan, attacks aimed at 
politicians and their campaign events were responsible for many deaths. In Indonesia, 
before the parliamentary elections on 9 April 2009, five politicians were assassinated, most 
likely by separatists.  
</p>
<p>66. Insurgents have also targeted voters or potential voters. Insurgents or rebel groups 
have often called for voters to boycott elections, as they did in Afghanistan, Colombia, 
India, Indonesia, Iraq and Spain. In numerous cases, citizens were warned of reprisals for 
voting. In Afghanistan, for example, the Taliban issued a letter to the public the week 
before the August 2009 elections, warning of reprisals for anyone who voted. Similarly, in 
Iraq, a militant group issued written warnings that they would kill voters; and before the 
April&#8211;May 2009 elections in India, the Naxalite insurgents threatened potential voters. 
There is not sufficient detail in many country reports to determine the extent to which 
voters were in fact subsequently killed for having voted, although on election day in 
Afghanistan, the Taliban hanged at least two people who had voted (indicated by their ink-
stained fingers); and in West Bengal, India, in a presumed attack on voters, shortly after 
voting, a bomb attack resulted in one death. 
</p>
<p>67. Those working at polling sites, including election officials and security officials, are 
also prime targets of insurgent threats and violence. In April&#8211;May 2009 elections in India, 
Naxalites launched a number of attacks on polling places and officials, and 11 election 
officials were killed on election day in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>68. The methods employed by insurgents to attack (e.g., grenade attacks in the 
Philippines, a variety of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, 
and landmines and other explosives in India) are often indiscriminate. Thus, while the 
attack may be nominally targeted at certain officials or locations, many civilians and 
bystanders have also been killed. In Pakistan, numerous explosions in the pre-election 
period resulted in extensive civilian casualties. Suicide bombers targeting Benazir Bhutto&#8217;s 
convoy on the night of her return to Pakistan on 18 October 2007, missed her, but killed 
over 140 people, and an attack aimed at another candidate on 21 December 2007 killed at 
least 50 worshippers at a mosque. 
</p>
<p>69. The above types of election killings, because they occur in the context of broader 
conflict, are extraordinarily difficult to address specifically. However, given the often 
notable increase in insurgent killings during elections and their impact on candidates and 
voter turnout, significantly more attention needs to be given to how to minimize insurgent 
violence during election periods. In addition to the general counter-insurgency, peace 
process and security promoting measures taken in an attempt to resolve the underlying 
causes of conflict, or to reduce insurgency-related violence, some measures taken by 
Governments and the international community might include the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Insurgent election-related killings are often targeted at places or individuals. 
Especially vulnerable are political candidates, election officials and election locations, 
including political rallies and polling sites. As the United Nations Commission into the 
Bhutto murder in Pakistan indicates, many deaths could be prevented if security measures 
were improved. Increased security should be focused on candidates and polling sites. 
Increased security should be planned not just for election day, but also especially in the pre-
election period, and should continue into the post-election period where necessary; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p> (b) The United Nations and civil society groups should, where appropriate and 
feasible, maintain contact with insurgent groups through the election period, to discourage 
them from unlawfully targeting civilians and civilian locations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Insurgent threats, intimidation and violence towards potential voters can 
result in significant reductions in voter turnout, with grave negative effects on election 
legitimacy and on the development of democratic processes. In countries or areas where 
insurgents have called for boycotts and threatened violence against voters, more attention 
should be devoted to considering how voters can vote while minimizing retaliation. Voting 
practices that, for example, result in voters having semi-permanent marks on their bodies 
(e.g., ink stained fingers) allow insurgents to identify voters for punishment, and may be 
inappropriate in some contexts; 
</p>
<p> (d) Election monitors in countries experiencing insurgency operate in very 
difficult conditions. Special measures may need to be developed to allow them to safely 
(and anonymously) undertake their essential work during insurgencies or armed conflict, 
including by using informal networks of monitors and developing technology-based 
reporting. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings of political candidates (assassinations) 
</b>70. Political candidates at all levels have been killed during election cycles, and 
particularly during the pre-election stage, for a range of reasons. Candidate killings have 
taken place as part of a general attempt to disrupt elections (e.g., assassinations by 
insurgents, discussed above, which form a large proportion of the number of candidate 
assassinations). 
71. The assassinations have been carried out as part of an attempt to reduce the threat of 
a particular political party or to neutralize the threat of a specific rival candidate. Many 
killings of this type took place before State and federal elections in Nigeria in 2007. The 
killings were generally carried out by rival politicians&#8217; own armed groups, composed 
mainly of unemployed youths. Such private gangs or militias tend to be created and 
maintained a long time before the election itself. Many political parties and candidates 
mobilized such armed groups in Nigeria, especially the larger parties who had more 
available funding. Both before and during the election cycle, Governments should make 
concerted efforts to dismantle private armed groups and prosecute those responsible for 
participating in or forming them. State forces should also protect citizens from armed 
groups. While private militias carried out the killings in Nigeria, Nigerian police were often 
blamed for failing to protect victims from violence and for failing to hold perpetrators to 
account. Killings of political rivals also occurred before the 2007 elections in Guatemala, 
during the 2008 elections in Nepal, and were suspected to have occurred before the March 
2010 elections in Iraq (although analysts found it difficult to verify motives). Where there is 
a history of violent political animosity between parties, some efforts to reduce violence 
have included codes of conduct negotiated and agreed to by the political parties. The State 
may also need to provide heightened security to candidates or key officials. 
</p>
<p>72. While killings of candidates are often carried out by rival candidates&#8217; private forces 
(militias, gangs, bodyguards or hired killers), State security forces have also been 
responsible for killings. After the April 2005 elections in Togo, the security forces targeted 
a number of opposition leaders; in 2008, in Zimbabwe, security forces and Government-
aligned militias together killed rival candidates in an attempt to &#8220;dismantle&#8221; the opposition. 
The issues and reforms relevant to this type are similar to those discussed above with regard 
to the killings of protestors. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-13553 
</p>
<p>73. In some cases, the killings were part of an attempt by criminal organizations to 
exercise influence over candidates and policies. In Guatemala, for example, over 50 
candidates and activists were killed in the run-up to the 2007 elections, many of whom 
seem likely to have been killed by organized criminal groups to increase their political 
influence. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Killings of supporters of a rival candidate or party 
</b></p>
<p>74. The supporters of a particular candidate or party have been frequent targets of 
election-violence, carried out generally by State security forces or the private armed groups 
of political leaders. Such killings generally take place in an environment of intimidation of 
supporters and potential voters of a rival party or candidate, and are generally carried out to 
persuade supporters to change political allegiances or to intimidate voters into voting for 
the party supported by the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>75. State security forces have been responsible for large numbers of such killings. In the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, in March 2007, the army, the republican 
guard and other security forces were deployed to target presumed opposition supporters, 
and they arrested and killed many. The killings occurred after the President was elected and 
the opposition leader refused to give up his own security force. Similarly motivated killings 
were witnessed in February 2008, when the Government launched a heavily armed police 
operation against a rival political-religious group, killing between 100 and 200 people. In 
April 2005, in Togo, State security forces, together with militias, killed hundreds of 
individuals beginning on election day and in the days following. The killings were carried 
out as part of an attempt to rig the election results. In Zimbabwe, in the March and June 
2008 elections, the Government used its security forces to kill hundreds of opposition 
voters in an attempt to force them to change their votes and to punish them for voting for 
the opposition party. These killings occur because the security forces are heavily politicized 
and thus are very similar to politically motivated killings by security forces in response to 
street demonstrations, discussed above. Security force training and other reforms aimed at 
professionalizing the forces are necessary but will be of little effect if the forces are not 
made independent of political leaders and if leaders are not pressured to stop violent 
deployments. 
</p>
<p>76. Killings of rival supporters have also been carried out by a candidate or party&#8217;s 
private armed forces or hired killers. Besides killing rival candidates, politicians&#8217; private 
armed groups in Nigeria killed many rival party supporters. In an especially egregious 
example, in the Philippines, in November 2009, an incumbent politician&#8217;s private militia 
massacred 57 civilians who were going to witness a candidate&#8217;s registration. In one incident 
in Sri Lanka, gunmen on motorbikes opened fire on a bus of opposition candidate 
supporters on their way to a rally, killing a 60-year-old woman and injuring four others. In 
Guatemala, some activists were shot while distributing party leaflets, and other party 
members were found dead with campaign posters covering them. The country examples 
studied by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the circumstances that result in the highest 
levels of intimidation and killings by private actors of voters are where politicians or 
candidates control permanent or semi-permanent armed groups. As indicated above, the 
Government should take measures to dismantle these groups, and significant further 
research is needed on the most effective ways to do so. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Rival party supporter-on-supporter killings 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience and the country case studies indicate that rival 
supporters have also killed each other during elections. There are two broad types of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>supporter killings: small fights between rival supporters, usually at an election-related site 
and that result in one or a small number of deaths; and large-scale clashes between rival 
supporters, generally following the release of disputed election results. 
</p>
<p>78. Small fights resulting in killings have occurred with some frequency in a range of 
election contexts, but supporter-on-supporter incidents generally result in a low number of 
killings. They are essentially one-on-one fights, or fights between small groups of rival 
supporters. Many do not appear to have been pre-planned, but appear to be the result of an 
argument or dispute that has escalated to murder. These incidents have often occurred on 
voting day, at a polling site, and they have also occurred at other election locations (e.g., 
campaign rallies). In Sri Lanka, for example, before the elections held on 26 January 2010, 
on 16 January, a Rajapaksa supporter was shot dead in a clash with Fonseka supporters. On 
18 January, a Fonseka supporter was beaten to death while putting up Fonseka posters. In 
the third phase of the April&#8211;May 2009 elections in India, rival supporters fought in West 
Bengal, leaving 11 dead; in the fourth phase, 12 people were killed in fighting between 
rival parties (each party accused the other of inciting violence to prevent voting); in the fifth 
phase, fighting between rival parties led to one death in Tamil Nadu and another in West 
Bengal. On election day in Nepal, on 10 April 2008, one person was killed after fighting 
broke out between rival parties in Sunsari. Small-scale clashes resulting in deaths between 
rival party supporters were also reported in Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>79. When such killings occur, political leaders should immediately and publicly 
condemn them, and the perpetrators should be prosecuted. Where there is a history of such 
killings in a country, the security arrangements at key election sites should be reviewed 
and, where necessary, strengthened. Long-term measures to reduce supporter violence 
should be developed in countries with repeated violence. 
</p>
<p>80. Large-scale clashes between rivals are a very different phenomenon. Two of the 
most significant incidents were witnessed in Nigeria and Kenya. In Nigeria, the perception 
that a local election in November 2008 was rigged triggered clashes between the largely 
Christian supporters of one party, and the largely Muslim supporters of another party, 
resulting in the deaths of at least 700 people, most of whom were beaten to death by armed 
mobs. In Kenya, allegations of electoral fraud after the 2007 elections led to violence and 
riots resulting in at least 1,113 deaths. As indicated above, police were responsible for an 
estimated 405 deaths, but the remaining 700-plus victims were killed by fellow citizens. In 
the short term, violence of this order must be countered by the immediate deployment of 
well-trained police and, sometimes, military forces. Deployments are often slow to arrive, 
and the forces ill-equipped to deal with the violence. When such clashes occur, they may be 
triggered by the perception of election fraud, but they have deep, long-term causes, 
generally linked with religious-ethnic rivalries and perceptions of unfair distribution of 
resources. Addressing election violence in these contexts must thus be conceived as a part 
of long-term efforts with regard to, for example, land disputes, institution-building, civic 
education and conflict resolution. 
</p>
<p>81. While the violence may at first glance appear to be by private actors, the State may 
nevertheless play an important role. The violence may have been instigated or planned by 
senior officials, as the Kenya example indicates. In addition, the police, because of resource 
or training deficiencies, may be unable to meet to their international due diligence 
obligations to effectively prevent violence. Political or other bias by the police may result in 
failures to protect civilians from violence (by, for example, not intervening to prevent 
physical attacks, or by failing to arrest perpetrators). In Kenya, for example, the Waki 
Commission found that officials had failed to act on intelligence regarding violence and had 
failed to respond adequately to violence, and that police lacked discipline and impartiality. </p>

<p><b> F. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>82. In one country studied (the Islamic Republic of Iran), evidence suggests that the 
death penalty was used in such a way that it should be classified as a form of election-
related killing. To date, at least 10 death sentences have been handed down against post-
election protestors on vague charges of <i>moharabeh</i>. In the months before and after the June 
2009 elections, the Government executed significantly higher numbers of people than 
usual, in an apparent attempt to intimidate voters and protestors. International law is clear 
that the death penalty may only be applied as a penalty for the crime of intentional murder, 
and it can only be applied following a trial that observes all fair trial guarantees.76 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Election monitoring and election-related violence 
</b></p>
<p>83. Monitoring and reporting on election-related violence often takes place as part of a 
much broader assessment undertaken by election monitoring organizations. Election 
monitoring reports provide information on whether an election was genuinely free and 
fair,77 and thus typically address issues related to, for example, whether the State&#8217;s election 
law complies with international standards; the conduct of the national election commission; 
candidate and voter registration processes; whether political parties could freely campaign; 
media freedom; ballot design and whether the voting process was fair; and the vote-
counting process. 
</p>
<p>84. Country election monitoring reports cover election-related violence to widely 
varying degrees, and reporting on violence is sometimes very poor. Some reports 
significantly underreport violence incidents, especially violence in the pre- and post-
election periods;78 others provide general information but without the detail necessary to 
understand incidents or work towards their prevention. Other reports provide detailed charts 
or annexes of election violent incidents; the better reports analyse the raw data to provide 
general conclusions on perpetrators, causes and the like. 
</p>
<p>85. Poor coverage of violence in election-monitoring reports may be due in part to a 
lack of detailed guidance in election monitoring guidelines and handbooks. While most 
handbooks point to the importance of monitoring and reporting on election violence, little 
guidance is generally given on what information should be reported. The fifth edition of the 
Election Observation Handbook (2007) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, for example, sets out to provide a thorough overview of election monitoring. It 
provides a number of references to the importance of violence-free elections, and requires 
observers to report incidents of violence, but does not provide further guidance. Similarly, 
the second edition of the European Commission&#8217;s Handbook for European Union Election 
Observation (2008) provides detailed guidance on election monitoring, and repeatedly 
stresses the need for the mission to investigate and report on election violence, but it 
provides almost no guidance on how to do so. The Principles for Election Monitoring, 
Management and Observation in the SADC Region (2003) of the Electoral Institute of 
Southern Africa refer to the undesirability of election violence, but impose no specific

 In one empirical study, Judith Kelley found that &#8220;pre-election violence is associated with greater 
</p>
<p>levels of [election monitor] endorsements&#8221;. Kelley explains that pre-election violence actually 
incentivizes monitors to dampen their criticism in the hopes of lessening post-election conflict; see 
Judith Kelley, &#8220;D-minus elections: the politics and norms of international election observation&#8221; 
(International Organization 63, 2009). </p>

</b></p>
<p>reporting obligations. The Methods of Election Observation: A Manual for OAS Electoral 
Observation Missions (2007) of the Organization of American States refers in general terms 
to monitoring incidents of violence. The African Union&#8217;s Election Observation and 
Monitoring Guidelines sets out that &#8220;intimidation&#8221; and &#8220;human rights violations&#8221; should be 
monitored. 
</p>
<p>86. Where reporting on violence is poor, the effects of the violence, including on 
election legitimacy, election processes (e.g., voter participation, voting patterns and 
candidate behaviour) and election outcomes are very difficult to assess. Poor reporting also 
makes it difficult to understand the causes of the violence, which inhibits the ability of 
advocates, officials or the Government to propose and implement reforms to reduce 
violence at future elections. 
</p>
<p>87. Election monitoring reports should, where appropriate and feasible, cover election-
related violence in detail. Ideally, each incident would be recorded and reported with 
information gathered on the circumstances, location, perpetrators, victims and motives. 
Reports should also provide a general analysis of incidents or patterns across the country. 
Detailed guidance on violence reporting could usefully be provided in election monitoring 
guidelines or handbook documents. Election monitoring organizations, together with other 
key actors involved in addressing election violence, should consider developing common 
criteria and standards for collecting and reporting on election violence.79 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>88. <b>Election-related violence, including killing, is a widespread phenomenon that 
does not receive sufficient direct attention. The Human Rights Council should request 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to present an annual report 
documenting such cases and the measures taken in response to protect human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>While election killings take place at the hands of a diverse array of actors, State 
responsibility remains central in many cases, such as when (a) State security forces 
themselves carry out the killings, which have often occurred at public demonstrations, 
or of rival party candidates, supporters or voters; (b) Government officials plan, 
direct or order private groups or militias to carry out killings; or (c) the Government 
fails to adequately protect citizens from non-State violence (e.g., the Government fails 
to disarm a candidate&#8217;s private militia; the security forces fail to account for post-
election violence). 
</b>90. <b>In countries with a track record of election violence, Governments should draw 
up plans for dealing with such violence in the future in ways that are consistent with 
their human rights obligations. Too often, Governments respond as if they had no 
inkling that relatively predictable violence would in fact occur. While some of the 
details of such contingency planning will need to remain confidential, it is also 
essential that the authorities release enough detailed information in order to make it 
clear that serious planning has been undertaken, as well as to discourage those 
potentially violent forces who might otherwise assume there will be few obstacles to, 
and no consequences flowing from, their actions.

 Guidance may usefully be developed in consultation with the International Foundation for Electoral 
</p>
<p>Systems, which maintains the Election Violence and Education and Resolution Project, which has 
developed methodologies to gather, record, monitor, map and analyse election violence in the 11 
countries it has thus far been active in, and maintains detailed databases. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> GE.10-13553 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Impunity for election-related violence is widespread. Investigations and 
prosecutions are essential to reduce future violence. In countries with recurring 
election violence, the Government should consider setting up special police and 
prosecutor task forces to focus specifically on election-related murders and other 
crimes. Following extensive election violence, the Government, with international 
assistance where appropriate, should set up an independent commission with a 
mandate to comprehensively study the violence and propose the necessary reforms. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The international community must be prepared to offer more support in post-
violence situations. Ideally, there would be a unit within the United Nations structure 
that would automatically offer assistance in all such cases. Furthermore, the progress 
and outcomes of national commissions should be closely followed by the international 
community.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The reality is, however, that, in the majority of situations in which heavily 
challenged election practices are followed by serious violence, the Government will be 
deeply implicated and unwilling under any circumstances to commission any sort of 
independent inquiry. The Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights have a major responsibility to take appropriate action in such cases. The 
International Criminal Court may also have an important role to play in some 
situations. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Post-election demonstrations are one of the most frequent contexts of election 
killings. Before elections, police should receive crowd- and riot-control training, and 
be equipped with the appropriate equipment. The security forces should prepare 
plans in advance for policing the post-election period. In some cases, international 
police assistance may be appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Many killings of candidates or voters are the result of politicized security 
forces, controlled by political leaders and used for unlawful political purposes. In 
these cases, the international community should undertake to assist the Government 
to depoliticize its forces through long-term restructuring and training efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Further research should examine the role played by presidential guards or 
equivalent forces whose loyalty is de facto to the President rather than the State and 
whose role in the context of elections seems generally unlikely to be conducive to the 
enjoyment of electoral and democratic freedoms. There is a legitimate question as to 
how a leader in an unstable society can legitimately protect himself and his 
Government short of achieving comprehensive reform of the entire armed forces. But 
the electoral implications of such arrangements need to be better understood and 
measures put in place to diminish the likelihood of the presidential guard playing an 
abusive role. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>In countries where candidates or political leaders control private armed 
groups, significant efforts need to be taken to research those links and to dismantle 
the groups before and during elections.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>It is important that election monitoring include detailed information on election 
violence, including violence that occurs in the pre- and post-election phases. Accurate 
and comprehensive reporting is essential to prevent the recurrence of violence during 
an election, permits rapid responses to violent incidents, promotes accountability and 
aids in understanding election dynamics.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Common criteria and standards should be developed to guide election violence 
monitoring and reporting.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>There is a great need for focused, in-depth research in the area of election-
related violence. This includes research on the various types of human rights abuses </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13553 <b>27 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed during election periods, including killings, torture, arbitrary detention, 
sexual violence and forced displacement. Research is also especially needed on the 
causes and effects of election violence, which are significantly understudied.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Election monitoring is a relatively recent phenomenon which came of age only 
at the end of the Cold War. Although it has gained a remarkable degree of 
acceptance, it inevitably remains a highly sensitive issue for Governments struggling 
to stay in power. Assertions of interference in sovereignty are thus never far beneath 
the surface. Nevertheless, it is essential that election monitors move systematically 
beyond a focus on the formal structures of elections and election-day monitoring. It 
should be understood that an election is not free or fair unless the authorities can 
show that they have done all within their power to minimize and respond to election-
related violence. For its part, the human rights community also needs to pay more 
attention to elections per se, rather than focus primarily on specific incidents of 
violence.</b></p>

<p><b>  Survey of election-related killings around the world 
</b></p>
<p>1. In order to understand and analyse the phenomenon of election-related killings, the 
Special Rapporteur carried out detailed research on selected countries that experienced 
election violence during the last five years, with a particular focus on the period since 
2007.1 In 2008, reports of killings were documented in nearly 20 per cent of countries that 
held elections that year.2  
</p>
<p>2. The results of the case study research are summarized below, and include detail on 
election killings in: Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Colombia, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, 
Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan  
</b></p>
<p>3. Leading up to Afghanistan&#8217;s 20 August 2009 elections, the country saw a marked 
increase in violent attacks by Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) in what analysts have 
described as an attempt to disrupt the elections by creating a climate of fear and insecurity 
by intimidating voters, candidates and election officials.3  
</p>
<p>4. Killings were one of several tactics employed by insurgents, including kidnappings, 
threats, and setting up illegal checkpoints.4 Two weeks before the election, there were on 
average 32 violent attacks per day, rising to 48 attacks per day in the four days before 
election day.5 Examples of attacks include a 5 August roadside bomb in Helmand province, 
which killed five civilians on their way to a wedding, and a 6 August explosion which 
killed five policemen.6 The Taliban issued a letter to the public on 18 August, explicitly 
warning of reprisals for those who voted.  
</p>
<p>5. Candidates and their campaign staff bore the brunt of direct attacks leading up to 
election day. On 1 August, a Provincial Council candidate was attacked in Laghman 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The research was based on United Nations reports, human rights and election monitoring organization 
</p>
<p>reports, Government accounts, and media reports. For some countries, including Kenya and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, information is also based on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s on-site 
field investigations. The survey summarized here includes most, but not all, of the countries that 
experienced election-related killings in 2008, 2009, and 2010. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Sixty-three countries held elections in 2008. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s research documented election-
</p>
<p>related killings in 11 countries (17.4%): Armenia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, 
Guinea-Bissau, Macedonia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Spain, and Zimbabwe.

Afghan forces close to two Provincial Council candidates&#8217; houses in Logar province.7 On 
the same day, in Ghazni province, the provincial campaign manager for President Karzai 
and members of the Provincial Council candidates&#8217; convoy were attacked by AGEs while 
they were returning from an election gathering in Badghis province. Two people were 
killed.8 On 14 August, in Kapisa province, AGEs killed one person and injured two others 
who were returning from campaigning for President Karzai. On 16 August 2009, a roadside 
bomb hit a convoy of President Karzai&#8217;s campaigners in Jawzjan province, and AGEs 
killed one of President Karzai&#8217;s campaigners and injured two others in Kapisa province.

hung 2 people who had ink-stained fingers (indicating that they had voted).11 In Baghlan 
province, insurgent attacks closed 14 polling sites and several police officers were killed.12 
The district chief of police of Baghlan was killed during a fight with AGEs and the deputy 
district chief of police in Nangarhar province was killed during an attack by AGEs.13 
Violence also affected the international forces &#8211; August and July of 2009 resulted in the 
highest and second highest amount of US and foreign troop deaths since the US invasion in 
2001.14 On 15 August, a suicide car bomb exploded outside NATO headquarters in Kabul, 
killing at least seven people, and on 18 August a suicide bomber detonated a device in a car 
close to a column of NATO forces on the main road out of Kabul to Jalalabad, killing eight 
people.15

<p>7. A few hours after the preliminary election results were released on 25 August, a 
bomb blast killed 43 people in Kandahar city. (The Taliban were suspected but denied 
responsibility). On 12 September, as the first full results were being announced by the 
election committee, a wave of attacks across the country resulted in 66 deaths.

Conscience is linked to the Sam Rainsy Party, who opposed the CPP in the national 
elections. No one has been arrested in connection with the shooting.29 Civil society groups 
documented five cases of politically motivated killings between January 2008 and May

affiliations, but that attacks represented opposition to the election process and the 
Government in general.34 While the FARC rebel group was responsible for many of the 
killings, criminal gangs and former paramilitaries are also reported to be responsible for 
some deaths.35  
</p>
<p>14. The Organization of American States election report notes that the killings and 
intimidation led to approximately 10 per cent of candidates giving up their nominations.36 
The report also notes that some voters reported being warned that they would be killed if 
they voted. In some areas, the FARC urged boycotts of the elections, in others, they 
threatened violence if citizens voted for certain parties.37

<p><b>  Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 
October 2009 and investigated the extensive election-related killings in the west of the 
country stemming from the aftermath of the 2006 presidential elections in Kinshasa and the 
2007 legislative elections in Bas Congo.42 After President Kabila won the election run-off, 
and opposition leader Bemba refused to integrate his 400 personal soldiers into the 
command of the Congolese army, a street battle broke out between Bemba&#8217;s guards and the 
army in March 2007. Hundreds of deaths resulted, including of many civilians. Following 
these initial clashes, the army, the republican guard and other Government security forces 
carried out targeted killings of actual or presumed Bemba supporters, including killing 
those who had been (unlawfully) detained.  
17. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur investigated Government security force killings 
of members of the political-religious group <i>Bunda dia Kongo</i> (BDK) in Bas Congo 
following legislative elections in early 2007. In response to alleged election fraud, the BDK 
organized general strikes. The army was called in, and police and soldiers killed over 100 
people, mostly BDK supporters. An additional 100&#8211;200 people were killed the following 
February when the Government launched a three-week, heavily armed police operation 
against the BDK. Most observers described this operation as an attempt to neutralize the 
political threat of the BDK.

Individuals from parties across the political spectrum were subjected to bombing and 
machete attacks, as well as shootings, although more killings targeted parties on the left, 
and candidates at the municipal level. In April 2007, a Unity for Hope party congressman 
was shot in front of party headquarters.53 A number of Encuentro por Guatemala party 
members were found dead with campaign posters covering them.54 The son of Amilcar 
Mendez, a human rights activist with links to Alvaro Colom, one of the presidential 
candidates, was shot as he left work. It was believed his death was linked to his work with 
his father in informing American human rights groups of the threats and violence against 
candidates in the election.55 Some activists were shot while distributing party leaflets.56

<p>22. In what has been called &#8220;Bloody Monday&#8221;, tens of thousands of opposition 
supporters gathered in Conakry stadium on 28 September 2009 to protest the rule of the 
military junta, including the indication that junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara 
would break his pledge not to run in the upcoming January 2010 presidential elections.  
</p>
<p>23. Clashes between demonstrators and security forces began in the morning as 
demonstrators began to force their way through barricades to get to the stadium. In some 
instances demonstrators threw rocks and security forces retaliated with tear gas, chasing 
demonstrators down and beating them with batons.60 During this time a police officer shot a 
young man 300 metres from the stadium, and two others were shot and killed by gendarmes 
from Th&#233;gboro&#8217;s Anti-Drug and Organized Crime Unit, in the presence of their 
commander.61 Th&#233;gboro&#8217;s gendarme also stopped a busload of demonstrators on their way 
to the stadium and forced them outside the vehicle where at least two demonstrators were 
shot dead.62 Security forces eventually withdrew allowing the crowds and political leaders 
to enter the stadium, where they peacefully prayed, danced and sang and the political 
leaders gave interviews to journalists in the absence of a public address system.63 The 
presidential security battalion of the Guinean army, signified by their red berets, then 
descended on the stadium firing shots upon entering, while riot police (CMIS) shot tear gas 
inside.64 Once inside, the security battalion killed dozens by opening fire on the crowd.65 As 
their ammunition ran out, witnesses say the red berets then resorted to stabbing and beating 
other demonstrators to death.66 Women were raped and summarily executed.67 As 
demonstrators attempted to escape, more were fired upon and killed, while others were 
trampled by the crowds or electrocuted by wires placed in front of the exits by security 
forces.68 After the massacre at the stadium, several other survivors were executed as they 
returned home.69 While the United Nations Commission of Inquiry into the killings 
confirmed 156 individuals who were killed or disappeared,70 the Government&#8217;s own inquiry 
into the violence allegedly reports on 59 deaths.71

<p>24. India held a parliamentary election between April and May 2009 that had five 
phases to accommodate its 714 million eligible voters. The election was marked by 
violence during all of the phases, and attacks by Maoist insurgents and clashes between 
political rivals resulted in a number of deaths.72  
</p>
<p>25. In the first phase, on 16 April, at least 17 people, including 5 election officials and 
security personnel, were killed when the Naxalites, a Maoist insurgent group, attacked 
polling places and election workers in the States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and 
Orissa.73 Before the elections, the Naxalites called for citizens to boycott them, stated that 
they would use violence to disrupt voting, and warned that they would cut off the hands of 
those who voted.74 In Bihar, the Naxalites attacked a polling station and shot and killed a 
policeman and a guard.75 In Chhattisgarh, the Naxalites reportedly killed five poll officials 
by blowing up the car in which they were travelling, and also attacked polling booths in two 
other areas in the State, killing at least one member of the Indian security forces.76 In 
Jharkhand, the Naxalites reportedly killed seven security personnel and two civilians with a 
landmine.77 The Indian Election Commission announced that families of poll workers and 
security officials who were killed in the Naxalite violence would each receive Rs. 
100,000.78  
</p>
<p>26. In the second phase, on 23 April, approximately seven people were reported killed in 
separate attacks by Naxalites in Bihar and West Bengal in further attempts to disrupt the 
Indian electoral process.79 In Bihar, Naxalites used a landmine to blow up a jeep carrying 
poll officials and killed four police and an election worker, while in West Bengal, they shot 
two members of the Communist Party.80  
</p>
<p>27. There did not appear to be any deaths leading up to and during the third phase (7 
May), but in post-polling violence, supporters of the Communist Party and Trinamool 
Congress party fought in several districts of West Bengal using bombs, firearms and other 
weapons, and reportedly caused up to 11 deaths.81 In more post-polling violence, another 
person was reported killed by a bomb on 9 May in the West Bengali area of 
Udaynarayanpur area; the Communist Party claimed that the victim was a Communist Party 
member who had earned the enmity of the Trinamool Congress party by campaigning in the 
area.82  
</p>
<p>28. In the fourth phase, on 10 May, at least two people were reported killed in election-
related violence. In West Bengal, a Communist Party member was killed in a bomb attack 
after voting, while in Rajasthan, one person was killed by security personnel when a 
reported mob attacked a polling booth.83 After voting day, approximately 12 people were

motorbikes, others appear to have been shot in their homes.89 The motives for the killings 
are not entirely clear, but appear to be linked to the &#8220;Razak Group&#8221;, a network of separatists 
against the 2005 peace agreement between Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement.90  
</p>
<p>31. Elsewhere, in Nabire in Papua, three days before the election, Indonesian police shot 
and wounded 11 people at a pro-independence rally.91 This was followed by a series of 
killings on election day throughout the province of Papua, where separatists &#8212; believed to 
be responsible for the killings &#8212; had been calling for a boycott of the elections.92 In 
Wamena, separatists were reported to be responsible for stabbing to death five motorcycle 
taxi drivers, in an apparent attempt to create a climate of fear and instability surrounding 
the election.93 In another incident, a crowd of 50&#8211;100 individuals attacked a police post

were carried out at Esfahan and possibly Tabriz that same day.97  
</p>
<p>34. Violence escalated after the decree of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on 19 June that 
further protests would be met with force. The next day, fewer protestors, but whose 
numbers were still in the thousands, continued to march in the streets and they were met 
with gunfire from security forces. On 20 June, Neda Agha Soltan was killed; her death was 
captured on camera and infamously captivated audiences around the world.  
</p>
<p>35. By September 2009, Iranian officials had estimated that around 30 people were 
killed in the immediate post-election period, but opposition supporters alleged that the 
number was closer to 70 and attributed the deaths mostly to police, revolutionary guard and 
Basij militia.98 The actual number has been impossible to determine, as the Government has 
restricted investigations by journalists and NGOs.99 In addition to killings during street 
protests, a number of cases were reported in which individuals were allegedly detained, 
tortured, and killed.100 
</p>
<p>36. Election protests again flared in November and December 2009. Security forces 
opened fire on protestors and drove trucks into crowds on 27 December, the Shia religious 
festival of Ashura, killing another 15 protestors, including Mousavi&#8217;s nephew.101  
</p>
<p>37. In addition to the killings of protestors by security forces, the Government appears 
to have used the death penalty to counter election-related political activism. At the time of 
writing, reports indicated that Iran had handed down at least 10 death sentences against 
post-election protestors, charging them with &#8220;moharabeh&#8221;, (&#8220;waging war against&#8221; or 
&#8220;defiance of&#8221; God).102 Those sentenced to death include one student who threw stones at 
security forces during the Ashura protests.103 The number of detained individuals awaiting 
trial in connection with the election protests remains in the thousands.104 There was a 
significant surge in the number of death sentences carried out by the Government 
immediately before and after the election. Iran carried out more executions in May (50), the 
month prior to the elections, and July (94), the month after the elections, than in any other 
months in 2009.105 In 2009, at least 388 people were executed, &#8220;the largest number recorded 
by Amnesty International in recent years&#8221;.106 Many experts have suggested that the

<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>38. Iraq saw an increase in suicide bombings and other attacks before its most recent 
parliamentary elections in March 2010. Reports indicate that at least 40 individuals were 
killed on election day itself.107 On 12 February 2010, an audio recording attributed to Omar 
al-Baghdadi (purported leader of Al-Qaida in Iraq) was released, stating that the elections 
were &#8220;illicit&#8221; and an attempt by the Shiite majority to repress the Sunni minority.108 The 
audio recording warned that the group would attempt to &#8220;prevent these elections&#8221; using 
&#8220;primarily military means&#8221;.109 The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella militant group that 
includes Al-Qaida in Iraq, also distributed fliers in Sunni dominated areas threatening to 
kill anyone who voted.110 
</p>
<p>39. While the perpetrators of some attacks are relatively clear, officials have expressed 
uncertainty about the perpetrators of many other election killings and attacks, indicating 
that attacks could be by insurgents or motivated by tribal, religious, or political interests.111 
Examples of killings during the recent election cycle include a 18 February suicide 
bombing in Ramadi, the capital of the predominantly Sunni province of Anbar, where an 
unidentified bomber targeted an Iraqi government compound and killed 13 people and 
wounded dozens more.112 On 3 March at least 33 people were killed in a triple suicide 
bombing attack in Baqouba, the provincial capital of Diyala.113 In Baqouba, the first suicide 
bomber targeted an Iraqi government building, while the second bomber detonated in a 
nearby crowded intersection, and the third bomber attacked the hospital where those injured 
from the first two blasts were being taken.114 
</p>
<p>40. Some preliminary evidence suggests that Baghdad, the site of the majority of 
election day blasts, had a markedly lower voter turnout (53 per cent) than the nation&#8217;s 
average (62 per cent).115 
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur visited Kenya in February 2009 and investigated the 
widespread violence that followed the general elections held in December 2007.116 Violence 
erupted amidst allegations of electoral fraud, and anger at the announced election results. 
The Waki Commission, a national commission of inquiry chaired by Justice Waki, 
produced a comprehensive report detailing the circumstances and causes of 1,113 killings

<p>that occurred in that period. The report identifies both spontaneous and organized violence 
resulting in high numbers of election-related killings. 
</p>
<p>42. One of the first sites of post-election violence was the town of Eldoret in the Rift 
Valley where attackers formed groups of 15 plus individuals and targeted Kikuyu 
populations, intending to push them out of the province. In one incident, a mob burned a 
church where families were taking shelter from the violence, killing 35 people. In some 
areas, up to 2,000 armed individuals carried out large-scale attacks against perceived ethnic 
or political enemies. 
</p>
<p>43. In terms of State responsibility, the Waki Commission found that officials failed to 
act on intelligence regarding potential violence; failed to respond adequately to violence; 
and that police lacked discipline and impartiality, and used unjustified force in responding 
to post-election demonstrations and violence. 
</p>
<p>44. Police were responsible for 405 deaths (35.7 per cent of the total). In some cases, the 
police indiscriminately used live ammunition, and over half of the gunshot victims had 
wounds from the back. Additionally, the Waki Commission identified specific senior 
officials and individuals from political parties who should be prosecuted for their role in 
planning or instigating the post-election violence. However, many perpetrators continue to 
enjoy immunity for the election-related killings including police force members and 
officials. In light of the Kenyan Government&#8217;s failure to establish a local tribunal to try 
those most responsible, their names were handed over to the ICC, which has initiated an 
investigation into some 20 suspects.117 According to the ICC prosecutor, these individuals, 
&#8220;utilised their personal, government, business and tribal networks to commit the crimes. 
They implemented their policy with the involvement of a number of State officers and 
public and private institutions such as Members of Parliament, senior government officers, 
the police force and youth gangs&#8221;.

<p><b>  Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>45. Following 5 April 2009 elections in Moldova, tens of thousands of protestors 
gathered in the country&#8217;s capital to demonstrate against allegedly rigged election results 
which had resulted in the victory of the ruling Communist party.118 A report by the Election 
Observation Delegation of the European Parliament found: 
</p>
<p>46. During the anti-Communist demonstrations, a young girl died on the morning of 7 
April and two other casualties of another two youngsters resulted (at least one of them 
appeared to have died as a result of the police brutality against the young demonstrators on 
the night of 7&#8211;8 April). More than 200 young people who had demonstrated against the 
Communist leadership were reportedly taken into police custody. The Moldovan 
Communist leadership has imposed terror, torture, murder, kidnappings, intimidation and 
threats against the Moldovan population, trying to prevent future protests against the 
Communist leadership.119

<p>47. Four months after the April elections, the communists lost early repeat elections

recently found evidence suggesting that &#8220;agents&#8221; acting for the Communist authorities at 
the time &#8220;could have infiltrated the peaceful protesters last spring to provoke the 
violence&#8221;.121 According to the latest reports, one police officer has been arrested for 
allegedly killing a protestor in the April 2009 demonstrations, while the former head of the 
Interior ministry and other former officials are under investigation for abuse of power.122

<p><b>  Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p>48. Mongolia declared its first ever state of emergency since transitioning to a 
democracy in 1990, following post-election rioting after its 29 June 2009 legislative 
election.123 In a protest of alleged election fraud on 1 July 2009, thousands of protestors set 
fire to the ruling Mongolian People&#8217;s Revolutionary Party (MRPR) headquarters in 
Ulaannbaatar and then clashed with police, who shot nine individuals, four fatally.124 
</p>
<p><b>  Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Report of the United Nations Secretary-General following 10 April 2008 
parliamentary elections in Nepal identified several election-related killings occurring in the 
pre-election phase, as well as on election day. A detailed report by the Democracy and 
Elections Alliance Nepal, a Nepali elections-monitoring organization, recorded 50 
deaths.125 
</p>
<p>50. Though many different parties were responsible for violent acts, Communist Party 
of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) supporters were reported to be most widely involved in election-
related violence. The CPN-M also suffered large numbers of fatalities in the weeks 
preceding the election. In the month before the election, 12 CPN-M supporters were killed, 
9 of them as a result of police fire.126 In Dang district on 8 April, police officers &#8220;providing 
security for a Nepali Congress candidate shot dead seven apparently unarmed [CPN-M 
supporters] and injured 12 others&#8221;.127 Other serious incidents included the killing of two 
candidates, as well as the bombing of a mosque in Biratnagar by the armed Hindu 
nationalist group, the Nepal Defence Group, causing two deaths.128 On polling day there 
were four reported deaths, including the death of an independent candidate and the death of 
an activist resulting from fighting that broke out between rival parties in the southern 
district of Sunsari.129

<p><b>  Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur visited Nigeria in June&#8211;July 2005, and in his January 2006 
report, noted that the de facto impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of political assassinations 
risked undermining Nigerian democracy, and warned that there would likely be more 
killings during the 2007 election year.133  
</p>
<p>53. The 2007 State and federal elections were accompanied by widespread violence, 
with levels of violence rising as election days approached.134 According to reliable 
estimates, there were approximately 200 election-related killings.135 One report found 40&#8211;
50 deaths on the day of State elections itself.136 In summarizing the general types of 
violence, the National Democratic Institute reported that there were: &#8220;assassinations of 
candidates for party nominations and for the general elections; armed attacks against 
campaign meetings and rallies; &#8230; attacks against polling stations, polling officials and rival 
party agents&#8221;.137 Some reports noted that the general tone was set by senior officials, 
including the President, who referred to the elections as a &#8220;do or die affair&#8221;, fuelling 
&#8220;tension at the grass-roots level&#8221;.138 
</p>
<p>54. Many killings targeted political candidates and their supporters, as well as 
Independent National Electoral Campaign (INEC) officials, and were carried out by 
politicians&#8217; armed groups. These groups &#8212; composed mostly of unemployed and poor 
youth &#8212; were used by candidates from many parties, but especially the larger parties with 
more significant funds.139 The days shortly before the State election were especially violent 
for political candidates &#8211; on 12 and 13 April, four People&#8217;s Democratic Party members 
were shot to death.140 Across the country, police were accused of failing to adequately 
protect voters and party supporters from violence.141 A number of reports noted that the 
State elections had increased security over the earlier federal elections, and was violence

</p>
<p>55. Killings also occurred during election-related riots. In Daura, supporters of one party 
rioted when they &#8220;discovered that electoral officials had delivered only half of the ballot 
papers that should have arrived&#8221;.144 Two people were killed. 
</p>
<p>56. Impunity for killings was widespread, and reports indicate political bias by the 
police in investigations.145  
</p>
<p>57. In November 2008, claims that a local election was rigged in Jos triggered riots and 
violent clashes between (mostly Christian) supporters of the People&#8217;s Democratic Party and 
(mostly Muslim) supporters of the All Nigeria People&#8217;s Party. The violence resulted in the 
deaths of at least 700 people. Victims were generally attacked by armed mobs (from both 
sides), who &#8220;beat, burned, or bludgeoned&#8221; them to death.146 In the initial stages of the 
violence, the security forces were accused of failing to appropriately respond. When they 
did, they helped to quell the violence, but the State security forces were also responsible for 
over 130 unlawful killings.147 Most of these security force killings occurred after the State 
Governor issued a &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; order. Many civilian victims were shot at close range, or 
arrested and executed. There has been no accountability for these killings. A State 
Government commission of inquiry into the events did &#8220;not investigate alleged abuses by 
security forces&#8221; and &#8220;has not been made public&#8221;.148 Large-scale ethnic-religious violence in 
Jos has occurred previously (2001, at least 1,000 dead), and erupted again recently (2010, at 
least 200 dead). 
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>58. Pakistan&#8217;s tenuous security situation became even more violent in the period leading 
up to national and provincial assembly elections that took place in February 2008. The 
political backdrop to the elections was intense domestic pressure for President General 
Pervez Musharraf to end eight years of military rule, and the rivalry among Musharraf and 
his two main opponents, Benazir Bhutto, leader of the Pakistani People&#8217;s Party (PPP), and 
Nawaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N party, both of whom returned from exile to contest the 
parliamentary elections.149 
</p>
<p>59. The entire pre-election period was marked by violence and bombings caused by a 
number of factors and actors: a larger conflict between Government forces and extremists 
fought primarily in the north, but with spillover effects in other parts of the country; attacks 
by extremists on political parties; Government violence to suppress political campaigners

themselves.150 
</p>
<p>60. Islamic militants had threatened all political parties in an attempt to disrupt the 
elections.151 Bomb attacks by militants, sometimes by suicide bombers, targeted at 
politicians and campaign events, appear responsible for most election-related deaths.152 For 
example, on 18 October 2007, the night Bhutto returned to Pakistan, her convoy was 
attacked by suicide bombers. The attackers missed Bhutto, but over 140 people were killed, 
including members of her political party and her guards, and hundreds more were injured. 
The Government blamed the bombing on extremists, while Bhutto blamed unnamed former 
Government officials and said she had been warned also that the Taliban, Al-Qaida and 
unnamed groups were planning attacks on her.153 
</p>
<p>61. On 21 December, at least 50 people were killed in a suicide attack apparently 
targeted at a former Interior Minister and candidate in the parliamentary elections, while he 
was worshipping at a mosque near Peshawar.154 A week later, on 27 December, a suicide 
bomber killed Bhutto and at least 24 others as she was leaving a political rally.155 The 
election was postponed for six weeks and in the wake of Bhutto&#8217;s assassination, there were 
protests and riots countrywide, resulting in at least 58 deaths.156 A United Nations 
Commission of Inquiry completed an investigation into Bhutto&#8217;s death, and found that her 
assassination &#8220;could have been prevented if adequate security measures had been taken&#8221; 
and that the Pakistani investigation into her death &#8220;lacked direction, was ineffective and 
suffered from a lack of commitment to identify and bring all of the perpetrators to 
justice&#8221;.157 It found that the failure to effectively investigate by domestic authorities was 
&#8220;deliberate&#8221;.158 
</p>
<p>62. Media and non-governmental organizations reported that, in addition to Bhutto, 
three other candidates and &#8220;at least 130 others were killed in the pre-election period in 
politically-motivated attacks&#8221;.159 On 9 February 2008, a suicide bomber killed 27 people at 
a political rally in Charsadda for the opposition Awami National Party (ANP),160 which was 
seen as a rival by religious extremists. On 11 February, another suicide bomber killed six 
supporters of an ANP candidate during a roadside campaign meeting.161 On 16 February, a 
suicide bomber rammed a car filled with explosives into the election office of a PPP-backed

<p>candidate in Parachinar, killing 47 and wounding approximately 150 people.162 On election 
day itself, there was less violence that many had anticipated, but there were numerous 
attacks on polling sites, and the Government confirmed at least 24 people were killed and 
200 injured in election-related violence.163 
</p><p>63. European Union election monitoring noted that election violence had restricted voter 
turnout and affected polling in some areas.164 
</p>
<p><b>  The Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>64. Most elections in the Philippines have had high numbers of election-related 
killings.165 The massacre on 23 November 2009 of 57 people, including the relatives of a 
gubernatorial candidate and 30 journalists, carried out by an incumbent ruling family and 
their private militia, constitutes the starkest recent incident in the country. In the aftermath 
of the massacre, the Special Rapporteur noted that elections in the Philippines have 
traditionally become occasions for widespread extrajudicial executions of political 
opponents.166 The convoy of relatives and journalists was on its way to file papers for 
Esmail &#8220;Toto&#8221; Mangudadatu&#8217;s candidacy for the governorship of Maguindanao.167 
Mangudadatu&#8217;s attempted candidacy was seen as a direct threat to the expected 
gubernatorial succession from Andal Ampatuan, Sr. to Andal Ampatuan, Jr. The 
Ampatuans had amassed significant influence in the region as well as a private armed 
militia of over 2,000 armed guards. On 23 November, 100 of these guards blocked the 
convoy&#8217;s passage and massacred all those in the convoy, including innocent bystanders 
travelling on the same road. A number of members of the Ampatuan family, as well as the 
armed guards were subsequently arrested, and their trials were ongoing at the time of this 
report. Two family members of a witness to the massacre were shot dead a few weeks after 
the witness testified about the massacre in court. He had reportedly refused an offer of 25 
million pesos (over US$ 500,000) to recant his witness statement.168 In February, reports 
warned that candidates continued to employ personal security forces, despite Government 
pledges to eradicate such forces by election day.169 
</p>
<p>65. The November massacre came just a month after a grenade blast at Marawi City 
Hall in Western Mindanao killed 3 people and injured 26 who were registering to vote for 
the 2010 elections.170 No individual or group claimed responsibility for the attack, but 
officials stated that it was likely connected to other recent bombings by rebel groups 
(including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf).

<p>66. In December 2009, attacks on election candidates in Northern Luzon and Eastern 
Mindanao left 4 dead.171 On 31 January 2010, two local Mindanao officials were killed.172 
On 15 April 2010, another grenade attack killed two people in Maguindanao.173 According 
to reports, the attack occurred during a meeting of political candidates, and the targets were 
the candidates for mayor and deputy mayor. Police reports indicated that from January&#8211;
April 2010, at least 33 people had been killed in election-related violence.174

councillor.175 Following the killing, both the governing Socialist Party and the opposition 
Popular Party (PP) suspended final campaign rallies. The ETA had put up posters calling 
for the elections to be boycotted, and engaged in intimidation in the pre-election period in 
the Basque region, which restricted the political activities of parties.176 Over the last four 
decades, the ETA has killed an estimated 800 people, 20 of whom were killed during pre-
election periods.177 Most commentators explain the pre-election killings as attempts to 
disrupt elections, and to opportunistically raise ETA&#8217;s profile.

<p>68. The lead-up to Sri Lanka&#8217;s 26 January 2010 presidential elections saw hundreds of

related killings and five attempted killings.178 A number of these killings were of supporters 
of one party, by identified supporters of another. In others, the attackers were unknown. In 
one incident, on 12 January, gunmen on motorbikes opened fire on a bus of opposition 
candidate supporters on their way to a rally, killing a 60-year-old woman and injuring four 
others.179 On 16 January, a Rajapaksa supporter was shot dead in a clash with Fonseka 
supporters.180 On 18 January, a Fonseka supporter was beaten to death while hanging 
Fonseka posters, and a grenade attack on an office of Rajapaksa&#8217;s party resulted in one 
death. An additional two killings were reported in the week after the election.181

<p>69. From early March 2010, crowds of protestors gathered in downtown Bangkok to 
demand that the current Government step down early and for elections to be held. The anti-
Government protests are organized by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship 
(UDD) (the &#8220;red shirts&#8221;), and are composed of supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin 
Shinawatra, as well as the rural and urban poor.182 
</p>
<p>70. On 10 April, an attempt by State security forces to disperse red shirt protestors in 
Bangkok led to a clash which has been characterized as &#8220;the bloodiest political violence in 
two decades [in Thailand]&#8221;.183 Subsequent reports indicated that &#8220;15 civilians and 5 soldiers 
were killed by gunshots, explosions from grenades and improvized explosive devices, and 
beatings during the clash&#8221;.184 Also, &#8220;at least 569 civilians, 265 soldiers, and 8 police 
officers were injured from tear-gas inhalation, assaults, and gunshot and shrapnel 
wounds&#8221;.185 At the time of this report, the exact circumstances of the deaths were unclear, 
and responsibility not yet determined, although it appears that both protestors and security 
forces were responsible for deaths. 
</p>
<p>71. Subsequently, on 22 April, a series of blasts, reported to have been caused by 
grenade launchers similar to those used against soldiers on 10 April, killed 3 people and 
wounded at least 87 others.186

son, Faure Gnassingb&#233;, emerged as the winner, amongst widespread irregularities at the 
polls, intimidation before election day, and extreme violence on election day and in the 
days following.188 One NGO counted at least 150 dead; the United Nations estimated that at 
least 400&#8211;500 individuals were killed.189 As vote counting began, State security forces, 
backed by militias close to the ruling party, attacked polling stations to steal ballot boxes. 
For instance, at the B&#232; Plage district polling centre in Lom&#233;, members of the presidential 
guard&#8217;s commando unit fired tear gas and live rounds into the room where votes were being 
counted, and made off with the ballots.190 One survivor of the B&#232; Plage incident described 
having to step over 30 bodies in order to escape.191 Security forces also targeted and killed 
opposition supporters and their leaders.192 When the results were announced on 26 April
