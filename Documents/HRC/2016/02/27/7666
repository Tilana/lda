<p><i>Summary 
</i>From mid-1998 to the end of 2001, Argentina experienced a severe recession. A 
</p>
<p>combination of questionable lending and policy advice by the International Monetary Fund, 
a global recession and reckless lending by international credit markets pushed the country 
to a situation of unsustainable debt that culminated in financial crisis, default and drastic 
social consequences for the country&#8217;s population. Restructurings of the debt in 2005 and 
2010 significantly reduced the country&#8217;s debt burden and afforded the Government some 
fiscal space for social investment and the establishment of conditions for the realization of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>Since 2002, Argentina has recorded impressive economic growth (averaging 7 per 
cent from 2003 to 2011), while social indicators have also improved considerably. Social 
spending has increased, rising from 10.3 per cent to around 14.2 per cent of gross domestic 
product. In 2009, the Government expanded its social programmes, including by 
introducing a conditional cash transfer programme for low-income households with the 
goal of reducing poverty and improving the welfare of children. The number of people

<p>living in poverty fell by more than two thirds from a peak of almost half the population in 
2001 to about one seventh of the population in early 2010, while the number of those living 
in extreme poverty also fell from one quarter of the population in 2001 to approximately 
one fifteenth in 2010. Unemployment has fallen to around 8 per cent. 
</p>
<p>These commendable achievements have been recorded in the face of adverse 
external circumstances, including difficulties in accessing international capital markets, 
little foreign direct investment and prolonged litigation by vulture funds against the 
country. 
</p>
<p>Although inflation has risen since 2007, peaking most recently at 27 per cent in 
early 2011, what is significant from the human rights viewpoint and for the well-being of 
the population are real income growth, employment and equitable income distribution. 
</p>
<p>Much of Argentina&#8217;s current debt was incurred in questionable circumstances, 
particularly during military rule from 1976 to 1983, and can therefore be considered odious. 
During that period, banks, international financial institutions and other countries continued 
to lend to Argentina, indirectly supporting an illegitimate government engaged in the 
repression and disappearance of its opponents. It is important that those who lent to the 
military dictatorship accept their share of responsibility and immediately take steps to 
cancel this questionable debt. 
</p>
<p>For its part, Argentina should conduct a transparent, participatory and 
comprehensive debt audit as recommended in the Guiding principles on foreign debt and 
human rights. Such an audit would help promote accountability in public debt management 
and can usefully inform future borrowing decisions by the State as well as its debt strategy, 
expenditure on development plans and the realization of human rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights conducted a mission to Argentina from 18 to 29 
November 2013. The main purpose of the visit was to assess the impact of the country&#8217;s 
external debt burden and the restructuring of the debt on the capacity of the Government to 
realize all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights and the right to 
development.   
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Independent Expert met with senior government officials at the 
ministries of Foreign Affairs; Economy and Public Finance; Justice and Human Rights; 
Social Welfare; Education; Health; and Labour, Employment and Social Security. He also 
met with the Vice-President of the Supreme Court, the National Ombudsman, as well as 
representatives of the Second Federal Court, the Central Bank, the World Bank, the Inter-
American Development Bank, United Nations agencies, civil society and academia. In 
addition, he visited the cities of Cordoba and Florencio Varela and the Museum on External 
Debt at the School of Economics, University of Buenos Aires.  
</p>
<p>3. Regrettably, he did not have occasion to meet the committees of the Argentine 
Congress with responsibility for social and economic affairs as he had requested. 
Parliament has an important legislative and oversight role in relation to budgetary issues 
and public debt management. As such, its insights would have been critical for a full 
assessment of the situation. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert would like to thank the Government for its invitation and its 
cooperation during his visit. He also wishes to express his gratitude to all those who shared 
their perspectives with him and to the United Nations Development Programme for 
assisting with the preparations for his visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context: recession, default and recovery  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Causes of the debt crisis  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Argentine debt crisis of 2001 is attributable to a number of factors, including 
questionable lending and policy advice by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a global 
recession and reckless lending by the international credit markets.1 Structural reforms such 
as deregulation, trade liberalization and privatization of State-owned enterprises made 
Argentina extremely vulnerable to external shocks, prompting an overvalued exchange rate, 
producing jobless growth and raising external and fiscal deficits that ultimately led to 
unsustainable debt levels.  
</p>
<p>6. During the period of the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 (the so-called 
National Reorganization Process), the country borrowed extensively for unproductive

<p>infrastructure, the conflict over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and to finance State take-
over of private-sector debt.2 Neoliberal economic policies introduced during this period led 
to significant economic and social problems, including massive capital flight and 
unemployment estimated at 18 per cent at the end of military rule in 1983. Between 1975 
and 1980, the debt increased from 13.2 per cent to 32.4 per cent of gross domestic product 
(GDP). A devaluation of the peso in 1981 caused the foreign debt to reach a peak of almost 
60 per cent of GDP in 1982. 
</p>
<p>7. In April 1991, the Menem Government introduced the &#8220;convertibility plan&#8221; with the 
aim of addressing the chronic inflation which plagued the country. The plan legally 
guaranteed the convertibility of pesos to United States dollars at a one-to-one fixed rate. 
Although this macroeconomic framework initially helped reduce inflation and debt service, 
it set the context for the financial crisis of 2001.3 From 1989 to 1999, the debt increased by 
123 per cent while interest payments on the debt rose by 253 per cent.  
</p>
<p>8. During the late 1990s, vulnerability to external shocks increased. Fiscal balances 
deteriorated with a strengthening dollar, to which the peso was linked, devaluations by its 
major regional trading partners (notably Brazil) and falling commodity prices. In particular, 
the 1998 Russian default and the 1999 devaluation of the Brazilian real put intense pressure 
on Argentina&#8217;s exchange rate.4 Inevitably, the country entered a recession, which lasted 
until 2000.  
</p>
<p>9. In response, the Argentine authorities implemented a succession of pro-cyclical 
fiscal adjustment policies supported by IMF that exacerbated the negative socioeconomic 
impact on the country. A toxic combination of cuts in public spending, public sector wages 
and jobs deepened the recession. While the hope was that foreign capital inflows would 
stimulate economic growth and general welfare, the results were disastrous. The country&#8217;s 
debt rose while poverty and inequality increased. High interest rates and negative growth 
raised the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 10 points between 1997 and 2000. 
</p>
<p>10. By mid-2001, Argentina&#8217;s country risk premium was the highest in the world, 
rendering the country unable to borrow on the international markets. Capital flight was also 
a critical problem for the Government. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Central Bank of 
Argentina lost $11 billion in liquid reserves (approximately 40 per cent of its reserves). The 
country&#8217;s banking system lost 25 per cent of its total deposits. 
</p>
<p>11. It should be noted that the international financial markets and IMF were complicit in 
deepening the severity of Argentina&#8217;s crisis. Despite the fact that Argentina faced an 
impending crisis, IMF, foreign Governments and investment banks determined to chase 
high-yielding debt continued to lend generously to Argentina. In addition, investment banks 
and credit agencies overstated the country&#8217;s economic health.5 Questionable policy 
prescriptions by IMF compounded the problem.6

<p>

 In 1981-1982, the public sector absorbed a considerable proportion of the private sector foreign debt,

<p>with the approval of the international banks, see Damill, Frenkel and Rapetti,, &#8220;The Argentinean 
debt&#8221;.

 From 1991 to 2001, IMF provided finance under five successive arrangements: two under the 
</p>
<p>Extended Fund Facility approved in 1992 and 1998, and three Stand-By Arrangements approved in 
1991, 1996 and 2000. In addition, it provided technical assistance in the fiscal and banking areas. In

<p>12. In the view of the Independent Expert, these actors should accept their share of 
responsibility for Argentina&#8217;s debt problem in line with the principle of shared 
responsibility underscored in the Monterrey Consensus.7 
</p>
<p>13. The financial crisis had a profound impact on Argentina. GDP shrank in the period 
from 1999 to 2002 by 25 per cent, official unemployment peaked at over 21.5 per cent in 
May 2002, savings and pensions were devaluated, and inflation of up to 41 per cent 
contributed to a drop in real wages by 23.2 per cent in 2002.8 Fifty-three per cent of the 
population lived in poverty and 24.8 per cent faced extreme poverty.9 The crisis also 
severely affected the public health system, with hospitals suffering a serious shortage of 
basic supplies and prices of medicines soaring.10 In addition, the drastic drop in 
employment left roughly 60 per cent of the population outside the social health insurance 
system.  
</p>
<p>14. The crisis also resulted in the deterioration of health indicators such as infant 
mortality, affecting in particular the relatively more disadvantaged provinces in the north of 
the country, where the infant mortality rate was 25 per 1,000 live births.11 Facing increased 
pressure to provide social services to a large number of poor people, the Government was 
forced to decrease its per capita spending on social services by 74 per cent. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Default  
</b></p>
<p>15. In December 2001, after four years of severe recession and mounting social unrest 
and unable to fulfil its debt obligations, the Government was forced to default. Shortly 
thereafter, the Government abandoned the convertibility plan and devalued the peso. Total 
public debt increased sharply from 45.7 per cent of GDP in 2000 to an unsustainable 166.3 
per cent in early 2002.12 The debt burden rose sharply partly due to the devaluation, which 
significantly increased, in terms of pesos, foreign currency-denominated obligations (most 
of which were in United States dollars and euros). 
</p><p>16. It has been suggested that Argentina had an alternative to default.13 However, in the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s considered view, default was inevitable: Argentina was faced with an 
unsustainable situation and was simply in no position to repay its massive debt without

<p>risking economic and social implosion. It is important to note that the Government made 
several efforts to prevent the default, including, among other measures, passing a Fiscal 
Responsibility Law  in 1999 that set a mandatory declining target for the public deficit to 
bring it to zero in a few years, and implementing significant tax increases and expenditure 
cuts (including a 13 per cent cut in public sector wages and pension benefits). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Debt restructuring 
</b></p>
<p>17. In 2005, after prolonged, contentious and unsuccessful attempts to restructure its 
debt, Argentina made a unilateral offer, involving a write-off of 75 per cent of the 
outstanding debt, but at present value rather than on a nominal basis. The Argentine 
legislature codified this commitment with the so-called Lock Law (Ley Cerrojo), which 
prohibited the Government from reopening the exchange or making any kind of future offer 
on better terms, and suspended any future payments on the untendered debt.14  
</p>
<p>18. In the end, 76 per cent of all bondholders accepted this offer; the remaining 24 per 
cent refused to participate. Thus, of the $81.8 billion face value of debt, $62.3 billion was 
exchanged for $35.2 billion of new bonds. This left a debt of $18.6 billion in dispute 
together with accrued interest, $6.3 billion of Paris Club arrears and $9.5 billion of IMF 
debt. 
</p>
<p>19. In 2006, the Government decided to repay in full the $9.5 billion owed to IMF ahead 
of schedule, thus freeing it from IMF policy constraints. In 2009, the Argentine legislature 
suspended the portion of the Lock Law that prohibited reopening a debt restructuring offer, 
and in 2010, the Government exchanged approximately $12.4 billion of the $18.6 billion in 
bonds.  
</p>
<p>20. Together, the debt restructurings of 2005 and 2010 had a participation rate of 91.3 
per cent. It is estimated that $11.2 billion (including $6.8 billion in principal past and 
coming due, and $4.4 billion in past due interest) was owed to the &#8220;holdouts&#8221; as at the end 
of 2010. Of this amount, $1.3 billion is the subject of litigation by vulture funds in courts in 
the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>21. As a result of the debt restructurings and settlement of IMF obligations, the debt as a 
percentage of GDP declined from 166.3 per cent in 2002 to around 45 per cent in 2012, 
with public external debt representing only 14 per cent of GDP. This has enabled the 
Government to significantly increase its social spending, including on education, health and 
social security. Social spending for health, education, social security and housing in the 
national budget increased from 9.5 per cent of GDP in 2003 to 15.5 per cent of GDP in 
</p><p>2013. Overall social spending (by the national, provincial and municipal governments) rose 
to around 27.7 per cent of GDP by 2009.15 
</p>
<p>22. In January 2014, the Government began informal negotiations with the Paris Club 
with the aim of reaching an agreement on the settlement of Argentina&#8217;s arrears to Paris 
Club creditors. In this context, the Independent Expert calls upon the Government of 
Argentina and the Paris Club to ensure that any debt restructuring agreement reflects the 
primacy of human rights as underscored in the Guiding principles on foreign debt and 
human rights (A/HRC/20/23, annex) and, in particular, that it is consistent with Argentina&#8217;s 
obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels of economic and social

<p>rights and does not compromise Argentina&#8217;s ability to address ongoing concerns related to 
the realization of these rights as mentioned below. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Economic recovery 
</b></p>
<p>23. The default and devaluation contributed to a profound financial crisis and a sharp 
economic contraction, with GDP shrinking by around 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. 
However, recovery followed only one quarter after the default and devaluation as a result of 
policies designed to restore the &#8220;basic macroeconomic equilibrium&#8221;, including imposition 
of exchange controls, introduction of taxes on exports and a flexible monetary policy.16  
</p>
<p>24. Pro-growth policies implemented by the Government since 2003 have helped spur 
economic growth and restore debt repayment capacity. Policies focusing on job creation, as 
well as the introduction of a non-contributory social security scheme and a cash transfer of 
150 pesos a month for unemployed household heads (Programa Jefes y Jefas de Hogar), 
reaching two million beneficiaries in May 2003, helped to reduce unemployment and 
poverty rates to below pre-crisis levels by 2006. 
</p>
<p>25. From 2002 to 2011, the Argentine economy grew 94 per cent &#8212; among the highest 
growth rates worldwide.17 This remarkable recovery has been achieved in the face of 
reduced access to international financial markets and relatively little foreign direct 
investment.18  
</p>
<p><b> E. Debt situation 
</b></p>
<p>26. According to the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, as of 30 June 2013, total 
public debt stood at $196 billion, of which around $66 billion is public external debt. Total 
external debt (private and public) was approximately $135 billion. Approximately  
$25 billion of the public debt is owed to multilateral financial institutions, such as the 
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and Paris Club creditors.19 
However, these figures do not include bonds held by creditors who did not participate in the 
2005 and 2010 restructurings, which are estimated at $11.5 billion.  
</p><p>27. It is notable that debt service still comes at a high cost to the country. The exclusion 
of the country from the international financial markets has forced the Government to draw 
on the country&#8217;s foreign reserves to service debt. As a result, reserves have fallen sharply 
from about $50 billion to less than $30 billion, as of November 2013. If this trend 
continues, the Government may face difficulties in fulfilling its debt obligations.  
</p>
<p>28. The 2014 national budget foresees that 9 per cent of the budget (up from 6.4 per cent 
in 2013) will be devoted to debt service alone, exceeding funds allocated for education (7.1

<p>per cent) and health care (3.4 per cent).20 As education and health care are largely within 
the competence of the provinces, the national budget does not give a complete picture of 
actual government spending on health care and education. The consolidated public budget 
(including national, provincial and municipal budgets) indicated that, in 2009, around 14 
per cent of all public spending was devoted to health care, 22 per cent to social security and 
15 per cent to education.21   
</p>
<p><b> F. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>29. As a result of the default, and the refusal of a minority of creditors to participate in 
the debt restructurings, and subsequent legal action by these creditors and &#8220;vulture funds&#8221;,22 
Argentina continues to face difficulties in accessing the international financial markets. 
Moreover, since it has not been able to settle its debt with the Paris Club countries, 
Argentina has been denied some export credits, while foreign direct investment has 
remained modest, at an average of around 1.7 per cent of GDP between 2003 and 2011. 
Thus, the Government continues to rely on domestic sources of finance, including intra-
government transfers. 
</p>
<p>30. Argentina has been facing litigation in United States courts by a group of vulture 
funds.  For example, on 21 November 2012, a court in the United States ruled that, with 
respect to a payment due to exchange bondholders on 15 December 2012, the bondholders 
and the vulture funds would have to be treated equally on the basis of its interpretation of 
the <i>pari pasu</i> (equal treatment) clause of the bond contracts. In effect, Argentina was 
required upon making its regular payment to exchange bondholders to also pay the vulture 
funds their full $1.3 billion claim.23 The decision left Argentina with the unpalatable choice 
of fulfilling a larger and immediate financial obligation or paying neither group. This would 
effectively force it to default on the exchange bonds.  
</p>
<p>31. An alternative payment plan proposed by Argentina that would essentially have 
given the vulture funds a deal similar to that of the exchange bondholders was rejected by 
the vulture funds on 19 April 2013.  
</p>
<p>32. It is not the intention of the Independent Expert to discuss the merits of the lawsuit. 
However, he considers that Argentina&#8217;s proposal would have presented a considerable 
return on the original investments of the vulture funds in 2008 and would have also met the 
equal treatment provisions. It should be noted that the vulture funds were not the original 
lenders to Argentina; they purchased most of the debt that they are claiming at a significant 
discount in the aftermath of the default. For example, NML Capital paid approximately 
$48.7 million for more than $220 million in defaulted bonds but is claiming an amount that 
would represent a profit of 1,380 per cent.  
</p>
<p>33. Moreover, the case raises broader issues beyond the particular case of Argentina. 
Significantly, the decision essentially reinforces the notion among creditors that refusing to

<p>participate in sovereign debt restructurings and suing for recovery of the full face value of 
the debt plus interest is an appropriate avenue to follow. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
opinion, such a decision, if upheld, will undermine the ability of countries facing similar 
difficulties to restructure their debt in an orderly, timely, fair and efficient fashion.24  
</p>
<p>34. Argentina has made important progress in improving the social conditions of its 
people. Vulture funds and irresponsible financing decisions must not be allowed to derail 
that progress. The Independent Expert, therefore, firmly supports the position of the 
Government not to yield to unreasonable demands by some vulture funds that continue to 
litigate against the country in foreign jurisdictions. In this regard, he reiterates his call on all 
countries to enact legislation, as a matter of priority, to limit the ability of unscrupulous 
investors to pursue immoral profits at the expense of the poor and most vulnerable through 
protracted litigation. Such legislation has been enacted in the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Channel Island of Jersey.25 It will not affect legitimate 
participants in the secondary debt market but will help address the predatory behaviour of 
vulture funds. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights obligations  
</b></p>
<p>35. Argentina has ratified all the core international human rights instruments and has 
also recognized the competence of most of the treaty bodies to consider petitions from 
persons claiming to be victims of violations of their rights under those instruments.  
</p>
<p>36. The 1994 constitutional reform explicitly gave constitutional status to several 
international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and further provided for those treaties to be considered as 
complementing the rights guaranteed in the Constitution.26  
</p>
<p>37. In the terms of article 2 of the Covenant, Argentina is required to utilize &#8220;the 
maximum of its available resources&#8221; to ensure the full realization of the rights enshrined 
therein, including the rights to food, health, education, social security and work. The 
implication of this is that the State is obliged to ensure that these rights are adequately 
satisfied before using public resources to achieve other State objectives unrelated to human 
rights, such as debt service.27 At the very least, the State must ensure the satisfaction of 
minimum essential levels of each economic, social and cultural right.28  
</p>
<p>38. It should be noted that the Guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights 
underline that States should ensure that their rights and obligations arising from an external

excessive obligations to repay external debt should not hinder the progressive realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights,30 and recommend that States conduct transparent and 
participatory periodic audits of their debt portfolios to ensure accountability in the 
management of the State&#8217;s external debt stock and to inform future borrowing decisions.31 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutions  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Republic of Argentina is a federal State, comprising 23 provinces and the 
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (which in many ways has a similar legal status to the 
provinces). The provinces, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the municipalities 
enjoy autonomy, subject to the Constitution. 
</p><p>40. At the national level, a number of institutions have responsibility for the promotion, 
protection and fulfilment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>41. Both federal and provincial courts have jurisdiction over human rights matters, 
while the Supreme Court and the lower courts have competence to rule on all matters 
governed by the National Constitution, national legislation or international treaties. It is 
notable that the Supreme Court has played an important role in enforcing social and 
economic rights through its power of review. For example, it has upheld the rights to 
health,32 food33 and housing;34 recognized the constitutional right of retirees to pension 
increases;35 and struck down public sector wage cuts imposed in the aftermath of the 2001 
debt crisis to meet debt payment obligations.36 In the case of Hugo Galli,37 Supreme Court 
judges Ra&#250;l Zaffaroni and Ricardo Lorenzetti held that while contractual debt repayment 
obligations usually have to be fulfilled, such obligations may be limited in situations of 
extreme crisis where the State would otherwise not be able to provide essential services for 
its citizens and uphold the minimum standards of human rights as required by international 
treaties that have constitutional rank.  
</p>
<p>42. The Office of the Secretary for Human Rights in the Ministry of Justice deals with a 
broad range of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>43. Finally, a number of independent public bodies at both the national and provincial 
levels play an important role in protecting and promoting human rights. For instance, the 
mandate of the National Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci&#243;n) is to defend and

Ombudsman has been active on several issues, such as access to social security benefits, 
pensions and family allowances; health and education; services of public utilities, such as 
water and sanitation; environmental pollution affecting, among others, the rights to health, 
adequate housing and water and sanitation;39 and access to public transport of persons with 
disabilities.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Framework for public debt management  
</b></p>
<p>44. Under the National Constitution, the Congress40 is empowered &#8220;to borrow money on 
the credit of the Nation&#8221;41 and to settle the payment of the domestic and foreign debt of the 
country.42 It has been asserted that this requirement is fulfilled by the Congress through the 
approval of budget acts which determine annually the budget of the State, including its 
provision for debt service payments. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s view, however, article 75, 
paragraph 7, of the National Constitution provides for a more active role of Congress in 
public financial management than the mere passing of budgetary acts. 
</p>
<p>45. In the terms of article 85, the National General Auditing Office, a technical advisory 
body of the Congress, must participate in the approval or rejection of the public revenue 
and investment accounts. 
</p>
<p>46. The Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2004 sets out rules of fiscal transparency as well 
as fiscal targets for the national and provincial governments and the federal capital district. 
The procedural rules and transparency requirements include three-year budgets; that new 
borrowing or guarantees must be approved by the Ministry of Economy and Public 
Finance; that provincial governments may not issue non-peso domestic bonds; and the  
publication of fiscal accounts and all debt-related transactions. The Law further enjoins the 
national and provincial governments to put money into stabilization funds and establishes a 
federal council for fiscal responsibility, with membership from the national and all the 
provincial ministries of finance.  
</p>
<p>47. In terms of fiscal targets, the provinces have to budget primary surpluses sufficient 
to bring their debt service gradually below 15 per cent of current revenues (net of transfers 
to municipalities) and may not engage in new borrowing if their debt service exceeds the 
ceiling. The national Government has to maintain a downward trend in debt, measured in 
terms of GDP. 
</p>
<p>48. It is notable that the National Public Credit Office provides technical assistance to 
the provincial debt management offices.

<p><b> IV. Realization of human rights  
</b></p>
<p>49. It is generally accepted that the debt crisis of 2001 had a severe impact on the 
enjoyment of a broad range of human rights, including the rights to work, social security, 
health and education.43 However, the restructuring of the debt has provided the Government 
with larger fiscal space for social investment. In addition, since  2003, the Government has 
implemented a number of policies to promote economic growth with social inclusion. 
These policies have significantly contributed to the establishment of the conditions for the 
realization of human rights and improvement of the well-being of the Argentine population. 
</p>
<p>50. Nevertheless, some challenges remain, particularly with regard to addressing 
poverty and ensuring social inclusion. In the following sections of the present report the 
impact of the Government&#8217;s policies on the realization of the rights to work, social security, 
health, education and adequate housing as well as on poverty is briefly discussed. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Work 
</b></p>
<p>51. In the aftermath of the 2001 crisis, the Government of Argentina implemented a 
series of policies aimed at creating jobs and improving working conditions. In October 
2003, for example, the Government adopted the 2003&#8211;2015 Millennium Development 
Goals for Argentina, which included a goal on promoting decent work. Specific objectives 
under the goal included reducing the unemployment rate to less than 10 per cent; reducing 
the rate of informal employment to less than 30 per cent; extending social protection 
coverage to 60 per cent of the unemployed population; decreasing to less than 30 per cent 
the share of workers earning a salary below the cost of the basic family food basket; and 
eradicating child labour. 
</p>
<p>52. In 2004, the Government reviewed the minimum wage determined by the National 
Council for Employment, Productivity and Minimum Living and Mobility Salary, a body 
consisting of representatives of the State, employers and workers.  
</p>
<p>53. As a result of these policies, the official unemployment rate has fallen and the 
minimum wage has been increased. According to official estimates, during the third quarter 
of 2013, the unemployment rate was 6.8 per cent. The monthly minimum wage for the 
period from August to December 2013 was 3,300 pesos (about $500 at the official 
exchange rate at the end of 2013) and has been increased to 3,600 pesos as of 1 January 
2014.44 According to the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, the average 
real salary of registered workers grew constantly after the crisis low of 2002, reaching 
levels of the mid-1980s by 2009.45 As a consequence, the number of workers employed in 
the formal sector earning a salary below the cost of the basic food basket was reduced by 
66.3 per cent in 2011.46

</p>
<p>54. However, a number of challenges remain, which require attention. First, there are 
high gender-based inequalities in the labour market: women earn lower incomes than men; 
have higher rates of unemployment (8.7 per cent compared with 6 per cent for men); enjoy 
lesser access to formal salaried employment (63 per cent compared with 69 per cent for 
men); and earn a lower income per hour worked.47 
</p><p>55. Second, although informal unregistered employment declined from 42.8 per cent in 
2003 to 33.3 per cent in 2011, it remains one of the most serious challenges in the 
Argentine labour market.48 Informal workers do not have health insurance coverage for 
themselves or members of their families, and do not contribute to pension funds, nor are 
they protected by unemployment insurance.49 While the Independent Expert acknowledges 
the progress made, further efforts on the part of the Government are required to reach the 
goal of moving non-registered employment below 30 per cent by 2015.50  He urges the 
Government to intensify its efforts to promote the registration of employment, as some 
surveys indicate that the percentage of workers not contributing to the social security 
system may have increased slightly during the past few years, notwithstanding government 
campaigns.51 
</p>
<p>56. Finally, more effort is required to address the problem of child labour, particularly in 
the agricultural and informal sectors. While the Prohibition of Child Labour and Protection 
of Adolescent Employment Act (No. 26.390) is an important step in the fight against child 
labour, children continue to bear the highest costs of poverty and, in many cases, provide 
substitute or complementary labour to satisfy household needs. Research indicates that in 
urban areas, 6.2 per cent of children between the ages of 5 and 13 years undertake 
economic activities, and a further 2.7 per cent of children in that age group are engaged in 
intensive domestic work.52   
</p>
<p><b> B. Social security 
</b></p>
<p>57. The additional fiscal space after 2005 has allowed the Government to significantly 
expand its non-contributory social protection schemes. The increase of formal employment 
and a simplified regime for small taxpayers (<i>el monotributo</i>) has ensured that a large 
number of workers now have access to social security. A pension inclusion plan, allowing 
pensioners who, owing to the economic crisis, had not completed 30 years of contributions 
to receive a reduced pension benefit, and the introduction of a non-contributory minimum 
pension in 2005 increased overall pension coverage for elderly people from 47 per cent in 
2005 to about 96 per cent in 2010. The overall number of persons receiving retirement 
benefits increased from 3.2 million in 2005 to 5.4 million in 2012. In addition, a law was

<p>passed ensuring automatic adjustments of pension benefits based on consumer price 
indices.53 
</p>
<p>58. In November 2009, a universal child allowance (<i>Asignaci&#243;n Universal por Hijo</i>) for 
all children under 18 years of age was introduced with the goal of reducing poverty and 
improving the welfare of children. This was a conditional cash transfer programme for low-
income households. In April 2013, 3.28 million children received this benefit.54  
Evaluations by the Ministry of Labour and independent research show that the allowance 
has helped to reduce extreme poverty for families with children; has increased primary 
school enrolment by 10 per cent and secondary school enrolment by 20 per cent; and has 
expanded the participation of children in regular medical checks and vaccinations, as 
applicants for this benefit are required to show proof of schooling and participation in an 
official health programme for their children in order to receive the full amount. 
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert commends the Government for the social policies described 
above. Nevertheless, he is concerned that some of the social benefits exclude certain 
marginalized and disadvantaged groups, such as migrants and their children. For example, 
access to non-contributory old age pensions requires 40 years of continued residence in the 
country; access to a disability pension, 20 years of continued residence; and access to a 
pension for mothers with more than seven children, 15 years of continued residence.  In the 
case of the universal child allowance, Decree No. 1602/2009, establishing the benefit, 
requires that the child beneficiary have Argentine nationality, be a child of an Argentine 
national or have at least three years of legal residence in Argentina, before his or her 
guardian is able to access this benefit.55 Although in September 2007 the Supreme Court 
declared the 20-year residence requirement unconstitutional in a case concerning disability 
benefits, excessive residency requirements to access social benefits remain.  
</p>
<p>60. The Independent Expert therefore urges the Government to implement the 
recommendations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(E/C.12/ARG/CO/3, para. 20), the Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW/ C/ARG/CO/1, 
paras. 29 and 30) and the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(CRPD/C/ARG/CO/1, paras. 45 and 46) and adopt the necessary measures to ensure 
unrestricted coverage of social benefits, including non-contributory pensions and the 
universal child allowance, for marginalized and disadvantaged groups, such as migrants and 
their children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Health 
</b></p>
<p>61. The country&#8217;s public health system provides universal access. At around 10 per cent 
of GDP, health expenditure is higher than that of other Latin American countries, but 
resources are unevenly distributed. Health expenditure of around 8 per cent of GDP serves 
about 64 per cent of the population, who have either private health insurance or are covered 
by social security-based health insurance, while the remaining 36 per cent of the population 
have to rely exclusively on public sector health services, which receive only about 2 per

<p>cent of GDP.56 Depending on province, region and location, there are significant 
discrepancies in the quality and accessibility of health care. For example, between 2003 and 
2009, the City of Buenos Aires spent 24 per cent of its budget on health care. However, 
more disadvantaged regions, like the provinces of Missiones and Buenos Aires, devoted 
only about 7 to 8 per cent of their budget to health care.57 The Government has 
acknowledged that such inequalities still need to be addressed in order to guarantee 
effective compliance with the right to health in the country.58  
</p>
<p>62. In November 2004, the Government introduced the Plan Nacer programme, a 
maternal and infant health programme, which strengthened health services provided to 
uninsured pregnant women and women who had just given birth, as well as children under 
the age of 6. By April 2012, Plan Nacer had provided health coverage to more than 4.5 
million pregnant women and children, and reached 89.7 per cent of the eligible 
population.59 The programme provided additional funds to provincial ministries of health, 
based on delivery of services and 10 tracers to measure results, one of them tracking the 
inclusion of indigenous communities in health services. 
</p>
<p>63. While Plan Nacer has contributed to the improvement of the health of uninsured 
women and children, including a reduction in infant mortality from 16.5 per 1,000 live 
births in 2003 to 11.9 in 2010, Argentina has so far been less successful in reducing 
maternal mortality, which has remained above 4 per 10,000 births in recent years. A high 
percentage of these deaths is related to unsafe abortions.60 Women and girls continue to 
face obstacles in accessing reproductive health-care services, such as contraception, 
resulting in a high rate of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, including unsafe abortions. 
Common barriers include long delays in service provision, unnecessary referrals to other 
clinics, financial barriers and outright refusals of service provision.61 
</p>
<p>64. Concerns have also been raised with the Independent Expert about the health effects 
of agropesticide spraying, including increased congenital birth defects and child cancers in 
certain areas that have witnessed an intensive increase in soybean production. Similar 
concerns have also been raised by the National Ombudsman,62 the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child (CRC/C/ARG/CO/3-4, paras. 29 and 30) and the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights of indigenous peoples (A/HRC/21/47/Add.2, para. 39). The Independent Expert has 
transmitted the concerns brought to his attention to the relevant thematic special procedures 
for their further consideration. Nevertheless, he encourages the Government to take 
measures to prevent health impairments caused by agrochemicals, including through 
improved regulation and control of their use.

</b></p>
<p><b> D. Education 
</b></p>
<p>65. Argentina&#8217;s school system and school infrastructure face ongoing challenges, 
including disparities across the provinces, improving the quality of education, and access to 
education and full enjoyment of the right to education for children with disabilities and 
indigenous children.  
</p>
<p>66. The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that the National Education Act (No. 
26.206) explicitly recognizes the right to education and extends compulsory education to 
secondary level. He also commends the Government for Act No. 26.075 on Educational 
Spending which provides for at least 6 per cent of GDP to be devoted to education. While 
nearly all children of primary school age (99 per cent) are enrolled in primary schools and 
96.5 per cent of children aged 12 to 14 are enrolled in secondary schools, the completion 
rate for secondary school (44.1 per cent) is rather low.63 Census data indicate that the 
Government managed to halve the number of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years dropping out 
of school between 2001 and 2010, but the drop-out rate was still 8 per cent in 2010, with 
children from disadvantaged communities being the most affected.64   
</p>
<p><b> E. Adequate housing  
</b></p>
<p>67. Argentina continues to have a serious shortage of adequate housing and millions of 
Argentines continue to live in substandard conditions, including in slums and other types of 
inadequate housing (A/HRC/19/53/Add.1, para. 6).  The Independent Expert is further 
concerned that only about 1 per cent of the national budget is devoted to addressing 
problems relating to housing.65 This contrasts sharply with the 9 per cent of the national 
budget expected to be absorbed by debt service payments in 2014.  
</p>
<p>68. According to surveys by the Catholic University of Argentina in 2010, 2011 and 
2012, 14.2 per cent of all persons in urban areas are without secure legal tenure, a problem 
affecting in particular residents of informal or precarious settlements, where more than half 
are without secure tenure. In addition, 13.4 per cent of the urban population lack direct 
access to the public drinking water network, a problem that is particularly widespread in the 
Greater Buenos Aires region, where 38.3 per cent of all households are excluded. Finally, 
34.1 per cent of all urban households are not connected to a sewage network, a problem 
affecting 68 per cent of all households in informal settlements.66 
</p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert urges the Government to expand its investment in housing 
programmes, with a view to ensuring access to adequate and affordable housing with legal 
security of tenure for everyone, in line with recommendations made by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/ARG/CO/3, para. 21) and the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing (A/HRC/19/53/Add.1, paras. 59&#8211;75).

<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Poverty  
</b></p>
<p>70. It is generally acknowledged that poverty has been significantly reduced since the 
2001 debt crisis. However, official statistics related to poverty and consumer price indices 
have generated much debate in recent years. Data from the National Statistics and Census 
Institute (INDEC) show that the poverty and extreme poverty levels have constantly 
declined since 2003, from 47.8 and 20.5 per cent to about 4.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively, 
according to the latest available data for the first half of 2013.67 Conversely, independent 
research institutions, such as the Institute for Social, Economic and Public Policy Research 
(ISEPCi), estimate that nearly a quarter of the Argentine population (24 per cent) lives in 
poverty and that 5.6 per cent face extreme poverty.68 Similar results have been presented by 
the Argentine Social Debt Observatory (ODSA) of the School of Economics, Catholic 
University of Argentina, and other research institutes.69  
</p>
<p>71. According to official statistics, both the national minimum wage (3,300 pesos a 
month in 2013) and the minimum pension (2,165 pesos in May 2013) are significantly 
above the poverty line of 1,734 pesos (during the third quarter of 2013).70 However, 
independent research shows some discrepancies relating to the food basket. For example, 
the Centre for Participatory Economic and Social Policy Research (CIPPES) found that, 
depending on the province, between 4,191 and 4,922 pesos would be required to purchase 
the goods and services included in the basket used to calculate the poverty line. According 
to CIPPES, in October 2013, the extreme poverty line was somewhere between 1,838 and 
2,159 pesos, depending on the province. This suggests that basic products and services 
required for maintaining a decent life may in reality be more than twice as expensive as 
official statistics indicate. 
</p>
<p>72. The Independent Expert further notes that both the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC/C/ARG/CO/3-4, para. 64) and the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (E/C.12/ARG/CO/3, para. 11) have previously expressed concern about the 
reliability of poverty and other official statistics. It would appear that as at the time of his 
visit to Argentina these issues had not yet been satisfactory addressed. 
</p>
<p>73. It is not the intention of the Independent Expert to draw conclusions on these 
divergent statistics. Rather, he wishes to underscore that the fight against poverty is a long-
term process that requires significant investment and that, despite much progress, 
challenges remain, with a part of the population still facing extreme poverty, although its 
actual size may be contested. He calls upon the Government to continue its efforts to reduce 
poverty, in particular among children and adolescents, residents of informal settlements, 
indigenous people and other disadvantaged groups, as part of a comprehensive social equity 
strategy that goes beyond financial measures.  
</p>
<p>74. Finally, the Independent Expert considers that the Government should enhance its 
efforts to evaluate the impact of its social policies from a human rights viewpoint. For 
example, there is a need to study whether existing measures and the level of existing

<p>benefits are sufficient to meet the essential minimum levels of social rights enumerated in 
international human rights treaties, and whether they are sufficient to move the 
impoverished out of poverty.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Need for a public debt audit 
</b></p>
<p>75. A significant share of the debt which the country is paying was incurred in 
questionable circumstances, particularly during military rule from 1976 to 1983. During 
that period, banks, international financial institutions and other countries continued to lend 
to Argentina, indirectly supporting an illegitimate government engaged in the repression 
and disappearance of its opponents. Most of the loans taken up during that period were not 
used for productive investments.71 In 1982, when Argentina started to face a financial crisis, 
the military government assumed the foreign debt of private Argentine companies through 
a system of exchange rate guarantees, thereby transforming in a questionable manner 
private debt into public debt. Needless to say, the country&#8217;s debt grew exponentially, from 
$7.8 billion in 1975 to $40.7 billion in 1982.72   
</p><p>76. According to World Bank estimates, of the nearly $45 billion dollars of loans taken 
up during that period, $2.5 billion were used to increase national foreign reserves; $13 
billion to service interest payments; $10 billion for unregistered imports, most of which are 
considered to have been related to arms purchases; and $19 billion were capital outflows.73 
Beneficiaries included senior government officials who transferred funds to their foreign 
bank accounts; businessmen who engaged in financial speculation and transferred their 
profits abroad; and the armed forces, which used loans to purchase arms. The losers were 
the export industry; the formerly prosperous nationalized enterprises; and the Argentine 
people, who had and still have to repay the debts, making up a large percentage of the 
country&#8217;s GDP.74  
</p>
<p>77. Given the questionable legitimacy of the military government and of many of its 
loan operations, the first democratic Government of President Ra&#250;l Alfons&#237;n initially held 
the view that the debt inherited from the military dictatorship should not be repaid without a 
thorough investigation to clarify to what extent the debt was in fact legitimate. A 
moratorium on debt repayments was declared and, in February 1984, the Senate 
Investigatory Commission on Illicit Economic Activities was created and tasked with 
carrying out an investigation of the foreign debt incurred by the military regime. However, 
the mandate of the Commission was not extended beyond 1985 and it lacked sufficient 
budgetary resources and time to present a conclusive report. An investigating commission 
set up by the Central Bank and tasked with investigating the legitimacy of the external debt 
of the private sector was similarly dissolved before it could present any findings.  
</p>
<p>78. Neither the first democratic Government after the 1976 to 1983 military dictatorship, 
nor subsequent governments conducted any thorough investigation into the legitimacy of 
the debt incurred during the military dictatorship. The closest thing to an official

<p>investigation was a judicial inquiry based on a case filed before the Second Federal 
Criminal and Correctional Court of Argentina that culminated in a ruling after 18 years of 
investigation.75 
</p>
<p>79. In 1983, Alejandro Olmos, an Argentine national, filed a claim against the former 
Finance Minister, Jos&#233; Alfredo Martinez de Hoz, for fraud and abuse of authority in 
relation to the public debt incurred during the military dictatorship. His initial claim and 
other proceedings before the Argentine courts were later consolidated into a case that was 
investigated by the Second Federal Criminal and Correctional Court. In a lengthy 
judgement, summarizing the evidence and testimony presented during the investigation, 
Judge Jorge Ballesteros concluded as follows:  
</p>
<p>The evidence introduced throughout these proceedings shows that the highest political 
and economic authorities of the country clearly acted in an arbitrary manner during the 
periods under consideration. This was also true for the directors and managers of some 
government-owned and privately-owned companies and organizations. The authorities 
did not hesitate to violate the Charter of the Argentine Central Bank; legal instruments 
were modified in order to extend the jurisdiction of foreign courts to cases that fell 
under the jurisdiction of domestic courts; and there were no accounting records of the 
foreign debt. For the purpose of sustaining the economic policy, government-owned 
companies were forced to incur debt in order to receive foreign currency that was kept 
by the Central Bank, and was later placed on the foreign exchange market. 
Furthermore, there was a lack of control over the debt incurred by government-owned 
companies and guaranteed by the State.76 
</p>
<p>80. Since the statute of limitations precluded the conviction of any accused person, the 
Court decided to refer its findings to the Congress, emphasizing at the same time that &#8220;the 
dismissal of this case should not preclude the members of the Argentine Congress from 
analysing the conclusions arrived at in these proceedings, in order to determine the 
potential political responsibility of each and every person involved in the events causing the 
enormous foreign debt of the Argentine Republic&#8221;.77 The court stated:  
</p>
<p>This may be the time to reiterate such request in order to obtain a reduction in the 
financial cost of the debt, notwithstanding any other benefit that may be offered by 
creditor countries. However, as is clear from this ruling, the task of making such 
complex decisions is incumbent upon other branches of government. For that reason, 
this Court will send a copy of this decision to the Argentine Congress so that it may 
adopt &#8212; through the respective committees &#8212; such measures as it may deem fit with a 
view to arriving at the best solution possible regarding the negotiation of Argentina&#8217;s 
foreign debt.78  
</p>
<p>81. To the knowledge of the Independent Expert, the Congress has not addressed to date 
the issues identified in the case. As mentioned earlier, he was not able to meet members of 
Congress to discuss the subject in more detail as he had hoped. This is regrettable given the 
obvious challenges that the debt problem has posed for the country.  
</p>
<p>82. It is critical that any strategy to address the country&#8217;s debt problem in a decisive 
manner should include a transparent, participatory and comprehensive audit to ascertain the 
legitimacy or otherwise of the public debt. Under international law, debts assumed by

<p>unrepresentative regimes and not used for the benefit of the people are odious and not 
repayable.79 In this regard, the Independent Expert calls upon the country&#8217;s international 
lenders to support a transparent and participatory audit of Argentina&#8217;s public debt and to 
unconditionally cancel any claims they may have should the audit find these to be odious or 
otherwise illegitimate.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>83.<b> Argentina&#8217;s experience highlights fundamental flaws in the global financial 
system and offers two important lessons. First, economic growth is a key precondition 
for debt repayment capacity, while unbridled fiscal austerity can only deepen a 
country&#8217;s poor economic situation. Second, there is an urgent need for an independent 
international mechanism based on a clear set of binding rules and procedures for 
resolving sovereign debt problems and addressing capital flight.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In the light of the above, the Independent Expert makes the following 
recommendations to the Government of Argentina and its international creditors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of Argentina 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Government of Argentina should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Conduct a transparent, participatory and comprehensive audit of its 
public debt in order to obtain a clear picture of the circumstances in which the debt 
was incurred and, in particular, to ascertain the extent to which the debt can be 
deemed to be odious;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) As a matter of priority, enact national legislation to limit the ability of 
vulture funds to pursue before Argentine courts immoral profits at the expense of the 
poor and most vulnerable through protracted litigation, and actively promote the 
enactment of such legislation by other countries both within and outside its region; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Renew its efforts to promote social, economic and cultural rights, 
including the rights to education, health, water and sanitation and adequate housing, 
and to ensure the minimum essential levels of these rights for all;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Take measures to address gender-based inequality in the labour market 
as outlined in the present report;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Intensify its efforts relating to the inclusion of workers in the social 
security system so as to reduce informal employment to less than 30 per cent by 2015; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Take measures to eliminate the social and economic factors contributing 
to child labour and continue to strengthen its efforts and structures to eliminate child 
labour, especially its worst forms;</b>80<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Take measures to address the problems of children remaining outside 
the education system, illiteracy, course repetition and school dropout;

</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Argentina&#8217;s international creditors should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support a transparent, participatory and comprehensive audit of 
Argentina&#8217;s public debt and, in keeping with the principle of shared responsibility for 
preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations, unconditionally cancel any 
claims they may have should the audit find these to be odious; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) As a matter of priority, enact national legislation to combat extortionate 
litigation by vulture funds;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Support the establishment of an international rules-based framework for 
the impartial, efficient and rights-sensitive resolution of sovereign debt problems; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that any sovereign debt restructuring agreements reflect the 
primacy of human rights obligations, particularly those of Argentina to its population.
