The shares represented by Proxy in the form provided to shareholders will be voted or withheld from

appointing him.  If there is no direction by the registered shareholder, those shares will be voted for all 
proposals set out in the Proxy and for the election of directors and the appointment of the auditors as 
set out in this Circular.  The Proxy gives the person named in it the discretion to vote as such person 
sees fit on any amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting, or any other 
matters which may properly come before the Meeting.  At the time of printing of this Circular, the 
management of the Company (the “Management”) knows of no other matters which may come before 
the Meeting other than those referred to in the Notice of Meeting.  
 
Advice to Beneficial Holders of Common Shares  
 
The  information  set  forth  in  this  section  is  of  significant  importance  to  many  shareholders,  as  a 
substantial number of shareholders do not hold common shares in their own name.  Shareholders who 
hold  their  common  shares  through  their  brokers,  intermediaries,  trustees  or  other  persons,  or  who 
otherwise  do  not  hold  their  common  shares  in  their  own  name  (referred  to  herein  as  “Beneficial 
Shareholders”)  should  note  that  only  proxies  deposited  by  shareholders  who  appear  on  the  records 
maintained by the Company’s registrar and transfer agent as registered holders of common shares will be 
recognized and acted upon at the Meeting.  If common shares are listed in an account statement provided 
to a Beneficial Shareholder by a broker, then those common shares will, in all likelihood, not be registered 
in the shareholder’s name.  Such common shares will more likely be registered under the name of the 
shareholder’s broker or an agent of that broker.  In Canada, the vast majority of such shares are registered 
under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc., which 
acts as nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms).  In the United States, the vast majority of such 
common shares are registered under the name of Cede & Co., the registration name for The Depository 
Trust Company, which acts as nominee for many United States brokerage firms.  Common shares held by 
brokers (or their agents or nominees) on behalf of a broker’s client can only be voted or withheld at the 
direction  of  the  Beneficial  Shareholder.    Without  specific  instructions,  brokers  and  their  agents  and 
nominees  are  prohibited  from  voting  shares  for  the  broker’s  clients.    Therefore,  each  Beneficial 
Shareholder should ensure that voting instructions are communicated to the appropriate person well 
in advance of the Meeting.  
 
Existing  regulatory  policy  requires  brokers  and  other  intermediaries  to  seek  voting  instructions  from 
Beneficial Shareholders in advance of shareholder meetings. The various brokers and other intermediaries 
have their own mailing procedures and provide their own return instructions to clients, which should be 
carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their common shares are voted at 
the Meeting.  The form of instrument of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Shareholder by its broker (or the 
agent of the broker) is substantially similar to the Proxy provided directly to registered shareholders by
4 | P a g e
the Company.  However, its purpose is limited to instructing the registered shareholder (i.e., the broker 
or agent of the broker) how to vote on behalf of the Beneficial Shareholder.  The vast majority of brokers 
now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. 
(“Broadridge”)  in  Canada.    Broadridge  typically  prepares  a  machine-readable  voting  instruction  form 
(“VIF”), mails those forms to Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to return the VIFs 
to Broadridge, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to Broadridge (by way of the internet or 
telephone, for example).  Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides 
appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting.  A Beneficial 
Shareholder who receives a Broadridge VIF cannot use that form to vote common shares directly at the 
Meeting.  The VIFs must be returned to Broadridge (or instructions respecting the voting of common 
shares must otherwise be communicated to Broadridge) well in advance of the Meeting in order to have 
the common shares voted.  If you have any questions respecting the voting of common shares held 
through a broker or other intermediary, please contact that broker or other intermediary for assistance.  
 
The  Notice  of  Meeting,  Circular,  Proxy  and  VIF,  as  applicable,  are  being  provided  to  both  registered 
shareholders and Beneficial Shareholders.  Beneficial Shareholders fall into two categories - those who 
object to their identity being known to the issuers of securities which they own (“OBOs”) and those who 
do  not  object  to  their  identity  being  made  known  to  the  issuers  of  the  securities  which  they  own 
(“NOBOs”).   
 
Pursuant to the provisions of National Instrument 54-101  -  Communication with Beneficial  Owners  of 
Securities of a Reporting Issuer (“NI 54-101”), issuers may request and obtain a list of their NOBOs from 
intermediaries directly or via their transfer agent and may obtain and use the NOBO list for the distribution 
of proxy-related materials directly (not via Broadridge) to such NOBOs.  The Company is providing the 
Notice of Meeting, Circular and Proxy or VIF, as applicable, directly to both registered owners and non-
registered owners of its securities.  If you are a non-registered or Beneficial Shareholder and the Company 
or its agent has sent these materials directly to you, your name, address and information about your 
holdings  of  common  shares  have  been  obtained  in  accordance  with  applicable  securities  regulatory 
requirements from the intermediary holding the common shares on your behalf.  By choosing to send 
these materials to you directly, the Company (and not the intermediary holding common shares on your 
behalf) has assumed responsibility for (i) delivering these materials to you, and (ii) executing your proper 
voting instructions.  Please return your voting instructions as specified in the VIF.  As a result, if you are a 
non-registered owner of the securities, you can expect to receive a scannable VIF from Computershare.  
Please  complete  and  return  the  VIF  to  Computershare  in  the  envelope  provided  or  by  facsimile.    In 
addition, telephone voting and internet voting instructions can be found on the VIF.  Computershare will 
tabulate  the  results  of  the  VIFs  received  from  the  Company’s  NOBOs  and  will  provide  appropriate 
instructions at the Meeting with respect to the common shares represented by the VIFs they receive.  
 
The Company’s OBOs can expect to be contacted by Broadridge or their broker or their broker’s agents as 
set out above.  The Company does not intend to pay for intermediaries to deliver the Notice of Meeting, 
Circular and VIF to OBOs under National Instrument 54-101 - Communication with Beneficial Owners of 
Securities of a Reporting Issuer and Form 54-101F7 - Request for Voting Instructions Made by Intermediary 
and accordingly, if the OBO’s intermediary does not assume the costs of delivery of those documents in 
the event that the OBO wishes to receive them, the OBO may not receive the documentation.  
 
Although a Beneficial Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of 
voting common shares registered in the name of his broker, a Beneficial Shareholder may attend the 
Meeting as proxyholder for the registered shareholder and vote the common shares in that capacity.  NI
5 | P a g e
54-101  allows  a  Beneficial  Shareholder  who  is  a  NOBO  to  submit  to  the  Company  or  an  applicable 
intermediary  any  document  in  writing  that  requests  that  the  NOBO  or  a  nominee  of  the  NOBO  be 
appointed as proxyholder.  If such a request is received, the Company or an intermediary, as applicable, 
must arrange, without expenses to the NOBO, to appoint such NOBO or its nominee as a proxyholder and 
to  deposit  that  proxy  within  the  time  specified  in  this  Circular,  provided  that  the  Company  or  the 
intermediary receives such written instructions from the NOBO at least one business day prior to the time 
by which proxies are to be submitted at the Meeting, with the result that such a written request must be 
received by 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on the day which is at least three business days prior to the Meeting.  
A  Beneficial  Shareholder  who  wishes  to  attend  the  Meeting  and  to  vote  their  common  shares  as 
proxyholder for the registered shareholder, should enter their own name in the blank space on the VIF 
or such other document in writing that requests that the NOBO or a nominee of the NOBO be appointed 
as proxyholder  and return the same to their broker (or the broker’s  agent) in accordance with the 
instructions provided by such broker.  
 
All  references  to  shareholders  in  the  Notice of  Meeting,  Circular  and  the  accompanying Proxy  are  to 
registered shareholders of the Company as set forth on the list of registered shareholders of the Company 
as maintained by the registrar and transfer agent of the Company, Computershare, unless specifically 
stated otherwise.
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF VOTING SECURITIES
As at the date of the accompanying Notice of Meeting, the Company’s authorized capital consists of an 
unlimited number of common shares of which 157,698,138 common shares are issued and outstanding.  
All common shares in the capital of the Company carry the right to one vote.  
 
Shareholders  registered  as  at  August  26,  2016,  are  entitled  to  attend  and  vote  at  the  Meeting.  
Shareholders who wish to be represented by proxy at the Meeting must, to entitle the person appointed 
by the Proxy to attend and vote, deliver their Proxies at the place and within the time set forth in the 
notes to the Proxy.  
 
To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company, as of the date of this Circular, 
no person beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, 10% or more of 
the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Named Executive Officers  
 
During the financial year ended March 31, 2016, the Company had two Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) 
being R. Joe Sandberg, the President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Alec Peck, the Chief Financial 
Officer (“CFO”).  
 
“Named  Executive  Officer”  means:  (a)  each  CEO,  (b)  each  CFO,  (c)  each  of  the  three  most  highly 
compensated executive officers of the Company, including any of its subsidiaries, or the three most highly 
compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO and CFO, at the end of the most 
recently completed financial year whose total compensation was, individually, more than $150,000; and 
(d) each individual who would be an NEO under (c) above but for the fact that the individual was neither 
an executive officer of the Company, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Compensation Discussion and Analysis  
 
The compensation of the Company’s NEOs is determined by the Company’s Board, on recommendation 
of  the  Company’s  Compensation  and  Nominating  Committee.    The  Compensation  and  Nominating 
Committee is composed of three directors, Steven C. Bastable, Kevin Puil, and Arthur Ratte, of which all 
are considered to be independent.  All members of the Compensation and Nominating Committee have 
direct experience which is relevant to their responsibilities as committee members and all members are 
or have held senior executive roles within public companies and, therefore, have a good understanding of 
compensation programmes.  The members of the Compensation and Nominating Committee also have 
good financial understanding which allows them  to assess the costs versus benefits of  compensation 
plans. The members’ combined experience in the resource sector provides them with the understanding 
of  the  Company’s  success  factors  and  risks,  which  is  very  important  when  determining  metrics  for 
measuring success.  
 
The mandate of the Compensation and Nominating Committee includes reviewing compensation strategy, 
objectives  and  policies;  annually  reviewing  and  assessing  the  performance  of  the  executive  officers; 
recommending  to  the  Board  the  compensation  of  the  executive  officers;  reviewing  executive 
appointments; and reviewing and recommending the adequacy and form of directors’ compensation.  The 
Compensation and Nominating Committee meets at least once annually.    
 
The  Company’s  compensation  program  is  designed  to  provide  competitive  levels  of  compensation,  a 
significant portion of which is dependent upon individual and corporate performance and contribution to 
increasing shareholder value.  The Board recognizes the need to provide a total compensation package 
that will attract and retain qualified and experienced executives as well as align the compensation level of 
each executive to that executive’s level of responsibility.  In general, an NEO’s compensation is comprised 
of two components: (i) consulting fees, and (ii) stock option grants.  
 
The objectives and reasons for this system of compensation are generally to allow the Company to remain 
competitive compared to its peers in attracting experienced personnel.  Stock option grants are designed 
to reward the NEOs for success on a similar basis as the shareholders of the Company, but these rewards 
are highly dependent upon the volatile stock market, much of which is beyond the control of the NEOs.    
 
Neither the Board nor the Compensation and Nominating Committee has undertaken a formal evaluation 
of the implications of the risks associated with the Company’s compensation policies and practices.  Risk 
management is a consideration of the Board when implementing its compensation programme, and the 
Board  and  the  Compensation  and  Nominating  Committee  does  not  believe  that  the  Company’s 
compensation programme results in unnecessary or inappropriate risk taking including risks that are likely  
to have a material adverse effect on the Company.   
 
The Company’s NEOs and directors are not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including for 
greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or units of exchange funds that 
are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation 
or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.   
 
Directors’ fees are paid to the independent directors.  See section titled “Director Compensation”.

As  the  Company’s  Board  and  its  Compensation  and  Nominating  Committee  do  not  rely  on  share 
performance as the basis for executive compensation decisions, the trend shown in above graph is not 
related to executive compensation. 
 
Share-Based and Option-Based Awards  
 
The Company does not grant share-based awards.  
 
Stock option grants are made pursuant to the Company’s amended and restated stock option plan (the 
“Stock  Option  Plan”)  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of  stock  options  currently  held,  position,  overall 
individual performance, anticipated contribution to the Company’s future success and the individual’s 
ability to influence corporate and business performance.  The purpose of granting such stock options is to 
assist  the  Company  in  compensating,  attracting,  retaining  and  motivating  the  officers,  directors, 
employees and consultants of the Company and to closely align the personal interest of such persons to 
the interest of the shareholders.  The recipients of incentive stock options and the terms of the stock 
options granted are determined from time to time by the Board.  Following is a brief description of the 
Stock Option Plan, which was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the annual meeting held on 
December 2, 2011.  The Stock Option Plan has not been amended since this approval.
8 | P a g e
General  
 
The maximum number of shares issuable under the Stock Option Plan may not in the aggregate exceed 
27,705,457  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares,  which,  as  of  the  date  of  this  Circular,  represents 
approximately 17.57% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares.  There are currently 11,675,000 
options issued and outstanding under the Stock Option Plan. The Company is prohibited from granting 
options:  
 
•
to any one person where the grant would result in such person holding options to acquire shares 
in excess of 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company;  
 
that  will  result  in  the  number  of  common  shares  of  the  Company  issuable  to  insiders  of  the 
Company (as such term is defined in the TSX Company Manual), as a group, at any time in excess 
of 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company at the award date or that 
will result in the number of common shares of the Company issued to insiders of the Company, as 
a group, within any one year period in excess of 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares 
of the Company as at the award date under the Stock Option Plan or when combined with all of 
the Company’s other security based compensation arrangements.
•
Expiry of Options  
 
The maximum expiry date of an option is five years from the date of grant, subject to extensions in the 
case of a trading blackout.   
 
In the event of the death or disability of an option holder while he or she is a director or an employee or 
the deemed death or disability of an option holder which is a consultant, the expiry date will be the earlier 
of the original expiry date of such option and one year from the date of death or disability.  Any options 
which are unvested as of the date of death or disability will not vest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
Board may, in its discretion, determine that any unvested options of the option holder will immediately 
vest and become exercisable.  
 
In the event the option holder is a director and ceases to be a director of the Company other than by 
reason of death or disability, all unvested options will immediately vest and become exercisable and the 
expiry date of the option will be the earlier of the original expiry date of such option and the 90th day 
following the date the option holder ceased to be a director of the Company unless the option holder 
ceases to be a director but continues to be an employee or consultant, in which case the options will not 
so vest and the expiry date will remain unchanged.  If the option holder ceases to be a director as the 
result of certain prescribed circumstances, the expiry date of the options will be the date the director 
ceases to be a director of the Company and any unvested options will not vest.  
 
In the event that an option holder is an employee and ceases to be employed by the Company (other than 
by reason of death, disability, mandatory retirement, a change of control, termination for cause or as a 
result of an order of a regulatory body) the expiry date of the option will be the earlier of the original 
expiry date of such option and the 90th day following the date the employee ceases to be employed unless 
the option holder ceases to be an employee but continues to be a director or consultant in which case the 
expiry date remains unchanged or unless the option holder ceases to be an employee as a result of (i) 
termination for cause; or (ii) by order of the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities 
Commission, the TSX or any other regulatory body having jurisdiction to so order, in which case the expiry
9 | P a g e
date will be the date the option holder ceases to be an employee.  All options which are not vested as of 
the date the employee ceases to be employed will not vest unless the option holder continues to be a 
director  or  consultant  of  the  Company,  in  which  case  the  vesting  of  the  options  will  be  unchanged.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, in its discretion, determine that any unvested options of 
the  option  holder  will  immediately  vest  and  become  exercisable.    If  the  employee  ceases  to  be  an 
employee by reason of mandatory retirement, all unvested options will immediately vest and become 
exercisable and the expiry date will be one year from the date of retirement.  
 
In the event that an option holder is a consultant of the Company and the option holder ceases to be a 
consultant  by  reason  of  the  completion  or  termination  of  the  contract  under  which  the  consultant 
provides services to the Company, the expiry date of the option will be the earlier of the original expiry 
date of such option and the 90th day following the date the option holder ceases to be a consultant, unless 
the option holder ceases to be a consultant but continues to be engaged as a director or employee of the 
Company, in which case the expiry date will be the 90th day following the date the Option Holder ceases 
to be a director or employee.  Any options which are unvested as of the date the option holder ceases to 
be a consultant will not vest unless the option holder continues to be engaged as a director or employee, 
in which case the vesting of the options will be unchanged.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board 
may, in its discretion, determine that any unvested options of the option holder immediately vest and 
become exercisable.  In addition, if upon completion of the contract under which the consultant provided 
services to the Company, the consultant is subsequently hired by the Company as an employee within 90 
days, the options previously granted to the consultant will flow through to the employee on the same 
terms and conditions as the original grant of options.  
 
Exercise Price  
 
The exercise price of options is determined by the Board and announced as of the award date and may 
not be less than the closing price of the shares on the TSX on the last day immediately preceding the award 
date.   
 
Vesting of Options  
 
The Board has the discretion to impose vesting periods on any options granted.  
 
Assignment of Options  
 
Options are non-assignable and non-transferable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an option holder may 
transfer an option to a corporation which is 100% owned by the option holder provided that the transfer 
is permitted by, and is effected in accordance with, the applicable securities laws and the policies of the 
TSX.  
 
Amendment and Termination  
 
The Board will have the power to, without shareholder approval, at any time and from time to time, either 
prospectively  or  retrospectively,  amend,  suspend  or  terminate  the  Stock  Option  Plan  or  any  option 
granted under the Stock Option Plan, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:  
 
•
alter, extend or accelerate the terms and conditions of vesting of any options;
10 | P a g e
amend or modify the mechanics of the exercise of options;
effect  amendments  of  a  “housekeeping”  or  ministerial  nature  including,  without  limiting  the 
generality of the foregoing, any amendment necessary to comply with the provisions of applicable 
laws (including, without limitation, the rules, regulations and policies of the TSX);
effect amendments respecting the administration of the Stock Option Plan;   
 
effect amendments necessary to suspend or terminate the Stock Option Plan; and  
 
effect  any  other  amendment,  whether  fundamental  or  otherwise,  not  requiring  shareholder 
approval under applicable law (including, without limitation, the rules, regulations and policies of 
the TSX);
provided always that any such amendment will not, without the consent of the option holder, alter the 
terms or conditions of any option or impair any right of any option holder pursuant to any option awarded

Additionally, in the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, 
repurchase or  exchange  of  shares or  other  securities  of  the  Company  or  any  other  similar corporate 
transaction  or  event  involving  the  Company  (or  the  Company  entering  into  a  written  agreement  to 
undergo such a transaction or event), the Board may, in its sole discretion, provide for any of the following

•
either (A) termination of any stock option, whether or not vested, in exchange for an amount of 
cash and/or other property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the 
exercise of such stock option or realization of the option holder’s rights (and, for the avoidance of 
doubt, if, as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described in Section 6.1(i)(A) 
of the Stock Option Plan, the Board determines in good faith that no amount would have been 
attained upon the exercise of such option or realization of the option holder’s rights, then such 
option may be terminated by the Company without any payment) or (B) the replacement of such 
option with other equivalent rights or property selected by the Board, in its sole discretion;  
 
that such option be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary 
thereof, or will be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the 
successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments 
as to the number and kind of shares and prices; or
• 
 
•
•
•
•

•
that such option will be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all shares covered 
thereby, or notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the option, the option cannot vest, be

of such event.
Notwithstanding  the  powers  of  the  Board  described  above,  shareholder  approval  (or  disinterested 
shareholder approval, if required by the policies of the TSX) will be required for the following types of 
amendments:
11 | P a g e
any increase in the number of shares issuable under the Stock Option Plan, except such increases 
that result from the adjustment provisions provided under the Stock Option Plan;  
 
any reduction in the exercise price of an option or the cancellation and reissue of an option within 
three months of the date of such cancellation;  
 
any amendment which extends the term of an option beyond its original expiry date except in 
accordance with provisions of the Stock Option Plan governing the blackouts;  
 
any amendment which would permit an option to be transferable or assignable other than for 
normal  estate  settlement  purposes  or  to  a  corporation  which  is  wholly-owned  by  the  option 
holder;
any amendment to Section 3.2, Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of the Stock Option Plan; and
any amendment required to be approved by shareholders under applicable law (including without 
limitation, pursuant to the rules, regulations and policies of the TSX).
The Board may terminate the Stock Option Plan at any time provided that such termination will not alter 
the terms or conditions of any option awarded prior to the date of such termination.  
 
Financial Assistance  
 
The Company does not offer financial assistance in respect of the exercise of options.

“In-the-Money Options” means the excess of the market value of the Company’s shares on March 31, 2016 over the 
exercise price of the options.  The market price for the Company’s common shares on March 31, 2016, was $0.04.  As the 
market value of the Company’s common shares on March 31, 2016, was less than the exercise price of these options, 
these options were not in-the-money options at March 31, 2016, and accordingly, no value has been given to them.
Incentive Plan Awards – Value Vested or Earned During the Year  
 
The following table sets forth details of the value vested or earned for all incentive plan awards during the

TERMINATION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL BENEFITS
Other than as set out below, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have a compensatory plan, contract, 
agreement, plan or arrangement in respect of compensation received or that may be received by any NEO 
(including  periodic  payments  or  instalments)  to  compensate  such  executive  officer  in  the  event  of 
resignation or other termination of the NEO’s employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, (whether 
voluntary, involuntary or constructive) a change of control of the Company, or a change in responsibilities 
of the NEO following a change in control.  
 
Consulting Agreement with R. Joe Sandberg, President, CEO and Director  
 
Effective October 1, 2008, the Company entered into a verbal consulting agreement, which was replaced 
and  superseded  by  an  amended  and  restated  agreement  dated  February  1,  2011  (the  “Sandberg 
Consulting Agreement”), with R. Joe Sandberg.  Pursuant to the Sandberg Consulting Agreement, Mr. 
Sandberg provides services as President and CEO of the Company in exchange for the payment by the
14 | P a g e
Company of a current annual fee of US$120,000, the issuance of stock options and reimbursement of all 
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Mr. Sandberg.  The arrangement may be terminated by 
either party on 30 days’ notice.  In the event the Sandberg Consulting Agreement is terminated by either 
Mr. Sandberg or the Company (or any successor company or person) as a result of a Change of Control (as 
defined in the Sandberg Consulting Agreement), Mr. Sandberg is entitled to an amount equal to 12 months 
of his July 1, 2012, monthly fee of US$18,375.  In addition, all options granted to Mr. Sandberg will vest 
immediately and will be exercisable for 90 days from the date of termination.  Accordingly, if the Sandberg 
Consulting Agreement had been terminated as a result of a Change of Control on March 31, 2016, Mr. 
Sandberg would have been entitled to a payment of US$220,500.  In addition, in the event of termination 
as a result of a Change of Control, all options granted to Mr. Sandberg will vest immediately and will be 
exercisable for 90 days from the date of termination.  Assuming the Sandberg Consulting Agreement was 
terminated as a result of a Change of Control on March 31, 2016, the value realized upon exercise of the 
options in the money would be $Nil.   
 
Consulting Agreement with Alec Peck, CFO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE
National Instrument 58-101  – Disclosure  of Corporate  Governance Practices (“NI 58-101”) requires all 
reporting issuers to provide certain annual disclosure of their corporate governance practices with respect 
to  the  corporate  governance  guidelines  (the  “Guidelines”)  adopted  in  National  Policy  58-201.    These 
Guidelines are not prescriptive, but have been used by the Company in adopting its corporate governance 
practices.  The Board and Management consider good corporate governance to be an integral part of the 
effective  and  efficient  operation  of  Canadian  corporations.    The  Company’s  approach  to  corporate 
governance is set out below.

Board of Directors   
 
(a)  Disclose the identity of the directors who are
independent.
(b)  Disclose the identity of the directors who are 
not independent, and describe the basis for 
that determination.
(c)  Disclose whether the majority of the directors
are independent.
The Board currently is comprised of five directors, a 
majority of whom are considered to be independent 
as three are considered to be independent and two 
are not considered to be independent.   
 
The Board considers Steven C. Bastable, Kevin Puil 
and Arthur Ratte to be independent directors.  The 
Board considers R. Joe Sandberg and J. Stephen 
Barley to be directors that are not considered to be 
independent as they are executive officers of the 
Company. R. Joe Sandberg is not an independent 
director because he also serves as the CEO and 
President of the Company.  J. Stephen Barley is not 
an independent director because he also serves as 
the Executive Chairman of the Company.   
 
The Board is responsible for determining whether 
or not each director is an independent director.  To 
do this, the Board analyzes all the relationships of 
the directors with the Company and its subsidiaries.  
Those directors who do not meet the meaning of 
independence as provided in NI 58-101 (and in 
section 1.4 of NI 52-110) were deemed to not be 
independent directors.

COMMENTS
The text of the written mandate of the Board of 
Directors is attached to this Circular as Schedule “A”. 
  
  
The Board has developed written position 
descriptions for each of the Executive Chairman and 
the Chair of the Audit Committee.  The Board 
delineates the role and responsibilities for the Chair 
of each of the other committees by providing such 
individuals with the applicable mandate of each 
committee.   
  
The Board has developed a written position 
description for the CEO.
Currently, the Board does not have a formal 
orientation or education program for its members.  
When new directors are appointed, they receive 
orientation, commensurate with the previous 
experience, on the Company’s business and on the 
responsibilities of directors.  In addition, the Board 
has prepared a comprehensive Corporate 
Governance Policies Manual which is provided to 
each new director.  
 
Board meetings may also include presentations by 
the Company’s management to give the directors 
additional insight into the Company’s business.
The Board has developed a “Code of Ethics” to 
encourage and promote a culture of ethical 
business conduct.  A copy of the Code of Ethics may 
be obtained by contacting the Company at (604) 
633-5088.  To monitor compliance with the Code of 
Ethics, the Company requires directors, officers and 
employees to review and declare their commitment 
to the Code of Ethics and provide a signed and 
dated declaration.  The Company conducts an 
annual review and every year directors, officers and 
employees are required to further declare whether 
they are aware of any breaches of the Code of 
Ethics and to further agree to comply with the Code 
of Ethics.

COMMENTS
The Board promotes ethical business conduct 
through the nomination of Board members it 
considers ethical, through avoiding and minimizing 
conflicts of interest and by having a majority of its 
Board members independent of corporate 
matters.  Where a director has a material interest 
in a transaction or agreement concerning the 
Company, the Board takes such steps as may be 
prudent to isolate and eliminate or reduce the 
potential for such a conflict of interest to interfere 
with the Board’s exercise of independent 
judgment.  
 
Corporate law and the Code require that any 
director or officer who is directly or indirectly 
personally interested in a proposed activity or 
transaction which involves the Company, or 
otherwise is in a position which creates a potential 
for a conflict of interest, must disclose the 
circumstances and these holdings to the Board.  
 
In  accordance  with  applicable  corporate  law,  any 
director who is in a position of conflict must refrain 
from  voting  on  any  resolution  of  the  Board  with 
respect to the conflict.  The Board may also require 
the  director  to  excuse  himself  or  herself  from 
deliberations of the Board or may alternatively refer 
the  matter  for  consideration  by  a  committee  of 
independent directors of the Board.  
 
In  addition  to  the  above  measures,  the  Board  has 
also adopted a Whistleblower Policy and a Policy on 
Trading in Securities to promote a culture of ethical 
conduct. 
  
 The   Board,   through  
its   Compensation   and  
Nominating Committee, considers its size each year 
when it considers the number of directors to 
recommend to the shareholders for election at the 
annual meeting of shareholders, taking into 
account the number required to carry out the 
Board’s duties effectively and to maintain a 
diversity of views and experience.
COMMENTS
The Compensation and Nominating Committee is 
currently composed entirely of independent 
directors being Steven C. Bastable, Kevin Puil, and 
Arthur Ratte.  
  
The Board carefully considers the required elements 
for nomination based on the needs of the Company 
at that time and only considers qualified individuals 
not related to existing Board members.  The 
committee is responsible for strengthening the 
Board through the recruitment of qualified 
candidates.  The committee identifies individuals 
qualified to become members of the Board, 
recommends nominees for election as directors at 
each annual shareholder meeting and recommends 
candidates to fill any vacancies on the Board. 
  
Detailed information on the Company’s approach to 
executive compensation is contained in this Circular 
under the heading “Executive Compensation”.

COMMENTS
In addition to the Audit Committee and the 
Compensation and Nominating Committee, the 
Board has established the following two 
committees:
a)  Disclosure Committee; and  
b)  Health and Safety Committee.
The Disclosure Committee is responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s regulatory disclosure 
and the Company’s disclosure practices.  The 
Health and Safety Committee is responsible for, 
among other things, reviewing and recommending 
to the Board changes in or additions to 
occupational health and safety policies and 
standards.
Currently, the Board takes responsibility for 
monitoring and assessing its effectiveness and the 
performance of individual directors, its committees, 
including reviewing the Board’s decision-making 
processes and quality and adequacy of information 
provided by management.   The Compensation and 
Nominating Committee assists the Board with this 
function by conducting annual evaluations of the 
Board. 
 
 
 
The Company has not adopted term limits or other 
mechanisms for Board renewal.  While the Company 
recognizes the benefits of adding individuals with 
new perspectives and different experiences to the 
Board, the Company prioritizes continuity and an in-
depth familiarity with the Company developed 
through long-standing relationships with the 
Company. 
 
 
While the Board notes that women have historically 
been under-represented on boards of directors of 
Canadian companies, the Company has not adopted 
a written policy in this regard as the Board 
prioritizes identifying and nominating candidates 
that have the skills and experience which meet the 
Company’s needs at any given time.

Policies Regarding the Representation of Women 
on the Board (continued) 
 
Disclose whether and, if so, how the board or 
nominating committee considers the level of 
representation of women on the board in 
identifying and nominating candidates for election 
or re-election to the board or the reasons for not 
doing so. 
 
Disclose whether and, if so, how consideration is 
given to the level of representation of women in 
executive officer positions when making executive 
officer appointments or the reasons for not doing 
so. 
 
Disclose  whether  a  “target”  (being  a  number  or 
percentage, or a range of numbers or percentages 
of  women  on  the  board  or  in  executive  officer 
positions) has been adopted or the reasons for not 
doing so. 
 
Disclose whether a target has been adopted 
regarding women in executive officer positions of 
the issuer or the reasons for not doing so. 
 
Disclose the number and proportion (in 
percentage terms) of directors on the board who 
are women. 
 
Disclose the number and proportion (in 
percentage terms) of executive officers of the 
Company, including all major subsidiaries, who are 
women.
COMMENTS
The Company is aware of the benefits of diversity on 
the Board and considers female representation as 
one factor during the search process; however, the 
Board also considers many other factors and 
prioritizes the experience of candidates and 
composition of the group of nominees in selecting 
candidates for election to the Board. 
 
The Board considers a diversity of skills and 
experience as an important component of its team 
of executive officers and in identifying candidates 
for executive officer positions, the Board considers 
both gender and other types of diversity.  The 
Board, however, prioritizes skill and experience over 
other factors in identifying executive officer 
candidates.

PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
Financial Statements
1. 
 
The Board has approved the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 
31, 2016, together with the auditors’ report thereon, and the corresponding Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis, all of which will be tabled at the Meeting.  Copies of these financial statements have been 
sent to those shareholders who had requested receipt of same, and are also available on SEDAR.  No 
approval or other action needs to be taken at the Meeting in respect of these documents.

Election of Directors
Fixing the Number of Directors
2. 
 
There are currently four (5) directors on the Company’s board of directors.  At the Meeting, it is proposed 
that the number of directors to be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or 
until their successors are elected or appointed be set at five (5).   
 
Unless otherwise directed, it is the intention of management to vote proxies IN FAVOUR of setting the 
number of directors to be elected at five (5). 
 
3. 
 
The directors of the Company are elected annually and hold office until the next annual general meeting 
of the shareholders or until their successors are elected or appointed.  Management of the Company 
proposes to nominate the persons listed below for election as directors of the Company to serve until their 
successors  are  elected  or  appointed.    In  the  absence  of  instructions  to  the  contrary,  Proxies  given 
pursuant to the solicitation by  Management will be voted FOR the nominees listed in this Circular.  
Management does not contemplate that any of the nominees will be unable to serve as a director.   
 
Majority Voting Policy  
 
On July 19, 2013, the Board adopted a policy which requires, among other things and subject to certain 
exceptions, that any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” than votes 
“for” his or her election will be required to tender his or her resignation.  This policy applies only to 
uncontested elections, which are elections in which the number of nominees for director is equal to the 
number of positions available on the Board and at which more than 15% of the outstanding common 
shares of the Company have been voted by holders in person or by proxy.  The Company’s compensation 
and nominating committee (in this section, the “Committee”) will consider the director’s resignation and 
will recommend to the Board whether or not to accept it.  The Committee will be expected to recommend 
accepting  the  resignation,  except  where  the  Committee  determines  that  there  are  extraordinary 
circumstances  that  justify  delaying  acceptance  or  rejecting  it.    In  making  its  recommendation,  the 
Committee (or equivalent) may consider all factors it deems to be relevant.  In making a decision to accept 
or reject a resignation offer, the Board will be expected to accept it unless the Board determines that 
there  are  extraordinary  circumstances  that  justify  delaying  acceptance or  rejecting  it.    In  reaching  its 
decision,  the  Board  may  consider  all  factors  it  deems  to  be  relevant,  including  any  Committee 
recommendation.  The Board’s decision regarding a resignation offer will be promptly announced via press 
release that discloses supporting reasons for its decision.  
 
Advance Notice Provisions  
 
Pursuant to Article 14.12 of the Company’s Articles, any additional director nominations for an annual 
general meeting must be received by the Company not less than 35 nor more than 65 days prior to the 
date of the meeting.  As no nominations were received by August 26, 2016, being the date which is 35 
days prior to the Meeting, Management’s nominees for election as directors set forth below shall be the 
only nominees eligible to stand for election at the Meeting.
