STATE

AND:

TANIELA KARURU

Counsels: Ms. S. Kiran for the State

JUDGMENT

1.      
The Accused Taniela Karuru was charged under section 207 (1), (2)(a) of the Crimes Decree 44 of 2009 for the offence of Rape.

2.      
Trial commenced on 1st June and concluded on the 7th June 2012.

3.      
After the conclusion of the Summing Up the assessors have arrived with an unanimous verdict of guilty to the offence that he is charged.

4.      
I adjourned overnight to consider my judgment.

5.      
I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial and I direct myself in accordance with the summing up I gave assessors yesterday. I find that the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept the verdict.

6.      
Considering all I find the Prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt therefore I find the Accused Taniela Karuru guilty to the charge of Rape and convict him under section 207 (1) of the Crimes Decree.
