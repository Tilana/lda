<p>GE.<footnote name="1">7. The delegation noted that the efforts of Gabon in the area of human rights policy did 
not place it above criticism or comment. However, criticism should be viewed as an 
invitation to improve, as human rights were an ideal. Gabon was working towards that ideal 
and assured the international community that it would continue to strive to reach it.  </footnote>2-18722  (E)    070113    080113

<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth 
session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Gabon was held at the 3rd 
meeting, held on 23 October 2012. The delegation of Gabon was headed by Ms. Ida Reteno 
Assonouet, the Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Relations with Constitutional 
Institutions. At its 10th meeting, held on 29 October 2012, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Gabon. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Gabon: Czech Republic, Italy and Uganda. 
3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Gabon: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">2. Nicaragua acknowledged progress made by Gabon since 2008. It highlighted the 
ratification of international human rights instruments, the cooperation with different 
mechanisms of the Council, as well as the implementation of national strategies to address 
discrimination and domestic violence against women and violence against children. It 
valued reforms in the justice system, particularly those regarding obsolete practices in the 
treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. Nicaragua made recommendations. </footnote>/14/GAB/1);

Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">1. The Netherlands commended Gabon on the abolition of the death penalty. It noted 
that mechanisms, policies and laws to prevent and combat trafficking existed in Gabon, 
both at national and provincial levels. Still, legislation was not regularly enforced and 
coordination had proven to be insufficient. Improvements in this field needed to be made, 
as noted also by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, when she visited Gabon 
in 2012. The Netherlands made a recommendation.

<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation, introducing Gabon&#8217;s report in the second phase of the 
universal periodic review process, said that Gabon, by engaging in that rigorous evaluation 
mechanism, was contributing to the effectiveness of the United Nations in protecting 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. Gabon had prepared its report in consultation with governmental and civil society 
organizations under a participatory and inclusive national process. The participation of the 
National Human Rights Commission had been significant. With the support of the United 
Nations Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa, preparatory meetings 
had been organized in April and May 2012. National civil society organizations, trade 
unions and religious and ideological associations had had the opportunity to express their 
opinions on the recommendations submitted to Gabon in 2008, and their input had been 
taken into account in finalizing the national report. Gabon pledged to include civil society 
in its action and to turn to the National Human Rights Commission not only for the 
preparation of national reports but also for other activities related to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation noted that human rights were highly valued in Gabon and that 
respect for them was the cornerstone of democracy. In addition to the Constitution, which 
recognized and guaranteed the inviolability and imprescriptibility of human rights, Gabon </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.12-18722 
</p>
<p>had a legal framework and action plans to cover all universally recognized fundamental 
rights. In order to promote and protect human rights, in 2012 Gabon had established the 
Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Relations with Constitutional Institutions. The 
National Human Rights Commission, which had been operational since 2011, had a 
monitoring, educational and proactive role in relation to the public authorities and citizens. 
Its independence was recognized and its operating procedures had gradually been 
improved.  
</p>
<p>8. The delegation emphasized that the national report concentrated on the 
recommendations made by 22 States in 2008. Progress had been noted in the areas 
described below.  
</p>
<p>9. Five United Nations international legal instruments had been signed, ratified and/or 
implemented, as indicated in chapter II of the report. 
</p>

and for its vote in favour of the adoption of the General Assembly resolution calling for a 
moratorium on the death penalty. Belgium expressed concern about the increase in ritual 
killings, most often of children, and frequently left unpunished. Belgium highlighted that 
domestic rape is not part of any legal domestic provisions. Belgium made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Benin welcomed progress made in the strengthening of the rule of law, human rights 
and democracy. It noted with satisfaction the entry into force, in 2010, of legislation 
abolishing the death penalty and encouraged Gabon to take the necessary measures towards 
the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Benin invited the international community to support Gabon in its efforts 
towards the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. Brazil welcomed Gabon&#8217;s progress in its human development index, the abolition of 
the death penalty, and the inclusion in its Code of Criminal Procedure of a section on

measures to promote conditions in which journalists could operate freely, in compliance 
with the rights to freedom of expression and of the press. Canada commended Gabon for its 
efforts to advance the status of women, including the adoption of a national strategy in 
2010. Canada remained concerned at reports that domestic violence was widespread and 
that cases of rape are rarely prosecuted. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>as for example the abolition of the death penalty. Cape Verde remained convinced that the

rights by its population and the reduction of social disparities. Cape Verde made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>27. Chad noted with satisfaction the inclusive and participative elaboration of the 
national report of Gabon, as well as the acceptance by Gabon of 30 recommendations from 
its first review under the universal periodic review mechanism. It further noted that Gabon

provides to human rights. Chad made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>28. Chile appreciated Gabon&#8217;s willingness to implement the recommendations and 
voluntary commitments made during its first review under the universal periodic review 
mechanism. It highlighted in particular the process of political and socio-economic reforms,

</p>
<p>29. China commended Gabon on its achievements in human rights in the areas of gender 
equality, advancing women&#8217;s social status and eliminating discrimination against women,

discrimination against women. It also noted efforts made to reinforce the normative 
framework and procedures to address the problem of children victims of trafficking, efforts 
in the area of education as well as to provide free medical care to persons living with 
HIV/AIDS. The Congo further praised Gabon for its actions towards the abolition of the 
death penalty, the adoption of legislation on the rights of minorities, the ratification of the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
31. Costa Rica commended Gabon for its progress made, highlighting in particular the 
adhesion of Gabon to CPED, the ratification of the Rome Statute of ICC and the ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to CAT (OP-CAT), among other measures. It also welcomed 
Gabon&#8217;s decision to abolish the death penalty, and progress made in the area of gender 
equality and reforms introduced to the National Human Rights Commission to harmonized 
its functioning with the Paris Principles, encouraging Gabon to seek the accreditation of the 
institution. Costa Rica made recommendations.

minority children. Iraq made recommendations. 
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.12-18722 
</p>
<p>children and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education to visit the country. Latvia 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. Malaysia was encouraged to note progress made in the implementation of 
recommendations from the first review of Gabon, in particular in the areas of health, 
education, women and children, and social, political and human development. It was 
encouraged by the ratification of a number of international human rights instruments and

</p>
<p>46. Mauritania commended Gabon for its engagement in the promotion and protection

promotion of human rights with the assistance of the international community. 
</p>
<p>47. Mexico recognized legislative measures undertaken to prevent the trafficking and 
sale of children, the promotion of the inclusion of diverse ethnic groups in decision-making 
positions and to abolish the death penalty. It commended recent progress and the 
implementation of recommendations from the first review, as well as the establishment of 
the National Human Rights Commission. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. The delegation said that Gabon could not be held responsible for child trafficking 
since that practice had no part in the country&#8217;s traditions and culture. However, other 
countries did use Gabon for child trafficking. Gabon considered trafficking in persons to be 
a violation of human rights and strongly condemned slavery. Gabon continued to cooperate 
with the Human Rights Council and had received a visit from the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, from 14 to 18 May 2012, so that she 
learn about the measures taken in terms of prevention, cooperation at borders, security, 
identity checks, victim protection, the return of victims, investigations and prosecutions. 
The delegation stressed that Gabon welcomed immigrants and condemned child trafficking. 
</p>
<p>49.  With regard to freedom of the press, Gabon ensured that the press enjoyed freedom 
of expression and was aware that such freedom was essential to any democracy. 
Democracy as practised in Gabon was open to the discussion of ideas, clashes of opinion 
and a variety of points of view. The Constitution protected the freedom of the press, 
provided that public order was upheld.  
</p>
<p>50. Ritual crimes were not recognized as offences in Gabon&#8217;s criminal legislation. In 
one year, Gabon had made considerable efforts to organize mobile court hearings to unearth 
cases dating back to the 1980s and to try all murders and similar crimes. The exercise 
would be continued in November 2012.  
</p>
<p>51.  Gabon had introduced stiffer penalties for the crime of marital rape, which 
primarily affected women, in order to deter offenders.  
</p>
<p>52. Regarding forced marriage, Gabon recognized that traditional marriages had no legal 
value. The recommendations made to Gabon in 2008 referred mainly to sex discrimination. 
Gabon prohibited discrimination in general, particularly discrimination related to sex, and 
had taken appropriate measures, including legislative measures, to guarantee women&#8217;s 
exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal footing 
with men. It was in that spirit that, with the Sylvia Bongo Ondimba Foundation for the 
Family, Gabon had launched a project aimed at legalizing traditional marriages. The 
objective was to pass legislation on traditional marriage that would enable women, who 
were so often neglected by tradition, to fully enjoy their inherent dignity.  </p>


<p>GE.12-18722 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>53. Regarding human rights in prisons, Gabon guaranteed prisoners&#8217; rights to life, health 
and education, among others; any violation of their rights was severely punished.  
</p>
<p>54. Regarding juvenile courts, the law establishing legal regulations for the protection of 
minors was in force. The juvenile justice system was operational and protective measures 
were in place to ensure the rehabilitation and social reintegration of minors. Furthermore, 
Gabon had started to provide education for minors in detention. 
</p>
<p>55. In conformity with United Nations rules, more prisons would be built in the near 
future and more minors would be separated from adults. Juvenile courts had been 
established; training courses were provided for detainees; the National Committee on 
Education and Vocational Training in Prisons was operational; and training courses on the 
regulations prohibiting and punishing the use of torture were organized for security officers.  
</p>
<p>56. Regarding the rights of minorities, Gabon took into account the rights of the 
Pygmies on the same basis as those of all other population groups. The Pygmies were 
closely attached to their environment. The delegation pointed out that leprosy no longer 
existed in Gabon and that the Pygmies were knowledgeable about plants which kept them 
in good health.  
</p>
<p>57. With regard to health, Gabon had put in place a new mechanism: a national health 
insurance and social security fund, which symbolized national solidarity and mutualisation. 
Staff of the national fund had criss-crossed the country to register the country&#8217;s poor, who 
could not afford health care. Henceforth, those with more resources paid to help the most 
needy.   
</p>
<p>58. The delegation emphasized that the President of the Republic had placed 
environmental protection at the top of his agenda and had set up a climate change 
programme. Gabon had 13 national parks, which covered a third of the country, and 
considerable efforts had been made to protect the environment. Moreover, some high-
ranking officials had been imprisoned for poaching. A number of countries had 
congratulated Gabon on its efforts to protect the environment.  
</p>
<p>59. The delegation of Gabon reiterated that the observations made during the discussion 
should enable it to progress with the consolidation of the rule of law. The observations 
would be recorded so that the necessary action could be taken and so that, during the next 
review, Gabon could report on other measures taken. 
</p>

<p><b>10</b> GE.12-18722 
</p>
<p>63. Nigeria noted with satisfaction policies put in place by the Government to improve 
the quality of citizens&#8217; lives and protect their fundamental freedoms and rights. It urged 
Gabon to do more to protect the rights of migrants and refugees following reports by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of humiliating treatment 
meted out to some refugees. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway highlighted a number of areas for improvement, such as freedom of 
expression, human trafficking, gender equality and protection mechanisms for victims of 
contemporary slavery, forced labour, sex trafficking and trafficking in organs and other 
body parts. It was concerned that children were being targeted in Gabon for human 
trafficking. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Palestine welcomed the adoption of legislation on preventing child trafficking and 
the United Nations Plan of Action (2005&#8211;2009) for the World Programme on Human 
Rights Education. It commended Gabon on pursuing a more practical policy to combat 
discrimination against women trying to increase public awareness of the conventions it had 
ratified. Palestine made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>66. The Philippines commended Gabon on the ratification of international human rights 
instruments and the adoption of a national strategy on equality and gender. It was

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Portugal particularly welcomed the abolition of the death penalty, but acknowledged 
that there were a number of remaining challenges, not least addressing trafficking in 
persons. It asked what further steps would be taken to fully implement the recently adopted 
legislation to combat the scourge. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. The Republic of Moldova saluted progress made on gender equality, especially in 
the areas of women&#8217;s access to health, education and employment. It welcomed the 
development of new policies and legislation to protect children and improvements in 
legislation to help prevent the trafficking and financial exploitation of children. The 
Republic of Moldova made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Rwanda commended Gabon on advances in human rights, particularly the abolition 
of the death penalty, improving access to education and school attendance, and the 
establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. It recognized efforts to promote 
and protect women&#8217;s rights, especially regarding health, education and career opportunities 
in politics and public administration. Rwanda made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>70. Senegal noted Gabon&#8217;s ongoing commitment to promoting and protecting human 
rights and its efforts to ensure greater protection for vulnerable persons, especially women 
and children, by improving access to health and education and ensuring women&#8217;s 
participation in political life. The National Human Rights Commission would help 
strengthen the general human rights framework. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Singapore noted that Gabon had made good progress in several areas such as raising 
school attendance and reducing infant and maternal mortality. It considered education to be 
the key to promoting economic and social development and the better enjoyment of human 
rights and welcomed the Government&#8217;s emphasis on building its human capital. Singapore 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Slovakia commended Gabon on the abolition of the death penalty and welcomed its

human dignity, and emphasized that the concerns put forward were shared by the Gabonese 
Government. </p>


<p>GE.12-18722 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>92. The delegation pointed out that the gender approach had not been discounted; for 
example, there were four women generals in the security and defence forces. Efforts were 
being made to achieve gender equality and prevent gender discrimination. Gabon had set up 
the Observatory for Women&#8217;s Rights and Parity to protect the rights of women, families 
and children. Since 25 January 2010, Gabon had been working to enhance women&#8217;s skills 
and strengthen organizations led by women. Training on microcredit had been provided for 
several women running associations and groups. The President of the Republic had recently 
asked the Government to establish mechanisms to systematically use performance-based 
assessments of Gabonese managers, especially women managers.  
</p>
<p>93. The delegation said that civil society played a dynamic, influential and proactive 
role in Gabon. Civil society sometimes overstepped the mark and got involved in politics, 
but it also served as a barometer and stimulus. The Government spokesperson said she was 
attentive to civil society and the Government took notice when it sounded the alarm.  
</p>
<p>94. The press was free in Gabon, where freedom was supported, not stifled. Insults and 
incitement to ethnic hatred were not human rights. Gabon was a haven of peace, and 
recognized as such in the international arena and in the subregion. It had not experienced 
war; peace was a precious gift that the President of the Republic had inherited from his 
predecessors and wished to perpetuate. Using journalists to incite ethnic hatred, insults and 
war was beyond the pale, and the press was not censored in Gabon except in such cases. 
The delegation noted that Gabon had recently revised its Media Code, which 
decriminalized press offences.  
</p>
<p>95. Gabon had signed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in December 2004, and its ratification 
was the subject of a nationwide debate. Gabon&#8217;s legal framework guaranteed the 
fundamental rights of all migrant workers and members of their families. Indeed, Gabon 
welcomed people from Africa and from across the world. It was an essentially hospitable 
country. The Government was particularly attentive to the outcomes of national and 
regional discussions on the free movement of persons and goods within the Central African 
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The rights of entry to and residence in 
Gabon, the right to exercise an occupation and the rights to family reunification, access to 
the courts, health care, education and housing were all guaranteed to migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>96. The delegation said that indigenous peoples represented 1 per cent of the Gabonese 
population. Under the Constitution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Gabon was 
committed to protecting indigenous peoples, who were a source of cultural and intellectual 
riches. Gabon was doing all it could to promote the integration of the Pygmies.  
</p>
<p>97. As far as education was concerned, the delegation pointed out that Gabon had 
adopted the action plan of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, which 
focused on national school systems. In Gabon, education was open to all children without 
distinction and was compulsory between the ages of 6 and 16. The figures for the various 
education levels in 2010 were: (i) <i>Preschool</i>: there was capacity for 11,230 pupils in 445 
classrooms; following the recommendations received in 2008, the Government had 
launched a project to build and equip a further 1,500 classrooms and 14 preschools; (ii) 
<i>Primary</i>: there were 1,447 schools; (iii) <i>Secondary</i>: there was capacity for 148,556 students 
in 128 schools; the Government had recently launched a project to build eight junior and 
five senior high schools; (iv) <i>Higher education</i>: there was capacity for 20,803 students, in 
three large State universities comprising three faculties, and in three <i>grandes &#233;coles</i> 
(university-level institutions with competitive entrance examinations) and four institutes. 
The Government had also launched a project to increase capacity in the three universities 
and two of the <i>grandes &#233;coles</i>.  </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.12-18722 
</p>
<p>98. With regard to prison conditions, the delegation said that medical staff provided 
prisoners with at least primary care and transport by ambulance to hospital, but such staff 
were poorly trained and in short supply. In terms of prison security, a capacity-building 
programme for prison officers to improve the supervision of prisoners ran throughout the 
year. Prisoners were free to practise their religion and family visits were authorized. 
Prisoners could also submit uncensored written complaints to the judicial authorities and 
call for inquiries into their living conditions. The Government had introduced independent 
monitoring of prison conditions by organizations like the International Committee of the 
Red Cross and the NGO Cri de Femmes. 
</p>
<p>99. With regard to child trafficking, Gabon had adopted the National Procedural Manual 
for Assisting Trafficking Victims. In 2008, in accordance with Act No. 09/2004, Gabon had 
hosted a regional conference on child trafficking organized by OHCHR in collaboration 
with the Economic Community of Central African States. Gabon had established four 
reception centres in Libreville and one in Port-Gentil to combat violence against children 
and to protect child victims of cross-border trafficking and domestic abuse. Mechanisms to 
prevent trafficking were in place across the country, in the form of a national committee 
and provincial committees.  
</p>
<p>100. Two special branches of the police were responsible for protecting child victims of 
trafficking &#8212; who were not Gabonese &#8212; and a national observatory for children&#8217;s rights 
had been set up. Gabon had ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The security services and the criminal 
investigation police carried out targeted operations against trafficking and exploitation. 
Moreover, a child protection code had been adopted and a law specifically criminalizing 
violence in the home, schools and institutions was in the process of being adopted.
