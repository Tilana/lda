Petro Matad Limited
('Petro Matad' or the 'Company')
Interim results for the six months ended 30
June 2016
LONDON, 26 August 2016: Petro Matad
Limited, the AIM quoted Mongolian oil
explorer, is pleased to announce its
unaudited interim results for the six months
ended 30 June 2016.
Financial Summary
The Group posted a profit of USD 0.1 million
for the six-month period ended 30 June
2016, which compares to a loss of USD 1.74
million for the comparable period in 2015.
The profit recorded reflects cash calls
received in 2016 from BG Group (Shell) to
fund operations under the farm-out
agreement prior to receipt of BG Group's
exit notice. The Company's cash balance at
30 June 2016 was $0.49 million, which
compares to a cash balance of $2.51 million
on 30 June 2015.
As reported in the announcement of 11
August 2016, $10,005,303 has been received
from Shell's affiliate, BG Mongolian
Holdings Limited (BGMH) and a further $5
million is payable upon Mongolian
Government approval of the reassignment
of BGMH's interest in Blocks IV and V to
Petro Matad. Following receipt of these
funds the Company will be in a position to
execute its exploration program for the next
twelve months.
Operational Update
As announced on 29 April 2016, BGMH issued an Exit Notice to the Company which formally
advised of their intention to relinquish their interests in Blocks IV and V. Upon receipt, the
Company commenced discussions with Shell/BGMH which ultimately resulted in an agreement
on exit payments to be made by BGMH, as summarized in the above Financial Summary. With
the exit payments provided by BGMH the Company will be able to continue with the previously
planned Block IV and V exploration programs.
Following the Company's acquisition of 1085 kms of 2D seismic in Block IV in the fourth quarter
of 2015, seismic operations were suspended for the winter. In May 2016, seismic operations
recommenced in Block IV with the acquisition of 174 kms of 2D "infill" seismic. These lines were
acquired to better define leads identified during the acquisition program in Block IV in late 2015.
The combined seismic acquisition from Block IV has been processed and is currently being
interpreted. The Company is encouraged by results to date, and has already identified a series of
leads. The Company is confident that a number of drill-ready prospects will emerge.
Following completion of the Block IV program, a 2D seismic acquisition program commenced in
early June 2016 in Block V consisting of 402 km, of which 245 km have now been acquired. Due
to dynamite quality issues the program was suspended in early July. The seismic contractor is in
process of acquiring new dynamite charges and the remainder of the program is expected to be
acquired during September and October 2016. The remaining seismic program is aimed at de-
risking leads and defining a potential drill location in Block V. Processing of data acquired to date
is underway and interpretation and prospect generation is progressing.
The leads inventory of both Blocks IV and V will be peer reviewed and qualified prospects will be
high-graded to drill-ready status prior to exploration drilling, expected in mid-2017. Further details
on the planned exploration program will be announced once specific drill locations have been
chosen.
Scouting information suggests that there are several rigs within Mongolia that are capable of
drilling exploration wells to the depths that the Company will be targeting. Well engineering and
preparation of the rig tender documentation are in process and the Company expects to issue its
drilling tender before the end of 2016.
Further operational updates will be provided in due course.

1.   CORPORATE INFORMATION
The financial report covers the consolidated entity of Petro Matad Limited and its controlled
entities.
Petro Matad Limited, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man on 30 August 2007 has four
wholly owned subsidiaries, including Capcorp Mongolia LLC and Petro Matad LLC (both
incorporated in Mongolia), Central Asian Petroleum Corporation Limited ("Capcorp") and
Petromatad Invest Limited (both incorporated in the Cayman Islands).  Its majority shareholder is
Petrovis Matad Inc.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The half-year financial report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included within
the annual financial report and therefore cannot be expected to provide as full an understanding
of the financial performance, financial position and financing and investing activities of the
consolidated entity as the full financial report.
The half-year financial report should be read in conjunction with the annual Financial Report of
Petro Matad Limited as at 31 December 2015. The half-year consolidated financial statements
have been prepared using the same accounting policies as used in the annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
It is also recommended that the half-year financial report is considered together with any public
announcements made by Petro Matad Limited and its controlled entities during the half-year
ended 30 June 2016.
(a)      Basis of Preparation
The half-year consolidated financial report is a general purpose financial report, which has been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). The half-year
financial report has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except where stated.
The financial report is presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest
thousand dollars ($'000).
For the purpose of preparing the half-year financial report, the half-year has been treated as a
discrete reporting period.
(b)      Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as at 31
December each year.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  Control exists when the Group has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities.  In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or
convertible are taken into account.  The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies. Adjustments are made to bring into line any
dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control is
accounted for as an equity transaction.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group
transactions, have been eliminated in full.  Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot
be recovered.

The following reflects the income and share data used in the total operations basic and diluted
earnings/(loss) per share computations:
Basic earnings/(loss) per share
Total basic earnings/(loss) per share (US$ cents per share) (note a)
 
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share
Total diluted earnings/(loss) per share (US$ cents per share) (note b)
 
(a)  Basic earnings/(loss) per share
The profit/(loss) and weighted average number of ordinary shares used in
the calculation of basic loss per share are as follows:
 
Net profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders (US$'000)
 
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic
earnings per share ('000)

Share Options and Conditional Share Awards could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the
future, however they have been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because
they are anti-dilutive for both years presented.
6.   EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE
On 1 August 2016, the Company announced that agreement had been reached with Shell
regarding the amount of exit payment to be paid to CapCorp. Under the terms of the agreement,
Shell's affiliate (BGMH) was to pay an initial exit amount of $10,005,303 as stipulated by the
Farmout Agreement and would pay a further $5,000,000 upon completion of requisite
government approvals in relation to the reassignment of BGMH's 78% working interest to
CapCorp. This further amount of $5,000,000 is refundable to BGMH, should CapCorp secure a
partner for any of the two Blocks during the exploration period or any extension of exploration
period. Any farmout entered into by CapCorp with a third-party company will be at Capcorp's
discretion.
On 11 August 2016, the Company announced that the initial exit payment of $10,005,303 was
received from BGMH.
