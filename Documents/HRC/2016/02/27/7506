<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session

29 April 2014. The delegation of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was headed by Mr. Gn&#233;n&#233;ma Mamadou 
Coulibaly. At its 10th meeting, held on 2 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report 
on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>

rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire: Argentina, Botswana and

</p>

</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire through 
the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review 
(UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the Ivorian delegation said that his country&#8217;s national report had been 
submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
16/21. The report had been prepared by a national universal periodic review team, the 
inherent difficulties faced by any administration emerging from a crisis notwithstanding. 
The results obtained had been extensively consolidated and shared with Ivorian civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>6. Structured around 13 main points, the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire report could be summarized in 
three themes: the development of the normative and institutional framework; follow-up to 
and implementation of the recommendations and commitments arising from the universal 
periodic review; and the expectations of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in terms of capacity-building and 
technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>7. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had made efforts to bring its legal provisions into line with 
international standards. The Ivorian authorities had taken many steps to strengthen the 
national normative and institutional framework by adopting a number of laws and 
establishing operational structures. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-07583 
</p>
<p>8. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had adopted the law on the insertion of article 85 bis into title VI of 
the Constitution and on the International Criminal Court; the law on the establishment, 
remit, organization and operation of the National Human Rights Commission of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire in accordance with the Paris Principles; the law on marriage, whose objective was 
to create de facto and de jure equality in Ivorian households; the law to amend the 
Nationality Code in relation to the procedure for acquiring nationality by marriage; 
particular provisions concerning the acquisition of nationality by declaration; the law on 
rural landownership; and the bill on sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>9. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had established several operational structures, including the 
Commission against Gender-Based Violence, the National Commission for the Family and 
the National Social Cohesion Programme. 
</p>
<p>10. In March 2012, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had adopted the National Development Plan, a 
unifying framework for the implementation of all national development policies, structured 
around six areas: defence, security, justice and the rule of law; education, health, 
employment and social affairs; economy, agriculture and the private sector; infrastructure, 
water, energy and mines; environment, quality of life and habitat, public services; and 
culture, youth and sport. 
</p>
<p>11. The national policy for the promotion and protection of human rights, introduced by 
the Ivorian Government in 2011, was monitored by the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights 
and Civil Liberties. A bill on the protection of human rights defenders had been drafted in 
cooperation with civil society and adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 2013. 
</p>
<p>12. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had made progress by acceding to the 1954 Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in 
October 2013; to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict in March 2012; and to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 
January 2012. 
</p>
<p>13. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in March 2012, and the amendment to 
the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes 
and Their Disposal in September 2013. 
</p>
<p>14. During the previous universal periodic review, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had received 147 
recommendations. It had accepted 108 of them, expressed reservations or observations in 
relation to 37 and rejected 2. Despite the many crises it had gone through, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had 
spared no effort in ensuring that it implemented a large proportion of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>15. The recommendations regarding the country&#8217;s political situation and overcoming the 
crisis had been implemented fully, as was demonstrated by the adoption of the following 
measures: the organization of elections in the aftermath of the crisis in accordance with the 
Ouagadougou Agreement, the redeployment of the administration across the entire national 
territory, the establishment of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration 
authority, the establishment of the new National Human Rights Commission in line with 
the Paris Principles, the creation of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 
the ratification of the Rome Statute and full cooperation with the International Criminal 
Court, the establishment of a national post-crisis commission of inquiry, the establishment 
of a special investigation unit, the introduction of human rights and citizenship education 
into curricula, and the adoption of a national strategy on sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>16. The recommendations being implemented were primarily related to the progressive 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights. The Ivorian people welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s efforts in many development sectors, such as health, through the </p>


<p>GE.14-07583 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>refurbishment, construction and fitting out of health facilities, the provision of free medical 
care for mothers and children, and specific programmes to combat pandemics (AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria, etc.); education, through the refurbishment of the 5 public 
universities, the construction and refurbishment of 4,478 primary- and secondary-school 
classrooms, the recruitment, as an exceptional measure, of 8,000 teachers, the introduction 
of school canteens and the distribution of 6,880,600 textbooks and 5,762,334 school kits 
that had enabled more than 90 per cent of students enrolled in primary school to take 
advantage of free education; and road infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>17. Ivorians also welcomed the increase in the minimum wage, from 35,000 CFA francs 
(70 dollars) to 60,000 CFA francs (120 dollars). Similarly, State workers had received a 
salary increase in January 2014. 
</p>
<p>18. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was determined to implement the recommendations of the universal 
periodic review. However, because of a lack of resources, it had not been able to fully 
implement them given other priorities in the aftermath of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>19. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was presenting its needs in the area of the promotion and protection of 
human rights to the whole international community. Countries such as C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
emerging from crisis, faced huge difficulties in guaranteeing their citizens full enjoyment of 
their human rights. For that reason, the United Nations, so as to encourage international 
solidarity among its members, made available a variety of mechanisms to support 
requesting States. 
</p>
<p>20. It was incumbent on States to ensure the promotion and respect of the human rights 
of their citizens.  
</p>
<p>21. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, mindful of that fundamental task but also of its current limitations, 
wished to make a solemn appeal to the entire United Nations system as well as to 
multilateral and bilateral partners to support its efforts in seven priority areas: 
peacebuilding; treaty body reports; combating violence against women and improving their 
living conditions; improving prison policy; adopting a national human rights policy; and 
working towards national reconciliation. 
</p>

welcomed the relevant and very useful contributions by the States parties aimed at 
strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He also 
responded to two of the questions raised. 
</p>
<p>69. In response to the question of Montenegro with regard to the level of cooperation 
between C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the International Criminal Court since the ratification of the 
Rome Statute, he said that there was good cooperation. A cooperation agreement had been 
in place since before the ratification, and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was prepared to cooperate with the 
Court. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to combating impunity, he said that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was working towards 
achieving zero impunity. The Ivorian Government was aware that impunity was at the root 
of serious abuses and violations in the aftermath of the 2010 post-election crisis. The 
perpetrators of acts liable to criminal prosecution would be brought to justice. 
</p><p>71. With regard to the measures taken in relation to polygamy and early marriage, he 
said that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had a system of monogamy and that polygamy was considered an 
offence. The legal age for marriage was set in legislation, and any derogation from that was 
punishable by law.  
</p>
<p>72. In response to the statement by Luxembourg concerning the trivialization of 
violence and the culture of impunity, he said that sexual violence could not be trivialized in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. No country could experience peace if it did not punish such behaviour. C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire strove to combat all forms of violation and impunity. All acts brought to the 
attention of the authorities were prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>73. In response to the questions submitted in advance, particularly those concerning the 
submission of reports to the treaty bodies, he emphasized that, since the end of the post-
election crisis, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had undertaken to prepare its reports to the human rights treaty 
bodies within the requested deadlines. Operational departments in the various ministries 
had been entrusted with the task. 
</p>
<p>74. However, the Government was in the process of reactivating the decree on the 
establishment of a committee to monitor implementation of international human rights 
instruments. That committee would, among other tasks, prepare the summary and periodic 
reports of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to the relevant bodies of the United Nations and the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-07583 
</p>
<p>75. With regard to the ratification of international human rights instruments, the head of 
the delegation said that there were no obstacles to the ratification of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance or the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
abolition of the death penalty. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was a party to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, article 6 of which suggested abolishing the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>76. As for the harmonization of national legislation with international standards, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire intended to address shortcomings in relation to rape as part of its reform of the 
standard codes. However, it should be borne in mind that articles 354 and 356 of the 
Ivorian Criminal Code criminalized rape and sexual harassment. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had ratified 
the Rome Statute on 15 February 2013. 
</p>
<p>77. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had signed the bilateral immunity agreements on 30 June 2003 and 
planned to ratify the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International 
Criminal Court and implement the Rome Statute in national law.  
</p>
<p>78. Rwanda applauded the creation of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation
