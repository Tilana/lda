<p><b>  27</b>/&#8230;  <b>Preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of 
 age as a human rights concern 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the standard 
</p>
<p>in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, and bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Optional Protocols thereto, as well as other human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 24/11 of 26 September 2013 on 
</p>
<p>preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age as a human rights 
</p>
<p>concern, as well as all other relevant resolutions on the rights of the child of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, and recognizing the need to ensure the full and effective enjoyment by all of 
</p>
<p>their human rights, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the right of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their 
</p>
<p>health and well-being, which is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>and the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
</p>
<p>mental health, as enshrined in the International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights as well as in the Convention on the Rights of the Child,  
</p>

<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that more than 6,300,000 children1 under 5 years of age die each 
</p>
<p>year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate or lack of access to 
</p>
<p>integrated and quality maternal, newborn and child health care and services, early 
</p>
<p>childbearing, as well as to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p>safe and adequate food and nutrition, and that mortality remains highest among children 
</p>
<p>belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that a human rights-based approach to reduce and eliminate preventable 
</p>
<p>child mortality and morbidity is an approach underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>equality and non-discrimination, participation, sustainability, transparency, the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the child, international cooperation and accountability;  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States should take all appropriate measures to ensure the right of 
</p>
<p>the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</p>
<p>without discrimination of any kind and, in doing so, be guided by the best interests of the 
</p>
<p>child, ensuring the meaningful participation of children, consistent with their evolving 
</p>
<p>capacities, in all matters and decisions affecting their lives, bearing in mind the rights, 
</p>
<p>duties and responsibilities of parents or caregivers in relation to preventing mortality and 
</p>
<p>morbidity of children under 5 years of age, and take steps to ensure the allocation of 
</p>
<p>available resources to the maximum extent possible to achieve the full realization of the 
</p>
<p>right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health, including by strengthening 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in this field, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the commitments made by States to make every effort to accelerate 
</p>
<p>the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal 4, to reduce by two thirds the under-5 mortality rate by 2015, Goal 5, to 
</p>
<p>improve maternal health, and Goal 6, to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and 
</p>
<p>the need to take into account preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years 
</p>
<p>of age in the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the work done by the United Nations and its specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>programmes and funds in relation to the reduction and elimination of preventable mortality 
</p>
<p>and morbidity of children under 5 years of age, and in that regard welcoming the Global 
</p>
<p>Strategy for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health launched by the Secretary-General, and the 
</p>
<p>related establishment of the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>and Children&#8217;s Health and the Independent Expert Review Group on Information and 
</p>
<p>Accountability for Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Health, the action plan &#8220;Every Newborn: an 
</p>
<p>action plan to end preventable deaths&#8221; endorsed by the World Health Assembly , and the 
</p>
