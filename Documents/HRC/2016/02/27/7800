<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of Colombia was held at the 4th meeting on 23 April 
</p><p>2013. The delegation of Colombia was headed by Vice-President Angelino Garz&#243;n. At its 
10th meeting, held on 26 April 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Colombia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Colombia: Ecuador, Gabon and India. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of

Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Colombia through the troika. These questions are

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Vice-President of Colombia began his presentation by noting that the 
Government attended the second UPR review to report on the follow-up to the 
commitments made and recommendations received in December 2008. In response to 
recommendations regarding peace, the Government recognized the existence of an internal 
armed conflict and promoted the adoption of the Victims and Land Restitution Law. With 
the help of Norway and Cuba and the accompaniment of the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela and Chile, President Santos had initiated a dialogue with representatives of the 
guerrilla army of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia &#8211; People&#8217;s Army]. 
The Government had the will to pursue dialogue; however, a will on the part of the FARC 
was also necessary. 
</p>
<p>6. The Government respected and protected the work of human rights defenders, 
including trade union leaders, as a State policy. The mechanisms of protection of human 
rights defenders, trade union leaders, victims of the armed conflict, communities of African 
descent, indigenous peoples, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and 
intersex (LGBTI) community and women had improved. 
</p>
<p>7. At the same time, the delegation recognized that there were still human rights 
challenges to overcome, such as lack of social equality, impunity, prison overcrowding, the 
need for greater protection for some human rights defenders and the signature of a peace 
agreement. </p>


<p>8. The Vice-President announced that the Government had taken a unilateral decision 
to extend for three years the mandate of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. Also, the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights had taken the decision to remove Colombia from the list of countries under 
permanent observation. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding indigenous peoples, for the first time ethnic minorities had been 
consulted on three instruments that guaranteed their rights: the National Development Plan, 
the national guarantee programme and the legislation regarding reparation and land 
restitution. Also, the Government had defined specific policies guaranteeing the rights of 
populations of African descent to a collective territory, self-government and autonomy in 
their decisions, as well as on specific health and education policies. The signing of the law 
on combating all forms of discrimination was just one example. 
</p>
<p>10. One of the promoters of International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 
No. 169, Colombia has been a pioneer in the right to prior consultation. In that connection, 
the Government had agreed with the OHCHR office in Colombia the establishment of a 
working group for the development of good practices on prior consultation. 
</p>
<p>11. For his part, the Deputy Attorney General stated that Colombia had the will and 
capacity to investigate and punish human rights violations. Its procedures were being 
strengthened to follow the model of international tribunals. Moreover, the International 
Criminal Court had considered the Attorney General&#8217;s Office as an example of positive 
complementarity. The strategy of investigating and prosecuting serious human rights 
violations had been changing and a new Unit of Analysis and Contexts had been 
established. 
</p>
<p>12. The security effort in the last decade had transformed the country. Colombians were 
more protected and lived more peacefully. A total of 87 per cent of the municipalities, 
comprising 86 per cent of the population, had not suffered a single act of terrorism in 2012. 
During the last decade, the homicide rate had been reduced by half and kidnappings by 95 
per cent. The delegation highlighted the policy that favored demobilization and captures 
over deaths in combat. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding military justice, Congress passed a constitutional amendment that 
excluded crimes against humanity, genocide, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial 
executions, sexual violence, torture and forced displacement from its jurisdiction and 
ordered that military justice should be independent, impartial and autonomous. The essence 
of the reform would enter into force only after Congress had deliberated on the law 
regulating the reform and once the Constitutional Court had reviewed the law. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding the administration of justice, the delegation explained that the State had 
committed to allocating US$ 1.11 billion over the next four years for the implementation of 
the new oral system, the promotion of the independence of the judiciary and the acquisition 
of new technologies for the judicial process. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation acknowledged that Colombia occupied the eighth place in Latin 
America in terms of prison overcrowding. To address this problem, the Government was 
implementing a plan to increase the capacity of prisons by 40 per cent over the next four 
years. 
</p>
<p>16. The core of the transitional justice system in Colombia was the rights of victims and 
the rights to truth, justice and reparation. The Victims and Land Restitution law was one of 
the tools for transitional justice. 
</p>
<p>17. Colombia had received recommendations requesting a reparations programme, even 
though the conflict had not ended. In response, a victims reparations unit, the Land 
Restitution Unit and the Center for Historical Memory had been established. Those three </p>


<p>institutions employed more than 2,000 officers trained to serve victims across the country 
with dignity and respect. 
</p>
<p>18. In one year of enforcement of the reparation measures, about 158,000 victims had 
been indemnified and over 100,000 victims had received a reparation plan. In the collective 
dimension, consultations with indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities were ongoing 
regarding over 70 processes of redress and safe and voluntary return with dignity. 
</p>
<p>19. The victims&#8217; policy could currently rely on accurate data. More than 1,000 
institutions exchanged disaggregated information, and more than 5 million victims, half of 
them women, were registered. 
</p>
<p>20. Colombia had allocated US$ 30 billion to implement this policy over the next 10 
years. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

commitment to extend the mandate of the OHCHR office in Colombia, it called for all 
aspects of the existing mandate to be extended. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>97. The Plurinational State of Bolivia welcomed the report submitted by Colombia, and 
in particular the achievements reported, and urged Colombia to continue its efforts in the 
field of human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>98. The delegation of Colombia explained that the victims law favored land restitution 
over land buy. By April 17, 12,000 hectares had been restituted to the original owners and, 
with regard to the territorial rights of ethnic communities, 150,000 hectares of land had 
been protected. A programme focused on facilitating access by women and girls to land 
restitution had been implemented. 
</p>
<p>99. The National Protection Unit, created in November 2011, currently was providing 
protection for 7,834 people, including 633 trade unionists, 559 human rights defenders, and 
490 land claimants, among others, particularly in remote and rural areas. The Unit&#8217;s budget 
for 2013 was expected to reach US$ 190 million, with particular emphasis on the protection </p>


<p>of victims and land restitution leaders. The delegation stressed that the Unit was not an 
intelligence agency; its sole purpose was the protection of life and human rights. 
</p>
<p>100. With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, poverty had fallen by 4.5 
percentage points in the last two years, reaching 32.7 per cent in 2012. During the same 
period, the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty fell by 1.9 percentage 
points, to 10.4 per cent. Additionally, the Government had achieved a reduction in 
inequality, thus bringing the country to the regional average and improving its position in 
the international ranking. The Government was committed to ensuring inclusion and social 
mobility for all Colombians. In November 2011, the Social Inclusion and Reconciliation 
Sector had been established. The Department for Social Prosperity led this sector. The 
flagship programme to fight poverty &#8211; More Families in Action &#8211; had benefited over 2.7 
million families. Additionally, the Government had launched a programme to build 100,000 
free houses intended for victims of violence, the poor and the vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>101. Unemployment in Colombia in 2012 stood at 10.4 per cent, the lowest level since 
2001, despite the international economic slowdown. 
</p>
<p>102. In the area of education, the delegation highlighted the introduction in 2012 of free 
universal education to the eleventh grade, which had benefited more than 8.5 million 
students. Also, dropouts had been reduced and the illiteracy rate of people between the ages 
of 15 and 24 had fallen. 
</p>
<p>103. The Colombian health system still faced enormous challenges. Nevertheless, the 
delegation noted that the entire population had guaranteed access to health care either 
through insurance or under the system in place for the uninsured poor population. 
</p>
<p>104. The State had made significant progress in the comprehensive protection of children. 
It had set up a single information system that facilitated monitoring of the progression of 
the rights of children. Also, investment in children had increased to up to US$ 9.8 billion in 
</p><p>2011. Malnutrition levels had decreased from 16 to 13.2 per cent, and the Government was 
committed to a comprehensive care strategy. In addition, children&#8217;s nutrition continued to 
improve. 
</p>
<p>105. The State had instituted programmes to reduce the risks associated with teen 
pregnancy, sexual violence, use of psychoactive substances, child labour and illegal 
recruitment by organized groups outside the law. The delegation noted that the State did not 
recruit minors. This violation of international humanitarian law was committed only by 
armed groups outside the law. 
</p>
<p>106. The Government recognized the impact that the armed conflict had on children. 
Since 1999, the Colombian Family Welfare Institute had provided 5,170 children with 
comprehensive support under a specialized programme for the care of children demobilized 
from armed groups outside the law. 
</p>
<p>107. With respect to indigenous peoples, the mechanisms for dialogue and consensus had 
been strengthened. Colombia had made significant progress in building its own systems of 
intercultural education and health care for indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, as 
well as methods of addressing issues of sexual violence and forced recruitment and 
combating impunity. However, Colombians continued to face structural and historical 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>108. Regarding dialogue with civil society and the National Plan of Action on Human 
Rights, the delegation noted the establishment, in 2011, of a National System and a 
National Conference on Human Rights. The system dealt with issues that had been 
identified in the Plan of Action, coordinated 63 public institutions, developed indicators of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and advanced other specific policies. For instance, in </p>


<p>2012, a Working Group on Business and Human Rights was established and a forum on 
free trade and human rights was convened. 
</p>
<p>109. Dialogue with civil society organizations had been strengthened within the 
framework of the National Human Rights Conference, convened by the Government, civil 
society and the international community. 
</p>
<p>110. Regarding women&#8217;s issues, in 2012 the Government adopted the Gender Equality 
Policy and the comprehensive plan to ensure women a life free of violence. The policy had 
a budget of nearly US$ 1.9 billion, and reflected international instruments such as Security 
Council resolutions 1325 and 1820. Recognizing the persistence of factors that hindered 
access to justice in cases of sexual violence, the State would continue to work on a strategy 
to strengthen prevention, comprehensive care for victims, effective investigation and 
prosecution of such acts. 
</p>
<p>111. In reference to the rights of the LGBTI community, the Government had included in 
the National Development Plan a mandate to design a public policy for that group. In that 
regard, the National Statistics Department had begun to establish a baseline profile of the 
LGBTI population. In the same vein, a committee to deal with urgent cases and receive 
complaints on human rights violations against members of the LGBTI community had been 
established in 2011. To date, more than 100 cases have been submitted for consideration by 
that mechanism. 
</p>
<p>112. The delegation also highlighted actions taken by the Government on the question of 
forced disappearances. The relevant institutions in Colombia had obtained some results in 
finding and identifying disappeared persons. During the first year of the current 
administration almost 10,000 human remains had been identified. In 2010 the Government 
had created a genetic data bank under the authority of the Attorney General. 
</p>
<p>113. In concluding, the delegation stated that the questions and recommendations 
received were fundamental to improving the human rights situation, achieving peace, 
overcoming hate and seeking forgiveness and reconciliation. The Vice-President 
highlighted those recommendations that requested the respect of trade unions as institutions 
of democracy, the advance of social dialogue and the end of employment intermediation. 
The Government shared the concerns expressed by some countries in the areas of corporate 
social responsibility, the situation of children and women, and discrimination against ethnic 
and other minorities. 
</p>
<p>114. The Vice-President announced that at the time of the adoption of the report of the 
second review of Colombia by the Working Group, the delegation would have ready 
written answers to the questions received during the interactive dialogue as well as the 
Government&#8217;s position on recommendations.
