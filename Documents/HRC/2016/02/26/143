<p> Summary </p>
<p> The present report consists of the analysis and conclusions of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the right to education following an official mission that he undertook to 
</p>
<p>Algeria, at the invitation of the Algerian Government, from 27 January to 3 February 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p> The realization of the right to education in Algeria has been remarkable in many 
</p>
<p>respects. The Government&#8217;s educational policies and programmes have yielded 
</p>
<p>positive results: school enrolment rates are excellent, education is provided free  of 
</p>
<p>charge at all levels and gender parity at all levels has been largely achieved. Algeria 
</p>
<p>accordingly has a very high rate of attainment of the Education for All goals and the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals, particularly goal two on universal primary educa tion 
</p>
<p>and goal three on gender parity in access to education. Furthermore, the infrastructure 
</p>
<p>for providing education is well in place.  
</p>
<p> Considerable budgetary resources are allocated to education in Algeria: it was 
</p>
<p>second only to national defence among national budgetary priorities, with 16 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the national budget, in 2014.  
</p>
<p> In 2003, reforms were undertaken with the aim of improving the quality of 
</p>
<p>education by overhauling teaching methods, improving the quality of teaching staff 
</p>
<p>and restructuring the school curriculum.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p> However, Algeria faces a number of challenges with respect to the realization of 
</p>
<p>the right to education. The main challenge the country faces is the quality of 
</p>
<p>education. The general standard of education needs to be raised as a ma tter of urgency. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the educational system is faced with high rates of school dropout and 
</p>
<p>grade repetition and classroom overcrowding. Enrolment rates are sometimes lower in 
</p>
<p>certain regions, in rural areas and in the poorest households. Ensuring equal 
</p>
<p>opportunities in access to education for children with disabilities is still a challenge for 
</p>
<p>the Government. It is also confronted with a perceptible decline in the teaching of 
</p>
<p>Tamazight. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, Algeria lacks the legal framework to guarantee that a minimum 
</p>
<p>proportion of the national budget is allocated to education. Lastly, the challenge of 
</p>
<p>strengthening and enhancing the social and cultural value of vocational education and 
</p>
<p>training is particularly acute. 
</p>
<p> At the end of the present report, the Special Rapporteur makes recommendations 
</p>
<p>designed to improve the realization of the right to education in Algeria.

</b></p>
<p><b> </b>I.<b> </b>Introduction<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, conducted an 
</p>
<p>official visit to Algeria from 27 January to 3 February 2015. The purpose of the visit 
</p>
<p>was to assess the implementation of the right to education in the country and the 
</p>
<p>achievements and progress made, as well as the impediments to the full realization of 
</p>
<p>this right. 
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the national authorities at 
</p>
<p>the highest level, including: the Minister of Education, the Minister of Higher 
</p>
<p>Education and Scientific Research, the Minister for Vocational Training, the Minister 
</p>
<p>of Youth and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was able to 
</p>
<p>hold discussions with senior officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and 
</p>
<p>Endowments (waqfs), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of National Solidarity, the 
</p>
<p>Family and the Status of Women, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour, 
</p>
<p>Employment and Social Security. The Special Rapporteur travelled to the wilaya of 
</p>
<p>Tipaza, where he met with local officials, including the Wali of this province.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with two parliamentary committees, of the 
</p>
<p>National People&#8217;s Assembly and the Council of the Nation, both of which are known 
</p>
<p>as the Committee on Education, Higher Education, Scientific Research and Religious 
</p>
<p>Affairs; with the President and members of the National Advisory Committee for the 
</p>
<p>Promotion and Protection of Human Rights; and with staff of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner on Amazigh Status and the National Office for Adult Literacy and 
</p>
<p>Education. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also visited institutions responsible for primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary education and technical and vocational training. For ins tance, in Algiers he 
</p>
<p>visited the Cheikh Bouamama primary and secondary schools, the Cheikh Sahnouni 
</p>
<p>Koranic School and the national institute specializing in vocational training at 
</p>
<p>Beaulieu. The Special Rapporteur also met the Rector of the University of Algiers 1. 
</p>
<p>At Tipaza, he visited a centre for children with mental disabilities in the Bou Ismail 
</p>
<p>community as well as a primary school in the rural area of Menaceur. During the 
</p>
<p>school visits, the Special Rapporteur spoke with teachers and pupils. He met wi th the 
</p>
<p>teachers at the Kouba Teacher Training College in Algiers. He met with civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and many other stakeholders, including the United Nations Resident 
</p>
<p>Coordinator and country team.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to convey his appreciation to the Government 
</p>
<p>of Algeria for its invitation as well as for its support and cooperation , both during the 
</p>
<p>preparations for the mission and during his visit. He would also like to thank the 
</p>
<p>authorities and everyone who agreed to meet with him. Lastly, he is particularly 
</p>
<p>grateful for the support he received from the United Nations Resident Coordinator and 
</p>
<p>country team in Algeria. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>II.<b> </b>Legal framework for the right to education in Algeria<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. The right to education is set out in the Constitution of the People&#8217;s Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Algeria of 1963, as amended in 2008. Under article 53 of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>the right to education is guaranteed, education is provided free of charge under 
</p>
<p>conditions set by law, primary school education is compulsory, the educational system 
</p>
<p>is organized by the Government and the Government ensures equality of access to 
</p>
<p>education and to vocational training.  </p>

<p> 
<b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>5/17 </b>GE. 15-10618 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. Algeria has ratified several international human rights instruments containing 
</p>
<p>provisions on the right to education. The treaties ratified by Algeria take precedence 
</p>
<p>over domestic law (article 132 of the Constitution). Thus, at the universal level, 
</p>
<p>Algeria is party to such instruments as the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
</p>
<p>Their Families. On the other hand, Algeria is not yet a party to the Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. At the regional 
</p>
<p>level, Algeria is a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples &#8217; Rights, the 
</p>
<p>African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Arab Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. The right to education is also governed by a body of legislation and regulations. 
</p>
<p>Legislation of note includes Act No. 08-04 of 23 January 2008, an Outline Act on 
</p>
<p>national education. The Outline Act places the pupil at the centre of educational policy 
</p>
<p>(art. 7) and assigns to schools, among other tasks, the role of providing an education 
</p>
<p>that is in harmony with the rights of the child and human rights and of developing a 
</p>
<p>culture of democracy by ensuring that pupils learn the principles of debate and 
</p>
<p>dialogue and how to accept the majority view, reject discrimination and violence and 
</p>
<p>give pride of place to discussion (art. 5). According to the provisions of the Outline 
</p>
<p>Act, the State guarantees the right to education to all Algerians , without discrimination 
</p>
<p>based on sex or social or geographic origin (art. 10). Education is obligatory for all 
</p>
<p>boys and girls from the ages of 6 to 16 years (art.  12) and it is free at all levels in all 
</p>
<p>national educational institutions in the public sector (art. 13). Equality of opportunity 
</p>
<p>is defined in article 11, which states that the right to education is given effect through 
</p>
<p>universal elementary education and by the guarantee of equal opportunities with 
</p>
<p>regard to conditions of schooling and continuation of studies after basic education. Act 
</p>
<p>No. 08-06 of 23 February 2008, which amends and updates Act No. 99-05 of 4 April 
</p>
<p>1999, the Outline Act on higher education, as well as Act No. 08-07 of 23 February 
</p>
<p>2008, an Outline Act on teacher training, are among the important laws on this subject. 
</p>
<p>School attendance of children with disabilities, which is enshrined in the Constitution 
</p>
<p>of Algeria, is also set out in the Outline Act on national education, No. 08-04 of 23 
</p>
<p>January 2008, article 14 of which stipulates that the Government must ensure that 
</p>
<p>children with special needs must benefit from the right to education and that the 
</p>
<p>national education sector, in liaison with hospitals and other establishments, must 
</p>
<p>ensure that appropriate pedagogical services are provided for schoolchildren with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and chronic illnesses and that they are fully integrated into the educational 
</p>
<p>system. 
</p>
<p>9. Many decrees and ministerial orders also contribute to  the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to education in Algeria, including: (a) order No. 05-07 of 23 August 2005, which 
</p>
<p>sets out the general rules regulating teaching in private educational and teaching 
</p>
<p>institutions; (b) Executive Decree No. 08-315 of 11 October 2008 on the special status 
</p>
<p>of civil servants in certain national educational sectors; (c) Executive Decree No. 08-
</p>
<p>287 of 17 September 2008, which sets out the conditions for establishing, organizing, 
</p>
<p>operating and supervising early childhood facilities and centres (for children aged 
</p>
<p>under 5 years); and (d) an interministerial decree of 13 March 2014, setting out the 
</p>
<p>measures for opening special classes for children with disabilities in educational 
</p>
<p>institutions and public teaching facilities within the national educational sector.  
</p>
<p>10. The existence of this legislation is a positive sign. The Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>with satisfaction that school pupils are placed at the heart of the 2008 Outline Act on 
</p>
<p>national education and that importance is accorded in the education system to human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE. 15-10618 <b>6/17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>rights, democracy and peace and to the values of respect for others and toleran ce. He 
</p>
<p>notes, however, the absence of legal provisions guaranteeing that the right to 
</p>
<p>education may be enforced and the fact that the Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has not been ratified. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>III.<b> </b>Institutional framework for the right to education in Algeria<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. Education is within the purview of several high-level State institutions. The main 
</p>
<p>governmental ministries responsible for education are the Ministry of National 
</p>
<p>Education, the Ministry of Vocational Training and Education and the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Higher Education and Scientific Research, each of which administers and manages the 
</p>
<p>sector under its authority according to a structure and modalities laid down in the 
</p>
<p>pertinent legal texts. Other ministries support the Government&#8217;s efforts to implement 
</p>
<p>the right to education. These include the Ministry of Religious Affairs and 
</p>
<p>Endowments (waqfs), which is responsible for promoting Islamic education and 
</p>
<p>culture, the Ministry of National Solidarity, the Family and the Status of Women, 
</p>
<p>responsible for the autonomy and educational, social and professional integration of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, the Ministry for Youth Affairs and the Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>12. In Parliament, educational matters are dealt with by two committees of the 
</p>
<p>National People&#8217;s Assembly and the Council of the Nation, both of which are known 
</p>
<p>as the Committee on Education, Higher Education, Scientific Research and Religious 
</p>
<p>Affairs. The National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights also helps to monitor the implementation of the right to education 
</p>
<p>throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>IV.<b> </b>Profile of the education system<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. The Algerian system of education focuses on the public sector, although 
</p>
<p>individuals and private-law entities are permitted to open private educational 
</p>
<p>institutions, subject to the approval of the Ministry of National Education. Private 
</p>
<p>educational institutions are required to follow the official Algerian curricula, but with 
</p>
<p>a window of three to five hours per week in which they can organize any other activity 
</p>
<p>not included in the official syllabus. Order No. 05-07 of 23 August 2005, which 
</p>
<p>establishes the general rules on education in private educational institutions, provides 
</p>
<p>a framework designed to ensure that education remains a public good and to safeguard 
</p>
<p>public interests in that area. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>National education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14. In accordance with article 27 of the Outline Act on national education of 2008, 
</p>
<p>the national education system is divided into the following levels: preschool 
</p>
<p>education; basic education, which consists of primary education and lower secondary 
</p>
<p>education; and general and technical secondary education. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>1.<b> </b>Preschool education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Preschool education, for children aged 5 to 6, is provided in preschools and 
</p>
<p>kindergartens and at classes for children offered in primary schools. Although 
</p>
<p>preschool education is not compulsory, the Government is working with other actors, 
</p>
<p>including the private sector, to make it more generally accessible,  in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the provisions of the Outline Act on national education of 2008. </p>

<p> 
<b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>7/17 </b>GE. 15-10618 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. Preschool provides a basic foundation for the child&#8217;s education and prepares 
</p>
<p>children for primary schooling by giving them learning opportunities and a chance to 
</p>
<p>develop their physical, intellectual, creative and social skills. It aims to foster the 
</p>
<p>development of their personalities, to awaken their sense of aesthetics and to develop 
</p>
<p>their sensory and motor skills; to instil good habits that prepare them for community 
</p>
<p>life; and introduce them to reading, writing and arithmetic.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Basic education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Basic education lasts nine years and comprises primary and lower secondary 
</p>
<p>school. It is the largest educational subsector, insofar as this stage of schooling is 
</p>
<p>compulsory for all children aged 6 to 16. Basic education provides all pupils with a 
</p>
<p>common educational foundation to give them the knowledge and essential skills that 
</p>
<p>will enable them to continue their schooling at the next level, to pursue vocational 
</p>
<p>education or training or to move towards employment.  
</p>
<p>18. Primary education lasts for five years and is taught in primary schools. 
</p>
<p>Completion of primary school is confirmed by a final exam enabling those who pass 
</p>
<p>to receive a certificate. Progression from primary school to lower secondary school is 
</p>
<p>based on the results of this exam and continuous assessments.  
</p>
<p>19. Lower secondary education, which lasts for four years, is provided in middle 
</p>
<p>schools. Completion of lower secondary education is confirmed by a final exam 
</p>
<p>enabling those who pass to receive a diploma called the lower secondary school 
</p>
<p>certificate (brevet d&#8217;enseignement moyen). Pupils in their fourth year of lower 
</p>
<p>secondary school who graduate go on to upper secondary education, according to their 
</p>
<p>abilities. Graduation from lower to upper secondary school is based on the results of 
</p>
<p>this exam and continuous assessments. Pupils who are not admitted to upper 
</p>
<p>secondary school may either pursue vocational training or seek employment once they 
</p>
<p>have reached the age of 16. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b>General and technical upper secondary education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Upper secondary education comprises general and technical upper secondary 
</p>
<p>education. It is provided in upper secondary schools and lasts for three years. The first 
</p>
<p>year consists of core curricula, divided into an arts branch and a science and 
</p>
<p>technology branch. Beginning in the second year, education is divided into a general 
</p>
<p>orientation and a technical orientation, linked by a bridging system allowing pupils to 
</p>
<p>reorient their studies. 
</p>
<p>21. The completion of general and technical upper secondary education is confirmed 
</p>
<p>by the upper secondary school certificate (baccalaur&#233;at de l&#8217;enseignement 
</p>
<p>secondaire). Pupils who earn this certificate may move on to higher education. Pupils 
</p>
<p>who do not do so may either pursue vocational training or seek employment.

<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Higher education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22. Higher education is regulated by Outline Act No. 08-06 of 23 February 2008, 
</p>
<p>which amends and updates Act No. 99-05 of 4 April 1999. Under the Act, higher 
</p>
<p>education is divided into three levels. The first culminates in a bachelor&#8217;s degree. It is 
</p>
<p>open to applicants who have received the upper secondary school certificate and is 
</p>
<p>intended to allow students to acquire, deepen and diversify their knowledge in 
</p>
<p>disciplines leading to various lines of work. The second level comprises academic 
</p>
<p>training and career-oriented training courses and culminates in a master&#8217;s degree. The 
</p>
<p>third level, which is research-based, leads to a doctorate. Higher education also 
</p>
<p>provides in-service and advanced training. Furthermore, under Act No. 99 -05, first and </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>GE. 15-10618 <b>8/17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>second-level higher education may be provided by private establishments. However, 
</p>
<p>there are no private universities in Algeria as yet. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that higher education is free in 
</p>
<p>Algeria, with minimal registration, meal and transport fees. Moreover, according to 
</p>
<p>the Government, nearly half of all students are guaranteed a spot in university 
</p>
<p>residence. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this development. He commends the 
</p>
<p>Government for the continuing education offered by some universities to persons who 
</p>
<p>have not followed a traditional path, including young persons who have not earned a 
</p>
<p>secondary school certificate. 
</p>
<p>24. According to the information received, Algeria has a student population of 
</p>
<p>1,330,000 out of 38 million inhabitants. Higher educational institutions nationwide 
</p>
<p>number 98 and consist of universities, university centres, national institutes and 
</p>
<p>grandes &#233;coles. Algeria has 47 universities, which have been established in most 
</p>
<p>wilayas, and 10 university centres. Under Act No. 99-05, university centres are higher 
</p>
<p>educational institutions that are set to become universities, in line with a number of 
</p>
<p>educational and scientific criteria. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government 
</p>
<p>for its efforts in providing higher education infrastructures. He urges the Government 
</p>
<p>to address a decline of standards at universities which was reported to him during his 
</p>
<p>visit. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Vocational education and training<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25. Vocational education and training in Algeria are governed by Act No. 0807 of 23 
</p>
<p>February 2008, establishing the Outline Act on vocational training and education. 
</p>
<p>Under the Act, the vocational training and education provided by the State consists of 
</p>
<p>basic vocational training, including apprenticeships and in-service training as well as 
</p>
<p>formal education (art. 2). A set of regulations governs this educational sector in 
</p>
<p>Algeria. These include: (a) Executive Decree No. 08-294 of 20 September 2008, 
</p>
<p>instituting lower- and higher-level vocational training diplomas (dipl&#244;me 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;enseignement professionnel du premier degr&#233; and dipl&#244;me d&#8217;enseignement 
</p>
<p>professionnel du second degr&#233;); (b) Executive Decree No. 08-293 of 20 September 
</p>
<p>2008, introducing model regulations for vocational education institutes; and (c) 
</p>
<p>Executive Decree No. 08-295 of 20 September 2008, establishing vocational training 
</p>
<p>and apprenticeship centres. 
</p>
<p>26. Formal vocational education refers to all courses of instruction, both academic 
</p>
<p>and skills-oriented, provided after completion of the compulsory course of study. It is 
</p>
<p>intended for pupils who, having finished their compulsory schooling and advanced to 
</p>
<p>the post-compulsory level, have chosen this educational option, as well as for pupils 
</p>
<p>redirected from general and technical upper secondary education. It aims to provide 
</p>
<p>pupils with training in one or more trades. Formal vocational education includes 
</p>
<p>science and technology courses that lead to certification, as well as in-service training 
</p>
<p>that aims to develop skills that can only be acquired in the workplace. According to 
</p>
<p>the Government, in 2014, 1,165 pupils were enrolled in such courses.  
</p>
<p>27. Basic vocational training includes pre-service and in-service vocational training 
</p>
<p>and may lead to a diploma or skills certification. Pre-service vocational training is for 
</p>
<p>pupils who graduate from the national educational system (primary, lower secondary 
</p>
<p>and upper secondary schools), as well as young persons and adults who are literate 
</p>
<p>and housewives who would like to undergo short-term training. It is designed to 
</p>
<p>provide basic qualifications to anyone seeking training and to develop practical skills 
</p>
<p>and the specific knowledge required for trades. There are three forms of pre-service 
</p>
<p>training: distance education; on-site training, which leads to a diploma or certification 
</p>
<p>and runs full time in a vocational training centre; and apprenticeships for young </p>

<p> 
<b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>9/17 </b>GE. 15-10618 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>persons aged 15 to 35, alternating between a training centre and the host workplace. 
</p>
<p>According to the Government, in 2014, there were 254,432 apprentices. In-service 
</p>
<p>vocational training, for its part, is generally characterized by the fact that it extends 
</p>
<p>over a short period (10 to 20 days) and focuses on providing know-how to adult 
</p>
<p>workers. This training can be done both off-site and onsite. 
</p>
<p>28. Basic vocational training and formal vocational education both lead to 
</p>
<p>certificates and diplomas issued by the Ministry of Vocational Training and Education. 
</p>
<p>There are five levels of certification: specialized vocational training (certificat de 
</p>
<p>formation professionnelle sp&#233;cialis&#233;); vocational aptitude (certificat d&#8217;aptitude 
</p>
<p>professionnelle); vocational expertise (certificat de ma&#238;trise professionnelle); technical 
</p>
<p>aptitude (brevet de technicien); and technical expertise (brevet de technicien 
</p>
<p>sup&#233;rieur). 
</p>
<p>29. As to formal vocational education, which is divided into two two-year cycles, the 
</p>
<p>first cycle leads to a basic vocational studies diploma (dipl&#244;me d&#8217;enseignement 
</p>
<p>professionnel du 1er degr&#233;) and the second, to a higher vocational studies diploma 
</p>
<p>(dipl&#244;me d&#8217;enseignement professionnel du 2e degr&#233;).

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>V.<b> </b>Achievements and progress made<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. Since independence, Algeria has made education a top priority and is moving 
</p>
<p>towards its general democratization in order to guarantee access to education, which 
</p>
<p>constitutes a fundamental right. As a result, significant progress has been made in 
</p>
<p>upholding the right to education. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these positive 
</p>
<p>developments and encourages the Government to continue its efforts and to 
</p>
<p>consolidate the gains made in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Educational policies and strategies in Algeria<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction during his visit that education 
</p>
<p>remains a strategic priority in Algerian governmental policy. In 2003, the Government 
</p>
<p>carried out a reform of the education system to improve the quality of education. This 
</p>
<p>reform was characterized by overhauling teaching methods, improving the quality of 
</p>
<p>teaching staff and restructuring the school curriculum. The new teaching methods 
</p>
<p>involve participatory and interactive lessons that engage the pupil. The traditional 
</p>
<p>model of teaching, based on the transmission of knowledge that the pupil memorizes 
</p>
<p>and reproduces during tests, is being replaced by a model of teaching in which pupils 
</p>
<p>are actively involved in the learning process. 
</p>
<p>32. A number of policies and programmes designed to guarantee and improve the 
</p>
<p>right to education have been developed. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the 
</p>
<p>2010&#8211;2014 five-year development programme, which includes national education, 
</p>
<p>higher education and vocational training as an integral component of human 
</p>
<p>development. He also welcomes the adoption, in May 2014, of the Government &#8217;s plan 
</p>
<p>of action to implement the programme of the President of the Republic, which follows 
</p>
<p>on from the education reform already launched by the Government. The plan of a ction 
</p>
<p>confirms the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the quality of the national 
</p>
<p>education system in order to meet the country&#8217;s needs, particularly with respect to 
</p>
<p>high-quality technical and vocational training. The implementation of the 2007&#8211;2016 
</p>
<p>national literacy strategy is another positive development that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>would like to highlight. </p>

<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Funding for education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33. Algeria is among the countries that allocate a significant share of the national 
</p>
<p>budget to education. Under the 2010&#8211;2014 five-year development programme, 
</p>
<p>national education, higher education and vocational training have seen their budgetary 
</p>
<p>spending double every five years, rising from 225.5 billion Algerian dinars in 2000 to 
</p>
<p>403.3 billion dinars in 2005 and to over 1,100 billion dinars in 2010. In 2013, the 
</p>
<p>national education budget was 7 per cent of gross domestic product, or 21.7 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the operating budget. According to the Government, in 2014, national education 
</p>
<p>accounted for 16 per cent of the national budget, making it second only to national 
</p>
<p>defence in terms of the budgetary priorities.  
</p>
<p>34. According to the information gathered by the Government, the State pays for all 
</p>
<p>staffing costs in the education sector, for services in all educational, training and 
</p>
<p>support establishments, and it also covers investment expenditures, which include 
</p>
<p>construction, equipment and maintenance. The operating budget includes: (a) staffing 
</p>
<p>costs; (b) the operation of central administration services and decentralized services; 
</p>
<p>(c) the operating expenses of education, training and support establishments; (d) 
</p>
<p>educational and cultural activities for pupils; and (e) social welfare measures such as 
</p>
<p>funding for school canteens, scholarships, free textbooks, school health care and 
</p>
<p>special grants for pupils from needy families. According to the Government, the 
</p>
<p>annual allocations for the operating budget for the period 2011&#8211;2015 have continued 
</p>
<p>to increase: in 2015, these totalled 746.7 billion dinars. The operating grants for 
</p>
<p>various fiscal years allocated to the Ministry of National Education have never 
</p>
<p>suffered from budgetary restrictions, due to the priority given to education by the 
</p>
<p>Algerian State and enshrined in the basic texts. Moreover, and in conjunction with the 
</p>
<p>operating budget, an equipment and investment budget is allocated to the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>National Education with a view to improving indicators of the quality of school 
</p>
<p>education. As to the equipment budget of the Ministry of National Education, data 
</p>
<p>from the Government show a budget package of 543 billion dinars under the 2010&#8211;
</p>
<p>2014 five-year programme mentioned above.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Access to education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on the excellent rates of 
</p>
<p>school enrolment. According to the statistics provided by the Government, the school 
</p>
<p>enrolment rate for children aged 6 rose from 93.24 per cent in 2000 to 98.5 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2014. The school enrolment rate for pupils aged 6 to 16 rose from 85.8 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2000 to 96.1 per cent in 2014. It should be noted that the national average for the 
</p>
<p>number of students per class is 29 pupils in primary school and 32 in lower secondary 
</p>
<p>school. Only 4.86 per cent of classes in primary school and 6.26 per cent of classes in 
</p>
<p>lower secondary school are overcrowded (have more than 41 pupils), most of these 
</p>
<p>being located in recently constructed urban areas.  
</p>
<p>36. Algeria has also made considerable progress on gender parity in education, it 
</p>
<p>having been largely achieved at educational levels. Currently, parity has nearly been 
</p>
<p>achieved in primary and lower secondary education. In upper secondary education, 
</p>
<p>girls outnumber boys. In 2014, the proportion of girls enrolled reached 47.67 per cent 
</p>
<p>in primary, 48.86 per cent in lower secondary and 58.22 per cent in upper secondary 
</p>
<p>education. More and more girls are going to school, not to mention the fact that they 
</p>
<p>perform better than boys. As a result, at the university level, girls are in the majority 
</p>
<p>and get better grades than boys. Women are also in the majority among primary 
</p>
<p>schoolteachers. It is also noteworthy that, in accordance with its international and 
</p>
<p>constitutional obligations, the Algerian Government provides free education at all </p>

<p> 
<b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>11/17 </b>GE. 15-10618

</b></p>
<p>levels, including higher education. These growing efforts have allowed the country to 
</p>
<p>move towards the achievement of education for all and the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals. The level of achievement of the Education for All goals and the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, particularly goal 2 on universal primary education and goal 3 on 
</p>
<p>gender parity in access to education, is very high in Algeria.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Government on 
</p>
<p>infrastructure. He notes with satisfaction that overall, the educational infrastructure 
</p>
<p>has expanded considerably. According to government data, in 2014, aggregate 
</p>
<p>infrastructure consisted of 25,858 schools, including 18,458 primary schools, 5,253 
</p>
<p>lower secondary schools and 2,147 upper secondary schools.  
</p>
<p>38. A series of measures are being implemented by the Government in support of 
</p>
<p>education. The Special Rapporteur notes with approval that since the start of the 
</p>
<p>2000/01 school year, the State has been providing the most needy pupils with 
</p>
<p>education grants. This annual financial aid increased from 2,000 to 3,000 dinars in 
</p>
<p>2008; approximately 3 million pupils receive it. Similarly, more than 4 million pupils 
</p>
<p>receive free textbooks each year, roughly half of the total number of pupils enrolled in 
</p>
<p>primary and secondary education. The network of school canteens has also expanded, 
</p>
<p>increasing from 11,802 during the 2007/08 school year to 14,739 during the 2013/14 
</p>
<p>school year providing meals for about 3.3 million pupils, or 85 per cent of all primary 
</p>
<p>school pupils. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur inaugurated a canteen in the 
</p>
<p>wilaya of Tipaza, at a primary school in the rural area of Menaceur. The 
</p>
<p>implementation of school health measures is also welcomed by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, as is the gradual introduction of school transportation, particularly for 
</p>
<p>pupils living in remote or isolated areas.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>D.<b> </b>Literacy<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Government to 
</p>
<p>combat illiteracy, including through the work of the National Office for Adult Literacy 
</p>
<p>and Education. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was able to meet with officia ls 
</p>
<p>from this National Office in Algiers. He appreciates the work of this public institution 
</p>
<p>and welcomes the adoption by the Government of the 2007&#8211;2016 national literacy 
</p>
<p>strategy which, by linking literacy to vocational training, has significantly lowered  the 
</p>
<p>illiteracy rate. The illiteracy rate for persons aged 15 to 24, which was 13.43 per cent 
</p>
<p>in 1998, has decreased significantly, dropping to 3.52 per cent in 2014. With regard to 
</p>
<p>persons over the age of 15, the illiteracy rate was 15.15 per cent in 2014 . 
</p>
<p>40. Civil society associations also play an important role in the fight against 
</p>
<p>illiteracy: they have contributed greatly to reducing the illiteracy rate. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur appreciates the significant contribution made by the Algerian Literacy 
</p>
<p>Association, a non-governmental organization that promotes literacy in Algeria and 
</p>
<p>has more than 130,000 volunteers. Since its inception in 1990, this association has 
</p>
<p>helped more than 1,681,000 persons learn how to read and write. It has also a literacy, 
</p>
<p>training and employment programme for women, which has helped more than 23,000 
</p>
<p>women aged 18 to 35 learn how to read and write, trained them and made them more 
</p>
<p>autonomous. The association was awarded the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) International Literacy Prize in 1997. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur encourages all civil society associations to continue their efforts to 
</p>
<p>promote literacy and calls on the authorities to support them.  
</p>
<p>41. The vocational training and education sector is also working to reduce the 
</p>
<p>illiteracy rate through a programme to raise qualifications through literacy that was set 
</p>
<p>up jointly by the National Office for Literacy and Education and the Algerian Literacy 
</p>
<p>Association. </p>

<p><b> </b>E.<b> </b>Enjoyment of the right to education by persons in detention<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment by persons in detention of their right to education. The Government 
</p>
<p>provides persons in detention with textbooks and learning materials. The type of 
</p>
<p>education provided in prisons is similar to that given in ordinary schools, and teachers 
</p>
<p>adapt their classes to the prisoners&#8217; situation. Thus, detainees enjoy their fundamental 
</p>
<p>right to education and apprenticeship, despite their adverse circumstances. Detainees 
</p>
<p>undergo rehabilitation programmes aimed at improving their intellectual ability and 
</p>
<p>developing their skills and aptitudes with a view to social integration. These activities 
</p>
<p>are carried out in coordination with the relevant ministries and civil society. 
</p>
<p>43. The Government shared some noteworthy data and information on this subject 
</p>
<p>with the Special Rapporteur. As a result of this policy on the right to education, 
</p>
<p>detainees&#8217; exam results have improved. By way of example, the number of detainees 
</p>
<p>enrolled in general education increased from 3,165 in 2003 to 39,943 in 2015. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pass rate in the secondary school leaving exam (baccalaur&#233;at) is 
</p>
<p>now more than 51 per cent, while for middle school, it equals 69 per cent. More  than 
</p>
<p>259,514 detainees are enrolled in vocational education or training. Detainees can 
</p>
<p>obtain diplomas just like anybody else. Furthermore, as part of prison policy, detainees 
</p>
<p>are encouraged to pursue their studies even while they are serving sentences an d can 
</p>
<p>have their sentences commuted if they succeed in acquiring new knowledge and skills.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>VI.<b> </b>Key challenges<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Quality of education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. Quality remains the biggest challenge in the area of education in Algeria. The 
</p>
<p>Government needs to act urgently to meet the need for improved quality in education 
</p>
<p>at all levels and in all regions, particularly in areas marked by deprivation and in the 
</p>
<p>south. This requires an upgrade of the relevance and quality of education. The low 
</p>
<p>levels of learning among children should be improved by diversifying approaches to 
</p>
<p>learning and strengthening the capacity of inspectors and, most importantly, of 
</p>
<p>teachers. Overcrowding in schools continues to be a problem in Algeria: it is not 
</p>
<p>conducive to the provision of high-quality education for children and it makes 
</p>
<p>teachers&#8217; jobs more difficult. The Government should adopt the necessary measures to 
</p>
<p>remedy this situation. 
</p>
<p>45. The selection process for teachers should be improved and they should be better 
</p>
<p>trained to impart knowledge, values and skills in order to improve the quality of 
</p>
<p>education, taking account of the &#8220;four pillars of learning&#8221; &#8212; learning to know, 
</p>
<p>learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be &#8212; which is a global 
</p>
<p>approach to quality education. This of course includes the values of human rights and 
</p>
<p>democratic citizenship as well as of humanist values that are reflected in the 2008 
</p>
<p>Education Act. These values should be more effectively incorporated into the 
</p>
<p>education system in order to reinforce the humanistic vocation of education. These 
</p>
<p>values are all the more important in the light of concerns about the resurgence of 
</p>
<p>violence among young people that were expressed during the Special Rapporteur &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>visit. The promotion of dialogue and of the values of tolerance, understanding and 
</p>
<p>mutual respect throughout the entire country is therefore essential. Parents also have a 
</p>
<p>key role to play in this regard. 
</p>
<p>46. According to the National Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the various reforms undertaken, particularly in the 2000s, were carried </p>

<p>out without any specific evaluation of the deficiencies of the education system and 
</p>
<p>without establishing quality and performance indicators for the effective management 
</p>
<p>of the system. Indicators are indispensable for improving the quality of education 
</p>
<p>provided to students, as they enable better monitoring and evaluation of the progress 
</p>
<p>made in the realization of the right to education.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Legal framework for education funding<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>47. Although the proportion of the national budget allocated to education is over 20 
</p>
<p>per cent, Algeria does not have a legal framework for national spending in the field of 
</p>
<p>education. The Special Rapporteur recommends preparing such a legal framework in 
</p>
<p>order to set a minimum percentage of the national budget to be allocated to education. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the operating budget, this framework should also include a budget for 
</p>
<p>education quality.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Vocational education and training<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>48. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the Government &#8217;s interest, at the 
</p>
<p>highest level, in improving and strengthening vocational education and training. Given 
</p>
<p>the limited use made of the pedagogical resources of vocational education facilities, 
</p>
<p>this sector warrants special attention by the Government. 
</p>
<p>49. The sector needs to be strengthened and its social and cultural value enhanced, 
</p>
<p>including through campaigns to improve the social prestige and status of technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational education. Vocational education and training should be incorporated into 
</p>
<p>the general education system at an even higher level. During their training, learners 
</p>
<p>should be given the opportunity to experience working life through work placement in 
</p>
<p>a company. Cooperation with companies needs to be strengthened and institutionalized 
</p>
<p>in order to meet the needs of the economy and the country&#8217;s development objectives. 
</p>
<p>Based on the concept of corporate social responsibili ty, the modalities of this public-
</p>
<p>private partnership should be clarified, and a more appropriate legal framework for 
</p>
<p>technical and vocational training should be created. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>D.<b> </b>Universal access to education and equality of opportunity<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>1.<b> </b>School dropout rate<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on the good results achieved 
</p>
<p>in terms of access to education. However, challenges remain. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is concerned by the number of children aged 6 to 16 years old who are not in school. 
</p>
<p>The Government also needs to address the problem of students dropping out of school, 
</p>
<p>which affects boys in particular. Likewise, high rates of grade repetition remain a 
</p>
<p>problem. According to information from 2013, more than 1 million students across all 
</p>
<p>three cycles were repeating a year, at a rate of 6.8 per cent at primary level, 20.1 per 
</p>
<p>cent in middle school and 15 per cent at secondary level.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Disparities<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>51. Admission rates are lowest in the western and central Hauts Plateaux regions, in 
</p>
<p>the poorest households and in households where the mother is illiterate. Girls living in 
</p>
<p>rural areas have particular difficulties in attending school because of distance and lack 
</p>
<p>of transport. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE. 15-10618 <b>14/17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. In order to alleviate these disparities, the vocational training and  education 
</p>
<p>sector has opened special units and set up telecentres in rural and isolated areas in 
</p>
<p>order to bring vocational training closer to young girls living in these areas.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b>Universal provision of preschool education<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The information collected by the Special Rapporteur indicates that access to 
</p>
<p>preschool education for all Algerian children, particularly physical access for all 
</p>
<p>children to preschool education facilities, is not yet fully available. During the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Ministry of Education indicated that approximately 60 per cent 
</p>
<p>of children had access to preschool education. The Government is engaged in a 
</p>
<p>process to make preschool education generally available, which should result in the 
</p>
<p>preparation of a national strategy for universal preschool education in 2017.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>4.<b> </b>Children with disabilities<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>54. According to the information collected, access to education for children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities is difficult. However, cognizant that schooling is essential to the social 
</p>
<p>integration of persons with disabilities, the Government is making considerable efforts 
</p>
<p>in this area. Solutions need to be found as a matter of urgency to ensure that the right 
</p>
<p>to education is recognized and exercised by all, without distinction, exclusion or 
</p>
<p>restriction based on sex, financial situation, region of origin, disability, social sta tus or 
</p>
<p>any other consideration. 
</p>
<p>55. In this area, the vocational training and education sector is contributing to the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s efforts by providing training and qualifications to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, both in specialized establishments and in ordinary training centres.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>5.<b> </b>Teaching of Tamazight<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>56. The Government took steps towards promoting and teaching Tamazight (the 
</p>
<p>Amazigh language) in response to the community&#8217;s demands in the 1990s. On 22 April 
</p>
<p>2002, the Amazigh language was declared a national language in the Constitution (art. 
</p>
<p>3 bis). In 1995, the High Commission on Amazighness, reporting to the Office of the 
</p>
<p>President of the Republic, was established by Presidential Decree No. 147-95, dated 
</p>
<p>27 May 1995. This body&#8217;s main tasks are to revive and promote Tamazight and 
</p>
<p>introduce it into the education system. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>with the members of the Commission. He commends the Commission on its work and 
</p>
<p>notes with satisfaction the activities it undertakes, particularly the publication of 
</p>
<p>textbooks in Tamazight and the continuous training of teachers in this language. 
</p>
<p>Tamazight classes were introduced in schools during the 1995/96 academic year. 
</p>
<p>Tamazight is not a language of instruction but is taught in primary, middle and 
</p>
<p>secondary schools. Teachers of the Amazigh language are mainly trained by the 
</p>
<p>departments of Amazigh language and culture of the universities of Tizi Ouzou, Bejaia 
</p>
<p>and Bouira, which are the main providers of teacher training for Tamazight.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports of a regression in the teaching of 
</p>
<p>Tamazight in Algeria. The number of regions in which the Amazigh language is taught 
</p>
<p>has declined. According to the High Commission on Amazighness, Tamazight 
</p>
<p>language classes, which were introduced in 16 wilayas, are now provided in only 10 
</p>
<p>wilayas. Furthermore, although Tamazight is a national language, it is still not 
</p>
<p>compulsory to teach it. However, in terms of numbers, there has been a marked 
</p>
<p>increase in the number of students who have received Tamazight language instruction, 
</p>
<p>from 53,587 in 1999/2000 to 200,333 in 2014/15, even though fewer wilayas 
</p>
<p>nationwide are offering these classes. The Ministry of Education and the High 
</p>
<p>Commission on Amazighness have put in place a strategy for the development of 
</p>
<p>Tamazight education at the national level.  </p>

<p><b> </b>VII.<b> </b>Conclusions and recommendations<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>58. Since independence, Algeria has made education one of its main priorities 
</p>
<p>and has undertaken a general process of democratization in education in order to 
</p>
<p>guarantee access to education as a fundamental right. Today, education remains a 
</p>
<p>priority under Algerian government policy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>59. In Algeria, the right to education is enshrined in the Constitution and 
</p>
<p>covered in laws and decrees concerning, for example, free and compulsory basic 
</p>
<p>education, vocational and technical education and higher education. Algeria has 
</p>
<p>also made international commitments by ratifying international instruments 
</p>
<p>concerning the right to education. In accordance with its international and 
</p>
<p>constitutional obligations, the Algerian Government provides free education at all 
</p>
<p>levels, including higher education.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Algerian Government&#8217;s efforts to 
</p>
<p>realize the right to education, in terms both of school and university 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and in the level of resources allocated to this sector, including 
</p>
<p>scholarships for pupils and students, free textbooks, transport services, etc. The 
</p>
<p>rate of enrolment at primary level is excellent, exceeding 97 per cent. Parity in 
</p>
<p>education access for boys and girls has largely been achieved at all levels. In fact, 
</p>
<p>at university level, girls are in the majority and obtain better results than boys. 
</p>
<p>Women are also in the majority among primary schoolteachers.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. There are many noteworthy aspects in the implementation of the right to 
</p>
<p>education in Algeria. The Government&#8217;s educational policies and programmes 
</p>
<p>have yielded positive results: the level of attainment of the Education for All goals 
</p>
<p>and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly goal 2 concerning universal 
</p>
<p>primary education and goal 3 on gender equality in access to education, is very 
</p>
<p>high in Algeria. The infrastructure for providing education and training is in 
</p>
<p>place. What is more, considerable budgetary resources are allocated to education 
</p>
<p>in Algeria: education ranks second in the list of national budgetary priorities 
</p>
<p>after national defence, having 16 per cent of the national budget in 2014. The 
</p>
<p>process of reform launched in 2003 was designed to enhance the quality of 
</p>
<p>education by reviewing educational methods, improving the quality of 
</p>
<p>pedagogical supervision and restructuring the school curriculum. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur commends the State on all of these successes.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. However, Algeria faces a number of challenges in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to education, chief among them quality. The general standard of education 
</p>
<p>needs to be raised as a matter of urgency. Problems facing the education system 
</p>
<p>include school dropout, a high rate of grade repetition and classroom 
</p>
<p>overcrowding. Enrolment rates are sometimes lower in regions, in rural areas and 
</p>
<p>in the poorest households. Ensuring equal opportunities in access to education for 
</p>
<p>children with disabilities is still a challenge for the Government, as is a decline in 
</p>
<p>the teaching of Tamazight. Algeria lacks a legal framework to guarantee that a 
</p>
<p>minimum proportion of the national budget is allocated to education. Lastly, the 
</p>
<p>challenge of strengthening and enhancing the social and cultural value of 
</p>
<p>vocational education and training is particularly acute. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>makes the following recommendations to Algeria with a view to improving the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to education in that country.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to consider signing and 
</p>
<p>ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights and to make the right to education enforceable in the 
</p>
<p>domestic legal order.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>GE. 15-10618 <b>16/17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Algerian Government must address the imperative of ensuring quality 
</p>
<p>in education as a matter of urgency. The provision of quality education is at the 
</p>
<p>heart of the commitments under Education for All. Consequently, the quality and 
</p>
<p>performance of the education system at all levels need to be improved and the 
</p>
<p>education provided must be made relevant. Students&#8217; performance and 
</p>
<p>knowledge should be regularly evaluated. To that end, a national system for the 
</p>
<p>evaluation and monitoring of the skills actually acquired by students should be 
</p>
<p>set up. As the recruitment and ongoing training of qualified teachers is one of the 
</p>
<p>fundamental elements of quality education, it is important for the Government to 
</p>
<p>improve the selection and training of teachers. The Government should also 
</p>
<p>adopt quality standards and criteria for the education system as a whole. With 
</p>
<p>this in mind, the Special Rapporteur recommends developing indicators and 
</p>
<p>setting up a more advanced and more reliable data collection and processing 
</p>
<p>system in order to enable appropriate monitoring and evaluation of the education 
</p>
<p>system. He also recommends that training be provided, with the support of 
</p>
<p>specialized United Nations agencies such as UNESCO and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), to officials from the Ministry of Education 
</p>
<p>responsible for statistics. Lastly, the involved stakeholders, including teachers, 
</p>
<p>parents and students, in the education system is necessary in order to ensure the 
</p>
<p>provision of quality education.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. As a source of human development and social progress, education is a public 
</p>
<p>good that deserves long<b>-</b>term investment at the national level. This has been 
</p>
<p>demonstrated in Algeria, a country that has made a huge investment in education 
</p>
<p>nationwide. A legal framework establishing a minimum proportion of the national 
</p>
<p>budget to be allocated to education should be developed, particularly as Algeria 
</p>
<p>has a broad legal framework covering the various dimensions of the right to 
</p>
<p>education. In addition to the operational budget, the framework should provide 
</p>
<p>for an investment budget for educational quality. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. With regard to technical and vocational education, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recommends incorporating vocational training into general education and 
</p>
<p>enhancing the value placed on vocational education and training and the job 
</p>
<p>opportunities they open up in order to improve the image of this type of 
</p>
<p>education in society, including through awareness<b>-</b>raising campaigns. This would 
</p>
<p>without doubt help to improve the profile of students at whom this training is 
</p>
<p>aimed. Particular attention should be paid to institutionalized collaboration 
</p>
<p>between companies and technical and vocational education institutions. Such 
</p>
<p>collaboration is essential to ensure that demand for skills can be met and that 
</p>
<p>vocational education and training can effectively contribute to the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>economy and to its development.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. With regard to the problem of school dropout, the Special Rapporteur urges 
</p>
<p>the Government to intensify its efforts to bring into the school system all the 
</p>
<p>children who have left it by ensuring that all children of the mandatory school<b>-
</b></p>
<p>going age of 6 are in school, taking social and educational measures to keep all 
</p>
<p>children up to the age of 16 in school and making preschool education universally 
</p>
<p>available. The Government should undertake an evaluation of school dropout to 
</p>
<p>identify its causes. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur recommends instituting 
</p>
<p>a system to compile information on the children not in the school system and 
</p>
<p>develop profiles for them.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to adopt an 
</p>
<p>intersectoral national strategy on early childhood development by the end of 
</p>
<p>2015, in close cooperation with all relevant national and international partners, 
</p>
<p>including UNICEF. It is imperative that the problem of physical access to </p>

<p> 
<b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>17/17 </b>GE. 15-10618 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>preschool facilities for all Algerian children be fully incorporated into the 
</p>
<p>strategy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to allocate more 
</p>
<p>human and financial resources in order to halt the decline in the teaching of 
</p>
<p>Tamazight, a national language, and to ensure at all levels of the education system 
</p>
<p>and receives fairer treatment at the national level. He recommends standardizing 
</p>
<p>the way Tamazight is taught at all levels of education: particular attention should 
</p>
<p>be paid to the teaching of Tamazight in preschool. The planned preschool 
</p>
<p>development strategy should therefore fully incorporate the teaching and 
</p>
<p>learning of Tamazight. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations on the Amazigh language of the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (see CERD/C/DZA/CO/15<b>-</b>19, paras. 14 
</p>
<p>and 16) and of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see 
</p>
<p>E/C.12/DZA/CO/4, para. 22).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on its commitment to 
</p>
<p>improving the quality of the national education system in order to meet the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s needs, including in relation to training excellence in technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational fields, pursuant to the Government&#8217;s action plan for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the programme of the President of the Republic, adopted in 
</p>
<p>May 2014. While continuing to carry out this plan of action, Algeria should 
</p>
<p>modernize its national legislation in the area of technical and vocational 
</p>
<p>education, for example. It might also develop a legal framework on investment in 
</p>
<p>the field of education and a new law on education quality based on experience 
</p>
<p>acquired to date and looking to the future. The Special Rapporteur considers, in 
</p>
<p>particular, that it is important to draft a law to replace the Executive Decree of 24 
</p>
<p>March 2004 setting out the conditions for the establishment, opening and 
</p>
<p>oversight of private education establishments, with the key objective being to 
</p>
<p>regulate private education and maintain education as a public good. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>71. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Algerian 
</p>
<p>Government to take account of the central role of the right to education during 
</p>
<p>the discussions on the post<b>-</b>2015 development programme, particularly the role of 
</p>
<p>education in combating poverty, which is the programme&#8217;s priority objective. In 
</p>
<p>this context, Algeria should mobilize all stakeholders to ensure that the priorities 
</p>
<p>of the African continent resonate strongly in the international community. Algeria 
</p>
<p>could play a key role in the African Union and the United Nations. <b>
