Judgment

Introduction

The accused is charged with Rape, Contrary to Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (Cap 17). It is alleged that Manasa Vakasoqo on the 29th day of june 2007 at Visama, Nausori in the Central Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl namely, K. Q [initials to protect the identity of the complainant] without her consent. 

The Prosecution Case

The prosecution in this case called three witnesses. The 1st Prosecution witness was the Doctor (PW-1), Dr. Romano Turaganiwai. He gave sworn evidence. 

In his Examination-in-chief, PW-1, stated the following:

- Based at CWM.
-       
14 years at CWM.
-       
Medical officer.
-       
1995  Started as a medical officer.
-       
Examined victim of rape- K. Q.
-       
Examination took place in gyno-clinic.
-       
I handed in report to the police.
-       
Examination did not reveal anything conclusive.
-       
The victim was brought with a report had sexual intercourse before that.
-       
I could not conclude anything. Victim had sex with boyfriend an hour before that and victim had 18 month old baby before that.

Witness was shown the medical report and he identified the report. Part 10  history as related by the person to be examined  read by witness. Witness told the Court that he signed the form. Medical report tendered as PE-1. Defence had no objection to tendering of the report and told the court that they have a copy. 

In cross-examination, PW-1s response was as follows:

  - Section 10 was a combination of what the police and the victim told me.

Following the Defence case both the prosecution and the Defence counsels made closing submissions. The Court has considered the submissions. 

The Law and the Analysis of the Evidence
Section 149 and 150 of the Penal Code (Cap 17) read as follows respectively:

Definition of rape - 149. Any person who has unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, without her consent, or with her consent if the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of bodily harm, or by means of false representations as to the nature of the act, or in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of the felony termed rape.

Punishment of rape - 150. Any person who commits the offence of rape is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without corporal punishment. 

The Elements

The elements of the offence that the prosecution is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to prove its case are the following:

(a)     
Manasa Vakasoqo, (the person in the charge and appearing in court  identification)
(b)     
Had unlawful carnal knowledge of K. Q (the complainant), and
(c)     
without K. Q's consent. 

The Standard and Burden of Proof

The onus in this case, as is with all criminal cases is on the prosecution to prove the case and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions, in commenting on the proof beyond reasonable doubt stated: "it need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice."

Corroboration

The Court in this case notes the ruling of the Supreme Court in Eliki Mototabua v- The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV0004 of 2005S (Date of Judgment 29th February 2008) where Mason, Handley and Weinberg JJ stated (In paragraph 39):

" & First, it has never been the law that actual corroboration is required in cases involving sexual offence. There was only a requirement, at common law, that a warning be given of the dangers of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of complainant. Second, it has been held by the Court of Appeal that that rule of practice no longer exists in Fiji: See: Sereima Balelala v- The State at p.19."

This Court takes notes of and heed of the comments by the Supreme Court Justices with regards to corroboration in sexual cases. 

Identification and the Parade
The Courts notes identification guidelines, as set out in R v Turnbull & Anor [1976] 3 All ER 549 (CA). 

This court notes the guidelines set in Turnbull and in particular the following questions: (a) How long did the witness have the accused under observation? (b) At what distance? (c) In what light? (d) Was the observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people?) (e)Had the witness ever seen the accused before? (f) How often? (g) If only occasionally, had he/she any special reason for remembering the accused? (h) How long elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police? (i) Are there any material discrepancies between the description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual appearance?

(a)     
How long did the witness have the accused under observation? The complainant in her evidence told the court that they hired the accused's taxi and they went to an ATM to withdraw money. The accused later dropped the complainant and her boyfriend at her home. They asked the accused to pick her up at 4am. She was picked up by the accused at 4am. She also explicitly gave evidence on where the accused took her, asked her to perform oral sex and raped her. For all this time the complainant was with the accused. This is a considerable period of time. 

The Court here notes from the evidence of the complainant that these events occurred for some time and this is in the view of the Court gave the complainant adequate time to observe the accused. She firstly saw him in the day time when he drove them home and she later saw him when he picked her up. She sat in the front passenger seat next to the accused who was the driver. 

(b) At what distance? The complainant in the morning was in the taxi. Later at 4am she sat in the front seat of the taxi. The distance between the complainant and the accused was proximate. 

(c) In what light? The complainant saw the accused in day time. She saw him again from the light of her house which was lit in the porch. The complainant saw the accused in both occasions in good light. 

(d) Was the observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people? No. according to the complainant the accused was next to her in the taxi at 4am. He was the driver; she was in the passenger seat and within her view. 

(e) Had the witness ever seen the accused before? The complainant had seen the accused before the time of the rape, which was day time. Later they asked the accused to pick her up at 4am. 

(f) How often? The complainant saw the accused as he drove her to her house before the incident in the day time. She also saw him in the morning from her porch light when he came to pick her up. 

(g) If only occasionally, had he/she any special reason for remembering the accused? The complainant alleged that the accused raped her. Rape does not take place from a distance. It takes place when a person is proximate to the other. The complainant was taken from her house in the accused's taxi. They drove along together and then he stopped the vehicle at an isolated spot and allegedly sexually assaulted her. The complainant and her boyfriend had earlier travelled in the accused's taxi in the day time. They had asked him to pick the complainant up at 4am. She sat in the taxi next to the driver. Would she not remember the accused? The court finds that the complainant did not have a fleeting glance or would miss recognizing her taxi driver and later her assailant. 

(h) How long elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police? The complainant was allegedly raped on 29th June 2007. The identification parade was held on 5th July 2007. The identification parade was held 6 days after the alleged rape. This time period is in no way an unreasonable time period based on the clear description given by the complainant of the accused and the time period she observed him, which includes him driving her in the day, picking her up at 4am, taking her to the scene of the alleged rape. 

(i) Are there any material discrepancies between the description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual appearance? There is no material discrepancy. 

The Court has answered the above questions with regards to the complainants evidence. Her description and identification of the accused is supported by PW-3 who was with her in the day time and sat next to the accused in the taxi. The PW-3 also saw the accused pick the complainant at 4am on the date of the alleged offence. 

The court finds from the statement of the ID conducting officer that the identity parade was properly conducted. Generally witnesses must be kept separate from the parade and escorted by a police officer, who may not discuss the parade with the witness. The suspect may choose where he stands and may object to the way in which the parade is conducted. All this was complied with and at the parade there is no record that the accused objected to the way in which the parade was conducted. The accused who had his interviewed re-commenced after the parade was concluded did not complain about the parade then. The identification by the complainant and PW-3 was clear and a strong one. The Court also finds that the accused was brought in by the police upon report by the complainant having seen the accused driving the taxi in town. Even before the parade the complainant identified the accused and the accused's vehicle. 

The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the identity of the accused. The prosecution has adduced evidence to the satisfaction of this Court to prove this element. 

Credibility of the Witnesses  Whom the Court Believes 

One of the main issues in this case is the credibility of the witnesses and whom the court believes. The defence argued on the medical opinion and stated that it did not confirm rape. The Court takes cognizance of the medical opinion which stated it was "difficult to ascertain whether penetration took place." The Court here reads this with what the complainant told the Doctor that she had "unprotected sexual intercourse with boyfriend 1 hour before the incident." The Court also notes the additional information noted by the Doctor that the complainant has "an 8 month old baby delivered vaginally on 6th October 2006." 

The Court notes the Doctors medical opinion and weighs it in light of the complainant having unprotected sexual intercourse with boyfriend 1 hour before the incident and her delivering a baby some 8 months before the alleged incident. 

The Court in analyzing the evidence also notes the complainant's evidence that she feared for herself and her safety. She told the Court: "I was thinking to myself if I could get out of this alive.". The complainant told the court she screamed and the accused caught up with her. The Court here notes that she gave up to the accused fearing for her safety. She wanted to come out alive. She did not fight back. This is probably the reason she did not bite the accused's penis. She told the Court she could have bitten it off. This is also probably the reason she does not have bruises and other marks upon medical examination. 

The other issue raised by the defence is the complainant stating that her uncle opened the door at home and to the police that it was her aunt. When this inconsistency was put to her she clarified that it was her uncle who opened the door and not her aunt. The Court noted the demeanor of the complainant. She was telling the truth. The Court believes her version. She missed some details, but these were not fatal details. The complainant has not swayed from her version and has not been discredited as to her evidence. 

The Court has also considered the issue as to why the complainant took of her shoes. She told the Court she was wearing a slip on shoe. She wanted to run away from the accused. She readied herself to flee from the accused as she found out the accused was taking a longer route and had something else in his mind. Any right minded person in position of danger would respond in the manner the complainant responded. The complainant's actions are consistent with that of person sensing danger and taking appropriate action to avert the danger. She told the Court she wanted to come out alive from the situation. 

The Court does not believe the accused. He is not truthful. When answering some questions the accused was shifty and evasive. The Court noted this. 

The Court believes the complaint and her version. Her evidence is supported by that of PW-3. 

The court finds Manasa Vakasoqo guilty that he on the 29th day of June 2007 at Visama, Nausori in the Central Division had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl namely, K. Q without her consent.
