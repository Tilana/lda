<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, Ms. Joy Ngozi 
Ezeilo, following the visit to Italy (12-20 September 2013)  
</b>1. Following to the request of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Italian Authorities are in a position to provide the following 
comments to be considered as a comprehensive addendum of the Report of the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. In regard to the reference concerning the reception of the provision of the European 
Convention on Human Rights, please introduce the correct reference to Italy legal position 
as a &#8216;Council of Europe Member State and Contracting Party of the ECHR (see paragraph 
23 of the Report). 
</p><p>3. Moreover, beside the fact that, at the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the 
absence of a national plan of action to combat human trafficking was recorded, the insertion 
of a reference to the current drafting process is fundamental, as provided for in Legislative 
Decree No. 24/2014, transposing directive 2011/36/EU, which established inter alia that the 
two kinds of victims&#8217; assistance programmes (Article 13 and Article 18 projects) will be 
integrated into one single assistance and social integration programme (see paragraphs 44 
and 45 of the Report).
