United States of America: draft resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>25/&#8230;  The promotion and protection of human rights in the context of 
peaceful protests 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,<i> 
Reaffirming also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
and relevant regional human rights instruments,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further </i>that, consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
States Members of the United Nations have pledged to achieve, in cooperation with the 
United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 12/16 of 2 October 2009 and 16/4 of 
24 March 2011, on freedom of opinion and expression, 15/21 of 30 September 2010, 21/16 
of 27 September 2012 and 24/5 of 26 September 2013, on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, and 19/35 of 23 March 2012 and 22/10 of 21 March 2013, on 
the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Recalling also </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 21/12 of 27 September 2012, on 
the safety of journalists, 24/8 of 26 September 2013, on equal political participation, 22/6 of 
21 March 2013, on protecting human rights defenders, and 24/21 of 27 September 2013, on 
civil society space: creating and maintaining, in law and practice, a safe and enabling 
environment,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly, of expression and of association are human rights guaranteed to all, while their 
exercise may be subject to certain restrictions, in accordance with States&#8217; obligations under 
applicable international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>that any such restrictions must be based in law, in accordance with 
States&#8217; obligations under applicable international human rights instruments, and subject to a 
competent, independent, impartial and prompt administrative or judicial review,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>that peaceful protests can occur in all societies, including protests 
that are spontaneous, simultaneous, unauthorized or restricted, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also </i>that participation in peaceful protests can be an important form 
of exercising the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression, of association and 
of participation in the conduct of public affairs,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that peaceful protests can make a positive contribution to the 
development, strengthening and effectiveness of democratic systems, and to democratic 
processes, including<b> </b>elections and referendums, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>that peaceful protests can contribute to the full enjoyment of civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person,<b> 
</b><i>Reaffirming also</i> that participation in public and peaceful protests should be entirely 
</p>
<p>voluntary and uncoerced, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>therefore that everyone must be able to express their grievances or 
aspirations in a peaceful manner, including through public protests without fear of reprisals 
or of being intimidated, harassed, injured, sexually assaulted, beaten, arbitrarily arrested 
and detained, tortured, killed or subjected to enforced disappearance,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>about extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions<b>,</b> torture and<b> 
</b>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or<b> </b>punishment of persons exercising their 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association in all regions of 
the world,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> about the number of attacks targeting human rights defenders 
and journalists in the context of peaceful protests,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern also </i>at the increasing criminalization, in all parts of the 
world, of individuals and groups organizing or taking part in peaceful protests,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that peaceful protests should not be viewed as a threat, and therefore 
encouraging all States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful dialogue when 
dealing with peaceful protests and their causes,<b> </b></p>


<p><i>Recalling </i>that acts of sporadic violence committed by others in the course of a 
protest do not deprive peaceful individuals of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, 
of expression and of association,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that national human rights institutions and representatives of civil 
society, including non-governmental organizations, can play a useful role in facilitating 
continued dialogue between individuals taking part in peaceful protests and the relevant 
authorities,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the need to ensure full accountability for human rights violations or abuses 
in the context of peaceful protests,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the importance of adequate training for officials exercising law 
enforcement duties assigned to deal with public protests, and of refraining, to the extent 
feasible, from assigning military personnel to<b> </b>perform such duties, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the holding of the seminar on effective 
measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
context of peaceful protests on 2 December 2013 and of the summary of the seminar 
prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,1 in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 22/10;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. <i>Recalls </i>that States have the responsibility, including in the context of 
peaceful protests, to promote and protect human rights and to prevent human rights 
violations, including extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary arrest and 
detention, enforced disappearances, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, and calls upon States to avoid the abuse of criminal and civil 
proceedings or threats of such acts at all times;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon </i>States to promote a safe and enabling environment for individuals 
and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of 
association, including by ensuring that their domestic legislation and procedures relating to 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association are in 
conformity with their international human rights obligations and commitments, clearly and 
explicitly establish a presumption in favour of the exercise of these rights, and that they are 
effectively implemented; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> States to facilitate peaceful protests by providing protestors with 
access to public space and protecting them, without discrimination, where necessary, 
against any form of threat and harassment, and underlines the role of local authorities in 
this regard;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. <i>Underlines </i>the important<b> </b>role that communication between protestors, local 
authorities and officials exercising law enforcement duties can play in the proper 
management of assemblies, such as peaceful protests, and calls on States to establish 
appropriate channels in that regard; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Urges</i> States to pay particular attention to the safety and protection of women 
and women human rights defenders from acts of intimidation and harassment, as well as 
gender-based violence, including sexual assault, in the context of peaceful protests; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>7. <i>Reaffirms </i>that States must take all necessary measures to ensure the safety 
and protection of children, including while they exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly, expression and association, including in the context of peaceful protests;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all States to pay particular attention to the safety of journalists and 
media workers covering peaceful protests, taking into account their specific role, exposure 
and vulnerability; 
</p>
<p>9.<i> Urges<b> </b></i>all States to avoid using force during peaceful protests, and to ensure 
that, where force is absolutely necessary, no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate 
use of force;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon </i>States, as a matter of priority, to ensure that their domestic 
legislation and procedures are consistent with their international obligations and 
commitments in relation to the use of force and are effectively implemented<b> </b>by officials 
exercising law enforcement duties, in particular applicable principles of law enforcement, 
such as the principles of necessity and proportionality, bearing in mind that lethal force may 
only be used to protect against an imminent threat to life and that it may not be used merely 
to disperse a gathering;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. <i>Affirms </i>that nothing can ever justify &#8220;shoot to kill&#8221; practices as well as 
indiscriminate use of lethal force against a crowd, acts which are unlawful under 
international human rights law;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon </i>States to investigate any death or significant injury committed 
during protests, including those resulting from the discharge of firearms or the use of non-
lethal weapons by officials exercising law enforcement duties;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to ensure adequate training of officials exercising law 
enforcement duties and, where applicable, to promote adequate training for private 
personnel acting on behalf of a State, including in international human rights law and, 
where appropriate, international humanitarian law;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. <i>Encourages </i>States to make protective equipment and non-lethal weapons 
available to their officials exercising law enforcement duties, while pursuing international 
efforts to regulate and establish protocols for the training and use of non-lethal weapons;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of thorough, independent and scientific testing of 
non-lethal weapons prior to deployment to establish their lethality and the extent of likely 
injury, and of monitoring appropriate training and use of such weapons;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16.<i> Stresses </i>the importance of international cooperation in support of national 
efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the 
context of peaceful protests, in order to raise the capacities of law enforcement agencies to 
deal with such protests in a manner that conforms to their international human rights 
obligations and commitments;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. <i>Underlines </i>the necessity to address the management of assemblies, including 
peaceful protests, so as to contribute to their peaceful conduct, and to prevent loss of life of, 
and injuries to, protestors, bystanders, those monitoring such protests, and officials 
exercising law enforcement duties, as well as any human rights violation or abuse;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. <i>Recognizes </i>the important role played by national human rights institutions, 
civil society, including non-governmental organizations, journalists and other media 
workers, Internet users and human rights defenders, and other relevant stakeholders in 
documenting human rights violations or abuses committed in the context of peaceful 
protests;<b> </b></p>


<p>19. <i>Urges </i>States to ensure that national mechanisms, based on law in conformity 
with their international human rights obligations and commitments, can deliver 
accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and provide victims with access to a 
remedy and redress, including in the context of peaceful protests;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20.<i> Requests </i>the High Commissioner to prepare, from within existing resources, 
guidelines for facilitating and protecting peaceful protests based on good practices, with a 
view to assisting States in promoting and protecting human rights in the context of peaceful 
protests, in collaboration with the Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful assembly 
and of association, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions and other relevant special procedures, and in consultation with States and other 
relevant stakeholders, and to present those guidelines to the Human Rights Council at its 
thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this topic at its thirty-first session 
under agenda item 3.
