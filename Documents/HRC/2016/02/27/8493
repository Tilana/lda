<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011.  The review of Saint Lucia was held at the 4th 
meeting on 25 January 2011. The delegation of Saint Lucia was headed by: Donatus Keith 
St. Aimee, Ambassador/Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia to the United Nations in 
New York. At its 8th meeting held on 27 January 2011, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Saint Lucia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Saint Lucia: Ghana, Maldives and Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Saint Lucia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/LCA/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/LCA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/LCA/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Latvia, Maldives, Netherlands, 
Slovenia, Sweden and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to Saint Lucia through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet 
of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Saint Lucia indicated that the preparation of the national report had involved a 
broad-based consultation process at the national level with all relevant stakeholders.  The 
Ministry of External Affairs co-ordinated this process and led inter-ministerial meetings 
with relevant ministries, the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsman), and the Saint 
Lucia Non State Actors Panel &#8211; an umbrella body representing a cross section of Saint 
Lucia&#8217;s non-governmental organizations.  Written submissions were also requested from 
other non-governmental organizations representing various special interests. 
</p>
<p>6. Saint Lucia then provided details regarding the country&#8217;s background including its 
size, population and electoral process. It also recalled that it is a member State of the 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States 
(OECS). 
</p>
<p>7. Saint Lucia noted that its economy is primarily driven by the tourism sector, which 
has supplanted a previously robust agricultural sector. Continued infrastructural investment, 
a stable political environment, and an educated workforce have attracted foreign and 
domestic investment. However, like several of its Caribbean neighbours, Saint Lucia&#8217;s 
developmental capacity remains constrained due to vulnerability to external shocks such as 
the economic and financial crisis and natural disasters. </p>


<p>8. It was indicated that the Constitution of Saint Lucia guarantees the protection of 
fundamental rights and freedoms in keeping with the fundamental rights and freedoms 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).  
</p>
<p>9. Saint Lucia underscored its commitment to the protection and defence of human life 
as well as its commitment to prompt and unbiased investigation in all matters involving the 
killing of a human person, and to vigilance in the practice of governance so that all persons 
have equal rights under the protection of the law.   <b> </b></p>
<p>10. Additionally, the Constitution guarantees judicial redress to any individual whose 
rights may be infringed. Saint Lucia stated that a process of Constitutional Reform is 
ongoing and the report on this process is due soon. 
</p>
<p>11. Saint Lucia then provided details regarding its legal and court system. It also 
highlighted that, in its effort to progress towards international standards, Saint Lucia had 
become a party to regional and international human rights instruments and participated in 
the initiatives that follow: Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); International 
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD); Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); the Bel&#233;m 
do Par&#225; Convention; the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing 1995); the Brasilia 
Consensus; the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; the International 
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>12. Moreover, in the very near future, Saint Lucia intends to sign/ratify the following 
other International Conventions: International Convention on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR); the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD); and the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons.  
</p>
<p>13. Saint Lucia explained that it faced a number of challenges which had an impact on 
how certain problems were dealt with. It noted that the country had only become 
independent in 1979 and that the international environment since then has been extremely 
challenging. Additionally, because of its location, storms or hurricanes are annual events 
and these not only affect Saint Lucia directly but also regionally. 
</p>
<p>14. Saint Lucia stated that the cost of development is much higher in Small Island 
Developing States (SIDS) and that it must bear those costs even within a limited resource 
base. It is nonetheless classified as &#8220;middle income&#8221;, though that classification does not 
reflect the true nature of the challenges it faces. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding poverty, it was noted that this is the most important social issue facing 
Saint Lucia and that it is recognized that the alleviation of poverty is essential to promoting 
respect for human dignity and the realization of all other human rights.   
</p>
<p>16. Saint Lucia was encouraged by the findings of the most recent poverty assessment 
(2005/2006), which indicated that, whilst there was a slight increase in relative poverty, 
there was a dramatic decrease in extreme poverty.  This decrease has been attributed to 
multiple interventions, primarily led by State-sponsored programmes which have been 
complemented by the important and significant work of faith-based and other civil society 
organizations. Saint Lucia provided information on a number of existing programmes 
including: the revised National Insurance Corporation Act; the Social Development Fund; 
the Public Assistance Programme; and the Basic Needs Trust Fund.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. Regarding health, it was stated that Saint Lucia has made significant strides in 
securing and improving access to quality health care for its citizens.  This is reflected, inter 
alia, through a number of programmes and initiatives such as: health-care facilities which 
offer a range of services and care located within a three-mile radius throughout the country; 
the removal of doctors&#8217; fees at all health centres and the introduction of health exemption </p>


<p>cards for the elderly; consistently high child-immunization coverage; reduction in the 
incidence of communicable diseases and increased focus on non-communicable diseases; 
and the establishment of a New Mental Wellness Centre, fully equipped, which will allow 
for a significant improvement in the clinical management and rehabilitation of patients. 
Additionally a new Mental Health Act has been drafted. 
</p>
<p>18. A National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan has also been implemented providing: free 
antiretroviral drugs for all HIV/AIDS clients; free voluntary counselling and treatment 
services at all health facilities; mother-to-child prevention of transmission programme; and 
support for orphans and children living with HIV/AIDs. 
</p>
<p>19. In addition, a National Assessment on HIV/AIDS Law, Ethics, and Human Rights 
was implemented and a Human Rights Desk under the guidance of the Aids Action 
Foundation established. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding children, Saint Lucia stated it aimed to provide special safeguards and 
care to ensure the well-being of the child from the earliest stages of life so that the child is 
able to fully enjoy his/her rights through all stages of childhood. Consequently, efforts have 
been focused on inter alia: enhancing prenatal and post-natal care, ensuring the provision of 
skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care, elimination of childhood illnesses and 
the enhancement of early childhood care and education.   
</p>
<p>21. Saint Lucia stated that a major risk factor for children in the country is the 
breakdown of family life and the absence of the father in the home.  This has been 
identified by many studies as one of the major causes of social disintegration and has a 
profound negative effect on children, predisposing them to crime and increasing their risk 
for other antisocial behaviour.  Interventions therefore are focused on building strong, 
healthy families, which are recognized as &#8220;the fundamental group unit of society and the 
natural environment for the growth and well-being of its members and more particularly of 
children&#8221; (UDHR 16(3) (CRC preamble).    
</p>
<p>22. Saint Lucia referred to numerous measures adopted to address this situation. 
</p>
<p>23. Saint Lucia also stated that a new transit home for children who are victims of child 
abuse and neglect has been constructed, which is now being operationalized.  Additionally, 
a Draft Policy and Operations Manual for the Registration, Guidance, and Inspection of 
Children&#8217;s Homes has been developed.  
</p>
<p>24. Saint Lucia indicated that there have been improvements in conditions at the Boys 
Training Centre, which accommodates boys in conflict with the law as well as those in need 
of care and protection. Budgetary allocations have also been made to provide a building to 
house juvenile girls. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding education, Saint Lucia stated that tremendous strides have been made in 
31 years: from three secondary schools accommodating the most privileged of the 
population, to universal secondary education. The Education Act of 1999 governs the 
education system and makes education compulsory for all between the ages of five and 
fifteen.  It further prohibits the refusal of admission of children into school on any 
discriminatory grounds. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. It was indicated that a number of programmes, including textbook rental, school 
meals, and a transportation subsidy programme have been implemented at most secondary 
schools. All teenage mothers are allowed to return to school after the birth of their children. 
</p>
<p>27. Saint Lucia indicated that it has achieved universal primary and secondary 
education. It was added that, by reason of constraints it faces, Saint Lucia would welcome 
partners in the education system. </p>


<p>28. On the issue of gender equality and the empowerment of women, Saint Lucia 
indicated that the Government has demonstrated its commitment by creating a Division of 
Gender Relations.   
</p>
<p>29. Additionally Saint Lucia provided information on the following positive 
developments, including the increased participation of women in public and political life at 
the highest levels of decision-making; the fact that the Equality of Opportunity and 
Treatment in Employment and Occupation Act 2000 specifically provides redress for 
gender discrimination in the workplace, and also expressly prohibits sexual harassment; the 
introduction of the offence of marital rape in the Revised Criminal Code; the fact that 
female representation outnumbers that of males at all levels of the educational system; and 
the enactment of the Domestic Violence (Summary Proceedings) Act in 1994 which 
provides redress to victims of domestic violence, and the establishment of the Women&#8217;s 
Support Centre.   
</p>
<p>30. Saint Lucia stated that as a consequence of the strides made with respect to women, 
stereotypical attitudes are becoming far less prevalent. Through the existence of a national 
curricula for secondary and primary schools, females have access to the same curricula and 
examinations as males.  Available data consistently indicate that overall female 
participation and attendance at these institutions outnumbers that of males.   
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the question on the alleged link between prostitution and the tourism 
industry, it was clarified that prostitution is unlawful in Saint Lucia and that the 
Government does not condone this activity. It was further stated that there is no official 
data or research supporting any link between prostitution and the tourism industry in Saint 
Lucia. 
</p>
<p>32. Regarding the justice system, Saint Lucia stated that over the past decades, the level 
of crime in the country has escalated to unacceptable levels and new policies and 
programmes are being put in place to combat crime.  
</p>
<p>33. A number of positive developments in the overall administration of justice were 
noted, including: the formulation of a Strategic Plan for the Royal Saint Lucia Police; the 
enactment of a Police Complaints Act in 2003, which provides for the establishment of a 
Police Complaints Unit; and the establishment of a Legal Aid Authority board pursuant to 
the enactment of the Legal Aid Act 2007.    
</p>
<p>34. In response to the advance question regarding compensation for persons who allege 
police brutality, Saint Lucia clarified that, while there exists no State mechanism for 
compensation arising from such cases, with the introduction of legal aid it is possible for 
litigants to access the Legal Aid Fund to initiate such proceedings.  
</p>
<p>35. Saint Lucia also noted, inter alia, the following action with regard to the 
administration of justice: the enactment of the Criminal Code Amendment Act which came 
into effect in November 2006 and which addresses several gender issues; the fact that the 
Evidence Act 2002 secures and guarantees the effective testimony of children in legal 
proceedings in a child-friendly courtroom atmosphere; and that the Counter-Trafficking Act 
of 2010 is now in effect and its legislative provisions are very similar to that contained in 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons.  
</p>
<p>36. Saint Lucia added that a major step in fulfilling its human rights obligations with 
regard to the incarcerated, was taken in 2003 when it opened the Bordelais Correctional 
Facility, which houses five hundred (500) inmates. The operationalization of this 
Correctional Facility with its emphasis on rehabilitation of prisoners replaced a more than 
one-century-old prison compound, which offered very limited scope for proper 
rehabilitation measures, and housed inmates in unsanitary and less than humane conditions.   </p>


<p>Within the current facility programmes are offered in three areas: Education, Skills 
Development and Counselling.   
</p>
<p>37. With regards to detention of inmates awaiting trial, Saint Lucia indicated that the 
new Criminal Procedure Rules of 2008 establish effective processes for the active 
management of criminal cases, which greatly assists with expediting cases through the 
system. 
</p>
<p>38. Regarding the death penalty, Saint Lucia stated that it is reserved for the most 
heinous crimes.  It added that, whilst Saint Lucia has exercised a de facto abolitionist 
position in the last 15 years, having not performed any executions, it is not presently in a 
position to move towards an express moratorium on the use of the death penalty, or its 
abolition. Recognizing that Saint Lucia is a constitutional democracy, it must be stated that 
in recent times, due to the upsurge in certain crime, nationals have in fact been calling for a 
revival of use of the death penalty.  Further it is the understanding of Saint Lucia that use of 
the death penalty does not contravene international law.   
</p>
<p>39. Saint Lucia stated that its most daunting challenge is the lack of financial and 
technical resources required to fully cater to the human rights needs of our people.  
</p>
<p>40. It reiterated, however, that its lack of resources will not detract from its pursuit of 
the full enjoyment of human rights by its population.  
</p>
<p>41. Finally, Saint Lucia stated that that, while no requests have been made by Special 
Procedures mandate holders to visit Saint Lucia, it would have no difficulty issuing a 
standing invitation for visits. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>42. During the interactive dialogue, 36 delegations made statements. The delegation of 
Saint Lucia was thanked for its frank presentation of the report, for responses to advance 
questions and for Saint Lucia&#8217;s constructive engagement in the universal periodic review 
process. Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present 
report.  
</p>
<p>43. Algeria acknowledged the progress achieved by Saint Lucia in attaining the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) despite the difficulties it faces as a developing 
island state.  It noted that Saint Lucia is not a party to some key international human rights 
instruments. It noted that the HIV/AIDS was a development problem in the region and that 
a significant part of the urban population of the island lives in slums. Algeria made 
recommendations.   <b> 
</b></p>
<p>44. Cuba acknowledged the progress made by Saint Lucia in terms of human rights, 
particularly its commitment to reduce poverty and to achieve socio-economic development. 
Cuba noted the determination of Saint Lucia to ensure the right to universal education; the 
health measures taken, which have improved the access to health care; and the actions taken 
in the field of women&#8217;s rights, people with disabilities and the elderly. Cuba made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Chile noted that poverty constituted the most important social problem in Saint 
Lucia. It thus commended the commitment of the authorities to continuing to strengthen 
social programmes aimed at the most vulnerable groups.  Chile also recalled that it was 
working with the CARICOM countries to better cope with the vulnerabilities they face due 
to natural disasters. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. Morocco praised the commitment of Saint Lucia to development, democracy and 
respect for human rights.  It also noted the island&#8217;s efforts aimed at reducing poverty and </p>


<p>promoting equality between men and women and referred to the creation of shelters for 
victims of violence against women.  It requested information about measures that could be 
taken to remedy the low participation of women in the public and political spheres.  It noted 
the initiatives and efforts taken to protect children and persons with disabilities. Morocco 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. Brazil noted the progress made by Saint Lucia in the achievement of the MDGs, 
especially regarding universal primary and secondary education, the reduction of poverty, 
the rights of the elderly and the free provision of antiretrovirals to HIV/AIDS patients. 
Brazil expressed concern regarding violence against women and children, including sexual 
violence. Brazil expressed its availability to provide technical assistance and capacity 
building. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Singapore noted the progress made towards achieving the MDGs. It welcomed the 
commitment and initiatives taken to reduce poverty and support economic growth. 
Singapore commended the political measures taken to protect children&#8217;s rights, especially 
those aimed at ensuring the highest possible standard of alternative care and delivery of 
services to children at risk and in need of special care and protection. Singapore made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Hungary welcomed achievements made with regard to rights of people with 
disabilities and education. Hungary noted the link between poverty, food insecurity and 
health. It noted existing cooperation between Saint Lucia and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding asylum seekers and 
stateless persons.  It acknowledged the efforts of Saint Lucia for the promotion of gender 
equality but was concerned by the problem of violence against women, in particular by the 
fact that the Civil Code calls for the wife&#8217;s obedience to her husband. Hungary made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>50. Turkey welcomed the efforts made to achieve international standards in key social 
areas, particularly for the protection of children&#8217;s rights and for the rehabilitation of 
juveniles. Turkey supported Saint Lucia&#8217;s determination to improve education. Turkey 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>51. Spain commended Saint Lucia for its determination to fight against discrimination in 
all its forms and encouraged the country to revise its legislation in order to guarantee non-
discrimination in terms of gender, sexual orientation, health and disability. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. In response to questions regarding poverty, Saint Lucia recalled that it had made a 
transition from an economy based on agriculture to one based on tourism and that in the 
transition some of the progress that had been made was lost, though in the long run the new 
emphasis on tourism should bring in added resources that would enable it to address this 
issue. The Government is very aware of this issue and has adopted a number of measures to 
counter it and will continue to try to address it.  
</p>
<p>53. On the question raised regarding the obligation present in the Civil Code for the wife 
to be obedient to her husband, Saint Lucia stated that it had inherited a number of laws 
from before independence which will need to be reviewed and brought up to date. It added 
that the country was promoting a family-based approach so that it was probable that not 
only the reference to obedience would be removed but that the concept of a cooperative 
partnership be endorsed.  
</p>
<p>54. Regarding questions concerning the participation of women in public life, Saint 
Lucia reiterated the information provided in its opening statement recalling that the issue 
had to a great extent been addressed and that those at the highest level of the political 
echelon in the country are women. </p>


<p>55. On the issue of the ratification of conventions, Saint Lucia stated that a number have 
already been ratified and the ratification of a number of others is being examined. Saint 
Lucia indicated that one of the reasons why ratification could sometimes take some time 
was that it tried to ensure that when a treaty is ratified the mechanism to implement its 
provisions has been put in place. Saint Lucia stated that it welcomed technical assistance in 
this regard. Additionally, it was noted that the fact that a Convention has not been ratified 
does not mean that present practice is in contravention of its provisions. The example was 
given of a number of measures already adopted to ensure the rights of people with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>56. Canada recalled that despite a strong constitutional framework for human rights 
Saint Lucia lacked provisions guaranteeing equality for all citizens&#8217; regardless of sexual 
identity. It acknowledged steps taken to guarantee universal education and to eliminate 
violence in the family. It noted the lack of information on the magnitude of the problem of 
trafficking in persons. It was concerned by reports of excessive use of force by the police. 
Canada made recommendations. <b> </b> 
</p>
<p>57. South Africa noted the challenges faced by Saint Lucia and encouraged the 
international community to provide the country with technical assistance. South Africa 
requested information on action taken to bring domestic legislation into line with the 
international instruments not ratified by Saint Lucia. South Africa made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. France praised the existence of a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 
</p><p>1995.  It recognized, with satisfaction, the commitment of the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia 
to fight against discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation.  It 
noted, however, that the Penal Code criminalized sexual relations between men. France 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed satisfaction that 
Saint Lucia was prepared to extend an open invitation to Special Procedures. The United 
Kingdom was pleased to see the opening of the mental wellness facility and the drafting of 
a new national mental health policy.  It encouraged the Government to improve confidence 
in the justice and security sectors and to put in place independent systems to oversee 
juvenile justice. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Germany requested information on the follow-up by Saint Lucia to 
recommendations made by the International Labour Organization (ILO) Committee of 
Experts (2010) and by CEDAW (2006), specifically those regarding the prohibition of the 
use, procuring and offering of a child below 18 years for the production of pornography; 
and those regarding the amendment of the Citizenship of Saint Lucia Act of 1979 which 
contained discriminatory provisions against women. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Slovakia took note that the death penalty has not been applied since 1995.  It also 
noted the existence of gender-based stereotypical attitudes on the role of women in society 
and the persistence of child labour in the informal economy in urban areas. It observed that 
some provisions of CRC have not yet been duly reflected in the country&#8217;s domestic laws. 
Slovakia made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>62. Ghana congratulated Saint Lucia for the progress made towards achieving the 
MDGs. Ghana commended the country for a number of measures adopted, aimed at 
promoting the right to education. Ghana expressed concern about the stereotypical attitudes 
towards the role of women and on the extent of prostitution. Ghana made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>63. The United States of America remained concerned about the continued 
criminalization of homosexual conduct and the pervasive societal discrimination against 
LGBT persons. It added that the criminalization of homosexual conduct exacerbates </p>


<p>homophobic attitudes in the general population and prevents LGBT persons from taking 
advantage of opportunities afforded to other St. Lucians.  It looked forward to further 
cooperation with Saint Lucia to strengthen human rights in the country and the region. It 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>64. Poland welcomed efforts made by Saint Lucia to strengthen the protection and 
promotion of human rights. Poland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>65. Regarding the issue of discrimination of persons on the basis of their sexual 
orientation, Saint Lucia reiterated that the Constitution very clearly does not allow for  
discrimination against anyone. Matters regarding how a society interacts, what principles it 
is governed by and how it will evolve in the future clearly reveal a need for advocacy and 
changes in attitude of certain sectors of society. The question remains, however, whether 
such advocacy should be the role of the Government or whether it should be carried out by 
those who believe they are discriminated against.  
</p>
<p>66. On the issue of the death penalty, Saint Lucia recalled what had been explained in its 
opening statement and noted that in a democracy the Government acts with the consent of 
those being governed. Institutional reforms must be in harmony with the wishes of the 
population. Saint Lucia also recalled that the country is going through a process of 
Constitutional review and that it is important that during this review such issues are 
discussed by the different sectors of the population. 
</p>
<p>67. Saint Lucia added that the country has a strong tradition of members of the 
community helping each other and this tradition has enabled a number of issues and 
problems to be solved within it.  
</p>
<p>68. Maldives appreciated the replies provided by Saint Lucia to its advance questions. It 
noted the challenges and constraints faced by a small island like Saint Lucia in fully 
promoting and protecting human rights. It mentioned that, nevertheless, Saint Lucia has 
made progress and enjoys a stable democratic political system, respect for the rule of law 
and universal primary and secondary education. It also referred to efforts to achieve the 
MDGs and eradicating extreme poverty. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Italy commended Saint Lucia for the de facto abolitionist position of death penalty. 
Italy noted that women continue to face disadvantages and unequal situations in public and 
private life. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. China made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>71. Botswana recognized the investment that the Government has made in social 
development. It mentioned the establishment of the Police Complaints Unit and the 
establishment of the Legal Aid Authority Board as examples of the progress achieved in the 
area of human rights by St. Lucia and asked that the international community provide 
support. It requested further information on the programmes and policies regarding HIV 
and AIDS. Botswana made a recommendation. <b> </b> 
</p>
<p>72. Australia noted Saint Lucia&#8217;s support for the Ottawa process and its stance against 
anti-personnel landmines. It welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and the efforts 
made to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities. It noted that the country 
was considering becoming a party to CRPD. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Sweden welcomed Saint Lucia&#8217;s intention to ratify the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It referred to the de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty and requested information on the possibility of revoking it as a result of the increase 
in crime.  Sweden was also concerned by reports of use of excessive force by the police and 
asked for information on measures taken to address this issue. Sweden made 
recommendations.  </p>


<p>74. Argentina praised Saint Lucia for the budget increase allocated to the promotion of 
the rights of children and the elderly.  It also requested information on the possibility of 
introducing a formal moratorium on the death penalty and on measures taken to adjust 
domestic legislation to international standards in the areas of gender equality and family 
law. Argentina made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>75. Venezuela noted Saint Lucia&#8217;s commitment to fighting poverty and highlighted the 
measures taken to strengthen the Social Development Fund and the Public Assistance 
Programme as well as the creation of the Social Reform Council, measures aimed at 
supporting deprived communities and the needy. Venezuela made a recommendation.     
</p>
<p>76. Mexico recognized the commitment of Saint Lucia to reducing extreme poverty and 
ongoing programmes to protect children and raise the level of and access to education.  
Mexico made recommendations.
