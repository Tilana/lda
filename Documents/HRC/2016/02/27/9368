<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
visited Mexico from 4 to 15 May 2007. The Special Rapporteur visited the following places: 
Guadalaja ra (Jalisco), Tijuana (Baja California), Ciudad Ju&#225;rez (Chihuahua) and the Federal 
District. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government of Mexico for its 
cooperation and assistance, and his appreciation to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). At the federal, state and municipal levels, the 
Special Rapporteur met with a number of ministries responsible for law enforcement and child 
protection, and with representatives of the Ministry of Social Development, the Under-Secretary 
for Foreign Affairs, the head of the National System for the Comprehensive Development of the 
Family and human rights&#8217; commissions. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur conducted on-site visits to observe the situation of children on the 
streets and in bars, nightclubs and areas considered a social risk (violent neighbourhoods, border 
areas, markets with places for illicit sexual exchanges). He also visited a number of centres for 
child victims of exploitation and abuse, as well as a wide range of social services for the 
protection of minors. 
</p>
<p> The present report analyses the legal frameworks at the federal level and in the States 
visited. There follows a discussion of the various programmes and policies adopted by 
government and civil society actors, which the Special Rapporteur considers useful for 
combating the commercial sexual exploitation of children; measures taken to implement a 
general national strategy for children; and the authorities responsible for punishing crimes. The 
Special Rapporteur then compares the situation prevailing in each city visited, bearing in mind 
that, while the causes of the commercial sexual exploitation of children are similar in most 
places, the characteristics of the phenomenon, as well as the responses of State and municipal 
governments and civil society, vary from one place to another. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur makes recommendations that can be adapted to Mexico&#8217;s 
diverse situations, in order to have a greater impact on civil society. A stronger and more 
creative approach must be taken to combat child sexual exploitation; legislation must be 
harmonized, coordination between law enforcement authorities must be improved, and additional 
resources must be allocated to combat this phenomenon, bearing in mind that the commercial 
sexual exploitation of children is not an isolated incident and that efforts must be made in 
conjunction with the fight against impunity and organized crime.  </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Mexico, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography visited Mexico from 4 to 15 May 2007. The 
Special Rapporteur visited the following places: Guadalajara (Jalisco), Tijuana (Baja California), 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez (Chihuahua) and the Federal District to study the problem of the commercial 
sexual exploitation of children in Mexico.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks for the cooperation and assistance extended to 
him by the Government of Mexico in particular the National System for the Comprehensive 
Development of the Family, at the federal, State and municipal levels, which enabled him to 
meet with representatives of many official and non-official sectors in all places visited and to 
obtain the necessary information and documentation to be able to draft this report and report to 
the Human Rights Council in an objective and impartial manner. 
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the representative of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for his substantive 
contribution to the success of the visit, and to officials of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) for their logistical support. The Special Rapporteur is also grateful for the 
information, documentation and assistance provided by the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in Mexico in the preparation and 
conduct of his mission. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the United Nations 
Information Centre in Mexico for its efficient coordination with the media during his visit. 
</p>
<p>4. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met at federal level with the Ministry of Social 
Development, the Under-Secretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and with the head of the National System for the Comprehensive Development 
of the Family. He also met with high officials of procurators&#8217; offices of the federal judicial 
system, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Public Security, the Office of the 
Attorney General and with several members of Congress. In addition, at the State and municipal 
levels, the Special Rapporteur met with high-level officials of procurators&#8217; offices of the States 
and municipalities that he visited, representatives of the National Human Rights Commission 
and the Human Rights Commissions of several States as well as law enforcement and child 
protection officials. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur conducted on-site investigations in all the places he visited in 
order to observe for himself the situation of children on the streets and in areas of high social 
risk, bars and nightclubs. He also received, privately and confidentially, direct testimonies from 
victims and their families. In addition, he visited a number of child reception and assistance 
centres and met with child victims of exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur decided to visit Mexico as a follow up to the visit by the 
mandate-holder in 1997,<b>1</b> to observe how Mexico is implementing democratic change, which is 
giving rise to a very rich process of policy reform and structural transformations and generating

</p>

</b>  See E/CN.4/1998/101/Add.2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>new areas for citizen participation. In view of the importance of children&#8217;s policies, the Special 
Rapporteur was interested in initiatives that might have been adopted to combat existing 
problems by the federal Government and state governments and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) since the mandate-holder&#8217;s last visit to Mexico in 1997. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the situation relating to each city will be treated separately, bearing in 
mind that, while the causes of the commercial sexual exploitation of children are similar in most 
places, the characteristics of the phenomenon, as well as the responses of state and municipal 
governments and civil society, can vary considerably. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND MEASURES TO  
PROTECT CHILDREN&#8217;S RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Federal legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. The prohibition and punishment of the commercial sexual exploitation of children<b>2</b>  is 
mostly covered by articles relating to the corruption of minors, defined as &#8220;the inducement to 
dishonest lifestyles that result in the moral and physical degradation of the child&#8221;; and to 
<i>lenocinio</i>, defined as &#8220;the purposeful or incidental exploitation of the body of another person 
through the flesh trade&#8221;. Articles 17, 21 and 102 of the Mexican Constitution state that activities 
relating to the sale or trafficking and prostitution of minors, as well as child prostitution, shall be 
subject to investigation and punishment. 
8. The measures adopted to protect children against all forms of exploitation and sexual abuse 
are listed in Book Two of the Federal Criminal Code, Title VIII (Crimes against the free 
development of the personality), where the corruption of minors and child pornography are 
classified as crimes. Similarly, article 203 punishes anyone who through any means, encourages, 
advertises for, invites, facilitates or arranges for, a person or persons to travel within or outside 
the national territory for the purpose of having sexual relations with minors under 18 years of 
age. Punishment for the offences of corruption of minors and child pornography is increased 
when such offences are committed by public officials. Similarly, punishment varies in 
accordance with the age of the minor against whom the crime is committed. 
</p>
<p>9. Article 366, II, (e), of the Criminal Code prescribes a prison sentence of 25 to 50 years for 
trafficking in minors. This article is related to the new Federal Law against Organized Crime, 
article 2 (V) of which refers to trafficking in minors as a serious offence when it is carried out by 
persons who are members of a criminal organization; this offence is punishable by 4 to 16 years&#8217; 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>

Security, ILO-IPEC and INACIPE, Mexico City, 2005. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/8/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>10. Article 173 of the Federal Labour Act states that work carried out by any person between 
the ages of 14 and 16 shall be subject to monitoring and protection by labour inspectors. 
Article 175 of the Act prohibits the employment of minors under 16 years of age in places where 
alcoholic drinks are served or where their morality may be affected. 
</p>
<p>11. In February 2007, the Federal Congress adopted a decree<b>3</b> amending, supplementing or 
repealing certain provisions of the Federal Criminal Code, the Federal Code of Criminal 
Procedure and the Federal Law against Organized Crime, relating to the sexual exploitation of 
children. This reform not only increases penalties for some offences previously provided for 
(such as the corruption of minors under 18 years of age), but also for the first time classifies 
offences such as sex tourism involving persons under 18 years of age, all forms of child 
pornography, trafficking in persons under 18 and procuring of persons under 18 as serious 
offences. Under this reform, penalties are increased when the offences are committed by family 
members, guardians, public officials, teachers, members of the clergy, among others. A 
substantial change is the recognition that, if any of these offences are committed, in addition to 
being a flagrant violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, they are considered an 
offence against the free development of the personality of persons under 18 years of age, rather 
than an affront to public morals and decency, as previously stipulated. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Specific legal framework in the States visited 
</b></p>
<p>12. In August 2007, the Criminal Code of the Federal District was amended and now classifies 
the corruption of minors, child prostitution, sex tourism and pornography as &#8220;offences against 
the free development of the personality&#8221;, carrying a penalty of between 1 and 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment, with aggravating circumstances for each case. In the case of the prostitution of a 
group of minors, for example in brothels, the penalty can be up to 40 years&#8217; imprisonment, in 
addition to the imposition of fines and the complete and permanent closure of premises. The 
prostitution of a minor by another minor is not regarded as a criminal offence but as a &#8220;lack of 
discipline&#8221;, which requires the rehabilitation of the minor in a juvenile correctional institution, 
unlike child victims of commercial sexual exploitation who are referred to separate institutions 
for rehabilitation and care, such as children&#8217;s homes and shelters operated by NGOs. One 
concern that was also raised during discussions was the need to amend the Criminal Code in 
order to make it possible to file a complaint on behalf of the child without parental consent. 
Mention was also made of the need to bring national legislation on child pornography into line 
with that of other countries. 
</p>
<p>13. In the State of Baja California, under articles 261 to 281 quater of Title III, Chapter I 
(Crimes against the State), the corruption of minors carries a penalty of a fine and six months&#8217; 
imprisonment. In articles 264 to 266 of the same chapter, the exploitation of child prostitution 
carries a prison sentence of 8 to 21 years, a fine equivalent to US$ 500 to US$ 20,000 and the 
permanent closure of the premises. 
</p>
<p>

<p>the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Law against Organized Crime, relating 
to the sexual exploitation of children, <i>Official Gazette</i>, 27 March 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. Articles 182 and 183 of Title VI of the Criminal Code of the State of Chihuahua, 
which deals with offences against the development of the personality, prescribe a penalty 
of six months&#8217; to three years&#8217; imprisonment for corruption of a minor and a fine equivalent 
to 300 to 1,000 days&#8217; wages. Article 201 prohibits procuring, while article 184 criminalizes 
child prostitution, prescribing a prison sentence of between 1 and 10 years and a fine equivalent 
to between 50 and 5,000 days&#8217; wages. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2007, the Criminal Codes of the States of Baja California, Chihuahua and Guerrero were 
amended. Prostitution, pornography, sex tourism and trafficking for the purpose of the sexual 
exploitation of children and adolescents were included and made punishable as serious offences. 
However, it is noteworthy that only 5 of the 32 Mexican States have specifically criminalized 
offences against minors, which in practice seriously weakens federal laws. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMMES AND POLICIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  State programmes and policies 
</b></p>
<p>16. The National System for the Comprehensive Development of the Family (DIF) is the 
principal government organization dealing with children; through 32 State DIFs, it attempts to 
build capacity at the local level through child protection programmes. DIF was established in 
the 1930s to care for abandoned children in cities. It develops national child protection policies, 
as well as intervention and rehabilitation strategies for child victims. Its preventive strategies 
place emphasis on family integration as the core element in its programmes, since the main 
reason for the high number of street children in Mexico has been attributed to family 
disintegration. For this reason, DIF advocates that the legislative review process of provisions 
relating to children must be accompanied by a campaign to raise Mexican society&#8217;s awareness of 
children&#8217;s rights. In addition, the relevant legislation must be accessible to families at the local 
level in order to ensure the effectiveness of child protection. The empowerment of the family is 
considered to be the most effective tool for preventing child exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p>17. DIF in the Federal District has established a telephone hotline so that incidents of child 
abuse can be reported to qualified staff, who then send social workers to evaluate the situation. 
DIF also provides free legal assistance to families who require it and it is considering the 
possibility of providing psychological and educational support to families and vulnerable groups. 
In its dialogue with the Special Rapporteur, DIF noted that its biggest challenge was to obtain 
more concrete statistics on children in difficult circumstances in Mexico, in addition to 
expanding its programmes in rural and indigenous areas. 
</p>
<p>18. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur was informed that UNICEF has no programmes that 
specifically address the issue of the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Mexico. Many 
of its programmes deal indirectly with the issue,<b>4</b> such as programmes to eliminate domestic 
violence, increase social mobilization through the media, provide assistance to street children, 
etc.

<p>A/HRC/7/8/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>19. In 2001, the National Coordination Committee to Prevent, Address and Eradicate the 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children was established; it is headed by DIF. Under the 
Committee, 32 institutions, including most notably the National Human Rights Commission, 
are participating in the development of a national action plan to deal with the problem. This 
inter-agency committee operates through five subcommittees: coordination of efforts; 
prevention; care; legal protection and defence of children&#8217;s rights; and investigation. 
</p>
<p>20. Mention should also be made of the Programme to Prevent, Address and Eradicate the 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, under the National System for the Comprehensive 
Development of the Family. Its purpose is to promote systematic policies and actions to prevent 
the commercial sexual exploitation of children and adolescents and to provide care and 
protection for victims of, or persons at risk of becoming victims of, such exploitation, with the 
participation of the three branches of government, public and private institutions and civil 
society organizations at the national and international levels. They operate in 71 cities in 18 
Mexican States that are experiencing a high incidence of this phenomenon. In addition, it 
submits quarterly and biannual reports on action taken in States where the Programme operates, 
and provides advisory services and follows up on action taken by each of the 18 States. The 
National System for the Comprehensive Development of the Family also has a national 
children&#8217;s rights programme, entitled &#8220;National Network of Child Promoters&#8221;, through which 
children learn about their rights and in which their active participation is promoted. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the fact that there is an Office of the Special Prosecutor 
for Investigating Offences Related to Acts of Violence against Women (FEVIM) within the 
Office of the Attorney General. The Office of the Special Prosecutor was established in 2006 by 
the executive, bearing in mind the interests of various bodies and organizations, such as the 
academic community, civil society, parliamentarians and the commitment of women and men to 
fully respecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. FEVIM had its beginnings when irregularities were detected in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez 
(Chihuahua). The Attorney General held talks with the special commissions of the Chamber 
of Senators and the Chamber of Deputies with a view to ensuring that there was no recurrence, 
for any reason, of unpunished violence against women in Mexico, as had been the case in 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. This led women from the academic community, women politicians and feminists 
to consider the subject of violence against women in Mexico and to promote an instrument that 
would deal with this problem. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the valuable and professional work being carried out 
by the National Human Rights Commission of Mexico, particularly its efforts to raise children&#8217;s 
awareness of their rights by involving children themselves in such activities. With regard to 
training by and for children, the National Human Rights Commission has the objective of raising 
awareness of the human rights of women, children and the family from a gender perspective, and 
of the best interests of children, by carrying out training programmes that create a culture of 
respect for their rights and make it possible to ensure that such rights are observed every day in 
the family and society in general. The Special Rapporteur has welcomed the idea of using 
children both as a means and an end in the promotion of human rights, and hopes that this 
activity will continue to be promoted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also visited the &#8220;Casa del &#193;rbol&#8221; (Tree House), a project 
developed in 1996 by the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District, in which children 
have an opportunity to learn about their rights and express and protect them. The Special 
Rapporteur was very impressed by the innovative teaching methods and the materials used in 
this &#8220;Casa del &#193;rbol&#8221; and encourages the establishment of similar centres in all States. The 
Human Rights Commission of the Federal District goes out into the streets and works with 
children, teaching staff, fathers, mothers, and public service workers who are involved in any 
way with children. The activities of &#8220;Casa del &#193;rbol&#8221; - and the number of persons that it 
reaches - are increasing every year. Children learn about their rights through different and 
original teaching activities. They also have &#8220;outside&#8221; work, which takes them to communities in 
which violence frequently occurs, or to communities that do not have access to the Commission. 
The Human Rights Commission of the Federal District has also developed a model for the 
prevention of the ill-treatment and abuse of children, through which it publishes materials, such 
as a booklet on the prevention of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, which has been 
distributed in more than 900 secondary schools. Lastly, it should be pointed out that educational 
models, such as the diploma course on human rights and violence against children and 
adolescents, which is currently offered by the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District, 
have been developed. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur wishes to put on record his positive impression of the work being 
carried out by the Office of the Federal District Procurator, which informed him that measures 
are slowly being taken to make cases of abuse of minors more visible, and people are beginning 
to report cases of sexual exploitation. According to some recent cases, members of the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office told the Special Rapporteur that they were convinced that a slow process to 
halt the activities of criminal organizations was getting under way; they said that, &#8220;in order to 
end impunity, it is essential for people to feel close to the Procurator&#8217;s Office and to have faith in 
its honesty and capability&#8221;. &#8220;We are just beginning to discover the extent of child prostitution 
and trafficking in minors. We must fight against existing corruption and increase awareness of 
this issue, so that citizens feel that it is their duty to report these atrocious violations of children&#8217;s 
dignity. If there is no confidence, there are no reports, and if there are no reports, there are no 
investigations&#8221;, they said. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Civil society initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>26. Programmes are also being implemented by civil society associations to combat the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>27. During an interview with the organization &#8220;Espacios de Desarrollo Integral Associaci&#243;n 
Civil&#8221; (Spaces for Comprehensive Development AC; EDIAC), the Special Rapporteur was 
highly impressed by its extremely professional work in the La Merced area, with professionals 
from different fields carrying out research and developing solutions for minors in vulnerable 
situations and at risk of prostitution.<b>5</b> The organization collects information on significant aspects

</p>
<p>of community life (community leaders, problems, conflicts, failures, etc.) as a basis for 
conducting an analysis of the real situation. Once this assessment has been carried out, the 
organization creates a common meeting space for minors that is different from the places they 
usually frequent. At the Mechita Club, minors take part in activities relating to prevention, 
formal and informal education, sexual health, leisure, children&#8217;s human rights and promotion of 
children&#8217;s participation. 
</p>
<p>28. EDIAC also carries out community awareness-raising and outreach activities, in order to 
help people improve their living conditions and develop strategies to prevent child prostitution. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur also held an interview with the Mexican journalist and writer 
Lydia Cacho, a human rights defender and author of several works that have had a strong social 
impact. After writing <i>Los demonios del Ed&#233;n</i> (The Demons of Eden), she received threats and 
faced confrontations and conflicts with different authorities, including judicial proceedings. The 
book refers to a child prostitution and paedophile network generating huge amounts of money 
and involving public office holders who enjoyed protection until reports revealed the seriousness 
of what was happening. &#8220;The social fabric linking the sexual abuse of minors with commercial 
sexual exploitation, adult prostitution, money-laundering and drug trafficking is more visible 
than we and ordinary citizens would like to believe. This huge business [...] is sustained by 
corruption on a global scale&#8221;, Cacho told the Special Rapporteur. Hers is a courageous voice that 
should be heeded and protected in Mexico. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at 
continuing reports that this journalist and human rights defender is still the target of personal 
threats because of the work she is doing. 
</p>
<p>30. Another civil society initiative aimed at defending children&#8217;s rights before the courts is the 
Office of the Ombudsman for Children&#8217;s Rights, which sees judicial proceedings as a valid 
instrument for achieving &#8220;structural transformation&#8221; and wider defence of rights that are usually 
violated or ignored.

<p><b>C.  Measures for a general national strategy for children 
</b></p>
<p>31. In response to the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child concerning 
the need for close cooperation between the Government and civil society in the design and 
implementation of policies and programmes, the Mexican Government has prepared the 
Programme of Action 2002-2010: A Mexico fit for children and adolescents,<b>6</b> which is assessed 
annually. The Programme of Action takes its inspiration from the special session of the 
United Nations General Assembly on children, held in 2002, at which Mexico reaffirmed its 
commitment to children by endorsing the outcome document, entitled, &#8220;A world fit for children&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>

Adolescents, Mexico City, 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. Through the National Human Rights Commission, Mexico has carried out several activities 
to promote children&#8217;s rights by publicizing them and developing inter-agency public policies. 
These measures are specifically focused on areas such as civic education, health, sexual and 
reproductive rights, commercial sexual exploitation and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was informed that new activities have been found to initiate public 
debate on children&#8217;s issues, such as the National Human Rights Commission&#8217;s participation in 
the Joint Action Programme on Children&#8217;s Rights and Democratic Values in 1998, and against 
violence and ill-treatment. The National Forum on Children of Women Prisoners was held 
in 2001, with the participation of several federal organizations and agencies such as the National 
Institute for Women and the Ministry of Public Security, as well as UNICEF and the Equity and 
Gender Commission of the fifty-eighth Legislature of the Chamber of Deputies. 
</p>
<p>34. The Ministry of Social Development has done some very positive work, implementing 
innovative policies to combat rural poverty and acute manifestations of urban poverty. These 
include immigrant support clubs, childcare facilities (schools or cr&#232;ches), social assistance and 
credit programmes in the 100 poorest municipalities, and activities to raise awareness among 
employers and migrant families of the need for children to attend school, whatever the 
circumstances.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Punishment of offences 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur visited the Office of the Attorney General, where he heard positive 
reports of the wider scope afforded by the legal reforms of March 2007, which had improved the 
conditions for investigating cases of sexual exploitation of minors or human trafficking in the 
various States. Until then, it had been necessary to link these crimes to other offences over which 
there was jurisdiction. The fact that trafficking in minors, sex tourism and various forms of 
exploitation are now federal offences has enhanced the capacity to investigate and prosecute 
such offences. However, the Office of the Attorney General faces severe shortages of material 
and human resources to combat this type of offence, which could mean that laws enacted with 
the best of intentions could become a dead letter. Firm policy decisions should be accompanied 
by sound and sustainable management capacity. At the meeting with officials of the Office of the 
Attorney General it was pointed out that, in the light of the need to improve investigation 
methods to ensure that complainants are not deterred or harmed by intrusive practices, &#8220;we need 
to start treating victims like victims; things have to change; we cannot continue to mistreat 
victims, keeping them waiting for hours or in inappropriate places; we must be careful to tend to 
their wounds and investigate the perpetrators&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the Ministry of Public Security left a lasting impression. 
On the one hand, he was positively impressed by the steps taken by the Cybernetic Police Unit to 
prevent offences against minors. The Unit is staffed by highly trained personnel and equipped 
with excellent technological tools to fight child pornography and Internet crime. However, the 
investigative response to complaints is often not rapid enough; this wastes time, resulting in the 
loss of important leads that are crucial to solving cases. There are obvious operational difficulties 
involved in searching for missing or lost minors, since there is no central database of missing 
children. </p>

</p>
<p><b>III.  SITUATION AND PROBLEMS IN THE CITIES VISITED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Mexico City (Federal District) 
</b>37. With a population of over 20 million, including 10 million who come to work in the city 
from surrounding areas, Mexico City is one of the largest conurbations in the world. In a 
megalopolis of this size, there is obviously a huge number of street children (children who are 
cut off from their families and who either live or spend most of their time in the street). It is 
estimated that there were about 25,000 street children in the Federal District in 2000; however, 
according to NGO calculations, the figure is higher. It is also estimated that the large majority of 
street children in the Federal District are victims of sexual abuse at some time during their lives 
in the street. 
</p>
<p>38. Street children engaging in prostitution gather mainly in disadvantaged areas in the 
La Merced market (Cuauht&#233;moc municipality), at the Central del Norte bus terminal and in the 
Observatorio and Indios Verdes metro stations. There are reports of an increase in child 
prostitution in Mexico City, particularly prostitution involving girls from other parts of the 
country, such as the southern States. The main causes of the migration of girls who travel alone 
from rural areas to the city include unfavourable social conditions, unemployment, the lack of 
social support services and socialization and the lack of educational opportunities in their 
communities. 
</p>
<p>39.  Most of the girls move to the Federal District in search of a job only to end up in the street 
without money or shelter. In many cases, they have run away from a violent home life and are 
vulnerable to exploitation by pimps or <i>padrotes</i> when they reach the big city, where they do not 
know anyone. Places where exploiters (<i>galanes</i>) first make contact with girls who have just 
arrived include the area around the Basilica of Guadalupe, Alameda Central Park, Chapultepec 
Park and La Villa. 
</p>
<p>40. Prostitution among boys has also been observed in the Federal District, but to a lesser 
extent than among girls. Street boys and homosexual or paedophile clients seeking the sexual 
services of boys generally meet in the Plaza Garibaldi area. The boys are generally reluctant to 
talk about their experience, and further studies are necessary to gain an overview of the 
exploiters and corruption networks operating behind the scenes. This is one of the main obstacles 
faced by social workers in getting street children to participate in assistance programmes for any 
length of time. The NGOs working with these children estimate that some 2,500 girls and boys 
are exploited after falling into prostitution. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur observed the situation first-hand in the side streets of La Merced, 
where several of the people engaging in prostitution were minors. He was also able to see for 
himself that many of the market stalls sold pornographic videos and magazines during the day, 
even openly displaying signs advertising the child pornography content of the recordings. In 
some cases these turned out to be compact discs showing adult women, while others were blank; 
however, some did in fact include images of child abuse that are usually considered to be child 
pornography. This is indicative of the lack of municipal and police control over either child 
sexual exploitation in public places (side streets) or the sale of pornographic materials produced 
by means of abuse and exploitation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur urges the competent government authorities to carry out 
inspections to ensure that child pornography is not possessed, produced or distributed in Mexico 
and to coordinate inspections between the different public authorities to prevent such situations. 
</p>
<p>43. The spread of HIV/AIDS is another risk increasingly associated with the proliferation of 
child prostitution. The Special Rapporteur was informed that many clients prefer to have 
unprotected sex with young children, heightening their vulnerability to exploitation and 
HIV/AIDS infection. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Guadalajara 
</b>44. The city of Guadalajara, capital of Jalisco State, is located in the west central region of 
Mexico. Together with the adjoining municipalities of Tonal&#225;, Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, El Salto 
and Tlajomulco, which are part of the same metropolitan area, it ranks second among Mexican 
cities in terms of population and economic activity. 
</p>
<p>45. In Guadalajara, the Special Rapporteur was informed that children in commercial sexual 
exploitation fall into different categories depending on their situation. An estimated 2,000 street 
children work in public places, while some 400 live in such areas. Among the latter group of 
children, some occasionally engage in prostitution in order to survive, while a smaller number, 
around 80, do so regularly as their main livelihood. Most of them are boys, aged between 12 
and 17, who come mainly from poorer areas of the conurbation or from other Mexican States. 
They are usually to be found in the city centre, near the former truck terminal, in Madero and 
Javier Mina streets, although 51 focal points of drug use and prostitution have been identified 
throughout the city. Boys are reportedly sought both by local homosexuals, who usually meet 
them at night in Revolution and Morelos parks, and by foreign tourists who look for them mainly 
in the Plaza del Sol area. 
</p>
<p>46. Official police sources in Guadalajara informed the Special Rapporteur that, although 
police culture is changing, there is a need for a gradual improvement in attitudes in the police 
force. More training is necessary to equip officers and chiefs to handle complex circumstances, 
as well as psychological support to enable personnel to deal with potential risks and pressure so 
that they can resist corruption. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur visited the Centre for Specialized 
Care for Victims of Child Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Their Families, the first of its 
kind in Mexico, established through the joint efforts of the three branches of government. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Tijuana 
</b>47.  The municipality of Tijuana is located in the north-western part of the State of 
Baja California, on the border with the United States of America. Its population is estimated 
at over 1.5 million, which implies a 50 per cent increase in only five years and makes it one of 
the most highly populated cities in Mexico.  
</p>
<p>48. For a long time, Tijuana has had a double function owing to its position on the border: on 
the one hand, it is a transit point for anyone wishing to cross the border legally or illegally; on 
the other, it is a receiving area for people sent back at the border, who often stay there only 
because they hope to make a second attempt. In this regard, Tijuana has in recent years been 
characterized by a growing rootlessness among a large part of its population. This phenomenon </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/8/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>has arisen as a result of the crisis in both rural and urban areas of the country and at a time when 
the United States has toughened its migration policy. The Special Rapporteur was informed of 
the steady flow into Tijuana of persons intending to cross the border. During a visit to the 
Tijuana-San Ysidro border post, he was able to see for himself that this was one of the busiest 
border areas in the world, with 150,000 persons crossing legally every day; at the same time, it is 
an important point for the return of illegal migrants.  
</p>
<p>49. The sale of alcohol and the sex trade play an important part in economic activity in 
Tijuana. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in recent years, a difficult situation has 
arisen as a result of increasing drug use and violence by groups that have settled in the city and 
are competing for control of key sectors of the national and international drug markets. This has 
had an impact on local society, in which the sale and use of drugs are spreading. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was informed of some of the problems faced by girls and boys in 
Tijuana. These problems should be viewed in the context of the pressures exerted on local 
society as a whole by the presence of a large immigrant population. The fact that more and more 
children are in the street, using drugs or involved in illegal migrant smuggling or drug trafficking 
only increases their vulnerability and exacerbates the likelihood of their becoming victims of 
sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>51. During his visits to bars and other popular night spots in Tijuana, both during the day and 
at night, the Special Rapporteur observed that these highly frequented places were surrounded by 
many other commercial establishments, ranging from hotels and restaurants to taco stands. He 
was informed that several groups of minors were involved in the local sex trade. He was also 
told that there was a proliferation of other businesses employing minors who provided sexual 
services, such as massage parlours, beauty salons, spas and escort or modelling agencies. All of 
these operate outside the public health inspection system, since they are not registered as 
establishments providing sexual services. There is therefore no information as to the number of 
minors employed in them and the conditions in which they work. 
</p>
<p>52. The bars also revealed the existence of an extensive sex market with international 
connections, and were also reportedly a place for human trafficking and smuggling. Although 
bars, nightclubs and so-called &#8220;table dance&#8221; clubs (with nude dancers or pole dancing) are now 
subject to increased police supervision, minors can still be found working in some of them. 
Supervision is far less effective in the case of commercial establishments that are not on the main 
avenues or which operate clandestinely in outlying areas or disguise the nature of their activities. 
In this connection, a very active role is played by touts (<i>jaladores</i>) who approach tourists, 
offering them a wide variety of sexual services. 
</p>
<p>53. According to police sources, cases of child pornography and sexual exploitation to supply 
both local demand and potential clients in San Diego and other parts of the United States, are 
being investigated. 
</p>
<p>54. The Human Rights Procurator explained that a programme had been launched two years 
earlier to combat sexual exploitation in the &#8220;bilateral corridor&#8221; between the United States and 
Mexico. A prostitution ring was identified, with connections in the public administration to 
protect it from prosecution. Although over the past two years the programme has examined a 
number of cases involving trafficking in adults and children, sexual offences and child sexual </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>exploitation, the official in charge pointed out that &#8220;the data registered are minimal compared to 
the real situation in Baja California, Tijuana and Rosarito&#8221;. He also referred to the problem of 
impunity and alleged complicity between certain officials and bar and nightclub managers. 
According to another source, there are many minors in Tijuana who do not live on the street, but 
in <i>cuarter&#237;as</i>, places hidden in bars, nightclubs, hotels or houses where they are at a high risk of 
sexual exploitation and which are very difficult for the authorities to reach. Some NGOs also 
pointed out that it is common for children from other parts of the country to come and live in 
Tijuana bars, from which they are subsequently taken across the border to be exploited.  
55. In a shelter run by the System for the Comprehensive Development of the Family (DIF) for 
the State of Baja California, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to hear that abandoned 
minors cannot stay in the shelter for more than three months and often have nowhere to go once 
this period has expired. During his visit, he observed the care given to five babies who had been 
abandoned by their drug-addicted mothers, a dramatic situation that is indicative of the serious 
circumstances faced by many minors in Mexico&#8217;s border areas. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed of the alarming number of 201 children and 31 babies who were being sheltered by the 
State DIF. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Unit for the Reception, Care and Referral of 
Migrant Minors located at the border post with the United States. There he heard direct, vivid 
and staggering accounts of the number of repatriated children who had been travelling alone 
until they reached the Unit. The Special Rapporteur is profoundly concerned that, at this border 
crossing alone, between 10 and 20 unaccompanied minors are repatriated every day. The same is 
true of other crossings. This grave situation raises the question as to what happens to minors who 
do not return, and how many of them are subjected to abuse and exploitation when they are taken 
to the United States by smugglers or <i>coyotes</i>.  
</p>
<p>57. At the Unit, the Special Rapporteur interviewed children and adolescents, along with the 
staff and some family members who arrived hours later to pick up the repatriated minors. The 
stories were all alarming. The Special Rapporteur heard a typical story from a 14-year-old girl 
named Carolina. She came from Aguascalientes, where she had lived and experienced problems 
with her mother and her boyfriend. Since her aunt and uncle lived in the United States, she 
decided to go there. Her uncle introduced her to someone to help her and she managed to fly to 
Tijuana, where she obtained a false document to go to the United States. However, she was 
detained while attempting to cross the border. Her testimony revealed the existence of an active 
network to send adolescents to cities in the United States and the rapid means of transporting 
them from distant Mexican cities to the border. It also raises serious doubts as to what would 
have awaited the girl if she had managed to reach her destination, where she would probably 
have been met by an exploitation network rather than a relative. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also made the acquaintance of a 4-year-old child named 
Humberto, who was repatriated unaccompanied by an adult. As he was given water and food in 
the Unit, his dusty clothes still bore the traces of his crossing through the desert, and his face 
showed signs of anxiety and exhaustion. Someone had paid a <i>coyote</i> US$ 1,800 to get him across 
the border into the United States. His uncle was coming to take him back to Guerrero, where he 
came from.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/8/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur would like to place on record the excellent work being done by the 
DIF Unit at the border crossing between Tijuana and the United States, where he witnessed the 
reception, care and appropriate treatment given to deported children who arrive at the Unit every 
day after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the border, from which they returned exhausted, 
anxious and with a deep sense of failure. They are then reunited with their families and referred 
to assistance programmes in order to prevent the recurrence of such migration, which carries a 
high risk for children&#8217;s integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Ciudad Ju&#225;rez 
</b></p>
<p>60. The municipality of Ju&#225;rez is situated in the northern part of the State of Chihuahua on 
the border with the United States. It is one of the country&#8217;s most important border areas, and 
it is estimated that a little more than one third of Mexico&#8217;s population lives there. Today, 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez has some 1.6 million inhabitants; if this figure is correct, this would mean that, in 
only five years, its population has increased by half and is more than double the population of its 
twin city, El Paso, on the other side of the border. This growth rate, which is markedly different 
from the growth rate of other cities in the State and in the country, can be explained by the large 
number of people - some 300 - who arrive in the city every day, either with the intention of 
crossing the border, which most of the time is unsuccessful, or to find employment in the city&#8217;s 
maquiladora (assembly plant) industry. In fact, of the approximately 900,000 workers employed 
in the country&#8217;s maquiladoras, 600,000 work in border municipalities, and almost one third of 
them in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. 
</p>
<p>61. The principal maquiladora industries in the city produce textiles, electronic goods and 
transport equipment. The growth of this sector in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez has been characterized by a high 
level of female employment, which has led to profound changes in the family and social life. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that these enterprises prefer young women and minors because 
they are considered to be a more docile labour force, less informed of their rights and less 
inclined to assert them, and more capable of putting up with meticulous and monotonous work 
and hard days in the maquiladoras; all this, combined with low salaries, increases the rate of 
return and the comparative advantages. 
</p>
<p>62. The growth of this sector has attracted large numbers of young women and minors from 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, rural areas and other States. These people move to the city expecting to find 
employment and to settle there, or to put together resources to cross the border. In other cases, it 
was mentioned that some young women were recruited for the sex trade after having tried to 
work in a maquiladora and having found that their salaries did not enable them to meet their 
needs, particularly when they had children to support. It is also alleged that a large number 
of the more than 200 murders - following rape and ill-treatment - that have taken place in 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez since 1993, involved young women or minors employed in maquiladoras. The 
Special Rapporteur noted that this situation demonstrates the high level of violence against 
women and the tolerance for such violence in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez; moreover, the victims are young 
women or girls, who are doubly vulnerable, both because of their gender and age and because </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>they belong to less advantaged social groups.<b>7</b> At the same time, the fact that this continues to 
occur can affect the ability of the authorities to provide adequate protection for this sector, 
enforce the law and apprehend the attackers. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was informed that bars, dance halls and brothels have long been an 
important part of economic life in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. This is because Ciudad Ju&#225;rez is a transit area 
for many people who are not from the locality, and because it is situated a stone&#8217;s throw away 
from the border with the United States. The availability of this type of sexual service in 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, and the response to the many job applications from persons who arrive in the 
city, is complemented by the demand for such services by persons passing through the city and 
by persons coming from the other side of the border because it is easier for them to evade the 
controls that exist where they live. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the large number of minors who, in recent 
years, have attempted to cross into the United States on their own in search of family members 
or with the hope of finding a job. 
</p><p>65. The wave of murders of women and girls in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, which has made the city 
notorious throughout the world, continues to be a mystery. According to the information and 
testimonies - ranging from private interviews with victims&#8217; families to meetings with leaders and 
humanitarian organizations - that the Special Rapporteur collected on site, everything indicates 
that the deaths are the tip of an iceberg that goes far beyond this particular city, revealing a more 
generalized situation of violence against women and minors. Such violence is largely caused by 
various forms of domination in the family and the workplace and by sexual exploitation. 
Machismo continues to be an obstacle, and the fact that women are beginning to participate in 
society is not tolerated by certain sectors that continue to believe that women are second-class 
citizens subservient to men. To a large extent, the response to women&#8217;s emancipation and 
liberation and their increasing assertion of their rights has been the terrible forms of violence 
against them, which are evident in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. 
</p>
<p>66. The data collected are overwhelming: in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, violence has also targeted minors. 
Between 1993 and 2005, 101 minors were murdered. Also between 1993 and 2005, 36 women 
disappeared without a trace, without any information concerning their whereabouts. The study of 
the victims&#8217; profiles reveals, coincidentally, a history of domestic violence, deprivation, 
difficulties at work and very limited possibilities of obtaining access to State assistance or 
protection services. 
</p>
<p>67. Some experts consider that there is a regular pattern of sexually motivated murder of 
women and girls in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, since investigations have linked a large number of the deaths 
to sexual abuse, commercial exploitation of prostitution, domestic violence initiated by 
</p>

</p>
<p>emotional or sexual disagreements and the unmistakable traces of organized criminal groups that 
have international contacts and are involved in drug trafficking, the sex trade and the smuggling 
of goods and persons over the nearby border. 
</p>
<p>68. In this regard, Ciudad Ju&#225;rez would not be an exception in Mexico, a rare case of violence 
caused by the unruly life of a border town, but an expression of suppressed violence that has 
been accumulating for years and which flared up here and was extensively covered by national 
and foreign media, sounding an alert about what also occurs (according to both governmental 
and non-governmental sources) in many other Mexican cities. 
</p>
<p>69. As a symbolic expression of its concern at the violence unleashed against girls in Ju&#225;rez, 
the Special Rapporteur travelled to the cotton field known as &#8220;El Caballito&#8221; where, in recent 
years, a number of women&#8217;s bodies were buried. In addition, accompanying a group of family 
members of victims of violence, the Special Rapporteur brought an offering of flowers to a site 
on the outskirts of the city and at the foot of the mountain where the lifeless body of a kidnapped 
and heinously murdered girl had been found. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>70. Mexico has made great strides in recent years in the protection of the human rights of 
children through its ratification of international conventions and protocols that have not only 
been incorporated into domestic legislation but which also serve as models for amending and 
updating national legislation and relevant social policies. The Mexican Government&#8217;s openness 
to international scrutiny is also noteworthy; Mexico assumes that the protection of human rights 
is binding on the entire international community and not only on national States. 
</p>
<p>71. A very positive development has been the process of adopting a law against trafficking in 
persons, and the drafting of the National Human Rights Plan is to be commended. Another 
welcome development is the growing and positive trend on the part of civil society to call for a 
rights-based modernization of legislation in all States, which means that human rights must no 
longer be conceived as values guaranteed only by the State, but as a challenge for the entire 
community. 
</p>
<p>72. Nevertheless, the system of protection is still too centralized in the State, which prevents 
many social networks from reaching populations in need of their assistance, particularly in 
border areas, tourist destinations and large cities, to combat the sexual exploitation of children. 
Relations between the State and civil society are still not strong enough to combat child sexual 
exploitation, and opportunities for cooperation, in which the public sector could benefit from the 
dynamism and creativity of civil society in order to get to the root causes of poverty and 
violence, are therefore lost. 
</p>
<p>73. There is no effective system to protect and provide assistance to children and young people 
who have been victims of the offences of sexual exploitation or any form of trafficking. Social 
rehabilitation or reintegration programmes are practically non-existent. This lack of assistance by 
the State or non-governmental sectors to child victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking is 
one of the causes of revictimization. There are not enough of these programmes to address the 
current situation; the programmes that exist are intended for victims of domestic violence which, 
although they have a number of similar points, are not sufficiently specialized to provide </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>assistance in treating serious psychological, physical and emotional damage. This can make 
victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking very vulnerable to the same or new networks of 
exploiters and traffickers, who are aware of their weaknesses. A new generation of public 
policies for children, capable of halting the increase in the trafficking of minors and the sexual 
exploitation of children and adolescents has yet to be developed. 
</p>
<p>74. The educational system is neither technically nor administratively prepared to receive 
reports of abuse, exploitation and trafficking from its students. Bearing in mind that the 
educational system is well established throughout the country, an opportunity is being lost to 
make it the first barrier for preventing violations of the human rights of children and young 
people, although the activities of the National Human Rights Commission and its programme of 
child promoters of human rights in schools should be mentioned. 
</p>
<p>75. The sexual exploitation of and trafficking in children, particularly in border areas, tourist 
destinations and large cities can become an uncontrollable pandemic unless intensive and 
profound efforts are made to amend social policies on children in order to reach critical areas 
before situations of exploitation and abuse are established with impunity. 
</p>
<p>76. Far from being a home-grown or spontaneous phenomenon committed by isolated 
offenders, the sexual exploitation of children and young people is related to various forms of 
organized crime and clandestine circuits of the sex trade, where the vast amount of money 
generated by such activities, and corrupt connections with various bodies in the State sector, 
facilitate exploitation and frequently make it impossible to prosecute the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>77. Although specific situations can vary in each State, city and locality, in accordance with 
the personal and professional characteristics of the staff involved, the testimonies gathered 
overwhelmingly point to corruption and police negligence as one of the main causes of 
exploitation and trafficking. Inefficiency, poor training, corruption and the lack of adequate 
protocols and monitoring regulations, endemic in various police and municipal agencies 
responsible for ensuring that no minors are exploited in the so-called &#8220;sex trade&#8221;, is conducive to 
the activities of speculators and opportunists who wish to offer their &#8220;clients&#8221; adolescents and 
children. 
</p>
<p>78. Lastly, the social situations in the country&#8217;s northern border region pose an extremely high 
risk for children and adolescents. Traffickers, smugglers and <i>polleros</i> (or <i>coyotes</i>, - smugglers of 
illegal immigrants) take minors across the border, sometimes in order to reunite them with 
family members who have emigrated and sometimes to hand them over to exploiters. In this 
regard, cases of children who, having illegally entered Mexican territory, have been deported, 
have not been sufficiently studied. Many of these children are in need of international protection, 
since they are fleeing not only poverty but also <i>maras</i> (juvenile gangs), criminal groups, violence 
and abandonment by their families and society. They are returned to countries that lack adequate 
protection networks and where due attention is not given to their future reintegration; this 
exposes them to new risks of trafficking and exploitation. </p>

<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
requests, comments and proposals: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Special Rapporteur urges political actors to ensure that the protection of 
children and, in particular, efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and 
adolescents, is a national priority supported by all political sectors, in which everyone has 
something to contribute, from the most distinguished leaders to the most humble citizens, 
to save future generations from this scourge besetting the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Of the 31 Mexican States, only three punish child prostitution as a serious 
offence. All Mexican States must punish child prostitution as a serious offence, just as sex 
crimes are qualified as serious offences in the legislation of the various Mexican States, 
with a view to ensuring genuine protection of children&#8217;s rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) There have been repeated calls for procurators&#8217; offices to respond more quickly 
to reports that they receive, in order to take action to protect potential victims. The various 
procurators&#8217; offices require additional technological resources, better training, better 
contact with their counterparts in other parts of the world and closer ties with society so 
that they have greater support for combating the offence more effectively; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The fight against organized crime is already a priority for the Mexican judicial, 
tax and police authorities. Efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and young 
people, who are easy victims of unscrupulous persons involved in other criminal activities, 
such as drug trafficking and smuggling, should also become a priority; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Owing to people&#8217;s fear of lodging a complaint, the State&#8217;s credibility has been 
weakened. In order to strengthen it, the Special Rapporteur recommends such steps as 
establishing a witness protection system in cases of trafficking and smuggling in order to 
encourage citizens to lodge complaints and not to resign themselves to what they consider 
to be inefficiency, corruption or passivity on the part of public institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The police require better training about victims of trafficking, smuggling, 
domestic violence and sexual abuse. The Cybernetic Police also needs more support and 
resources in order to ensure that the positive actions that are currently being taken can be 
expanded to address more demanding criminal realities. To this end, cooperation with 
other countries is essential; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Special Rapporteur considers it necessary for the State to maintain its lead 
role in the area of policies on children; the State should also carry out a vigorous 
decentralization exercise and transfer resources to organized civil society in order to enable 
it to reach places that are inaccessible to the State. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The existing policies are not sufficient for creating a new and genuine protection 
system. In order to achieve this, the Special Rapporteur recommends: </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) The initiation of a national dialogue, in which the State and NGOs can draw up 
a plan of action for the next 15 years, with shared responsibilities, common goals and 
innovative policies. Civil society is of key importance for strengthening the democratic 
process and combating the sexual exploitation of and trafficking in children, and its social 
interventions should be encouraged, not hindered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The creation of a high-level national council on children that reflects the diverse 
proposals of civil society and State programmes and which can formulate ways of 
developing a new model for providing minors with comprehensive protection and 
assistance. He also recommends the creation of an ombudsman for children in order to 
facilitate the decision-making process and the formulation of new policies that have been 
delayed for too long; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) There is currently no rapid response mechanism for cases of disappearances of 
minors. The Special Rapporteur proposes the creation of a focal point for receiving 
information and coordinating an emergency search system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Special Rapporteur notes the establishment of a free telephone hotline in 
the Federal District to receive all types of complaints from minors. It would be very useful 
to have a free national hotline accessible in all parts of the country to enable people to 
report cases of trafficking in minors or disappeared persons, and to assist minors in 
complete confidentiality. He also recommends that the hotline operate 24 hours a day in 
order to be able to receive emergency calls; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Special Rapporteur recommends the establishment of special centres that 
are fully equipped to provide emergency assistance to minors who have been victims of 
child commercial sexual exploitation. The existence of various civil society programmes 
with different technical expertise and with diverse proposals would be useful in order to 
have a wide range of possibilities and strategies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Special Rapporteur recommends the strengthening of relations with the 
International Labour Organization and, specifically, the International Programme on the 
Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), which continues to form institutional alliances that 
define measures to combat child labour, encourages the development of national policies, 
promotes protective legislation and works to strengthen existing organizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Special Rapporteur recommends that special emphasis be placed on 
responsible tourism. He recommends that Mexico sign the Code of Conduct for the 
Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism, which is designed 
to establish the ethical norms to be followed by the tourist industry, thereby creating a 
shared social responsibility that respects and protects children&#8217;s rights. The Special 
Rapporteur also recommends more active cooperation between the Government of Mexico 
and national and foreign tourist industries with a view to improving the protection of 
children from these crimes. In addition, the various governments of the Federation should 
take care when they establish guidelines to be followed in their tourism policies in order to 
prevent - as has already occurred in the past - the State from encouraging investments that 
are linked to networks that exploit minors. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/8/Add.2

</p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the lack of complete, credible and 
consistent information concerning the series of offences committed against minors in 
connection with prostitution and child pornography that have occurred in recent years in 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. The Special Rapporteur recommends the establishment of a truth and 
prevention commission in that city, composed of government representatives and 
representatives of victims&#8217; families, humanitarian organizations and eminent persons of the 
city, which would have the objective of compiling all available information and making 
proposals concerning social prevention in order to avoid the recurrence of such offences. 
This group could proceed to the creation of &#8220;a book of hope and never again&#8221;, in which 
cases could be registered and the community could express its commitment to forms of 
coexistence in security and development that would help to prevent these unpunished 
forms of violence. The Special Rapporteur also recommends the erection of a monument or 
memorial in honour of the victims, which should be placed in a central area in order to 
demonstrate civilians&#8217; commitment to peaceful coexistence and respect for human rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Child commercial sexual exploitation is still a subject that has received little attention 
from researchers, in spite of the interesting works that the Special Rapporteur found at the 
University of Guadalajara. The Special Rapporteur urges the Mexican academic 
community, which is intellectually rich and innovative in many areas, to make an in-depth 
study of subjects relating to the protection of minors. 
</b>83. <b>It often happens that members of a minor&#8217;s immediate family live in the United States 
of America, while members of the minor&#8217;s non-immediate family - for example, distant 
aunts and uncles or cousins - live in Mexico. This leads to a situation in which minors who 
have been deported back to Mexico often find it difficult to face the trauma of having been 
deported and having to leave their nuclear family in the neighbouring country; this leads to 
very traumatic situations of separation. The Special Rapporteur recommends the 
conclusion of a bilateral agreement that would grant such children amnesty and enable 
them to return to the United States to be with their immediate family.
