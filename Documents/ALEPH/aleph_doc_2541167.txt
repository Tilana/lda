stock upon the mandatory conversion or earlier exchange of all the one million 
shares of its Series
B Preferred Stock. Any outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock are
expected to be
mandatorily converted into shares of our common stock on December&nbsp;12, 2005.
The holders of the
60,000,015 shares of common stock issued on June&nbsp;10, 2005 in the debt for 
equity exchange
transaction will acquire the 554,139,356 shares of common stock to be issued, 
which total shares
are equivalent to 95% of the Company&#146;s aggregate outstanding common stock. 
If the holders of these
shares of common stock act together, they will be in a position to control or 
exercise substantial
influence over the outcome of all matters requiring a stockholder vote. The 
conversion or earlier
exchange of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock will result in further, 
significant dilution to the
Company&#146;s stockholders and the book value per share of the Company&#146;s 
common stock. Accordingly, any
investment in the Company&#146;s common stock will continue to be highly 
speculative.

current trends and the earnings guidance
disclosed in this press release. The marine construction industry is highly 
competitive, and
trends and guidance are subject to numerous factors and influences, some of 
which are discussed in
the cautionary language below in this press release. The Company disclaims any 
obligation to update
disclosed information on trends or targets other than in its periodic filings 
with the Securities

Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)&nbsp;financial
measure of EBITDA, as defined. Horizon calculates EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization) as net income or loss excluding income taxes, net
interest expense,
depreciation and amortization, interest expense related to the conversion of the
Series&nbsp;B Preferred
Stock, loss on debt extinguishment and non-cash charges. Horizon has separately 
identified non-cash
charges which are non-recurring, infrequent, unusual, or isolated or the result 
of special
circumstances and has excluded these non-cash charges from the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">calculation of 
EBITDA. Horizon has aligned the disclosure of EBITDA with the financial
covenants in the Company&#146;s material credit agreements with various lenders,
including maintaining a
required positive EBITDA, as defined. Horizon believes that EBITDA is a material
component of the
financial covenants in the Company&#146;s credit agreements and non-compliance 
with the covenants could
result in the acceleration of indebtedness. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is
derived from items
in Horizon&#146;s GAAP financials and is used as a measure of operational 
performance. Horizon believes
EBITDA is a commonly applied measurement of financial performance by investors. 
Horizon believes
EBITDA is useful to investors because it gives a measure of operational 
performance without taking
into account items that Horizon believes do not relate directly to operations or
that are subject
to variations that are not caused by operational performance. This non-GAAP 
measure is not intended
to be a substitute for GAAP measures, and investors are advised to review this 
non-GAAP measure in
conjunction with GAAP information provided by Horizon. EBITDA should not be 
construed as a
substitute for income from operations, net income (loss)&nbsp;or cash flows from
operating activities
(all determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing 
Horizon&#146;s operating
performance, financial position and cash flows. Horizons computation of EBITDA 
may not be
comparable to similar titled measures of other companies.
