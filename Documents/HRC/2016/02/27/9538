<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
</p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-country 
basis, summaries of reliable and credible allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment that were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, 
and were transmitted to the Governments concerned. It also contains replies from Governments. 
This addendum does not illustrate the state of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment throughout the world, but rather reflects the state of information 
brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does he 
support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a 
non-derogable right, and every human being is legally and morally entitled to protection. When 
the Special Rapporteur receives reliable and credible information that gives grounds to fear that a 
person may be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, he may transmit an urgent appeal 
to the Government concerned. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have a 
humanitarian and preventive purpose, and do not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies. 
Governments are requested to clarify the substance of the allegations, take steps to protect the 
person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to investigate the allegations and prosecute and impose appropriate 
sanctions on any persons guilty of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, i.e. from 16 December 2005 to 15 December 2006, the 
Special Rapporteur sent 79 letters&#8727; of allegations of torture to 35 Governments and 157 urgent 
appeals* to 60 Governments on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other forms 
of ill-treatment. Government responses received up to 31 December 2006 have been included. 
The responses received after that date will be duly reflected in a future communications report. 
 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the timely responses received from Governments to 
the letters and urgent appeals transmitted. He regrets that many Governments fail to respond, or 
do so selectively, and that responses to older cases remain outstanding in large part. 
 
</p>
<p>5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been 
obliged to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received, with attention given 
to information relating specifically to allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. As a result, requests from Governments to publish their 
replies in their totality could not be acceded to. Moreover, attention is given to information in 
Government replies specifically relating to the allegations, particularly information on the 
following: 
 
</p>
<p>(a) What steps were taken to ascertain the veracity of the facts alleged? 
                                                 
</p>
<p>&#8727;
 Includes joint action with other special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights. General statistical 
</p>
<p>information on communications sent by special procedures in 2005 is available on OHCHR website : 
http://www.ohchr.org. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/33/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(b) Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim? 
(c) The details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, 
</p>
<p>and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the case. 
(d) Full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken (e.g. penal, disciplinary or 
</p>
<p>administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrator(s)). 
(e) What compensation and rehabilitation have been provided to the victim or the 
</p>
<p>family of the victim?

M. Madjid Benyamina auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s le 
9 septembre 2005 &#224; l'a&#233;roport d'Oran par des

aurait &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233; apr&#232;s quatre jours de d&#233;tention et 
serait retourn&#233; en France. Selon lui, des membres

aurait &#233;t&#233; signal&#233;e par la Direction fran&#231;aise de la 
surveillance du territoire. Durant ses quatre jours 
de d&#233;tention, les agents auraient interrog&#233; 
Monsieur Madjid Benyamina sur la vie de son 
oncle en France et lui auraient dit qu&#8217;il &#233;tait 
suspect&#233; d'appartenir &#224; une organisation 
terroriste. Ni la famille de  Mohammed Benyamina 
ni son avocat n'auraient obtenu des informations

Selon le registre judiciaire, il n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224;

</b>El 17 de junio de 2006, el Sr. Hormozabal fue 
encontrado muerto en la Penitenciaria de 
Mendoza (Pabell&#243;n 9, celda 16) como 
consecuencia de heridas m&#250;ltiples causadas por 
un instrumento corto-punzante.  El 18 de junio de

reclusos Diego Ferranti Lucero y Gerardo G&#243;mez 
Gonz&#225;lez en un patio del Pabell&#243;n 16 de m&#225;xima 
seguridad. Los dos reclusos habr&#237;an sido 
trasladados horas antes desde la c&#225;rcel de 
C&#243;rdoba y su traslado se deber&#237;a  a que el martes 
siguiente iban a declarar ante el juez que instruye

16, from the Village of Eni Genushli, near Baku, 
who are currently being held at the third pre-trial 
detention facility in Shuvlani, on the outskirts of 
Baku, or in the Ranaman District police 
administration building in Baku. On 14 March 
2005, the three of them were detained and taken 
to the 33rd police precinct in Surakhan, where for 
two days they were subject to severe beatings 
and other forms of torture by police officials and 
officials from the office of the public prosecutor 
(i.a. senior investigator and Surakhan District 
prosecutor). All three were denied access to a 
lawyer and to their parents during their initial 
detention. Compelled by severe beatings, kicking 
and threats, the boys were forced to sign 
confessions and accusations against one another 
for participation in the murder of Mr  Vusal 
Zeinalov on 15 February 2005, which they all 
deny. R. B. faced additional beatings in June 2005 
while he was in the third pre-trial detention facility 
(SIZO) on the outskirts of Baku. The three of them 
sustained bruises on their legs, feet, back, and 
torso and suffer from pain in their heads and 
stomachs. All of them suffer from psychological 
trauma. As a result of the torture in March 2005, 
R. B. suffered contusions on his head that 
produced large bumps. None of them have 
received adequate medical treatment. Currently, 
the boys are being held at the third pre-trial 
detention facility in Shuvlani in cells with 4 or 5 
other boys and one adult. Ventilation and light in 
the cell are poor, the quality of drinking water is 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 17/07/06, the Government 
reported that criminal proceedings were 
instituted against them on charges of 
premeditated murder and an arrest warrant 
was issued against them. The investigation 
was conducted by Surakhany District and Baku 
city Prosecutor's Offices and on 13 April 2006, 
the criminal case was transferred to the Court 
on Serious Crimes. On 15 July 2006, the 
defence lawyer filed an application with the 
Head Department of the Implementation of 
Court Rulings of the Ministry of Justice, asking 
for examination of complaints of violence in the 
course of the investigation used against R. B. 
while he was detained in investigative isolation 
unit  no. 3. As a result of the investigation it 
was ascertained that the inspector of the 
Surakhan District prosecutor's office had met 
with defendant R. B. in investigative isolation 
unit no. 3 on 23 June 2005, and submitted to 
him the copy of the indictment against him. 
During this meeting he asked R. B. to give true 
testimonies at the court hearings and to testify 
that he did not commit any violence and torture 
against him. It was also ascertained that R. B. 
did not apply either to the governing board of 
the investigative isolator or the medical centre 
on 23 June 2005 and on subsequent days. A 
medical examination was conducted and no 
signs of injury were discovered on his body or 
internal organs. During the investigation, 
supervisors of investigative isolation unit no. 3 
indicated that R. B., after meeting with the </p>

to 10 minutes of exercise per day and do not have 
access to education. At times, they are being 
taken to the Ranaman District police 
administration building in Baku, where they are 
held in isolation for up to 10 days, get only one 
meal per day and are not allowed to exercise at 
all. They have been held in pre-trial detention for 
more than a year, pending the investigation that 
has now been on-going for more than 13 months. 
Officials have refused to investigate the 
allegations of torture.

<p>inspector, said nothing about any violence, 
torture or threat used against him on his way to 
the cell. At the same time they did not observe 
any injuries on R. B.'s body. Defendant R. B. 
explained that he had met with the inspector 
on 23 June 2005 in investigative isolation unit 
no. 3 and the inspector asked him to give 
objective testimonies during court hearings. 
After turning down this request, the inspector 
grasped R. B.'s right wrist, but committed 
neither torture nor violence against him. Thus 
the allegations of torture and violence 
committed against defendant R. B. were not 
confirmed. During the investigation of the 
criminal case of R. B., M. G. and D. P., they all 
underwent medical examinations, and 
according to the forensic medical examination, 
no injuries were discovered on their bodies. It 
is impossible to draw any conclusions about 
whether the &quot;yellowish spot&quot; indicated in R. 
B.'s medical card is an injury or not, as no 
registration of its pre-existing morphologic 
signs had been conducted. The allegations of 
violence against R. B. committed by inspectors 
carrying out the investigation and by the police 
officers of Surakhan District police department 
n. 33 on 14 March 2005, were not confirmed 
and neither R. B. nor the other defendants and 
their lawyers filed any complaints on that issue 
with the investigative agencies. Currently, the 
Prosecutor's Office is closely following the trial. 
Respecting its international obligations, the 
State will ensure full, comphrehensive and </p>

<b> 
</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 17/07/06, the Government 
reported that, with a view to ensuring the 
objectivity and comprehensiveness of the 
investigation, Mr  Sarhanov and other 
members of  Yeni Fikir were invited for 
interrogation on 11 August 2005 and informed 
about their rights and interrogated as 
witnesses without any external pressure or 
intervention. During the interrogation Sarvan 
Sarhanov indicated that he was the member of 
&quot;Yeni Fikir&quot; and was acquainted with some 
members of that organization, but his activity 
was limited to taking part in rallies. 
Subsequently, information appeared in the 
media that during interrogation he was beaten 
by two investigators, offered to apply for 
membership in &quot;Yeni Azerbaijan Party&quot;, 
coerced into signing the transcript of the 
interrogation and that he signed it with a 
straight line. This information is not backed up 
by any facts and is completely refuted by the 
factual data of the case. Sarvan Sarhanov 
freely signed the transcript of the interrogation, 
at the end of which he indicated his remarks in 
writing. The identities of the two alleged 
investigators are not confirmed. After the 
above-mentioned information was published in 
the media, on 22 September 2005, Sarvan 
Sarhanov was once again invited to 
interrogation and in his confession he indicated 
that there had not been any pressure against </p>

<p>him, nor any attempts to obtain testimonies 
against anyone, and he had not been subject 
to any physical or physiological threat during 
the previous interrogation and in this regard he 
did not complain to any foreign organization. 
Furthermore, a special investigation was 
launched and Sarvan Sarhanov underwent a 
forensic medical examination and, as a result, 
the information in the media was not 
confirmed. The primary investigation of the 
crime is underway.

Alutus Newbold was sentenced to eight lashes 
with a &quot;cat-of-nine tails&quot; (a device consisting of 
nine knotted cords or thongs of raw hide attached 
to a handle) and 24 years' imprisonment. He was 
found guilty of burglary, attempted rape and 
causing harm, after an attack on an 87-year-old 
woman in her home in 2004.The court ordered 
that he receive four lashes at the start of his 
sentence and four upon his release. The 
punishment is suspended for three weeks pending 
a possible appeal.  Corporal punishment had 
been abolished in 1984 in the Bahamas, but was

Abdul-Jabar Jaffa Al-Mushaima, Ahmed 
Yousef Nasser Al-Mushaima, Mohamed 
Hassan Yousef Saif </b>and <b>Ali Jaffar Jasssim 
Rabea, </b>all arrested and detained in connection 
with a peaceful protest. On 19 January 2006, the 
above named persons were arrested in the Daih 
and Sanabis areas of Manama. They had 
gathered to peacefully protest against the 
detention of 21 people, who were arrested on 25 
December 2005 at Bahrain Airport for peacefully 
protesting against the detention of Sheikh Sanad. 
Sheikh Sanad had called for a referendum under 
the supervision of the United Nations on the 
legitimacy of the political system in Bahrain. It is 
reported that 16 of the 21 protestors have been 
sentenced to one or two years&#8217; imprisonment. 
During their police detention, the above-
mentioned persons were threatened and 
assaulted by police officers. During the first days 
of their detention their families were not informed 
about their whereabouts. Relatives were not 
allowed to attend their trial session on 26 
February 2006. The trial has been postponed to 
12 March 2006 and they remain in custody. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 18/05/06, the Government 
reported that the crowd was asked to disperse 
in a peaceful and amicable manner.  However, 
the protesters refused to comply and began 
rioting and damaging public property.  They set 
fire to tires and garbage containers, which they 
threw into the middle of the public highway, 
endangering the lives of passers-by and the 
general security forces.  They also threw 
stones at the police who took steps to help 
restore law and order.  As a result of all this, 13 
individuals were arrested.On 21 January 2006, 
the arrested persons were presented to the 
Department of Public Prosecutions which 
charged the defendants with unlawful 
assembly and rioting under articles 178-180 of 
the Bahrain Criminal Code. After all the legal 
and constitutional procedures had been 
completed, the Department of Public 
Prosecutions ordered the detention of seven of 
the accused persons and released the 
remaining six accused persons, due to lack of 
sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. 
The case file and the accused persons in 
detention were referred to the competent 
criminal court to hear the charges against 
them. On 19 April 2006, the court issued a 
judgement, sentencing each of the accused 
persons to one year&#8217;s imprisonment.  The case 
is still being heard by the court of second 
instance (court of appeal).  The authorities 
responsible for investigations, whether the 
police, the Department of Public Prosecutions </p>

<p>or the competent criminal court, acted in a 
manner that was legally transparent and 
impartial and afforded all legal and procedural 
safeguards to the defendants from the date of 
their arrest to the date on which the case was 
heard by the competent court.  This matter is 
clearly illustrated by the following facts: 
The police officers at the scene corroborated 
the charges against the accused persons 
through the statements that they made during 
the investigation by the Department of Public 
Prosecutions and the photographic evidence 
which showed that the accused persons had 
taken part in the rioting. Some of the accused 
persons who were arrested gave detailed 
confessions to the police and investigators of 
the Department of Public Prosecutions, 
admitting that they had caused a riot and set 
fire to garbage containers and car tires.  They 
did not indicate that their confessions had been 
extracted as a result of coercion or violence.  
This is also evidenced by the fact that some of 
them gave statements to the police denying 
the charges against them.The legal arrests 
made by the police were based on a legal 
provision which provides that arrested 
suspects must be presented to the Department 
of Public Prosecutions within 48 hours.  This is 
what the police did.The Department of Public 
Prosecutions told the accused persons that 
they had to have defence counsel present 
during questioning.  Some lawyers appeared 
with the accused persons and presented their </p>

<p>legal defence. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions heard the statements of the 
witnesses for the defence, at the request of the 
accused persons. From the very beginning of 
the investigation, anyone against whom there 
was insufficient evidence for prosecution was 
released. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions sent the accused persons who 
had been injured during the riot to a police 
doctor to assess their injuries and prescribe 
treatment for them, even though they did not 
indicate who had caused the injuries. 
The families and lawyers of the accused 
persons were allowed to visit them on 21 
January 2006, i.e. two days after the incident 
occurred. The father of Abdullah Madan was 
allowed to visit his son on 22 January 2006 
and to give him the medicine that he needed.

Election Commission office. On the way, at Mirpur 
Road, in between Manik Mian Avenue and Road 
27 in Dhanmondi Residential Area, the police 
erected a barricade to block the protesters. Ms S. 
S. S. was in this vicinity at the time as she was 
going to collect her son from a school that is 
located in the area. At approximately 12:30 pm, a 
group of demonstrators, belonging to an 
opposition political party, passed by the school. 
The police fired tear gas and water canons at the 
demonstrators and beat them with sticks, canes 
and iron rods. Ms S. S. S., who had been waiting 
in front of the school, took shelter inside a private 
hospital opposite the school. Police forcibly 
removed her from the clinic and placed her with 
the arrested demonstrators. Ms S. S. S. told the

Commissioner of Police (South Zone) and the 
Deputy Commissioner ordered their subordinates 
to break Ms S. S. S.&#8217;s hands and legs. Male police 
officers placed their hands on Ms S. S. S.&#8217;s lower 
abdomen to check whether she was pregnant. 
They tied a rope around her abdomen and 
forcefully pulled on both ends of the rope. 
Thereafter they forced her into a prison van. 
Inside the van, policemen walked on her body and 
kicked her genitalia as well as her lower 
abdomen. After Ms S. S. S. fainted she was 
discarded on the street. Ms S. S. S. suffered 
severe injuries to her thighs, lower abdomen, 
back, waist, hip and other areas of her body. She 
also suffered two fractures, one in her right elbow 
and the other in the small finger on her right hand. 
Ms S. S. S.lodged a complaint against the alleged 
perpetrators at Mohammadpur Police Station but 
the police refused to record the case. On 14

28 February 2002 around midnight, as he was 
waiting for a flight at Zia International Airport, he 
was taken and detained in the office of the 
immigration police. Around 3am, a plain-clothes 
police officer, who identified himself as belonging 
to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), 
accused him of being wanted in connection with 
the attack on the motorcade of the then leader of 
the opposition Ms  Khaleda Zia (current Prime 
Minister). When Mr  Nasim requested to see the 
arrest warrant, he was told that the necessary 
documents would be provided later. A few hours 
later, he was taken to the CID headquarters, 
Malibagh. He was forced to sign some blank 
papers. Until late in the evening, he was unable to 
inform his family of his whereabouts, or have 
contact with a lawyer. He was removed from the 
police station, taken first to the roof, then by the 
back door, and transported to the court. He was

the Joint Interrogation Cell. He was blindfolded 
with a strip of cloth and cotton wads, had his 
wrists tied with rope, and was ordered to lie down 
in the van during the trip. He was blindfolded 
throughout his detention, and his wrists would be 
unbound for toilet trips and meals only. He slept 
on the floor without bedding. He was tortured in 
order to make incriminating statements against Ms  
Hasina, to the effect that she was responsible for 
orchestrating a string of killings, rapes, extortion, 
and repression of minorities following the 1 
October 2001 election. He was threatened that he 
would be imprisoned for a long time, that if he 
didn't comply they would leave him impotent and 
handicapped. Among other things, he was beaten, 
subjected to electric shocks on sensitive parts of 
his body, forced to stand on ice and hung upside-
down from the ceiling for long periods of time, 
spun around, put in a sack and trampled on, and 
forced to lie for hours on the floor spread-eagled. 
On 7 March 2002, he was transferred to the 
Dhaka Central Jail, where he was denied the 
rights afforded to ordinary inmates, such as 
receiving amenities from family members. An 
additional charge in relation to sedition was filed 
against him. Mr  Nasim was subsequently 
tranferred to Kashimpur Jail on 22 November, 
then to Rangpur Jail on 22 December and finally, 
after lengthy delays in the proceedings, was 
released on bail on 6 January 2003. </p>

Senhato police outpost under the Dighalia Police 
Station in Khulna District, and a Police Constable 
arrived at M. K.&#8217;s home. The  Assistant Sub 
Inspector entered her room and attempted to rape 
her. She managed to resist until her brother and 
various other family members arrived to help her. 
In response, the policemen beat M. K. and hit 
Rafiqul Islam with a bamboo stick, a rifle butt and 
a chain, before they arrested him and took him to 
Senhati Police Outpost. The commanding officer 
of the Senhati police camp and the  Assistant Sub 
Inspector then demanded 10,000 Taka from 
Rafiqul Islam&#8217;s family. They threatened that 
Rafiqul Islam might be &#8220;killed in crossfire&#8221; if the 
family failed to pay the money.  When the family 
only managed to raise 5,000 Taka, the policemen 
beat Rafiqul Islam with a stick and a rifle butt 
causing fractures of his left hand and right leg. 
They also poured hot water in his nose. He can no 
longer walk properly or work to support his 
family.On 24 July 2006, the police lodged a

relatives that protected M. K. from the attempted 
rape. On 25 July 2006, the local Magistrate&#8217;s

conference held at the Khulna Press Club on 28 
July 2006. On 30 July 2006, she also lodged a 
criminal case against the responsible police

under the Women and Children Repression 
Prevention (Special Provision) Amendment Act 
</p><p>2003. On 23 September 2006, a member of Ward 
4 of the Senhati Union Council, told M. K. to 
withdraw the case. He also threatened her and 
her family with the words:  &quot;Remember, the police 
lodged a case against you, in which your brother 
is detained in Khulna Jail. If you don&#8217;t withdraw 
the case against the police, you will be in trouble. 
Fighting against the police is very difficult!&quot; He 
further suggested that the family come to a 
&quot;solution&quot; without fighting against the police. Since 
then, the same policemen have repeatedly 
attempted to intimidate M. K. by threatening to 
ensure that her brother would be convicted on 
trumped-up charges.The Special Tribunal of 
Women and Children Repression Prevention, 
which has jurisdiction over the criminal case 
against the police officers has so far not taken any 
substantive action. In a court hearing that took 
place on 28 September 2006, the judge refused to 
consider the merits of the case and rescheduled 
the case to 30 November 2006.

March 2006, at approximately 3.30 am, members 
of the police riot squad surrounded demonstrators 
in October Square (Kastrychnitskaya Square) in 
Minsk, separated journalists from the protestors, 
and then forcefully dragged the protestors into

<p><b>Hundreds of opposition supporters</b> continue to 
be detained in Minsk after having beienarrested 
by police agents during the protest actions which 
took place on 24 and 25 March 2006. Presidential 
candidate <b>Alexander Kozulin</b> and members of 
his family were arrested during the forcible 
dispersal of a peaceful rally on Freedom Day, 
protesting against the outcome\s of the recent 
presidential election but also commemorating the 
anniversary of the 1918 Declaration of 
Independence of the Republic of Belarus. Mr  
Kozolin has reportedly been charged with 
hooliganism. His whereabouts were unknown until 
26 March 2006, when he was located in a 
detention centre outside Minsk. It was also 
reported that Russian journalist Pavel Sheremet 
was beaten and arrested during the clashes.

<p>16.   07/08/06 AL  TOR; Conditions in several places of detention, such as 
<b>IK-11 (Valkavysk, Hrodna region)</b>, <b>IK-19 
(Mahileu), IK-17 (Shklou, Mahileu region), IK-20 
(Mozyr, Homel region), LTP-1 (Svetlagorsk, 
Homel region), SIZO-1 (Minsk), Sizo.8 
(Zhodzina, Minsk region),</b> Minsk city special 
detention center. IK-19 and several places of 
detention in Minsk were the subject of previously 
transmitted communication for which a response 
was received (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.1, para. 12). 
Nevertheless, it continues to be alleged that in the 
above mentioned institutions overcrowding is still 
prevalent, with inmates having only 1-2 square 
metres per person at their disposal (including bed 
space), which means that inmates have to sleep 
in shifts. In many cases healthy persons are held 
together with those sick with tuberculosis in the 
same rooms/cells. Ventilation is insufficient and 
contributes to the spreading of infections as does 
the low-quality food. Access to hygienic facilities 
and medical care is restricted. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 6/10/06, the Government 
reported that pursuant to article 94, paragraph 
1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons 
serving sentences in correctional facilities shall 
be provided the necessary living conditions 
consistent with health and hygiene rules.  The 
minimum living area per detainee in 
correctional colonies and in prisons may not be 
less than 2 square metres.  Pursuant to this 
provision, the upper limits for the number of 
detainees who may be held in each directional 
facility, as recommended by the director of the 
Department of Corrections, are laid down by 
the Minister of Internal Affairs. At the current 
time, the number of detainees in correctional 
colony No. 11 (IK-11, Valkavysk), compulsory 
rehabilitation centre No. 1 (LTP-1, 
Svetlagorsk), pretrial detention centre No. 1 
(SIZO-1, Minsk) and pretrial detention centre 
No. 8 (SIZO-8, Zhodzina) is within the 
prescribed limit.  The number of detainees in 
correctional colony No. 19 (Mohylau) is almost 
300 below the stipulated limit.  The stipulated 
limits are only exceeded to a very small extent 
in correctional colonies No. 17 (IK-17, Shklou) 
and No. 20 (IK-20, Mozyr).  After the entry into 
force on 18 September 2006 of the act 
amending and supplementing the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the number of detainees 
in the above-listed and other facilities of the 
criminal corrections system will be brought 
within the established limits. Each detainee is 
provided with his or her own sleeping area and </p>

<p>bedding.  The listed establishments are fitted 
with the necessary sanitary facilities and other 
amenities to meet all the needs of the 
detainees. The health and hygiene conditions 
and utilities in facilities of the criminal 
corrections system are regularly checked, at 
least once every quarter, by public health 
officials. The public health situation in 
detention facilities is stable and regularly 
monitored.  During 2006, there were no 
outbreaks of infectious diseases.  The 
tuberculosis infection rate is steadily dropping:  
according to final figures for 2005, there were 
406 cases per 100,000 detainees, representing 
a 35 per cent drop from the 2004 levels.  
Figures for the first six months of 2006 show 
the downward trend in infections continuing.  In 
2005, tuberculosis infection rates dropped in all 
establishments listed by the Special 
Rapporteur:  they dropped by 52 per cent in 
correctional colony No. 11, by 68 per cent in 
correctional colony No. 17, by 45 per cent in 
correctional colony No. 19 and by 89 per cent 
in correctional colony No. 20.  In the pretrial 
detention centres and the compulsory 
rehabilitation centres a large proportion of 
tuberculosis sufferers are found to be already 
infected when they are admitted to the 
facilities.  There are no cases of detainees 
infected with an active form of tuberculosis 
being held together with healthy detainees.  
Where there is any suspicion that detainees 
may be infected with tuberculosis, they are </p>

<p>immediately isolated in the facility&#8217;s medical 
centre and transferred to the national 
tuberculosis hospital.  Only persons cured of 
tuberculosis and under regular medical 
supervision may be held together with healthy 
detainees. The accessibility of medical 
assistance for detainees is at the same level 
as for the country&#8217;s population as a whole.  
The patient-doctor ratio for detainees is 53.1 
per 10,000 (compared to 46.2 per 10,000 for 
the country as a whole), the ratio of 
paramedical and nursing staff is 98.1 per 
10,000 detainees (compared to 119.7 per 
10,000 for the country as a whole) and the 
hospital bed rate is 439.4 per 10,000 
(compared to 107.4 per 10,000 for the country 
as a whole). Clothing allowances for detainees 
are set by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
nutritional standards by the Council of 
Ministers.  At the current time, work is under 
way by the State authorities on the approval of 
a draft government decision to raise the 
nutritional standards.

receiving visits from their family and friends on 
a daily basis, as was the case throughout their 
trial. As per normal practice, medical attention 
is provided to all detainees if required or upon 
request by the individual concerned. With 
regard to the allegations against officers of the 
Royal Bhutan Police, these are factually 
incorrect as the alleged person was not 
present during the arrest. It is also untrue that 
Mr  Dhungana and Mr  Tamang have been 
subjected to torture and ill treatment in

t&#233;rminos del art&#237;culo 85 del C&#243;digo de

Cadin se present&#243; en el juzgado, fue detenido y 
trasladado en calidad de prisionero a la c&#225;rcel de 
Temuco. Asimismo, el caso fue trasladado a la 
Fiscal&#237;a Militar para que se investiguen los 
hechos en el plazo de cinco meses. Se da la 
circunstancia de que el arresto y supuestos malos 
tratos sufridos por el Sr. Waikilaf Cadin se dan en 
el contexto del conflicto sobre la propiedad de 
tierras ubicadas en la Comunidad Juan Paillalef. 
Estas tierras, reclamadas como propiedad de la 
Comunidad sobre la base de t&#237;tulos hist&#243;ricos y 
posesi&#243;n ancestral, est&#225;n siendo supuestamente 
utilizadas por el Ministerio de Obras P&#250;blicas para

consulta a la Comunidad y sin su consentimiento, 
no habr&#237;a dado lugar a una leg&#237;tima

Innovateck, art&#237;culo 141 del C&#243;digo Penal;  
da&#241;os calificados en perjuicio a la empresa

c&#243;digo Penal; porte ilegal de arma blanca; 
hurto, art&#237;culo 446 del C&#243;digo Penal.   
El tribunal resolvi&#243; que se contaban con los 
antecedentes que justificaban el hecho 
delictivo y la participaci&#243;n en los delitos de 
des&#243;rdenes p&#250;blicos, hurto y da&#241;os, no as&#237;

were arrested following a patriotic re-education 
ceremony that had been taking place at Drepung 
Monastery in Lhasa since October 2005. They 
were handed over to the Public Security Bureau of

<p><b>Trafficking and sexual exploitation of female 
</b>citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of

least 50,000 DPRK citizens who only have 
irregular visa status in the Korean Autonomous 
Prefecture of Yanbian (Jilin Province), which 
borders the DPRK and is home to about one 
million Chinese citizens of Korean ethnicity. While 
a considerable number clandestinely crossed the

reported that the allegation that 50,000 illegal 
immigrants from the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea have been detained in Jilin 
in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous 
Prefecture, which is a wild exaggeration.  As a 
consequence of the improved economic 
situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea and the strengthened controls 
exercised over the frontier region by China and 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
the number of Korean illegal immigrants

<p>become the concubines of Chinese men. Human 
traffickers systematically target the women, who 
are usually hungry and desperate, by approaching 
them in the border region and promising them 
food, shelter, employment and protection. Once 
the traffickers have gained the women&#8217;s 
confidence, the women are lured to an apartment, 
confined and then sold to local men. The buyers 
often lock their victims in the house, tie them up or 
take away their clothing to prevent them from 
escaping. In many cases, the women are also 
physically abused and raped. Some women from 
the DPRK are also trafficked into the sex industry 
in Jinlin Province and other parts of the PRC. 
They are forced to prostitute themselves in 
brothels, which are often disguised as karaoke 
bars. Women from the DPRK with an irregular 
visa status are extremely vulnerable to trafficking 
since the Chinese authorities have reportedly 
been instructed to arrest and deport DPRK 
citizens against their will, if they do not have a 
valid residence permit. The PRC reportedly 
considers these persons to be irregular migrants 
who cross the border only for economic reasons. 
This deportation policy has been adopted despite 
the fact that DPRK citizens face detention under 
cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions, ill-
treatment and torture as well as, in extreme 
cases, summary execution in the DPRK. Human 
traffickers are well aware of this deportation policy 
and often manage to subdue their victims by 
threatening to report them to the authorities, if 
they resist.

<p>interests of foreign citizens within its territory.  
Regardless of whether these people have 
entered the country in the normal fashion or 
have crossed the frontier illegally, their lawful 
rights and interests are equally protected under 
Chinese law.  With regard to the issue of the 
illegal entry into China of citizens of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the 
Chinese Government invariably proceeds in an 
appropriate manner, consistent with both 
domestic and international law and in 
observance of humanitarian principles.  In this 
process, the Chinese police authorities enforce 
the law in an impartial manner and there are 
no cases of commissions being paid for the 
repatriation of citizens of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have illegally 
entered China and have been apprehended. 
The Chinese Government and the public 
security authorities always attach great 
importance to safeguarding the lawful rights 
and interests of women and children, and 
countering any kind of activities which infringe 
the rights and interests of women and children.  
They are consistently and indefatigably 
working to crack down with severity on any 
illegal activities involving trafficking in women 
and children.  Starting this year, as a 
consequence of the increase in contacts 
between China and foreign countries, offences 
involving trafficking in women and children are 
now starting to occur in China as well.  The </p>

<p>Chinese public security authorities take a very 
serious view of this and have increased their 
preventive measures, taken stronger action to 
combat such offences, stepped up cooperation 
with police forces in all the other countries 
involved and cracked down with severity on 
Chinese and foreign offenders who traffic in 
women and children.  Persons profiting from 
the abduction and trafficking of women and 
those involved in rape, ill-treatment and 
unlawful detention of others are charged, in 
accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code, 
with the offences of abducting and trafficking in 
women and children, rape, inflicting injury, 
unlawfully detaining others and other 
associated offences.  At the same time, the 
authorities attach high importance to efforts to 
protect the rights and interests of victims, 
ensuring that they receive personal care and 
consideration, and are actively assisting 
foreign women and children who have been 
rescued from such abusive practices, 
endeavouring to ensure the personal safety 
and physical and mental health of victims.

estimated seven policemen.  Her home was 
ransacked and all Falun Gong materials were 
seized.  She was taken to Dongchengfang Town 
Police Station in Tunzhou City, Hebei Province, 
where she was interrogated, beaten with rubber 
clubs and given electric shocks with stun batons.  
At approximately 2pm on 25 November 2005, a 
police officer took L. J. to a room, where he lifted 
her shirt and touched her breasts.  He then gave 
her electric shocks on her breasts with a stun 
baton.  Another police officer briefly came into the 
room, encouraged the officer to beat her up, and 
left.  The first officer raped L. J.  While raping her, 
he repeatedly slapped her in the face.  He then 
brought H. Y. into the same room and raped her 
too.  Both rapes took place in the presence of 
another police officer, who made no attempt to 
intervene or prevent the incidents.

raped.  The authorities promptly summoned 
the policed officer in question.  In the ensuing 
questioning and investigation, it was 
ascertained that he was a temporary employee 
in the Dongchengfang Township Public

afternoon of 25 November 2005, he had taken 
L. J. and H. Y. in turn back to his hostel, where 
he had indecently assaulted L. J. and had 
raped H. Y.  On 9 December, following

the manufacture of explosive devices, 
detonators and blasting fuses and in weapons

attended a conference of the formally 
constituted East Turkestan Islamic Movement, 
held in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, and was 
appointed military commander.  The 
conference resolved that the goal of the 
organization would be to liberate East 
Turkestan through a holy war and to set in 
place an Islamic State, and mapped out a 
strategic plan for the period ahead. In mid-
December 1998, Semed and others organized 
a meeting in Rawalpindi at which they decided 
to break away from the East Turkestan Islamic 
Movement and form a separate grouping.  
They deposed their former leader, Hasan 
Mahsum, assumed control of their members 
and funds in Afghanistan and started to look 
for ways of illegally entering Xinjiang, so as to 
prepare for the conduct of military jihadist

<p><b>Organ harvesting</b>. Organ harvesting has been

for the purpose making available organs for

hearts, kidneys, livers and corneas were 
systematically harvested from Falun Gong 
practitioners at Sujiatan Hospital, Shenyang, 
Liaoning Province, beginning in 2001. The 
practitioners were given injections to induce heart 
failure, and therefore were killed in the course of 
the organ harvesting operations or immediately 
thereafter. It is reported that employees of the

Transplant Centre in Shanghai, Zhengzhou 
Medical University Organ Transplant Centre in 
Henan, Oriental Organ Transplant Centre in 
Tianjin City, Tongji Hospital in Wuhan City in 
Hunan and General Hospital of Guangzhou 
Military Regional in Guangdong. It is reported that 
employees from the following detention facilities 
have indicated that organs from Falun Gong 
detainees have been used for transplants: Mijiang 
Detention Centre in Heilongjiang, First Detention 
Centre of Qinhuangdao City in Shangdong 
Province and Second Detention Centre of 
Qinhuangdao City in Shangdong Province. After 
the organs were removed, the bodies were 
cremated, and no corpse is left to examine for 
identification as the source of an organ transplant. 
Once the organs were removed they were 
shipped to transplant centres to be used for 
transplants for both domestic and foreign patients. 
Officials from the following detention facilities 
have indicated that courts have been involved in 
administering the use of organs from Falun Gong 
detainees, namely: Qinhuangdao Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court in Shangdong Province, First 
Criminal Bureau of the Jinzhou Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court and Kunming Higher People&#8217;s 
Court. It is reported that there are many more 
organ transplants than identifiable sources of 
organs, even taking into account figures for 
identifiable sources, namely: estimates of 
executed prisoners annually, of which a high 
percentage of organs are donated, according to 
</p>
<p>6,000 persons. There was no basement for 
incarcerating practitioners, as alleged. The so-
called &#8220;cremation oven&#8221; is in fact a 
boiler/furnace room, whose primary function is 
to provide heat and disinfect medical 
instruments. This boiler room has several 
transparent glass windows and a lawn outside 
that is open to the public where nearby 
residents come daily to stroll. In such a place,  
there is simply no way to cremate corpses in 
secret, continuously, and in large volumes. The 
rumors fabricated by Falun Gong collapse on 
their own. Everyone recognizes that Sujiatun 
Hospital is nothing but a simple hospital to 
treat coronary disease and that there is no 
evidence to show that it is being used for any 
purpose. This once again proves that the 
&#8220;Sujiatun concentration camp&#8221; fabricated by 
Falun Gong is nothing more than a rumor. As a 
WHO Member State, the Government 
resolutely abides by the WHO 1991 Guiding 
Principles on Human Organ Transplants and 
strictly forbids the sale of human organs. 
Human organ donation must be done 
voluntarily and with the written consent of the 
donor. The  human organ transplant 
regulations that took effect on 1 July 2006 
reiterate that human organs must not be sold, 
that human organs used for transplant by 
medical facilities must have the written consent 
of the donor, that a donor has the right to 
refuse to donate before the organ transplant 
takes place, and that medical facilities carrying </p>

<p>the statement in 2005 of the Vice Minister of 
Health Mr  Huang Jiefu; willing donor family 
members, who for cultural reasons, are often 
reluctant to donate their organs after death; and 
brain-dead donors. Moreover, the reportedly short 
waiting times that have been advertised for 
perfectly-matched organs would suggest the 
existence of a computerized matching system for 
transplants and a large bank of live prospective 
donors. It is alleged that the discrepancy between 
available organs and numbers from identifiable 
sources is explained by organs harvested from 
Falun Gong practitioners, and that the rise in 
transplants from 2000 coincides and correlates 
with the beginning of the persecution of these 
persons. On organ transplants, in general, it has 
been reported that in March 2006, legislation was 
introduced which bans the sale of human organs 
and requires the donor to give written permission.  
The legislation also limits transplants to certain 
institutions, which must verify the source of the 
organs. This law came into force on 1 July 2006. 
Contrary to the Government assertion that human 
organs have been prohibited from sale, in 
accordance with the 1991 WHO guiding 
principles, it has been reported that up to this time 
Chinese law has allowed the buying and selling of 
organs; has not required that donors give written 
permission for their organs to be transplanted; 
there has been no restriction on the institutions 
which could engage in organ harvesting or 
transplants; there was no requirement that the 
institutions engaged in transplants had to verify 
</p>
<p>out human organ transplants must have the 
capacity to ensure medical quality and safety 
in accordance with ethical principles. The goal 
of these regulations is to standardize and 
improve the management of clinical practice of 
human organ transplant operations in order to 
safeguard medical quality and safety. 
Presently, the relevant government agencies 
are drafting human organ transplant 
regulations in order to create the necessary 
regulation of human organ donation, 
registration, matching, and transplant. China 
absolutely does not allow forced donation or 
trafficking in the corpses or organs of executed 
criminals, which are used in strict accordance 
with the relevant regulations. Notably: written 
consent must be received from the criminal to 
be executed and his family; approval must be 
received from the provincial-level health 
authority and the provincial-level higher 
people&#8217;s court; and the unit using the organs 
must have the authority/capacity to conduct 
medical science research or transplant 
operations. The question of organ donation is 
not part of the inquiries made at the time of 
execution. Those death-row criminals who 
wish to donate their corpse or organs after they 
are executed must express this voluntarily in 
writing. Mobile execution vehicles are used 
solely by the courts to carry out execution by 
lethal injection. They do not, and are strictly 
forbidden to, transport organs. According to 
Chinese laws and regulations, individuals who </p>

</b></p>
<p>that the organs being transplanted were from legal 
sources; and there was no obligation to have 
transplant ethics committees approve all 
transplants in advance. Moreover, evidence 
exists, for example, that at least up until April 2006 
price lists for organ transplants in China were 
published on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>are sentenced to death are those criminals 
who have committed extremely serious crimes 
and who should be sentenced to death and 
executed immediately (i.e. without reprieve), 
not for being Falun Gong practitioners. For this 
reason, there are no statistical data for Falun 
Gong practitioners who have been executed. 
In order to deal with the problem of organ 
supply, each country typically uses two 
methods: one, to increase social awareness 
and mobilize the population to donate organs; 
and two, to facilitate live organ donation and 
transplant between relatives. China&#8217;s methods 
are not exceptions. Moreover, it has placed 
serious restrictions: citizens who donate live 
organs must be at least 18 years old and be in 
possession of full civil capacities; and the live 
organ recipient must be the spouse, direct 
blood relative, or within three generations of 
collateral blood relatives.

to his x-rays were refused. Further, his family was 
denied permission to visit him. Concern is 
expressed as regards his deteriorating health and 
physical integrity, also in view of his 
incommunicado and solitary detention. Mr  Zhang 
was arrested in Beijing and sentenced to 11 years 
of imprisonment in 2001. Later that year he was 
transferred to Tiebei Prison in Changchun city, 
where he went on a 53 day hunger strike, and 
then, in March 2002, to Jilin Prison. There, Mr  
Zhang was held in solitary confinement for two 
years and five months and ill-treated.

</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 12/01/06, the Government 
reported that on 19 June 2002, Huang 
Zhiqiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen and 
Cheng Lihe were arrested and they are 
currently being held in custody. Concerning the 
allegation that the four persons have been 
subjected to torture, the Leping People&#8217;s 
Procurator&#8217;s Office assigned two procuratorial 
officials to make a careful study of the case.  
These officials were present on numerous 
occasions when the suspects made 
statements and identified the scene of the 
crimes and they found no evidence at all that 
the investigating officers had employed any 
unlawful methods in their handling of the case, 
such as extorting confessions by torture, etc. 
Throughout the course of the investigation, the 
officials handling the case made sound and 
video recordings of the questioning of the 
defendants and the identification of the scene 
of the crime.  The disc containing the sound 
and video recordings of the questioning of the 
four defendants and the identification of the 
scene of the crime was carefully studied and 
the recordings showed no evidence that the 
police had used beatings, verbal abuse, or 
threats; the criminal suspects were seen to be 
in a stable and calm state of mind and no 
harsh treatment was used against them:  they 
showed no signs of fear or having been 
intimidated and freely confessed their crimes.

Cheng Lihe are able to correspond with their </p>

<p>families while being held in preventive 
detention and they have freely admitted that 
they had committed serious offences, and 
have shown themselves to be extremely 
repentant.  When the procurator&#8217;s office 
commenced its examination of the appeal 
stage of the proceedings, the suspects 
complained to the procuratorial authorities that 
the investigative officers had extorted 
confessions from them by the use of torture 
and showed abrasions on their wrists to prove 
it.  The oversight division of the Leping 
People&#8217;s Security Bureau conducted a special 
investigation, but did not find any evidence that 
the investigating officers had extorted 
confessions by torture.  An examination of the 
criminal suspects revealed that the abrasions 
on their wrists and the resulting bruising had 
been caused by pressure from the clasps of 
their handcuffs (because of the gravity of the 
offences committed by the four offenders, the 
investigating officers had put handcuffs on 
them, as provided for by law).

<p>By letter dated 18/04/06, the Government 
reported that Wu Zeheng, also known as Wu 
Wenheng and Wu Zeheng, prior to his arrest, 
was the legal representative and director of the 
Beijing Huazang Consulting Centre.  On 2 
November 2001 he was sentenced by the 
Beijing Supreme People&#8217;s Court to 11 years&#8217; 
imprisonment (from 31 July 1999 to 30 July 
2010) and deprived of his political rights for 2 
years for the crimes of illegal business </p>

<p>operations and unauthorized floating of stocks.  
He is currently serving his sentence in the 
Huaiji prison in Guangdong Province.  A 
physical examination conducted after Wu 
entered prison yielded a positive reaction for 
tuberculosis.  As a carrier of the tubercle 
bacillus, he was treated with medication and 
was cured; he did not &#8220;suffer &#8230; from a fever of 
40.2 Celsius&#8221;, and his health is now normal.  
After entering prison Wu was able to visit with 
family members for the time prescribed by 
regulation, and he received more than 80 
letters and six parcels.  He has submitted 
written appeals to the National People&#8217;s 
Council and to judicial bodies, which the prison 
authorities always transmit promptly.  Like 
other criminals, Wu works eight hours a day; 
on no day does he ever work more than 13 
hours.  Wu has never been placed in solitary 
confinement, and the room where he is 
detained has a surface area of 26.4 square 
metres and has excellent light and ventilation.  
Wu&#8217;s legitimate rights and interests are 
guaranteed in accordance with the law. An 
investigation has revealed that there is no one 
in any Chinese prison by the name of Shi 
Xingwu. </p>

number of citizens of the DPRK clandestinely 
cross international borders. There are at least 
50,000 DPRK citizens who have irregular visa 
status in the Korean Autonomous Prefecture of 
Yanbian (Jilin Province, PRC), which borders the 
DPRK and is home to about one million Chinese 
citizens of Korean ethnicity. The People&#8217;s

arresting and deporting DPRK citizens who do not 
possess a valid visa. The Chinese authorities 
consider them to be irregular migrants who cross 
the border for purely economic reasons. Upon 
their return to the DPRK, deported persons are 
usually first taken to the state security agency 
(bowibu) where they are subject to beatings, 
humiliating body searches, and interrogated on 
their activities in China. After the interrogations, 
which can take a week or longer, the majority of 
persons are sent without trial or any form of 
judicial process to a labour training camp (nodong 
danryundae) or a provincial detention centre 
(jipkyulso), close to their hometown. Upon arrival, 
they are usually again stripped, searched, 
interrogated and beaten. Detained for several 
months in inhuman conditions in overcrowded, 
unsanitary cells, they are forced to perform long 
hours of hard labour. Some detention centres 
force prisoners to attend re-education sessions

light of its impure political motives, provocative 
nature and fabricated contents, the 
communication sent to the Government, at the 
same time as the above attempts, can be 
construed as nothing but an inevitable product 
of a conspiracy undertaken in line with the 
attempts of hostile forces. Therefore the 
Government resolutely rejects the 
communication. It cannot ignore the fact that 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the DPRK, who has taken 
sides with the hostile forces, is among the 
sponsors of the communication. As stated on 
several occasions, the Government rejects the 
resolution on DPRK, which is aimed at 
overthrowing the State and social system, and 
does not even recognize the Special 
Rapporteur appointed pursuant to that 
resolution. This position of the Government will 
remain invariable. As for the five other thematic 
rapporteurs listed in the letter, the Government 
treated them with sincerity in the past, inter 
alia, replying to them to remove their concerns, 
and maintaining contacts with them in one way 
or another, since they then promised to pursue 
genuine promotion of human rights, if only by 
words. However, they responded to this 
sincerity and generosity with hostility by 
provoking the Government on the basis of 
information fabricated by hostile forces. By way 
of this, they unilaterally turned their back on </p>

<p>results in high illness rates. Detainees who 
become seriously ill are often released since there 
is no medical care available in these institutions 
and the authorities do not want to be burdened 
with a dying inmate. Citizens of the DPRK, who 
the authorities believe to have made contact with 
churches, citizens of the Republic of Korea or 
journalists or to have engaged in any other 
conduct officials consider to be political betrayal, 
are usually sent to a political labour camp 
(kwanliso) or a re-education labour camp 
(kyohwaso) without trial or any form of judicial 
process, and detained for periods ranging 
between several years and a lifetime. Detainees 
have to perform hard labour while being 
perpetually kept on the verge of starvation. Many 
detainees are subjected to various forms of 
torture. Summary executions have also been 
reported to occur in detention facilities. In 1999, 
for instance, two women were executed in 
Onsong Detention Centre after they confessed to 
having converted to Christianity. The cruel, 
inhuman and degrading punishment of DPRK 
citizens who clandestinely crossed the border into 
the PRC and were then deported also 
exacerbates the human trafficking of women from 
the DPRK, who make up about half of all those 
who cross the border. Upon arrival in PRC, many 
of these women are trafficked and forced to marry 
or become the concubines of Chinese men. 
Human traffickers systematically target the 
women, who are usually hungry and desperate, 
by approaching them in the border region and

<p>the Government and suspended the dialogue 
and cooperation with it. Consequently, it will 
not deal with them any longer. The 
Government deserves the right to take 
necessary corresponding countermeasures 
against their infringement of its dignity and 
sovereignty. In the event of any negative effect 
arising therefrom, they should be held 
responsible as offenders. In relation to the 
communication, which is in pursuit of the 
political aim, having no relevance with human 
rights, the Government is left with no 
alternative but to question the impartiality of 
the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, in its capacity not only as a 
transmitter of the letter but also as an entity 
assisting the work of the Special Rapporteur 
on a daily basis. If the principle of impartiality 
always advocated by OHCHR had been 
supported by deeds, such unfortunate things 
as the case of the transmitted letter, could 
have been prevented beforehand. For the 
above reasons, the Government returns the 
letter of the Special Rapporteurs. </p>

<p>promising them food, shelter, employment and 
protection. Once the traffickers have gained the 
women&#8217;s confidence, the women are lured to an 
apartment, confined and then sold to local men. 
The buyers often lock the women in the house, tie 
them up, take away their clothing to prevent them 
from escaping the forced relationship. In many 
cases, the women are also physically abused and 
raped by their buyers. Some women are also 
trafficked into the sex industry in Jinlin Province 
and other parts of the PRC. They are forced to 
prostitute themselves in brothels, which are often 
disguised as karaoke bars. Since they fear 
deportation to and punishment in the DPRK, the 
women are effectively denied access to the 
protection of the Chinese authorities. Human 
traffickers are well aware of this fact and use it to 
subdue their victims by threatening to report them 
to the Chinese authorities if they resist. The 
situation is particularly dire for women who have 
become pregnant as a result of sexual exploitation 
in forced marriages or the sex industry and are 
then deported. Pregnant women who the DPRK 
authorities suspect of being impregnated by 
Chinese men are often subjected to particularly 
harsh treatment and also torture.  Their 
pregnancies are considered evidence of indecent 
sexual relations with foreigners and a betrayal of 
the home country. In the past, there have also 
been reports about cases in which women were 
forced to have abortions or newly born infants 
were murdered. </p>

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR). On 5 January 2006, up to 
650 Sudanese nationals were at imminent risk of 
being forcibly returned to Sudan. Some might be 
at risk of torture if returned. This followed the 
deaths on 30 December 2005 of 27 Sudanese 
refugees and migrants demonstrating in a 
makeshift camp in Mohandiseen, Cairo, outside 
the UNHCR offices. Nearly 4,000 police officers 
surrounded the encampment, fired water cannons 
into the crowd, and then entered in force, beating 
people indiscriminately with batons and 
truncheons.

reported that while regretting the casualties on 
both sides, it is noteworthy that most of the 
losses of life resulted from the chaos and 
stampede caused by the extremist leaders of

Ms  Yalemzewd Bekele into custody. The 
allegations that they were tortured and ill-

unfounded. Ethiopian domestic laws and 
international human rights instruments ratified 
by Ethiopian condemns any form of torture. 
The treatment of these individuals adhered to 
the letter and spirit of these laws and norms. 
While in detention, both were allowed visits by 
their family, friends and religious counselors. 
Ms  Yalemzewd Bekele made no allegations of 
torture and mistreatment after her release on 
26 October 2006. The European Union has 
officially confirmed that Ms  Bekele was in 
good spirit and physical condition after her 
release. Ms  Bekele&#8217;s arrest and detention do 
not have any relation with her alleged 
association with EWLA or her work supported

on many inmates. Despite the fact that the injured 
inmates needed medical aid, a doctor was

the prisoners did not follow their directions. 
Officials addressed the inmates with 
loudspeakers requesting them to calm down

otherwise they would use force, but to no avail. 
Ministry of Justice forces were present, but in 
insufficient numbers. Therefore Ministry of

entire operation was carried out in full 
compliance with Georgian legislation and

seven prisoners died and 22 were wounded. It 
stresses that it has dealt with the situation

meeting with the Parliament. It emphasises 
that the Government of Georgia is in favour of 
a non-biased and genuine investigation of the 
events by the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The

on the seven deceased detainees, which 
indicated that their deaths were the result of

worship, shouting slogans such as &#8220;Death to

imprisonment and fifty lashes by the Penal Court 
N&#176; 105 of the General Penal Court of the Province

property&#8221;. On 26 October 2006 Mr  Leysanli filed a

first instance. The Erdebil Appeal Court, Branch 1 
of the Erdebil Province, in closed session, 
increased the sentence for disturbing the peace 
and creating public disorder from ten to twelve 
months of imprisonment, making the sentence in 
total 18 months. The fifty lashes have been 
retained by the court. On 31 October 2006, Mr  
Leysanli was rearrested at his workplace in 
Erdebil by plainclothes security agents and taken 
to the Erdebil State Prison, where he has been 
detained ever since. No formal statement 
regarding the authority upon which he was 
arrested and detained has been issued to Mr

conviction on appeal. Mr  Leysanli suffers from

regarding this matter. The perpetrator was 
interrogated by three investigators, but bribed 
them in order to terminate the investigation.  He 
publicly boasted that he has enough money to 
guarantee his impunity.  The rape case referred to 
above is not an isolated incident, and impunity for 
rape and other forms of sexual violence is 
common.  Of increasing concern is the 
widespread practice of &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221;, 
whereby a woman or girl is taken against her will 
through deception or force and forced to marry 
one of her abductors.  Abductors are often 
intoxicated and act in groups, using physical or 
psychological coercion to compel the woman to 
&#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage. These marriages are 
rarely registered with the State. Instead, a Muslim 
cleric conducts the ceremony or the occasion is 
privately celebrated.  The kidnapped women are 
often raped by the abductors, but fail to report the 
crime for fear of repercussions. The abductions 
occur within all parts of Kyrgyzstan, both urban 
and rural.  The women involved are typically 
under the age of 25. Some victims are also 
minors. Despite the fact that Article 155 of the 
Criminal Code, outlaws non-consensual marriage

rounded up and detained the 300 refugees in 
Almerge Prison, 100km from Bengazi in northern

be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment if 
returned to Eritrea.  In particular, a group of 110 
refugees who were returned from Libya to Eritrea 
in July 2004 were held incommunicado in a secret

<p><b>Incident which took place in the Tripoli Abu 
Salim Prison</b>, which led to the death of one 
prisoner and the injuring of at least nine others.  
On 4 October 2006, some 190 prisoners were 
brought back to Abu Salim Prison following a 
hearing at a court in Tripoli. Upon their return to 
the Abu Salim Prison, some of the prisoners 
started to protest and an altercation ensued with 
the prison guards. The prison administration 
called in security forces from outside the prison to 
assist the guards in order to control the situation. 
Between 2pm and 3pm law enforcement officials 
fired tear-gas grenades and live ammunition at 
some of the prisoners. A prisoner, <b>Hafed Mansur 
Al-Zwai</b>, received a bullet wound to the head and 
died shortly afterwards. Nine other prisoners,

<p>By letter dated 13/11/06, the Government 
reported that the Department of Public 
Prosecutions launched an investigation into the 
incidents that occurred at the Abu Salim 
Reform and Rehabilitation Institute on 
Wednesday, 4 October 2006, where a number 
of prisoners and detainees staged a revolt.  
The Department of Public Prosecutions took all 
the steps required by law, questioning security 
personnel and guards of the officer class and 
other ranks.  It also questioned inmates who 
were not involved in the incident.  The 
investigation revealed that several detainees 
had returned from a court session.  When they 
entered the Institute, they occupied a number 
of administrative offices and threatened to set 
fire to them.  At the same time, they incited the 
other prisoners to join them and moved </p>

received bullet wounds and are still in serious

proceeded to occupy, jeopardizing the security 
and safety of the Institute as well as the safety 
of prisoners, guards and prison staff.  The 
officer in charge of the Institute went to the 
men to try to restore calm and convince them 
to return to their cells.  They attempted to 
assault him and a number of police guards, 
several of whom were injured.  The 
management had to call the General Security 
Department for reinforcements.  After a major 
effort, the General Security contingent and a 
group of guards managed to get back into the 
Institute.  At this point, the prisoners started to 
pelt the police with stones and pieces of iron 
that they had stolen from the site of the 
company carrying out maintenance work at the 
Institute.  A number of men climbed the walls 
and windows in a bid to escape, compelling the 
guards on the roofs and at the main entrances 
to discharge their weapons in order to gain 
control of the situation.  As a result, three 
prisoners received injuries of different kinds 
and were taken to hospital. The General 
Security officers who had been called in to help 
with the protection of the Institute made a great 
effort to force the prisoners back into their 
cells.  Direct clashes between the police and 
the prisoners ensued, with the police being 
bombarded with iron pieces, screwdrivers and 
water pipes.  In the clashes, eight policemen 
were injured, two of them slightly and the six 
others with various injuries, for which they </p>

<p>were hospitalized.  After the prisoners had 
returned to their cells, one person was found 
lying on the floor.  Upon examination, he was 
found to be dead.The investigation showed 
that the dead prisoner, Hafiz Mansur al-Zawi, 
had been imprisoned in connection with case 
No. 120/98.  The pathologist&#8217;s report indicated 
that the cause of death was a single injury 
sustained when the head of the deceased had 
collided with a body, cracking the skull and 
precipitating a fatal haemorrhage.  The report 
ruled out a gunshot wound as the cause of 
death.  The relatives of the deceased were 
notified of the death and of the conclusions of 
the medical report and the Department of 
Public Prosecutions ordered that the body be 
released to the family for burial. According to 
the investigation, three prisoners had been 
injured, namely: Ayman Ali al-Busayfi, Al-
Sanusi Mohammed al-Bashari, Fadlallah 
Mohammed al-Mughayrbi. These persons 
sustained various injuries and were taken to 
hospital for treatment.  The Department of 
Public Prosecutions took their statements. The 
investigation will continue until the testimony of 
prisoners associated with, or involved in the 
incident, and that of some of the Institute&#8217;s 
personnel has been heard.  The medical report 
has been annexed to the case file.

(E/CN.4/2005/62/Add.1, para. 906). On 1 
November 2006, at approximately 12pm, about 70 
members of the riot force police arrived by 
speedboats at Thinadhoo Island in the Southern 
Atoll of Gaaf Dhaal and proceeded to the office 
building of the MDP. On their way, the riot police 
apprehended <b>Mohamed Gasam</b> and forced him 
to accompany them to the MDP office, where six 
members of the MDP were working at this time. 
The riot police did not produce any search or 
arrest warrant when entering the office building 
and ordered the persons concerned to leave the 
office immediately, failing which they would be 
arrested. The riot force searched the office and 
confiscated banners, posters and other material. 
Following these events, Mohamed Gasam was 
taken directly from the MDP office to a holding cell 
on Thinadhoo Island. On the same day, a group of 
riot police approached <b>Mohamed Nazim</b>, while he 
was working in his shop. He was asked to 
accompany the riot police to the local police 
station. Mohamed Gasam and Mohamed Nazim 
were both held in solitary cells on Thinadhoo 
Island and pepper spray was applied to their faces 
while in detention there. They were both 
transferred at an unknown date to the Dhoonidhoo 
Island Detention Centre. <b>Mohamed Saleem Ali</b>

arrested this day. Before the arrests were made 
island officials allegedly drove around the island 
announcing that if any protection was provided to 
these persons, it would be considered an offence. 
It is reported that <b>Mohamed Waheed</b> and 
<b>Mohamed Saleem Ali</b> were ill-treated upon their 
arrests. Mohamed Waheed was hit in the face 
causing it to swell up. Mohamed Saleem Ali&#8217;s 
hand was broken, and when he asked for 
immediate medical attention it was initially denied. 
He received medical assistance only on 2 
November 2006 on Gaaf Alif Atoll Villingili Island. 
On the same day, <b>Yamin Mohamed</b> was taken

used inside holding cells to control noise caused 
by the detainees. Following a demonstration of

<p>Aureliano Alvarez  y Tiburcio G&#243;mez habr&#237;an sido 
nuevamente golpeados por otros reclusos, 
presuntamente bajo las &#243;rdenes de Armando 
Fabricio Maldonado, Director del Centro de 
Readaptaci&#243;n Social (CERESO) n&#250;mero 14, El 
Amate. En esta ocasi&#243;n, Aureliano &#193;lvarez y 
Tiburcio G&#243;mez habr&#237;an sido golpeados 
reiteradamente en el pecho, asfixiados con bolsas 
y sumergidos en agua fr&#237;a por un grupo de 
reclusos conocido como &#8220;los precisos&#8221;, entre 
ellos, Filadelfo Gonz&#225;lez, alias &#8220;El Cochero&#8221; y 
Andr&#233;s Balcacer, alias &#8220;El cachorro&#8221;. Debido a los

G&#243;mez habr&#237;an tenido que pasar la noche en la 
enfermer&#237;a y luego habr&#237;an sido trasladados

que cuando Aureliano Alvarez  y Tiburcio G&#243;mez 
regresaran el 16 de julio al modulo verde de 
poblaci&#243;n general, ser&#237;an nuevamente golpeados.  
Al conocer los abusos cometidos en contra de 
Aureliano Alvarez y Tiburcio G&#243;mez, &#8220;La voz del 
Amate&#8221;, organizaci&#243;n de presos pol&#237;ticos al

puesto tambi&#233;n en riesgo a esta organizaci&#243;n y 
actualmente sus miembros estar&#237;an siendo 
amenazados con ser castigados o dispersados en 
otros centros de reclusi&#243;n. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n

promoviendo entre los reclusos una recolecci&#243;n

modalidad de plagio o secuestro y 
delincuencia organizada. el Doctor Jorge 
Antonio L&#243;pez le practic&#243; un examen m&#233;dico 
al detenido, y concluy&#243; que no presentaba 
huellas de lesiones recientes visibles. Sobre 
los hechos ocurridos el 5 y 13 de julio de 2006, 
el Gobierno de M&#233;xico desea aclarar que tales 
eventos no ocurrieron. Las autoridades del 
centro de reclusi&#243;n iniciaron una investigaci&#243;n 
despu&#233;s de ser informados de los hechos. Se 
pregunt&#243; directamente a Aureliano Alvarez 
G&#243;mez y a Tiburcio G&#243;mez P&#233;rez, quienes 
confirmaron que las denuncias no eran ciertas. 
Para corroborar lo anterior, se les practicaron 
ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos y se determin&#243; que ambos 
se encontraban en buen estado de salud. As&#237; 
mismo, las autoridades del centro de reclusi&#243;n 
investigaron si Aureliano Alvarez G&#243;mez y a 
Tiburcio G&#243;mez P&#233;rez hab&#237;an sido objeto de 
extorsi&#243;n por parte de otros reclusos, lo cual 
result&#243; igualmente falso. Aunado a todo lo 
anterior, la Secretar&#237;a General del Estado de 
Chiapas, por medio del Comisionado para la 
Reconciliaci&#243;n de Comunidades en Conflicto, 
realiz&#243; acciones para confirmar el hecho, 
solicitando al Director del centro de reclusi&#243;n 
la elaboraci&#243;n de un nuevo examen m&#233;dico y 
psicol&#243;gico. Estos certificados constataron que 
se encontraban en buen estado de salud. A fin

copias de la valoraci&#243;n m&#233;dica del 30 de junio

reported that on 30 October 2005, the city of 
La&#226;youne was the scene of disturbances in 
which approximately 150 individuals 
participated. They hurled stones at passers-by 
in Mecca Street, causing damage to two police

named Hamdi Lmbarki was seriously injured; 
he was taken to a hospital for treatment, but he 
died. The Office of the Public Prosecutor 
ordered an autopsy on the body of the 
deceased. The autopsy was performed by 
three doctors at the Moulay Hassan Ben El-
Mehdi Hospital, and their conclusion was that 
death had resulted from injuries to the skull.

<p>investigation into the circumstances in which 
his son had died. The case was referred to the 
National Division of the Judicial Police for 
investigation of the incident and action to bring 
to justice those who had been responsible for 
the death. In addition, the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor ordered a second autopsy to 
determine the injuries sustained and identify 
the causes of the death. This autopsy was 
conducted by specialists at the Ibn Rushd 
University Hospital in Casablanca. The family 
of the deceased was informed of all measures 
taken in the case. On the basis of the findings 
of the investigation, it was decided that the two 
police officers who had been involved in the 
case should be brought before the examining 
magistrate on a charge of having inflicted 
injuries with a weapon and thereby 
unintentionally caused death while acting in 
their capacity as public employees. After 
questioning the two officers, the examining 
magistrate sentenced them to prison.

by several prisoners in Insein Prison. The incident 
occurred following the transfer of the prisoners 
from their cells to another wing. All three prisoners 
were beaten in the presence of several prison 
officials. Ko Aung San Myat who had been 
subjected to similar beatings on 18 December

stood by as the incident took place. The treatment

prisoner named Soe Thein Ye Thiha on 22 July

and he was then denied visits on two 
occasions as punishment. On 29 April 2005, 
Han Win Aung conducted a hunger strike as 
he was not satisfied with his transfer from ward 
4 to ward 5 and he wanted to move to another 
cell. He also conducted some activities which 
violated the prison&#8217;s rules and was accordingly 
denied visits for two weeks. Moreover, he was 
put in a special cell for two weeks as 
punishment. Regarding the deaths of 90 
prisoners since 1988, it was found that they 
died as a result of previous illnesses such as 
heart disease, hypertension, liver, lungs and 
tuberculosis and HIV. However, they had 
received proper medical treatments in prison 
hospitals as well as local hospitals. </p>

Headquarters in Naxal, Kathmandu, where he 
was threatened with dismissal unless he withdrew 
two complaints he had lodged in court against his 
superiors. On 21 March, Hom Bahadur Bagale 
was subjected to ill-treatment at Police 
Headquarters in Naxal, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. 
He managed to escape and took a taxi to the 
offices of daily newspaper publisher Kantipur

beaten him, shaved the top of his head to 
humiliate and degrade him, and dragged him 
through puddles of dirty water in his uniform.

<p>Before Kantipur staff could give any help, police 
officers arrived from the nearby Naya Baneshwor 
Ward Police Office and took him away in a police 
van. On 21 March, he was arrested by Nepal 
Police and detained at Hanuman Dhoka District 
police office (DPO), where he was held 
incommunicado. The Deputy Superintendent told 
lawyers that no access to Hom Bahadur Bagale 
was permitted until the Nepal Police completed 
their investigation. Lawyers, relatives and human 
rights activists tried to visit him in custody that 
day, but were turned away by police. On 28 
March, officer Bagale was brought before the 
Supreme Court and ordered to be released. The 
Court found that there were no permissible 
grounds to continue to detain him. He was thereby 
released but fears further reprisals by the Nepal 
Police. The National Human Rights Commission 
has been informed. Hom Bahadur Bagale has 
been pursuing a claim since 2002 that he was 
tortured by other police officers. The Special 
Rapporteur on Torture visited Hanuman Dhoka 
District police office on 12 September 2005, 
where he interviewed the Deputy Superintendent, 
and who together with the Chief Superintendent 
and another Deputy Superintendent, admitted that 
torture (TOR) takes place in Hanuman Dhoka 
DPO. The Special Rapporteur recalls that by letter 
dated 27 December 2005, the Government stated 
that it does not tolerate, condone or permit torture; 
that it does not allow impunity; that allegations are 
investigated with all the seriousness that they 
deserve; and stern action is taken against </p>

<p>offenders. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets 
that no steps have apparently been taken by the 
Government to this end, despite his appeal in the 
report of his mission to Nepal that security officials 
who practise, order or condone torture (e.g. the 
chief and deputy superintendents of Hanuman 
Dhoka District Police Office) are held accountable

2006, police beat student demonstrators with 
batons at the Patan Multiple Campus of Tribhuvan 
University in Lalitpur District, injuring several 
people. Yagya Raj Pant was kicked, punched, and 
beaten with batons by police. He was then taken 
away in a police van. While he was in the van, a 
police officer pointed a gun at his head and 
threatened to kill him, while other officers beat and 
kicked him. He was first taken to the District 
Police Office in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur District, and 
then to the nearby Patan Hospital for treatment. 
His left hand was injured, and at least one finger 
was broken. He is currently being held at the 
Armed Police Force compound, Gan No. 1, in the 
Naxal area of Kathmandu, under the Public 
Security Act.  The Forum for Protection of 
People's Rights, a non-governmental

peaceful rally against the army operation in 
Balochistan.  Their whereabouts were unknown 
for two months.   On 24 May 2005, Dr. Imdad 
Baloch, Dr. Yousaf Baloch, Dr. Naseem Baloch 
and Dr. Ghulam Rasool were released on bail. Dr. 
Imdad Baloch alleges that he and his fellow 
detainees had been detained incommunicado in 
solitary confinement for 33 days in Karachi, where 
they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment. 
He was hit on the soles of his feet making him 
unable to walk and beaten all over his body, 
including on his kidneys, with leather straps while 
forced to lie prone in fetters on the ground. The 
four detainees were then taken to Quetta, where 
they were kept for 22 days and threatened with 
death if they continued to participate in politics. In 
August 2005, Dr, Allah Nazar, Dr. Akhtar Nadeem 
and Dr. Ali Nawaz were located at a police station

Balochistan, Dr. Allah Nazar and Dr. Akhtar

terrorist activities under section 302, 234 of the 
Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, therefore they 
were kept in preventive detention as envisaged 
under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public 
Order. After the completion of the investigation, 
Akhtar Nadeem was released. However, 
sufficient evidence for indictment was found 
against Dr. Allah Nazar, therefore he was sent 
to judicial custody for facing trial in the court of 
law at Turbat. The inquiry report of the Home 
Department Balochistan states that no physical 
and mental torture was inflicted upon the 
suspects. It further states that, if, as they claim, 
they were subjected to maltreatment, they 
might have approached the court of law </p>

three of the suspected perpetrators. Local police

al-Muhannadi, he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment, not death. The conviction 
handed down by the courts of first and second 
instance were based on proper evidence that 
satisfied all legal standards and had been 
obtained from confessions which the 
defendants had made against themselves and 
each other.  The confessions were made freely 
and voluntarily before the court, and were 
supported by witness testimony given at trial.  
As for the statements which the defendants 
made to the police during questioning, the 
court did not accept them without being 
perfectly convinced that they had been 
obtained without any form of coercion or 
duress.  The court acted in accordance with 
international standards relating to the 
guarantee of a fair trial before ordinary courts 
in accordance with Qatari laws, and not before 
special or military courts.  The court sessions 
were attended by representatives of 
international non-governmental organizations 
such as the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, attending as observers. The judgement 
was final and cannot be appealed before any 
judicial body.  It remains for the Emir to 
exercise his power to confirm the judgement or 
grant an amnesty, as permitted by law. 
The Qatari Constitution which entered into 
force in June this year guarantees the right to a 
fair trial and the prohibition of torture. </p>

officers beat him on the head with a plastic bottle 
full of water, so as to leave no marks, and 
punched him in the kidney area. His lawyer is 
allowed to meet him only in the presence of the

<p>By letter dated 05/07/06, the Government 
reported that with respect to the allegations 
that he was subjected to beatings, torture and 
inhuman treatment by oficers of the Buicucani 
District Police Station, following careful 
examination of the applications submitted by 
his lawyer, the procurators of the Buiucani 
District procurator's office concluded that the 
arguments put forward were irrelevant, and 
declined to initiate criminal proceedings on the 
grounds that no offence had been committed 
by the police officers. On 18 April 2006, at 
around 2:30pm, while being pursued by the 
police for having committed an offence, Mr  
Kolibaba, acting out of contempt for law 
enforcement officials and endeavouring to 
escape arrest, unexpectedly struck a police 
officer with a sharp object on his face and neck 
causing him moderate bodily harm. Mr  
Kolibaba thereupon disappeared from the 
scene of the incident, without providing any 
medical assistance or calling an ambulance. 
On the basis of this evidence, on 26 April 
2006, criminal proceedings were initiated 
against Mr  Kolibaba for an attempt on the life 
of a police officer. On 21 April 2006,  Mr  
Kolibaba had been arrested for an 
administrative offence committed prior to the 
criminal offence mentioned previously, and 
appeared before a judge, who sentenced him 
to five days' administrative detention. 
Subsequently, during the criminal proceedings 
against him, Mr  Kolibaba was held in </p>

<p>three officers who had tortured him. The forensic 
expert reported that there was no evidence of 
torture. Vitalii Kolibaba is taken to Buiucani District 
Police Station every day for questioning. There 
are no facilities for providing food at Buiucani 
District Police Station, which means that he is 
forced to beg food from other prisoners. In the 
remand centre where he is currently held, 
prisoners are provided with hot water and bread, 
but this food is inedible. The utensils are filthy and 
the bread is of very poor quality. All prisoners rely 
on packages brought by relatives. As he is not 
allowed to receive packages from his mother he 
does not have access to adequate and sufficient

on 15 May 2006. When Mr  Kolibaba was 
examined by doctors in the emergency 
department at the hospital, and subsequently 
by the court medical expert, no internal or 
external injuries were found apart form a cut on 
his right forearm, which he had himself inflicted 
with a piece of metal while he was being held 
in custody in order to mislead the procurator 
and avoid criminal prosecution. The Buiucani 
District procurator's office submitted a report to 
the chief of police concerning the breach of 
conduct by the officers responsible, who had 
allowed Mr  Kolibaba to get hold of a piece of 
metal while he was being held in custody. In 
view of the foregoing, the Office of the 
Procurator-General considers that the 
circumstances and manner in which the 
injuries were sustained were correctly 
established by the procurators in the Buiucani 
District procurator's office, Chisinau. No 
evidence was found of the use of torture or ill-
treatment against Mr  Kolibaba. Given these 
circumstances, the position taken by the 
lawyer is clearly untenable: his appeal to the 
international organizations to take up Mr  
Kolibaba's case is quite unwarranted and he is 
surrounding the issue with a mass of 
misinformation in the hope of winning his case. 
Spreading reports of alleged gross violations of 
human rights and freedoms in this way when 
there is no substance to these allegations 
harms the image of our country and of its law </p>

crime. At the same time, the increasingly 
frequent use of such methods by the parties 
concerned, before the criminal cases in 
question have been dealt with by the national 
authorities, is a cause of concern. It is a 
dishonourable means of promoting private or

of criminal responsibility and the exertion of 
influence on legal authorities, involving them in 
futile exercises and diverting them from their 
core functions. In the light of the problem, the

a report to the Bar Association so as to ensure

on 9 March 2006, stated that the version of events 
given in the urgent appeal did not correspond to 
the reality, and gave a bad image of the State. No 
action was taken against the alleged perpetrators 
of torture. In the case of Roman Zadoinov, his 
client was also released on bail after an urgent

which remain in the cells until they are filled. Then 
they have to carry them although they weigh 
about 40 kg. In the punishment cells 
&#8220;preventative&#8221; beatings are common. Quarantine 
cells, where persons are held for up to two weeks, 
are located in the basement and conditions there 
are similar, with no toilets and no access to fresh 
water. Also, there are several bunkers, where the 
prison administration hides inmates and mistreats 
them. When prisoners file complaints about their 
treatment, the administration regularly threatens 
to kill them unless they withdraw them. In 
September 2005 the administration announced 
that special operations by OMON Special Forces 
will be conducted if any additional complaints are  
filed. Several cases of self-immolation to draw 
attention to the inhuman treatment have taken 
place. Some of them have resulted in deaths (the 
Special Rapporteur received information including 
the names and dates of death of three persons 
who died as a result of the treatment in the course 
of 2003 and 2004). No action was taken by the 
administration in response to these cases. When 
the prisoners protested, a special action was 
conducted on 20 April 2004 by OMON Special 
Forces, together with 300 staff members,  where 
mass beatings took place. Food is insufficient and 
of poor quality and often made of rotten 
ingredients. Medical assistance is regularly 
denied, in particular after beatings. Gifts from

self-mutilation by convicts were recorded at 
this institution in 2005. In each case, the 
convicts received proper medical treatment. No 
incidents involving fatal outcomes have been 
recorded at the prison. Prison food conforms to 
the requirements of Ministry of Justice Order 
No. 125 of 2 August 2005 confirming standards 
of nutrition and amenities for convicted 
prisoners and suspects and accused persons 
held in remand prisons administered by the 
Federal Penal Corrections Service. Inmates 
may receive parcels, hand-delivered packages 
and packets in accordance with Russian law. 
An inquiry has failed to confirm allegations that 
parcels, hand-delivered packages and packets 
from convicts' relatives have not been passed

2005, Magnitogorsk City Procurator's office 
conducted 15 inquiries at Prison No. 1. No

article 79 of the Penal Enforcement Code, 
convicts arriving at the prison are housed in 
quarantine cells for up to 15 days. During this 
time, they are held in normal prison conditions. 
The amenities and sanitary facilities in these 
cells meet required standards. There is no 
centralized sewage system in the cells located 
on the ground floor of the secure wing of the 
disciplinary unit owing to the proximity of 
groundwater. In 2005, therefore, 23 special 
cells were fitted out on the second and third 
floors of the disciplinary unit that meet all 
requisite standards in terms of amenities and 
hygiene. Reports of &quot;bunkers&quot; or &quot;punishment 
cells&quot; have not been confirmed, either in 
conversations with convicts and prison officers 
at Prison No. 1, or in the context of prison 
visits. At interviews with convicts on personal 
matters (which are conducted in private), no 
allegations of cruel treatment by prison officers 
have been borne out by facts. Complaints and 
communications from convicts are dealt with in 
accordance with current legislation. A survey 
conducted among the convicts has indicated 
that prison officers do not prevent them from 
filing complaints or making statements. </p>

<p><b>Isa Gamaev</b> and <b>Mekhti Mukhaev</b>, aged 47, a 
farmer from the Itum-Kali region of the Chechen 
Republic. On 10 December 2005, Isa Gamaev 
was detained in the city of Nalchik in the Republic 
of Kabardino-Balkaria, in connection with 
allegations that he was involved in the conflict in 
Chechnya. He was detained for three days in 
Nalchik.  He was then transferred to Khankala, the 
headquarters of the Russian armed and security 
forces in the North Caucasus, where he remained 
for approximately 10 days. He was then 
transferred to another unknown place of 
detention. Isa Gamaev has alleged that he was 
tortured in all three places of detention, including 
by electric shock treatment. While under duress, 
he made a statement to the security forces about 
his alleged participation in armed opposition 
groups and named Mekhti Mukhaev as a member 
of an armed group. In late December 2005 or 
early January 2006, Isa Gamaev was transferred 
to the Interior Ministry's Operative and Search 
Bureau, known as ORB-2, in the Chechen capital 
of Grozny, and from there to the pre-trial detention 
centre (SIZO 1) in Grozny, where he was able to 
send a letter to a non-governmental organization 
about his treatment in detention. He subsequently 
withdrew his &quot;confession&quot;. On 5 or 6 February 
2006, Isa Gamaev was again taken to ORB-2, 
where he was allegedly threatened with rape if he 
refused to uphold his &#8220;confession&#8221;. On 30

armed group led by Tarkhan Gaziev from the 
armed gang led by Doku Umarov.  On 24 
December 2005, he was arrested in Nalchik on 
suspicion of having committed offences under 
article 209 (Banditry), paragraph 2, article 208 
(Membership of an illegal armed formation) 
and article 317 (Attempt on the life of a law 
enforcement officer) of the Criminal Code of 
the Russian Federation.  On 24 December 
2005, by a decision of the Zavodsk District 
Court in Grozny, Chechen Republic, he was 
remanded in custody as a preventive measure. 
On 30 December 2005, Mr  Gamaev was 
taken to pretrial detention centre No. 1

Correction Service for the Chechen Republic.  
During his detention in SIZO-1, Mr  Gamaev

broke into the house where he was staying and 
took him to the Regional Police Department

hooliganism. The basis for the charge is not 
known. From there he was taken to the Regional 
Police Department of the Police in the Chechen 
town of Shatoi, where he was interrogated. During 
the interrogation, police officers beat him and 
threatened to shoot him while showing him 
pictures of various people whom they wanted him 
to identify. After 11 days in detention at the ROVD 
in Shatoi, he was transferred to the Interior 
Ministry's Operative and Search Bureau, known 
as ORB-2, where his interrogation continued. He 
was subjected to electric shock treatment and his 
arms and legs were bent back into painful 
positions. He was beaten with truncheons and 
was threatened that he would &#8220;disappear&#8221; if he did 
not confess to being a member of an armed 
opposition group. He reportedly lost 
consciousness several times.  On 18 January 
2006, Mekhti Mukhaev was transferred to the pre-
trial detention centre (SIZO 1) in Grozny. After 
almost three weeks of incommunicado detention, 
he was granted access to a lawyer and his 
relatives learned about his whereabouts. When 
his relatives visited him, he complained about 
headaches, pain in his legs, his lungs and his 
kidneys. Mekhti Mukhaev told his lawyer that after 
eight or nine days of ill treatment he had decided 
to &#8220;admit&#8221; to having given food and shelter to 
</p>
<p>offences under article 209, paragraph 2, article 
208, article 317 and article 105 (Murder) of the 
Criminal Code.  By a decision of 13 January 
2006, of the Zavodsk District Court in Grozny, 
Chechen Republic, he was remanded in 
custody as a preventive measure. On 18 
January 2006, Mr  Mukhaev was transferred to 
SIZO-1 of the Russian Federal Penal 
Correction Service for the Chechen Republic.  
From 1 to 2 February 2006, he was held in the 
ORB-2 temporary holding facility pursuant to a 
decision of the investigator attached to the 
procurator&#8217;s office of the Chechen Republic. 
During their time in the pretrial detention 
centre, Mr  Gamaev and Mr  Mukhaev did not 
address any complaints to the administration of 
the centre, and their state of health was 
assessed as satisfactory. On 3 February 2006, 
Mr  Gamaev and Mr  Mukhaev submitted

their fists, and kicked him, in order to force him to 
repeat his &#8220;confession&#8221;. He was returned to the 
SIZO the following day. Mekhti Mukhaev was 
charged on 8 February 2006 with banditry (Article 
209 of the Russian Criminal Code). There is 
concern that both men are at risk of torture or ill-
treatment in order to force them to uphold their 
previous &#8220;confessions&#8221;.

the admissibility of the evidence gathered will 
be subjected to a legal evaluation.  The reports 
that I.M. Gamaev and M.M. Mukhaev were 
subjected to illegal methods of investigation 
have been checked by the Procurator&#8217;s Office 
of the Chechen Republic under articles 144

the Russian Federation.  On the basis of the 
results of that verification, on 9 February 2006 
the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Chechen 
Republic decided not to institute criminal 
proceedings.  The report on the checks was 
studied at the Office of the Procurator-General 
of the Russian Federation, and there are no 
grounds for overturning that decision. It has 
been ascertained that on 30 December 2005, 
M.M. Mukhaev was detained in the Itum-Kali 
District Internal Affairs Office in the Chechen 
Republic in connection with his possible 
membership of illegal armed formations, 
following which he was released the same day.  
According to the conclusions of forensic 
experts, M.M. Mukhaev shows no sign of 
physical harm.  I.M. Gamaev and M.M. 
Mukhaev were held in Institution IZ-21/1 of the 
Federal Penal Correction Service for the

not the subject of any search activities.  In 
order to verify this information further, in 
accordance with the legislation on criminal 
procedure, on 6 May 2006, materials were 
taken from the file on the aforementioned 
criminal case and sent to the Office of the 
Procurator of the Grozny District of the 
Chechen Republic. I.M. Gamaev&#8217;s allegation 
regarding the illegal actions of law enforcement 
officials in the towns of Nalchik and Khasavyurt 
were also checked by the procurators&#8217; offices 
of those towns, under articles 144 and 145 of 
the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure.  The 
evidence collected was studied at the Office of 
the Procurator-General of the Russian 
Federation, and the decisions not to institute 
criminal proceedings were found to have been 
premature.  The evidence has been returned 
for further checks, the outcome of which is

Sayasan for the purposes of verifying evidence 
at the scene of the offence.  During the 
inspection of the scene, A.A. Umaev picked up

The men said that they were members of the

seven other individuals in the mosque to show 
them their ID cards. The FSB members physically 
threatened them and forced them to get into a

forced to face the wall and were forbidden to 
speak. They were taken one by one to an office 
where they were interrogated about who financed 
the mosque and why they attended the mosque. 
The FSB members demand that they stop 
attending the mosque and agree to cooperate. 
They also threatened that if they refused to 
cooperate, they would plant narcotics on them 
and bring false charges against them.  The three 
Russian detainees were subsequently released. 
However, the six Tajik detainees were taken to a 
bus at gun point.  They were made to lie on the 
floor in the bus and taken to the Lenin Regional 
Ministry of Interior office in TumenThere, Abdu

who beat  him to obtain a confession, which he 
signed. As a result, he fell sick and caught a fever, 
but was denied access to medical treatment. The 
first defence lawyer was intimidated by law-

repeated threats as well. Mr  Brechanov's parents 
were told that their son would not be beaten any 
more if they paid money to the officials. They filed 
complaints with the Prosecutor's Office and the 
Ministry of Interior, but no action ensued.

reported that Mr  Brechalov was arrested on 
7 March 2006 in Moscow and transferred into 
police custody in the town of Tikhoretsk for the 
purposes of investigation.  In the course of the 
pre-trial investigation, it was established that 
Mr  Brechalov had committed a robbery and 11

<p>Procurator&#8217;s Office decided on 8 June 2006 not 
to institute criminal proceedings, on the 
grounds that no offence had been committed.  
That decision was overturned by the 
Tikhoretsk Inter-District Deputy Procurator on 
21 July 2006. Mr  Brechalov was sent for a 
medical examination.  According to the report 
submitted on his results, an injury was found in 
the form of an abrasion to the radiocarpal area, 
not causing harm to his health.  An official from 
the Procurator&#8217;s Office questioned the chief 
investigation officer of the investigative section 
attached to the Vyselki District Internal Affairs 
office, who explained that, in the course of 
investigation, no complaints had been received 
from Mr  Brechalov that unlawful methods had 
been used on him by militia personnel. His 
lawyers confirmed the testimony and explained 
that they had conducted the defence of Mr  
Brechalov during the investigations that were 
carried out with his participation.  In their 
presence, Mr  Brechalov had voluntarily made 
a confession.  They had seen no physical 
injuries on their client; he denied that physical 
or psychological pressure had been used, nor 
did he make any complaints about the actions 
of the militia personnel.  On 3 August 2006, a 
further decision was taken not to institute 
criminal proceedings on the grounds that the 
actions of the investigators had not constituted 
an offence.  This decision was overturned on 
31 August 2006 and the files were returned for 
additional investigation. </p>

hairs from Ravil Gumarov&#8217;s beard and forced 
vodka down his throat, which is a particularly

acts by law-enforcement agents in relation to 
Ravil Gumarov, Timur Ishmuratov, Rustam

subsequently got approval from the Russian 
Supreme Court to annul the verdict so that the 
three could be tried again for the same crime.  On 
5 May 2006, the defendants were convicted of 
terrorism and illegal possession of weapons or 
explosives (Articles 205 and 222 of the Russian 
Criminal Code). They were also ordered to pay 
damages of about U.S. $2,000 for property 
damage. Ravil Gumarov was sentenced to a term 
of 13 years, and Timur Ishmuratov to 11 years and 
one month. The third man, Fanis Shaikhutdinov, 
received 15 years and six months.  According to 
the information received, another suspect had 
confessed to carrying out the crime in July 2005, 
however, the defence lawyers for the three men 
were never informed of this confession.  All three 
have appealed their convictions to the Russian 
Supreme Court. Two witnesses in the trial were 
detained and beaten to force them to testify 
against the defendants. On 31 March 2005, Timor

<p>232.   19/09/06 AL  TOR; <b>Krasnokamensk Prison Camp</b> YG 14/10, Chita 
Region, Siberia. The Krasnokamensk prison is 
situated near a uranium mine that has 
contaminated the area with radioactive waste. 
Concentrations of radioactive elements exceed 
appropriate safety levels, and spills from storage 
centers enter ground waters and migrate towards 
drinking water reservoirs.  As a result, inmates are 
at risk of radiation poisoning. Further, as a result 
of the prevailing unsanitary conditions, inmates 
suffer from tuberculosis, and in 2005, two inmates 
died, one of dysentery due to leakage of sewage 
into the prison water supply, and the other of 
gangrene. Moreover, article 73 of the Russian 
Criminal Penitentiary Code stipulates that except 
under extraordinary circumstances, prisoners 
serve their terms of deprivation of liberty on the 
territory of subjects of the Russian Federation 
where they reside or were convicted. In violation 
of this, there are reportedly prisoners, such as 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is serving an eight-
year prison sentence for tax evasion, who are 
sent to the prison camp, thousands of kilometers 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 30/11/06 the Government 
replied that Krasnokamensk colony IK-10 is 
located close to the town Krasnokamensk, only 
at approximately 800 meters from the closest 
residential houses. The closest uranium mine 
is 12 km away from the town and 15 km from 
the colony. The level of radiation is regularly 
controlled by the responsible authorities. In 
January and April 2006, when the Department 
for Environmental Protection of the joint stock 
company &#8220;Priargun metallurgical-chemical 
production association&#8221; conducted controls, the 
radioactivity was at 0,10-0,16 &#181; of contaminant 
particles/hour (the norm is 0,35 &#181; of 
contaminant particles/hour). The figures 
provided by the Centre for Hygiene and 
Epidemiology of Krasnokamensk show that the 
level of radioactivity was 0,10 &#8211; 0,26 &#181; of 
contaminant particles/hour (control n. 265). 
Also, additional tests conducted in October 
2006 (control n. 72) showed that the level of 
radioactivity did not exceed the permissible 
levels (0,17-0,20 &#181; of contaminant </p>

<p>from their families. particles/hour on the eastern side of the colony 
and 0,15-0,18 on the southern side).  
The drinking water supplying IK-10 and the 
town of Krasnokamensk stems from an 
artesian well situated at a distance of 
approximately 30 km from the town. According 
to the figures of the Centre for Hygiene and 
Epidemiology of Krasnokamensk the amount 
of uranium in the drinking water constitutes 
0,4-1,26 Bq /l (permissible level: 3,1 Bq /l). No 
uranium leakages have entered ground waters 
or migrated towards drinking water reservoirs.  
In 2005 and 2006, 12 and14 persons 
respectively suffered from tuberculosis in IK-
</p><p>10. Since the abolition of a tuberculosis unit in 
2005 (in connection with a sharp fall in cases 
of tuberculosis), persons suffering from 
tuberculosis have been transferred to a 
specialized medical institution. In October 
2006, 1035 persons were being held in IK-10 
(capacity: 1498), out of whom three had 
undergone tuberculosis treatment, but were 
completely cured.  
The sanitary conditions of the living quarters 
have been found satisfactory by the Sanitary-
epidemiological service of the Penitentiary 
Administration of Chitinskiy Region.  
In 2005 two convicts held in IK-10 died: V. A. 
Fedorov from coronary insufficiency, and S. E. 
Yazshin from salmonella poisoning (after a 
long-term meeting with relatives). Therefore, 
there were no deaths due to sanitary problems 
or diseases in IK-10 in 2005.  </p>

<p>In 2005, because of the long-term use of water 
pipes there was one instance of leakage of 
sewage, but it was immediately repaired and 
did not lead to any cases of dysentery.  
Art. 73 of the Russian Criminal Penitentiary 
Code stipulates that prisoners serve their 
terms of deprivation of liberty on the territory of 
subjects of the Russian Federation where they 
reside or were convicted. If there is no colony 
of the type required by the conviction or no 
place in one of the colonies on the territory of 
subjects of the Russian Federation where they 
reside or were convicted, convicts are sent to 
the closest possible institution. M. B. 
Khodorkovsky, considering that this provision 
was violated in his case, filed a complaint 
against his place of detention. The 
Zamoskvoreckiy District Court of Moscow 
rejected this complaint, which M. B. 
Khodorkovsky appealed to Moscow City Court. 
However, the latter also rejected the appeal. 
Therefore, the court has confirmed that the fact 
that M. B. Khodorkovskiy is serving his 
sentence in IK-10 is in compliance with the 
legislation. Besides Mr. Khodorkovsky, there 
are 14 more convicts from other Subjects of 
the Russian Federation and no violations of 
art. 73 were detected in their cases.

<p>He was then taken to a District Court in Moscow, 
which ordered him to be deported to Uzbekistan 
due to his failure to present a residency permit. 
During the hearing he was not represented by a 
lawyer and was not given an opportunity to speak 
on his own behalf.  He was deported on the 
evening of 24 October 2006.  Rustam Muminov 
moved from Uzbekistan to Russia in 2000 and 
acquired a temporary residency permit. In 2005, 
the authorities in Uzbekistan accused him of 
membership of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. In February 2006, 
he was detained in the city of Lipetsk following an 
extradition request from the General Procuracy of 
Uzbekistan. In September 2006, the General 
Procuracy of the Russian Federation decided not 
to extradite Rustam Muminov and he was 
released on 29 September 2006. His temporary 
residence permit expired while he was in 
detention, and the authorities refused to renew it. 
According to the information received, he was 
returned to Uzbekistan despite the fact that a 
lawyer from Komitet Grazhdanskoe Sodeistvie 
had filed an appeal with the court, which was due 
to be examined on 26 October 2006. Furthermore, 
on 24 October, the European Court had indicated 
to the authorities under rule 39 of the Rules of the 
Court that they should take interim measures to 
ensure that Rustam Muminov remained in the 
Russian Federation.

against Mr  <b>Shamsudin Tangiev</b> and Ms

Memorial. On 16 October 2006, a memorial picket 
was due to take place in honour of the late 
journalist Ms  Anna Politkovkskaya in Nazran, 
Ingushetia at 4pm. Uniformed police agents and 
men in civilian clothes prevented people from 
attending the picket as it had been deemed illegal 
by the authorities.  Mr  Mutsolgov had notified the 
Head of the City Administration of the intention to 
hold the memorial but no official response was 
received, since it is not necessary to obtain 
permission to hold a picket under Federal Law. Mr  
Mutsolgov did receive a letter dated 15 October 
2006, informing him that the picket had been 
deemed illegal, but he did not consider it to be an 
official response as it was not signed by the Head 
of the City Administration and there was no official 
emblem on the letter. Members of the Chechen 
Committee for National Salvation and Mr

were surrounded by men in civilian clothes who 
tried to provoke a violent reaction from them.  
They were joined a few minutes later by Mr  
Mutsolgov and members of Mashr but they were 
also surrounded by men in civilian clothes 
accompanied by uniformed militiamen. The 
participants were physically beaten. In addition, 
two Memorial staff members were beaten.  Mr  
Tangiev was assaulted after he supposedly 
commented on the use of language by the 
militiamen in relation to the women present and 
when Ms  Sokirianskaia attempted to intervene, a 
Nazran police officer in civilian clothes, struck her 
across the face causing her to suffer concussion 
and a broken nose. Ms  Mukusheva, Ms  
Muradova, Ms  Yandieva, Mr  Khantygov and Mr  
Mutsolgov were subsequently  transported to the 
Nazran city militia station (GOVD) where they 
were denied access to their lawyers and were not 
informed of their rights. Late that night a judge 
was brought to the station in order to hear the 
case of the three female detainees. They were not 
legally represented and were fined 500 rubles for 
&#8220;violating the established manner for carrying out 
a demonstration&#8221;. The male activists were 
eventually granted access to their lawyer, 
Magomed Gandaur-Egi, but only eight hours after 
their initial detention and their hearing was 
postponed until 30 October 2006. Concern is

reported that on 13 October 2005, he was 
detained as a suspect in criminal proceedings 
in connection with an armed attack on law 
enforcement officers and civilians in Nalchik. 
On the same day, Mr  Karaev&#8217;s relatives were 
informed of his arrest in accordance with the 
legally established procedure. On 19 October, 
pursuant to a court decision, the preventive 
measure of remand in custody was chosen for 
Mr  Karaev.  No violations of current legislation 
occurred during Mr  Karaev&#8217;s detention and 
remand in custody. He was indicted on the 
basis of sufficient grounds for accusing him of 
the aforementioned particularly serious 
offences. The allegations that he sustained 
serious physical injuries from law enforcement 
officers who sought to obtain a confession 
were investigated by the procurator&#8217;s office in 
accordance with articles 144 and 145 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. The forensic 
medical examination (No. 1434-A) conducted

of Nizhny Novgorod, was arrested by officers 
of the criminal investigation unit of the 
Moskovsky district internal affairs office of 
Nizhny Novgorod on suspicion of involvement 
in the murder of the head of the criminal 
investigation division of the Sormovo district 
internal affairs authority, I.S. Dodonov. On 22 </p>

<p>July 2005, the Moskovsky district procurator&#8217;s 
office of Nizhny Novgorod instituted criminal 
proceedings (case No. 141715) on the basis of 
evidence of an offence contrary to article 111, 
paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation (Intentional infliction of a 
serious injury, resulting in manslaughter). 
Immediately after his arrest, Mr. Salikhov was 
taken by militia officers to the aforementioned 
procurator&#8217;s office where, in the presence of a 
lawyer, he stated that, on the evening of 21 
July 2005, on Strazh Revolutsii Street in 
Nizhny Novgorod, in a state of alcoholic 
intoxication, together with his acquaintances 
A.V. Gogochkin and S.S. Kuznetsov, both of 
whom have criminal records, for no apparent 
reason he beat up the first man (I.S. Dodonov) 
that came his way. Mr. Salikhov confirmed his 
testimony during the examination of the scene 
of the crime. On 27 July 2005, pursuant to a 
court decision, Mr. Salikhov was remanded in 
custody.  On 1 August 2005, the investigator of 
the procurator&#8217;s office charged him under 
article 111, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code. 
On 5 August 2005, the lawyer I.V. Rykov went 
to the Novgorod Province Central Internal 
Affairs Department and presented a statement 
made on 30 July 2005 by Mr. Salikhov, in 
which he alleges that, at the time of his arrest 
on 26 July 2005, he was beaten in the 
premises of the Moskovsky district internal 
affairs office by several militia officers who tried 
to force him to confess. </p>

</b></p>
<p>An official investigation into the matter was 
carried out with the participation of the Internal 
Security Department of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs; however, Mr. Salikhov&#8217;s allegations 
were not confirmed. According to an entry in 
the record of persons brought to the duty office 
of the Moskovsky internal affairs office in 
Nizhny Novgorod, during his time there (26 
and 27 July 2005), Mr. Salikhov did not 
complain about his health. The members of the 
criminal investigation unit of the Moskovsky 
district internal affairs office who participated in 
the investigation into Mr. Dodonov&#8217;s murder 
categorically deny that any force was used 
against the detainee. Moreover, pursuant to a 
decision taken on 3 August 2005 by the 
investigator in criminal case No. 141715, Mr. 
V.S. Koryagin, Mr. Salikhov underwent a 
forensic medical examination, which found that 
his physical injuries in the form of abrasions - 
which did not cause any harm to his health - 
were sustained on 21 or 22 July 2005 (prior to 
his arrest). In this connection, the Moskovsky 
district procurator&#8217;s office in Nizhny Novgorod 
twice, on 29 September and 21 October 2005, 
decided not to institute criminal proceedings 
owing to the lack of any evidence that the 
militia officers committed an offence. Mr. 
Salikhov is being held in remand centre No. 1 
in Nizhny Novgorod.  When he entered the 
remand centre, he was examined by a 
physician. The examination revealed the 
following bodily injuries:  bruise in the area of </p>

<p>his left eye and numerous abrasions on his 
back. The relevant materials have been 
referred to the Moskovsky district procurator&#8217;s 
office in Nizhny Novgorod. As a result of an 
additional investigation, conducted by the 
Nizhny Novgorod provincial procurator&#8217;s office, 
into Mr. Salikhov&#8217;s allegations of having been 
beaten by militia officers, on 6 December 2005, 
criminal proceedings were instituted on the 
basis of evidence that official powers had been 
exceeded, which constitutes an offence under 
article 286 of the Criminal Code. The 
investigation of this criminal case is being 
monitored by the Office of the Procurator 
General of the Russian Federation.

</b></p>
<p>By letter dated 29/02/06, the Government 
reported that on 29 December 2004 the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan instituted criminal proceedings 
on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary 
to article 286 (Exceeding official powers), 
paragraph 3 (a), of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation, following an incident 
involving officers of the Blagoveshchensk 
district internal affairs division and the police 
special duties detachment (OMON) of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan.  While conducting preventive 
measures from 10 to 14 December 2004, the 
officers allegedly used force against residents 
of Blagoveshchensk. 
During the investigation it was established that,

<p>Sedov Street in Blagoveshchensk in the 
Republic of Bashkortostan, in the presence of 
a large crowd, a group of citizens resisted 
officers of the Blagoveshchensk district internal 
affairs division, as a result of which five of them 
received minor injuries.  On 9 December 2004, 
the head of the Blagoveshchensk internal 
affairs division, together with officials of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan, using the aforementioned 
incident as justification, took a decision to 
conduct preventive measures in 
Blagoveshchensk and Blagoveshchensk 
district, making maximum use of the personnel 
of the Blagoveshchensk district internal affairs 
division and the OMON group attached to the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan.  The main objective of the 
measures was to identify persons who commit 
offences on the streets and in public places, 
violate law and order and engage in antisocial 
behaviour, and to prevent domestic crime and 
juvenile delinquency. However, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs officers and the group of OMON 
officers turned this operation into a 
demonstration of force in order to intimidate 
the population; their actions were accompanied 
by numerous violations of citizens&#8217; 
constitutional rights and freedoms and by cruel 
and degrading treatment. Between 10 and 14 
December 2004, 144 persons were taken 
without due cause to the Blagoveshchensk

<p>illegally subjected to unlawful force.  These 
persons have been recognized as the victims 
in the case. Experts found that 23 persons had 
sustained various bodily injuries. Citizens 
Berdnikov, Ramentev, Kondratev, Lazarev, 
Antipin and Sergeev were recognized as 
victims in the criminal proceedings.  Citizens 
Shatanov and Dyakonov were not questioned 
as witnesses or victims in the case, and no 
information concerning any bodily harm 
caused to them was received during the 
investigation.  The procurator&#8217;s office of the 
Republic of Bashkortostan is investigating this 
information. As a result of the investigation of 
the criminal case, the head of the 
Blagoveshchensk district internal affairs 
division and the person immediately 
responsible for conducting the preventive 
measures, was charged with offences contrary 
to article 286, paragraphs 3 (a), (b) and (c), of 
the Criminal Code. The commander of the first 
tactical company of OMON attached to the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan, who was the senior officer of 
the OMON group that was sent to provide 
practical assistance to the Blagoveshchensk 
district internal affairs division, was charged 
with offences contrary to article 286, paragraph 
3 (a), (b) and (c), of the Criminal Code. In 
connection with the issuance of 198 knowingly 
unlawful decisions to bring administrative 
proceedings against citizens, the deputy head 
of the Blagoveshchensk district internal affairs </p>

<p>division, was charged with an offence contrary 
to article 285 (Abuse of official powers), 
paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code. For 
exceeding official powers, which took the form 
of the unlawful use of force against citizens, 
several other officers were prosecuted. On 29 
July 2005, the criminal case with the bill of 
indictment was referred to the 
Blagoveshchensk district court for 
consideration of its merits, the result of which 
is being monitored. Moreover, in a case related 
to the aforementioned criminal proceedings, 
two militia officers of the Blagoveshchensk 
district internal affairs division who used 
persuasion and threats to force the victims to 
sign declarations that they had sustained their 
bodily injuries through their own negligence, 
have been convicted under article 285, 
paragraph 1, and article 292 of the Criminal 
Code. The incidents that occurred in 
Blagoveshchensk and Blagoveshchensk 
district were thoroughly investigated by senior 
officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation with the participation of the 
President of the Republic of Bashkortostan, 
Mr. M.G. Rakhimov.  As a result of the 
investigation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 
the Russian Federation signed an order setting 
out a series of measures to strengthen legality 
and ensure that citizens&#8217; rights are observed 
when Russian internal affairs bodies engage in 
law enforcement activities. The information

<p>concerning mass arrests in the town market, 
the conduct of identification checks in two 
residences in Blagoveshchensk, A. Shatanov&#8217;s 
attempted suicide, the beating of pregnant 
women, as well as the ethnic focus of the 
measures taken, does not correspond to the 
facts. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation is currently cooperating 
actively with the Commissioner for Human 
Rights in the Russian Federation and other 
human rights organizations, including with a 
view to investigating violations by militia 
officers of citizens&#8217; constitutional rights and 
interests, and is drafting joint measures to 
prevent violations of law and order.  Some 
constituent entities of the Russian Federation 
have established social councils to monitor the 
observance of human rights in the work of 
internal affairs agencies, and there are plans to 
extend this practice to other regions of the

The sentence followed his conviction for

<p><b>Khalid Mehmood Rashid</b>, a Pakistani citizen. Mr  
Khalid Mehmood Rashid was handed over by 
South African authorities to Pakistani officials at 
an air base in South Africa nine months ago. 
Thereafter, he left the country with Pakistani 
officials on an unscheduled flight. He has not 
been seen or heard from since. According to the 
Pakistani High Commission in South Africa on 14 
June 2006, Mr Rashid was &quot;wanted in Pakistan for 
his suspected links with terrorism and other anti-
state elements (...) Presently he is in the custody 
of the Government of Pakistan&quot;. On 29 June 
2006, the Lahore High Court directed the state to 
disclose his whereabouts within three weeks. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 23/11/06, the Government 
reported that On 31 October 2005 members of 
the South African Police Services and 
members of the Department of Home Affairs 
conducted an exercise in the town of Escourt, 
KwaZulu-Natal, which led to the detention of K 
M Rashid and I Jeebhai. Mr. Rashid is a 
Pakistani national whilst Mrs. Jeebhai is an 
Indian national. Both these persons were 
detained under the provisions of sections 34, 
42 and 8 of the Immigration Act, No 13 of 2002 
(&quot;the Immigration Act&quot;). After the provisions 
were complied with, Mr. Rashid was deported 
to Pakistan, having been handed over by 
South African authorities to Pakistan officials at 
Waterkloof Air Force Base, South Africa, on 6 
November 2005. Mr. Jeebhai was also in the 
process of being deported to India, when an 
urgent application was lodged by his brother, 
on 12 November 2005, and set down for 
hearing on 15 November 2005. In terms of a 
court order obtained on 15 November 2005 Mr. 
Jeebhai, who had not yet been deported, was </p>

<p>released and is presently (illegally) in the 
Republic of South Africa. Waterkloof Air Force 
Base is a port of entry operated by the 
Department of Home Affairs. Immigration 
officials stationed at Waterkloof Air Force Base 
completed and stamped the necessary 
prescribed documentation prior to Mr. Rashid 
being handed over to Pakistani officials. The 
aircraft which collected Mr. Rashid is not a 
scheduled flight. No direct flight exists between 
South Africa and Pakistan. Full details of the 
aircraft's registration number were made 
available to Mr. Rashid's legal representatives. 
At that stage, being October/November 2005, 
the South African authorities were not aware of 
the fact that Mr. Rashid was &quot;wanted in 
Pakistan for his suspected links with terrorism 
and other anti-state elements&quot;. The first time 
that the South African authorities became 
aware thereof, was when the Pakistani High 
Commission to South Africa issued a 
statement to this effect on 14 June 2006. It is 
the policy of the Department of Home Affairs to 
deport persons as soon as possible after their 
detention under South African immigration 
legislation. A plethora of applications and other 
court proceedings were instituted on behalf of 
Mr. Rashid subsequent to October 2005 and 
which culminated in the hearing of the main 
application which took place on 25 and 28 
August 2006 as mentioned above. Despite the 
filing of a multitude of depositions by parties 
acting on behalf of Messrs. Jeebhai and </p>

</p>
<p>

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government Response 
</b></p>
<p>Rashid, as well as by their legal 
representatives, no reference whatsoever is 
ever made in such depositions as to any 
inappropriate behaviour or conduct towards 
Mr. Rashid by the South African authorities. 
The only cause for complaint which is lodged 
by the persons and legal representatives 
acting on behalf of Messrs. Rashid and 
Jeebhai, was that the detention and 
deportation of Mr. Rashid was not in 
compliance with the Immigration Act, to the 
extent that section 8 thereof had not been 
complied with. Section 8 of the Immigration 
Act, provides that the person detained under 
section 41 or section 34 has a right of review, 
directly by the Minister, of the decision of an 
immigration official to declare a person 
detained in terms of the immigration legislation 
as an &quot;illegal foreigner&quot;. Such a review, which 
is directed to the Minister of Home Affairs must 
be lodged within three days of to the 
declaration of &#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221;. The reason for 
the short period of time afforded to a detainee 
is self-evident, namely, to ensure that certainty 
as to the immediate future movement of the 
detainee, is obtained as soon as is possible. 
Further appeal/review proceedings are 
provided for in section 8 but which are not, for 
purposes of the present enquiry, relevant. 
Whilst in detention, Mr. Rashid deposed an 
affidavit on 2 November 2005 in terms of which 
he acknowledged that he had entered the 
Republic of South Africa unlawfully and that he </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/33/Add.1

<p><b>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government Response 
</b></p>
<p>had paid certain monies for a fraudulently 
issued permit. He  also, in addition thereto, 
signed certain prescribed documentation in 
terms of which he waived his entitlement to the 
review procedure provided for in section 8 of 
the Immigration Act as well as his entitlement 
to call for the confirmation of his detention by 
way of an arrest warrant issued by a South 
African court. As regards the further allegations 
concerning the proceedings of the Lahore High 
Court, the South African authorities are aware, 
through statements made by Mr. Rashid's 
South African legal representative, that steps 
have been taken in Lahore to attempt to 
establish his whereabouts. No further 
information in this regard is known by the 
South African authorities. The South African 
Government cannot adopt the approach that all 
deportations to countries such as Pakistan will 
lead to the torture of such returnees. In the 
event, however, of South African officials being 
aware of the possibility that specific returnees 
may well be exposed to torture, the South 
African Government will request written 
undertakings by the Government of the 
returnee that the relevant international 
covenants regulating torture, will be respected. 
To the extent that this question is aimed by the 
Special Rapporteurs only at the Government of 
Pakistan, this is unwarranted in that it 
discriminates specifically against the officials of 
Pakistan, and fails to take into consideration 
the fact that torture may be exercised by a </p>

<p>number of Governments of the international 
community. The South African authorities did 
communicate with the Pakistani authorities 
during June/July 2006, with a view to 
establishing whether or not Mr. Rashid was in 
fact received by the Government in Pakistan. 
Answers to both these questions were 
provided in the affirmative by the Government  
of Pakistan.

<p>Por carta con fecha 25/11/05, el Gobierno 
inform&#243; de que los cuatro incidentes 
mencionados han dado origen a procesos 
judiciales y otras tantas investigaciones 
internas. Ni uno ni otro precisan denuncia 
previa, pues se inician de oficio. La muerte del 
nacional camerun&#233;s Joseph Abunaw 
Ayukabang es objeto de una investigaci&#243;n a&#250;n 
abierta, cuyo desarrollo se ve forzosamente 
limitado debido a que el fallecimiento ocurri&#243; 
fuera de Espa&#241;a. Respecto a este incidente el 
Gobierno aclara que las fuerzas y cuerpos de 
seguridad espa&#241;oles tienen prohibidas la 
tenencia y uso de porras el&#233;ctricas. En los 
registros peri&#243;dicos de los dep&#243;sitos de armas

Finalmente, existe un proceso judicial abierto

que el personal del puesto fronterizo recuper&#243; 
los cuerpos de dos personas que murieron al

<p>By letter dated 30/06/06, the Government 
reported that is facing the problem of terrorism 
with the LTTE, which is a terrorist group that 
has been banned in many countries including 
the USA, India, Canada and the European 
Union. The LTTE is known to operate in 
countries that have banned it through front 
organisations. The Tamil Rehabilitation 
Organisation (TRO) is a known front 
organisation of the LTTE, which helps the 
LTTE in its terrorist activities by collecting 
funds in foreign countries. The alleged 
abduction of members of the TRO appears to 
have been stage managed by the LTTE in 
order to bring about adverse publicity for the 
Government. The facts contained in the 
allegations cast serious doubt on the credibility 
of the information regarding the abduction. On

<p>they wanted to make a complaint regarding a 
kidnapping. They complained to the effect that 
they were kidnapped by an armed gang whilst 
they were proceeding towards Kilinochchi on

left for Kilinochchi in a van, registration no. JA 
3074 on 29 January 2006 with a view to 
collecting some money lent to them by an 
NGO at Kilinochchi named FORUT. They had 
left Batticaloa at about 5:15pm with two others, 
namely Doshini and Ganeshalingam, in a van 
driven by Thangarasa. When they were on 
their way to Kilinochchi at Welikanda, an 
armed gang of about seven persons stopped 
their vehicle, threatened them at gunpoint and 
kidnapped all five of them. Their valuables and 
jewellery were removed and the victims 
blindfolded and taken away towards the jungle 
in their vehicle. The three females were 
detained in a separate place from the men. On 
the following day (30 January 2006) at about 
4pm, Doshini was taken away from them. All of 
them were questioned and photographed by 
the assailants, who had cellular phones. On 30 
January 2006 at about 8pm, the assailants 
returned their valuables and dropped the two 
complainants, Sivamadi and Ganeshwari, in a 
van at Batticaloa along the Polonnaruwa Road.

two persons were detained by the assailants 
and it is reported that they have been not 
released to date: Mandakumar Thangarasa (of 
Jaffna, driver); and Kasinadan Qanehalingam. 
As per the directions of the Inspector General 
of Police, the Criminal Investigation Division 
took over the investigation into this matter. 
According to statements of witnesses Sivamadi 
and Ganeshwari, the assailants had spoken in 
Tamil, Hindi and Sinhala. S. Doshini 
corroborated the facts that the assailants 
spoke to them in Hindi, Sinhala and Tamil, had 
returned her jewellery, provided meals and tea, 
and released her unharmed. Inquiries revealed 
that the van in which the victims travelled 
belonged to the TRO Office in Killinochchi. The 
statement of the Administrative Officer of TRO 
in Colombo has also been recorded. The 
police conducted several operations and 
searches in the area but there was no trace of 
the victims or the vehicle. The public in the 
area were questioned but the police were not 
able to find any useful information regarding 
the allegations. The alleged incident of 
abduction took place on the evening of 29 
January but the incident was reported only on 
2 February after a lapse of three days. The 
long delay in reporting the crime resulted in the 
police being unable to act swiftly. The TRO has 
not given sufficient assistance to the </p>

<p>investigation. The delay in reporting leaves a 
reasonable doubt with regard to the 
genuineness of the complaint. Though the 
witnesses had stated that they were on their 
way to Kilinochchi to collect money from 
FORUT for rehabilitation work in schools etc., 
the manager of the organization denied that 
such funds were to be provided for this 
purpose nor was the distribution of money 
fixed for the day in question. This creates 
doubt about the credibility of the three 
witnesses Ganeshwari, Doshini and Sivamadi. 
Facts have been reported to the Magistrate&#8217;s 
Court of Polonnaruwa in Case No: B 224/06 
and the case is fixed for 24 July 2006. Further 
inquiries are continuing to trace the victims and 
to establish the identities of the culprits, though 
this is a difficult task due to the location being 
an &#8220;uncleared area&#8221;, where there is little or no 
hope of receiving intelligence, for the purpose 
of conducting further investigations. On 31 
January 2006 at 7:20pm, Sadhasivam 
Mahalingam, the Administrative Officer of the 
TRO at Batticaloa, appeared at Batticaloa 
Police Station and complained that on 30 
January 2006, an armed gang stopped and 
threatened a vehicle (vehicle number 250-
8993, driven by Selvarajah Fradeepan, which

carrying a team of 14 TRO Officers on their 
way from Batticaloa to Kilinochchi. The

including the driver, released.. This incident 
was brought to the notice of the Inspector 
General of Police on 31 January 2006, who 
immediately directed DIG CID to send a team 
to TRO Office Colombo and to Welikanda to 
make a full scale investigation. He also 
directed DIQQ Batticaloa and North Central 
Range to conduct further inquiries to this 
matter. The nature of the complaint and the 
subsequent behaviour of the complainant 
reveal the following facts. The alleged incident 
according to the complainant occurred on 30 
January 2006 at 4pm. The driver failed to 
inform the closest police station or any other 
law enforcement authority in the proximity of 
the incident. The Administrative Officer of the 
TRO complained on 31 January 2006 at 
7:20pm on the basis of information received 
from the driver at 10am that day. It had taken 
18 hours for the driver to inform the 
Administrative Officer of the TRO, and the AO 
had taken well over nine hours to make this 
complaint to the police. According to the 
Administrative Officer, 14 TRO Officer are said 
to have travelled in this vehicle. If five were 
abducted, the other nine could have gone to 
the authorities to make complaints as they too 
would have been eyewitnesses. On 31

were alleged to have been kidnapped. Out of 
the released TRO Officers, CID has recorded 
the statements of Ms  Kunarathnam

there is little or no hope of receiving 
intelligence, for the purpose of conducting 
further investigations. Some of the highlights of 
the prompt investigations carried out by the 
police: prompt recording of statements by the 
Batticoloa police; presence of a human rights 
lawyer, TRO officer, and an NGO officer during 
the recording of statements; statements 
recorded in the Tamil language by Tamil 
officers; the witnesses brought before the 
Judicial Medical Officer to obtain a report with 
regard to their health   and brought before the 
Courts for their safe release, and no complaint 
made against the police officers involved in the 
investigation; a Court report filed requesting 
the Batticoloa Magistrate to assist the 
investigators to call the other witnesses who 
have not come to the police to come and make 
statements; action taken to reproduce the 
features of the suspects for publication in 
newspapers in order to seek public assistance, 
for the police to identify the perpetrators.  
Police also conducted several searches in the 
area where the alleged abductions took place, 
but no trace of any evidence was ever found; 
the TRO officers were requested to be present 
and they participated in one of the searches; 
the Superintendent of Police, Batticoloa, 
requested the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission,

<p>University Teachers of Human Rights, Jaffna, 
in one of its special reports, has categorically 
stated that the &#8216;TRO abduction drama was 
staged by the LTTE immediately before the 
Geneva talks to force a paramilitary issue in 
the forefront of the talks.&#8217; Some of the 
problems faced by the investigators and the 
reasons for the suspicion that the alleged 
abduction was stage-managed by the LTTE 
include: a long delay in reporting the crime to 
the police; lack of cooperation of witnesses, 
namely witnesses appearing at police stations 
after long delays, or not appearing at all 
despite repeated requests; witness statements  
not providing the investigators with any leads; 
and TRO not assisting sufficiently in the 
investigation. The above demonstrates that the 
Government has taken all efforts to conduct a 
speedy and effective investigation into the 
alleged abductions. It is also clear that the 
alleged victims and the complainants, including 
the TRO, have failed to assist in the 
investigation as a bona fide complainant would 
undoubtedly have done.

</p>
<p>By letter dated 19/06/06, the Government 
reported that the Criminal Investigations 
Department (CID) had commenced 
investigations. According to the statement of 
Samimuttu Benedict, he was transferred from 
Kandy Police Station to the Special 
Investigation Unit in Colombo on 15 June 
</p><p>1998. He was detained for three months there. 
The accused police officers have been 
interviewed, and deny their involvement in the 
torture. Although there is no evidence from 
eyewitnesses, the medical report of the JMO, 
indicated that Samimuttu Benedict had injuries 
on his body. CID has sought instructions of the 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Department to take 
necessary legal action against the accused 
officers. The investigation report has been sent 
to the Attorney General. Although there is 
credible evidence, the Attorney-General came 
to the conclusion that he was subject to police 
assault, but it was not possible to attribute 
criminal responsibility to any particular person. 
As such the Attorney-General has advised the 
police that no criminal charges could be filed 
against any named person.

</p>
<p>By letter dated 19/06/06, the Government 
reported that under the instructions of the 
Attorney-General, the Sri Lanka police has 
conducted disciplinary inquiries against the 
accused police officers. However, two 
disciplinary inquiries in this regard were 
conducted as the officers were attached to two 
different police stations (i.e. Kandy and 
Kantale). At the disciplinary inquiry conducted 
against the accused officers attached to Kandy 
police under the supervision of DIG / Central 
Range (West), no lapses as alleged on the part 
of the accused officers were found to be 
proven. Further, upon the completion of the 
disciplinary inquiry conducted against the 
accused officers attached to the Kantale police 
under the supervision of DIG / Eastern Range, 
the officer concerned has been discharged, as 
even the complainant did not appear for the 
inquiry. The Attorney-General filed two 
indictments, under the Act No. 22 of 1994 
[Convention against Torture and other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment], in the High Court. The 
complainant had however submitted an 
affidavit stating that the earlier complaint made 
by him was a false complaint merely to 
exonerate him from the pending court case. He 
had further stated that he did not wish to 
proceed with the case. Based on this affidavit 
the indictments were withdrawn and the 
accused officers were discharged by the High 
Court. </p>

<p>By letter dated 19/06/06, the Government 
reported that the Special Investigations Unit 
(SIU) commenced investigations into the 
allegations. The Medical Superintendent of 
Ampara Hospital stated that he discovered 
external injuries on the body of the alleged 
victim. These could have been caused by a 
blunt weapon or as a result of a fall when 
running. He was again examined on 13 and 25 
June 2001 and 7 and 16 July 2001. He did not 
have external or internal injuries at that time. It 
has been discovered  that two officers of the 
STF had been involved in the arrest of the 
victim. According to them a group of STF 
officers went to arrest a group of armed 
terrorists on 16 May 2001. The two parties 
exchanged fire and after the fighting, 
Sivalingam Sathiskumar surrendered to the 
STF with a firearm. They denied that he was 
subjected to torture. Officers of Ampara CSU 
who took over Sathiskumar from the STF 
denied any assault. After completing 
investigations, the SIU forwarded an extract of 
the investigation notes to the Attorney-
General&#8217;s Department for advice. The 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Department decided to 
indict three officers under the Torture Act, for 
the alleged assault. The Indictment was sent to 
the High Court of Ampara on 27 January 2004 
and after trial the said accused were acquitted.

25 December 2005, he was sentenced by the 
Zalingy Special Criminal Court to cross 
amputation of his right hand and left foot, and to a 
total of six years&#8217; imprisonment in connection with 
charges of murder and robbery at the Alhisahisa 
Internally Displaced Persons Camp, Zalingy. He 
was detained by the Zalingy police on 3 June 
2005, and on 7 September, the case was 
transferred to the Special Criminal Court. 
Following presentations by both the prosecution 
and defence, Mr  Mohamed was found guilty on 
the same day. The Special Court, established in 
accordance with the State of Emergency Act 1998 
by the Governors of Southern and Northern Darfur 
Provinces, deals with crimes of armed robbery, 
crimes against the State, as well as crimes 
relating to drugs and public nuisance. According 
to the information received, including admissions 
from the Sudanese Minister of Justice, the Special 
Criminal Court does not follow correct judicial 
procedures and internationally recognized 
principles of due process. The penalty for armed 
robbery (Hiraba) under article 168 of the Penal 
Code provides for, among other things, &#8220;&#8230;the 
amputation of the right hand and left foot if his act 
results in grievous hurt or robbery of property 
equivalent to the minimum (Nisab) for capital 
theft&#8230;&#8221;

<p>Case of <b>Muhamandruzi Iskandarov</b>  
E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.1, para. 481 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 24/10/05, the Government 
reported that Muhamadruzi Iskandarov&#8217;s 
complicity in the commission of a number of 
other serious and especially serious offences 
was proved by the preliminary investigation.  
As a result of the investigation, in June 2005 
he was charged with the commission of 
offences under several articles of the Criminal 
Code of the Republic of Tajikistan. In the 
course of the proceedings, evidence collected 
both during the court hearings and in the 
judicial examination was examined fully, with 
the involvement of the defendant, 
M. Iskandarov, his defence counsel and other 
participants in the proceedings.  The evidence 
was also subjected to the appropriate legal 
scrutiny.  Allegations that illegal methods had 
been used during the pretrial investigation 
were examined during the hearing and a legal 
ruling was passed on their substance. In 
particular, during the trial it was established 
that at the pretrial investigation the defendants 
M. Iskandarov, D. Sakovarov and E. Ibrogimov 
had been assigned defence counsel, and the 
investigative actions had been performed with 
their involvement.  During the investigation 
they made statements admitting their 
complicity in acts of terrorism and illegal 
storage of weapons and ammunition. During 
the pretrial investigation the defendants had 
lodged no complaints or objections concerning 
the manner in which the investigation was 
conducted or alleging the use of prohibited </p>

<p>methods of investigation, although they had 
had every opportunity to do so. Witnesses, 
namely the head of the police task force, the 
head of the investigation team, a detective, the 
Procurator of Tajikabad District and a task 
force member, explained at the court hearing 
that from the moment they were taken into 
custody, the defendants had quite 
spontaneously, freely, and without any 
coercion made statements admitting their 
complicity.  During the investigation no 
pressure of any kind of mental or physical 
force had been applied at any time.  In 
accordance with due process, all the 
defendants had been provided with lawyers - 
two defence lawyers in the case of M. 
Iskandarov - and the lawyers had been present 
when they made their statements admitting 
their complicity in the offences. The fact that M. 
Iskandarov and D. Sakorov had made their 
statements without coercion or pressure of any 
kind during the investigation is confirmed by 
video recordings of their testimony during the 
pretrial investigation, in which they testify freely 
in the presence of their lawyers with regard to 
the offences committed, and also give replies 
to the lawyers&#8217; questions in which they admit 
their complicity. The testimony of K. Toirova, 
M. Iskandarov&#8217;s mother, can be cited in 
confirmation of the facts in the statements 
made by M. Iskandarov, D. Sakovarov and E. 
Ibrogimov.  In her testimony, K. Toirova 
confirmed that D. Sakovarov called on M. </p>

<p>Ahmadov in the Rasht District and passed on 
the instructions from M. Iskandarov. D. 
Sakovarov&#8217;s own testimony confirms that, after 
receiving M. Iskandarov&#8217;s instructions, he first 
called on M. Ahmadov in the Rasht District and 
passed on M. Iskandarov&#8217;s instructions about 
the launching of the operation, and then 
repeated them to E.A. Ibrogimov. This 
testimony by D. Sakovarov tallies with the 
testimony given by M. Iskandarov, E. 
Ibrogimov, the witness K. Toirova, and other 
facts of the case. Taken together, all these 
facts disprove allegations that prohibited 
methods were used against these defendants 
during the pretrial investigation, and that they 
were prevented from communicating freely. No 
material evidence was obtained during the 
hearing to support M. Iskandarov&#8217;s allegations 
that unauthorized methods had been used 
during the pretrial investigation.  It may 
therefore be concluded that it was with the aim 
of misleading the investigation and evading 
prosecution that the accused, M. Iskandarov, 
argued at the hearing that he had supposedly 
been subjected to mental pressure, and had 
made the statements admitting his complicity 
under duress.

<p>and heavily bruised ribs. The predominant 
weapons used by security forces were reported to 
be rifle butts. The Emergency Ward of Vaiola 
Hospital reported receiving a number of patients 
with serious injuries. At the Nuku&#8217;alofa Police 
Station prisoners were subject to verbal abuse 
from police officers while waiting to be processed 
inside the Station. Male prisoners were then strip-
searched, sometimes in front of female officers. 
The prisoners were not offered access to lawyers, 
or such requests were ignored. Many families 
were unaware that their relatives were detained 
until they had been released several days later. 
Interrogations were held on the third floor of the 
Nuku&#8217;alofa Police Station and were reported to be 
frequently violent, including some detainees being 
beaten with furniture, slapped and punched in the 
face, forced to sign confessions, and subjected to 
threats of physical and sexual violence, with 
officers holding a large broom stick. Some 
prisoners were handcuffed continuously for up to 
four days. The worst conditions were reported to 
be in prison cells numbered 5 to 7, which 
contained the majority of persons who had been 
physically assaulted. Prisoners reported 
overcrowded conditions, particularly in the days 
immediately following the march. For example, in 
cell 7, up to 64 prisoners were held in a cell with a 
capacity for 16. Prisoners were forced to sleep on 
the floor, or on the wooden or wire slats of the 
bunks, without bedding materials. Toilet visits 
were restricted, and eventually led to filthy 
conditions amidst the stench of urine and faeces. </p>

Me Ayachi Hammami, Me Raouf Ayadi et Me 
Abderrazak Kilani ainsi que d&#8217;autres avocats 
auraient tenu un sit-in devant leurs locaux en 
signe de protestation contre des attaques dont 
l&#8217;ordre des avocats aurait fait l&#8217;objet les jours 
pr&#233;c&#233;dents. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 8 
mai le Minist&#232;re de la justice aurait pr&#233;sent&#233; au 
Parlement un projet de loi, pr&#233;par&#233; de fa&#231;on

formation des avocats, alors qu&#8217;une commission 
mixte associant le Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des Avocats 
et le Minist&#232;re de la Justice aurait au pr&#233;alable 
travaill&#233; sur un projet de loi commun. La cr&#233;ation 
de cet Institut ferait partie d&#8217;un programme de 
modernisation de la justice financ&#233; par l&#8217;Union 
europ&#233;enne qui pr&#233;voirait la participation active 
du Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des Avocats dans la

mai, une d&#233;l&#233;gation du Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des 
Avocats qui se serait dirig&#233;e vers le Parlement en 
vue d&#8217;informer les d&#233;put&#233;s de leurs propositions 
aurait &#233;t&#233; bloqu&#233;e par les forces de police qui, en 
usant de violences verbales et physiques, 
auraient quadrill&#233; le quartier et barr&#233; la voie aux 
membres du Conseil de l'Ordre en les emp&#234;chant 
de rejoindre le Parlement. Le 9 mai au soir, la 
Chambre des d&#233;put&#233;s aurait adopt&#233; le projet de 
loi en question, dans la version &#233;labor&#233;e de fa&#231;on

aux avocats de se rendre &#224; la maison du barreau. </p>

Code.  Mr Yaray and Mr Kayar were to be tried 
at the 5th Penal Court of Diyarbakir on charges 
of willfully assisting illegal organizations.  Mr 
Ozel had been involved in marking the doors of

<p>By letter dated 20/02/06, the Government 
reported that the judgement against him in 
relation to the charges of insubordination was 
reversed on 25 October 2005 by the Military 
Court of Appeals. Considering the claim of the 
defendant that he was gay, the Military Court 
of Appeals decided that a medical examination 
is required in order to determine whether he 
was eligible for military service. However, the 
Military Criminal Court ruled that this would 
amount to discrimination based on sexual 
preference, contrary to European Court of 
Human Rights jurisprudence. Consequently, 
the Military Criminal Court ruled on the 
continuation of his imprisonment. This decision 
can be challenged at the Military Court of

<p>By letter dated 27/03/06, the Government 
reported that the assembly and demonstrations 
which took place on 6 March 2005 in Istanbul, 
did not comply with conditions as prescribed by 
the Law N&#176; 2911. The law enforcement 
authorities repeatedly warned the 
demonstrators of the consequences of staging 
an unlawful assembly. The demonstrators 
abused their right to peacefully assemble as 
they chanted slogans that supported terrorist 
organisations and attacked law enforcement 
officials with metal sticks and stones.  
Seventy persons who resorted to violence 
during the demonstrations were detained in 
order to be brought before the court. It was 
established that 23 of the detainees had 
previously been convicted of offences including 
membership in terrorist organisations and 13 
others had been subjected to legal actions for 
violating Law N&#176; 2911. A disciplinary inquiry 
was initiated by the Ministry of Interior to 
determine whether the law enforcement 
authorities acted within the limits of law during 
their intervention. Four inspectors were 
appointed by the Ministry of Interior to conduct 
this inquiry. As a result, three officials were 
reprimanded for failing to supervise and train 
the personnel under their authority. 
Furthermore, six officials received penalties 
imposing loss of pay for disproportionate use 
of force and degrading acts when dispersing 
the demonstrators. In addition to the

was arrested by plain clothes armed men and 
taken to the National Security Committee (NSC) 
on 30 January 2002 after a meeting at the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Turkmenistan in Ashgabat. 
However, an official warrant for Mr  Kyarizov&#8217;s 
arrest was issued only on 6 February 2002. In the 
meanwhile, he was held incommunicado in the 
NSC&#8217;s investigatory prison. The first time he was 
allowed to see his lawyer was on 13 February 
2002.  During the investigation and trial from 30 
January 2002 to 4 April 2002 he was detained by 
the Turkmenistan National Security Committee. 
During that time, Mr Kyarizov was interrogated 
many times continuously for 24 hours, while his 
interrogators would take shifts. Interrogations 
continued even when he had caught pneumonia 
and suffered two heart attacks. Moreover, the  
Chairman of the Turkmenistan National Security 
Committee (NSC), exerted psychological pressure 
on Mr  Kyarizov. He threatened that he would use 
force on Mr  Kyarizov unless he admitted on 
national TV that he embezzled state property. On 
one day between 30 January 2002 and 2 
February 2002, another NSC officer took away Mr  
Kyarizov&#8217;s outer coat, bedding, and pillow, 
following which he was forced to sleep on a bare 
iron bed in an unheated prison cell until the end of 
his trial on 4 April 2002. The officers said that, if 
Mr  Kyarizov continued to refuse to confess, the 
NSC would take revenge on his family, including 
his baby. On another occasion, around 2 February 
2002, NSC officers brought one man to Mr

<p>Kyarizov&#8217;s prison cell and tortured him in front of 
Mr  Kyarizov by applying electric shocks to his 
genitals through a needle. Mr  Kyarizov asked that 
the torture be stopped and agreed to make the 
requested public confession on television. For the 
next two days, Mr  Kyarizov had to witness 
bleeding of the tortured man&#8217;s ears and throat. On 
2 February 2002, Mr  Kyarizov made the 
requested confession on National TV. On 
approximately 13 February 2002, Mr  Kyarizov&#8217;s 
brother was arrested as well, but no charges were 
brought against him. He had electric shocks 
applied to his head through a metallic helmet to 
give evidence against Mr  Kyarizov. One day 
between 2 February 2002 and 4 April 2002, two 
other officers summoned Mr  Kyarizov&#8217;s wife, 
Yuliya, and her older sister to the Committee for 
interrogation, where they showed the death ward 
to the women and a NSC investigator threatened 
them with execution, unless Yuliya and her sister 
testified against Mr  Kyarizov. Following the trial 
Mr Kyarizov was taken to a prison hospital located 
in Mary on 8 April 2002, where his family could 
visit him at established times. On 11 February 
2003, despite the fact that his health remained 
very poor, Mr  Kyarizov was transferred to LB-
K/12 Prison in Turkmenabad in Seidy region, 
where he remains. His relatives are permitted to 
see him, but their requests for visits are not 
always granted. Throughout the more than three 
years of imprisonment, Mr  Kyarizov has been 
kept in a tiny cell with 50 to 60 other inmates. It is 
very hot and stuffy inside the prison in the </p>

<p>summer (the prison itself is in the desert), and 
very cold in the winter. Hygienic conditions are 
extremely poor. The food provided in the prison is 
poor, which made Mr  Kyarizov lose up to 30 kg. 
There is not enough drinking water and the water 
the prisoners receive contains sand and high 
levels of salt. During his imprisonment, Mr  
Kyarizov has become partially paralyzed as the 
result of an untreated stroke. As an effect of this 
condition, there are times when he is unable to 
move unassisted. There is only one nurse for the 
entire prison, which has a population of 2500 
inmates. Officially, for almost 4 years of his 
incarceration, Mr  Kyarizov was examined only 
once (on 9 April 2002) by doctors of the Turkmen 
Ministry of Health and Medical Industry Hospital 
with Scientific Medical Centre of Physiology.

publicly accused the three defendants of having 
conspired with foreigners in order to destabilise 
the State. Their trial took place in camera. Indeed, 
their lawyers were denied access to Court, as 
they were kicked out by soldiers just before the

consequence, only the Prosecutor and the 
defendants were allowed to attend the hearing, 
which lasted only a few minutes. The Court 
building and the streets leading to it were 
cordoned off by armed soldiers, preventing the 
defendants&#8217; relatives and supporters from 
entering. On 25 August 2006, the Azatlyk District 
Court of Ashgabat condemned Mrs. Muradova 
and Mr  Amanklychev to a six-year and a seven-
year prison term, respectively, while Mr  Khajiev 
was sentenced to a seven-year term in a high-

&#8220;illegally possessing ammunition&#8221; (article 287-2 of 
the Criminal Code), on the basis that police 
officers claimed to have found arms in Mr  
Amanklychev&#8217;s car. The three defendants decided

February 2006, they were deported to Uzbekistan. 
On 7 February 2006, they had been detained by 
the Crimean police following an extradition 
request issued by the Office of the Prosecutor in 
Uzbekistan.  The extradition request alleges that 
the 11 individuals were involved in the events in 
Andijan, which occurred in May 2005.  Nine of the 
individuals were registered with the Migration 
Services as asylum seekers. The other two had 
also expressed their intention to claim asylum 
through a partner of UNCHCR, but had not yet 
received the official documents to complete their 
applications. Concern is expressed that they are 
at risk of torture or ill-treatment in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>be safe third countries. On 1 and 6 February 
2006, these persons applied for refugee status 
with the Department of Migration Service in the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Having duly 
considered their applications, on 13 February 
2006, the department decided to deny their 
applications, as groundless and not meeting 
the provisions of the law of Ukraine on 
refugees. In accordance with Ukrainian and 
international law, the citizens of Uzbekistan 
were granted the right to appeal to the court 
against the decision, which they refused to do, 
as per the personal statements on file. In view 
of the fact that these persons, while staying in 
Ukraine, were involved in unlawful activities, 
violating the standing regulations and refused 
to voluntarily leave the territory of Ukraine, 
these citizens, by decision of 14 February 2006 
of the Kyiv Regional Court of Simferopol, were 
removed from the territory of Ukraine. 
Therefore, the actions of the authorities meet 
Ukrainian law and do not violate international 
legal obligations. It needs to be emphasized 
that the matter was not about extradition of 
Uzbek citizens, but the substantiated denial of 
granting refugee status and expelling them 
from Ukraine, on legal grounds, to another  
State Party to the 1984 Convention against 
Torture. Ukraine has been assured by the 
Government of Uzbekistan of its full 
observance of its obligations under this 
Convention. </p>

were acquitted. The law of the United Arab 
Emirates stipulates that a person can only be 
found guilty of homosexuality if four witnesses 
unanimously agree they saw the act or if the 
accused confesses. It is reported that no 
witnesses testified against the defendants and 
that there was no other indication that they had 
engaged in homosexual conduct. The alleged 
confessions, which were presented as evidence, 
were extracted under invasive forensic

<p>17/01/06 UA TOR; <b>Kulvir Singh Barapind</b>, aged 41, an Indian 
national. He is currently detained at the Fresno 
County Jail, Fresno, California, and is at risk of 
immediate forcible return to India. He has been 
the subject of extradition proceedings since 
September 1997. Mr  Barapind was a senior 
member of the Sikh Students Federation (SSF), a 
group advocating for a separate Sikh state of 
Khalistan, and has previously been tortured by 
Indian police officers. On 12 June 1988, he was 
detained at the Rahimpur Bus Station by Nakodar 
City police and taken to the police station. When 
one of the inspectors learned of Mr  Barapind&#8217;s 
involvement in the SSF, he ordered him to be 
taken to a cell by three officers. There he was 
stripped, his hands were bound behind his back, 
he was suspended from the ceiling by a rope tied 
to his hands, and was punched in the stomach. 
He was then taken down, and was forced to sit 
with his legs outstretched. While one officer held 
him from behind, another held his legs, and a third

<p>rolled a heavy wooden pole (&#8220;roller&#8221;) over his legs 
10 to 15 times. The police officers then attempted 
to stretch his legs 180 degrees apart about four to 
five times. This session was repeated again on 
the next morning before he was transferred to 
Goraya Police Station. The same treatment was 
meted out to him there over a period of five days. 
He was questioned in order to extract information 
on the identities of other SSF members. On 17 
June 1988, he was brought before a magistrate, 
charged with terrorist-related offences, and 
remanded in custody in the Central Jail, Jalandar. 
He was released on bail on 30 November 1988, 
and the charges were subsequently withdrawn. 
Subject to regular harassment by the police, he 
was again arrested on 21 July 1989, this time at 
his home by the Punjab police and the Central 
Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and taken to a 
CRPF camp in Phagwara. Accused by the agents 
of involvement in terrorist-related activity, he was 
taken to a cell, stripped, bound by his hands 
behind his back and suspended from the ceiling. 
When he refused to answer questions about the 
identities of senior SSF leaders, he was taken 
down, and subjected to the roller. Afterwards, with 
wires attached to his toe and little finger, an officer 
cranked a generator, causing him to be 
electrocuted. Shocks were also applied to his ear 
lobes, penis and testicles. Mr  Barapind was 
subjected to the roller again that afternoon. In 
addition, his arms and legs were bound behind his 
back, and with one officer sitting on his buttocks, 
another struck the soles of his feet with a wooden </p>

<p>stick 30 to 40 times. His feet reportedly swelled to 
the point, causing his toe nails to fall off. On the 
evening of 21 July, he was transferred to the 
Criminal Investigation Agency (CIA), Kapurthala. 
The following morning, under the authority of 
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Mr  
Barapind was tortured in a similar manner as on 
previous occasions, in addition to being flogged 
on his buttocks with leather straps. He was 
threatened with death if he did not respond to their 
questions, and spent the night chained to the floor 
of the cell. On 31 July, he was released. In 
September 1989, security forces raided Mr  
Barapind&#8217;s house, beat him with wooden sticks 
and attempted to arrest him before a crowd of 
villagers intervened to prevent him from being 
taken away. Following a raid on his house in April 
1990 during his absence, Mr  Barapind went into 
hiding until March 1993, at which time he fled to 
the United States.  
Subsequently his family members, including his 
father, brother and brother-in-law have been 
severely tortured, and his friends have been 
arbitrarily detained, in order to determine his 
whereabouts. Six of his accomplices, who were 
identified in First Information Reports filed by the 
Indian Government in its extradition request for Mr  
Barapind, were subject to extra-judicial 
executions; and at least two other proponents of a 
Sikh state and suspected terrorists, Mr  Daya 
Singh Sandhu and Ms  Kamaljit Sandhu, were 
tortured following their extradition from the United 
States to India despite the provision of diplomatic </p>

<p>321.   10/07/06 AL  TOR; At least <b>135 African American men</b> in Chicago, 
Illinois. During the period from 1972 to 1991, at 
least 135 African-American detainees were 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment while they 
were detained at the Area 2 and Area 3 Police 
Headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. The detainees 
were subjected to techniques including electrically 
shocking men&#8217;s genitals, ears and lips with a 
cattle prod and an electric shock box, suffocating 
individuals with plastic bags, mock executions and 
beatings with telephone books and rubber hoses.  
These acts were carried out with the aim of 
extracting confessions. The names of the alleged 
perpetrators are known to the Special Rapporteur. 
In 1990, Michael Goldston, an investigator with 
the Chicago Police Department&#8217;s Office of 
Professional Standards concluded that systematic 
abuse occurred in Area 2 and Area 3 over a ten 
year period. He concluded that the type of abuse 
was not limited to beating, but also included 
psychological techniques and planned torture. 
Despite these findings and specific admissions, in

<p>some cases, by the City of Chicago that crimes 
had been committed by its police officers, nobody 
was prosecuted for the alleged crimes. In 2002, a 
Special Prosecutor was appointed to further 
investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
at the Area 2 and Area 3 Police Headquarters. 
However, the Special Prosecutor indicated in May 
2006 that no prosecutions would likely be brought 
due to the application of the statute of limitations 
to the alleged crimes.  Furthermore, the only 
officer to be subjected to internal disciplinary 
procedures in relation to the acts described above 
was the Commander, who was fired in 1993 due 
to evidence of the abuse of one detainee, Andrew 
Wilson.  Andrew Wilson was suffocated with a 
plastic bag, shocked on his genitals, ears and lips 
with an electric shock box, burned with cigarettes, 
beaten and handcuffed across a hot radiator while 
being interrogated.  In that case, Dr. John Raba, 
the Medical Director of Cermak Health Services at 
Cook County Jail examined Wilson after his 
interrogation and, taking note of the injuries, he 
requested the Chicago Police Superintendent to 
carry out an investigation. However, no action was 
taken. There are further concerns that a number 
of those individuals may have been convicted 
partly or solely on the basis of confessions 
obtained by torture or ill-treatment.  In particular, 
at least 24 individuals are currently serving prison 
terms on the basis of confessions which may have 
been obtained by torture or ill-treatment.  The

at Pike County Prison, Milford, Pennsylvania. He 
has been detained for two years and is currently 
at risk of imminent forcible return to Uzbekistan 
following an unsuccessful bid to seek asylum in 
the United States. He entered the US in 1999 and 
learned in January 2000 that he was sought by 
the Uzbek authorities on suspicion of involvement 
in activities in support of &#8220;illegal religious extremist 
movements&#8221;. An FBI investigation found on his 
shared computer downloaded video files of 
speeches by known terrorists, such as Osama Bin 
Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Shamil Basayev, 
which depicted bombings and other acts of 
violence. In June 2003 he was convicted of falsely 
representing himself as a US national. US 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking 
diplomatic assurances from the Government of 
Uzbekistan that Mr  Yusupov will not be tortured 
upon his return. 
</p>
<p>By letter of 23/01/07, the Government reported 
that it has not sought and does not intend to

Uzbekistan that Mr  Yusupov would not be 
tortured upon his return, as was conveyed to 
Mr. Yusupov and the Federal District Court 
hearing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
on 6 October 2006. Whereas the United States 
does not agree with the non-binding opinion of 
the Human Rights Committee that Article 7 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights creates a non-refoulement 
obligation on States Parties, or share the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view that diplomatic 
assurances are never reliable or effective in 
protecting against torture, it does not believe 
that diplomatic assurances are appropriate in 
every case or that they could serve as a 
substitute for a case by case analysis of 
whether US obligations under Article 3 of the 
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman orDegrading Treatment or

<p>the Taliban who continue to support them. 
However, President Bush has affirmed on a 
number of occasions that al Qaeda and 
Taliban detainees are treated humanely, and, 
to the extent consistent with military necessity, 
in a manner consistent with the principles of 
the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. As a 
result, representatives of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) routinely 
visit detainees individually and privately. United 
States Government personnel are not 
permitted to torture detainees or participate in 
torture by others. Torture is a violation of the 
laws of the United States. Allegations of torture 
will be thoroughly investigated. Where 
appropriate, in cases where the United States 
Government transfers detainees to other 
countries for detention or questioning on  
behalf of the United States, assurances that 
the detainees will not be tortured or subjected 
to persecution are being sought. The United 
States recognizes the special needs of 
younger detainees and the difficult 
circumstances surrounding their situation and 
treats young enemy combatants in a manner 
appropriate to their status and age.

<p>consider the issue.  The United States 
disagrees that security internees who are 
detained in the context of armed conflict are 
entitled to take proceedings before a court, in 
order that the court may decide on the 
lawfulness of their detentions, pursuant to 
Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR). In contrast, 
consistent with the Geneva Conventions, a 
detaining power can use an administrative 
board to review and decide challenges to their 
detention by protected persons. Additionally, 
by its terms, the ICCPR has no application 
outside the territory of a State and thus does 
not apply to security internments conducted by 
MNF-1. The Government of the United States 
notes that the MNF-1 released Mr  Al-
Mashadani in January 2006.

that Article 7 of the International Covenant on

refoulement obligation that would apply with 
respect to cruel, inhuman or degrading

transfer a person to a country if it determines 
that it is more likely than not that the person 
will be tortured. Mr  al-Lathi was recently

resulted from an injury sustained before United 
States involvement with him. According to Mr 
al-Lathi&#8217;s statements to the United States, his 
injury was sustained in an automobile accident, 
and the damage has progressed over time. 
There are no indications that his condition was 
adversely affected by his detention. His injury 
could have been corrected through available 
surgical intervention. United States authorities 
repeatedly tried to persuade Mr al-Lathi to 
consent to this treatment. This is one of those 
unfortunate situations where the United States 
wanted to provide assistance, but the detainee 
would not permit them to do so. While Mr al-

of mistreatment during the period that he was 
detained by the United States, the US

the night of 14 to 15 February 2006, they were 
deported from Ukraine to Uzbekistan.  On 7 
February 2006, they had been detained by the 
Crimean police following an extradition request 
issued by the Office of the Prosecutor in 
Uzbekistan.  The extradition request reportedly 
alleges that the 11 individuals were involved in the 
events in Andijan, which occurred in May 2005.  
According to the information received, nine of the 
individuals were registered with the migration 
services in Ukraine as asylum-seekers.  The other 
two had also expressed their intention to claim 
asylum through a partner of UNHCR, but had not

</p>
<p>By letter dated 28/02/06, the Government 
reported that, pursuant to the norms of 
international law, sovereign States, such as 
Ukraine, independently define the procedures 
for taking decisions on the extradition, 
deportation and return of individuals. The 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
provides that the competence to decide 
whether to accept an application from a 
petitioner under provisions of the Convention 
lies with the State party to the Convention on 
whose territory the individual is applying for 
refugee status. The provisions of the 
Convention specifically do not apply to persons 
with respect to whom there are serious 
reasons for considering that they have 
committed a grave crime outside the country of 
refuge prior to their admission to that country 
as refugees. Article 33, paragraph 2, of the 
1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees states that the prohibition of 
refoulement &#8220;may not be claimed by a refugee

Gulistan in the Syrdaryn region on 29 April 2006 
and held in the office of the Gulistan City Police 
Department. They were transferred to 
Investigation Isolator UY 64/SI-13 of the City of 
Havast, near Yangier. During their detention a 
senior investigator of the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor of Dzhizak region and an inspector of 
the Syr-Darya Department of Internal Affairs beat 
them on their legs and heels with truncheons, put 
gas masks with closed air valves on their heads 
and threw them in the air to let them fall on their

2006, he was deported from the Russian 
Federation to Uzbekistan, following an extradition 
request from the General Procuracy of 
Uzbekistan, which was issued in February 2006.  
Rustam Muminov has been accused of 
membership of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 05/12/06, the Government 
reported that Rustam Muminov emigrated to 
Tajikistan in the mid-1990s, where he received 
a religious extremist education. After his return 
to Uzbekistan, he maintained close relations 
with members of the religious-extremist 
organization Khizb-ut Takhrir and studied 
extremist literature, which contained calls to 
build a world-wide khalifat.  In 1999 Rustam 
Muminov, who was a mushrif of the religious-
extremist organization Khisb-ut-Takhrir, 
organised a unit of this organization in 
Dzahrkurgansk District of Surkhandarinsk

associates conducted propaganda work, 
recruited new members and called for civil 
disobedience. Moreover, Mr  Muminov took 
part in the distribution of anti-constitutional 
leaflets calling for the overthrow of the State of 
Uzbekistan. R. Muminov, in 2003, after the 
detention and convictions of his associates, left 
the Republic and went into hiding in the 
Russian Federation. In 2005 Uzbek law 
enforcement organs opened a criminal case 
against Mr  Muminov with reference to art. 159,

overthrow the constitutional system after a trial 
which was conducted with numerous violations of 
the Criminal Procedural Code of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan and international human rights 
instruments. In particular, the public prosecutor 
did not attend the first phases of the trial. The 
chairman judge in charge of the case performed 
the dual function of public prosecutor. During the 
trial the accusations were not corroberated with 
any fact or evidence as required by the Criminal 
Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the court 
did not allow defence witnesses to appear, nor did 
it allow human rights defenders, journalists and 
many of the accused relatives to observe the 
proceedings. At the first court session, Mr  
Komiljon Usmanov rejected the accusations, 
stating that his confessions had been obtained as 
a result of torture and ill-treatment.  Four 
witnesses stated that they had witnessed Mr 
Usmanov being subjected to torture in the GUVD 
facilities, including being hung from the ceiling 
from his feet and with his ears attached to electric 
wires. However, the judge refused to order any 
investigation into these allegations of torture.

<p>Ms  <b>Fatima Hussein al-Badi </b>who could face 
imminent execution if the President of Yemen 
rejects a final appeal asking for her death 
sentence to be commuted on the basis that her 
trial was unfair. Fatima Hussein al-Badi and her 
brother Abdullah Hussein al-Badi were arrested 
on 13 July 2000 for the murder of her husband, 
Hamoud Ali al-Jalal. They were sentenced to 
death on 17 February 2001 following a trial that 
fell short of international fair trial standards. 
Fatima Hussein al-Badi has maintained her 
innocence in the murder of her husband since her 
arrest: she was tortured by police in detention, but 
refused to &quot;confess&quot;. Her brother denied that he 
and his sister were involved in the murder, but 
later &quot;confessed&quot; to police after he was assured 
that his &quot;confession&quot; would lead to Fatima's 
release. During the trial, they had no legal 
representation, and were forced to be quiet 
whenever they tried to speak in court. Both Fatima 
and her brother took their case to the Court of 
Appeal, which upheld the sentence against them 
on 12 August 2002. They then appealed to the 
Supreme Court, which upheld the decision. 
President 'Ali 'Abdullah Saleh then ratified the two 
death sentences. On 2 May 2005, Abdullah 
Hussein al-Badi was executed for his alleged role 
in the murder. In October, Fatima Hussein al-Badi 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 17/06/06, the Government 
reported that Fatima Hussein al-Badi and her 
brother Abdullah Hussein al-Badi, murdered 
her husband Hamud Ali Jalal.  Evidence of 
guilt was provided at trial and by the defendant 
herself, who confessed to the murder.   
The trial was conducted in accordance with the 
law.The initial verdict was delivered on 17 
December 2001 and the defendant lodged an 
appeal.  After reviewing the procedures 
followed by the court of first instance and 
finding nothing amiss, the appeal court issued 
a ruling, on 12 August 2002, upholding the 
initial verdict. The case was referred to the 
Supreme Court, which in turn approved the 
appeal court ruling sentencing Ms Hussein al-
Badi to death on 5 August 2004.  Fatima 
Hussein al-Badi was not subjected to any form 
of mental or physical torture.  A lawyer was 
appointed to present her defence from the very 
first stage of the proceedings until the 
Supreme Court delivered its ruling. The 
Yemeni judiciary takes every care to comply 
with, and abide by, the norms of international 
law.  Yemeni law guarantees defendants the 
full right to a defence during every stage of 
judicial proceedings.   </p>
