-----------------
IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL CASE NO: HAC0034 OF 2004S

STATE

v.

SAKIUSA BASA

Counsel: Ms K. Bavou for State
Accused in Person

Hearing: 1st February 2005
Ruling: 1st February 2005

RULING

The Accused now faces two charges of robbery with violence, allegedly committed whilst on bail. Further he failed to appear in court on the 28th of January despite a court order and advice from his surety. Indeed his surety reminded him twice. Although he says that he was stopped by the police from attending court, I have a duty to also consider the fact that he is facing further charges and a pending investigation for robbery.

It is not in the public interest to release him on bail. He is remanded until bail review on 18th of February 2005 at 9.30am in open court.
