<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur made an official visit to Honduras from 30 August to 7 
September 2012. During the visit, she met with stakeholders in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro 
Sula and La Ceiba. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of 
Honduras for helping to arrange the meetings with the pertinent State agencies and for the 
cooperation shown before, during and after the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In Tegucigalpa, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of the Republic, the 
Minister of Justice and Human Rights, the Deputy Minister of Education, the Minister of 
Security and representatives of his ministry (one from the Special Investigations Unit and 
the Director-General of the National Police), the Minister of Tourism, the Minister for 
Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Peoples, the Minister of the Interior and Population Affairs, 
and representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Directorate-General 
for Migration and Foreign Nationals, the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family 
(IHNFA), the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children 
of the Public Prosecution Service, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Inter-Agency 
Commission to Combat the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents 
(CICESCT), the National Human Rights Commission (CONADEH), the Ministry of 
Tourism, the Honduran Tourist Board (CANATURH), the National Telecommunications 
Commission (CONATEL) and the Monitoring Centre for Violence in Honduras. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with the President of the National Congress and the Chair of 
the Congressional Committee on Children, as well as with other members of Congress. In 
San Pedro Sula and in La Ceiba the Special Rapporteur met with the mayor, the governor, 
the municipal judge, the special prosecutor for children and representatives of the police 
force.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited five centres and homes for children in need and child 
victims of sexual exploitation.1 She had the opportunity during these visits to speak with the 
children at the centres and discuss matters with them. In La Ceiba, she visited the Integrated 
Centre for Justice. The Special Rapporteur also met with several members of civil society 
and the international community (the so-called &#8220;G16&#8221;) during the course of her visit.2 In 
addition, she met with the United Nations country team. The Special Rapporteur wishes to 
thank in particular the staff of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) for their 
invaluable support and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights for the assistance it provided.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 In Tegucigalpa, these were the centre for street children run by the Casa Alianza charity and the 
</p>
<p>Querubines home for girl victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, and the programmes and 
facilities run by the Compartir association in the Los Pinos community and in Villanueva. In San 
Pedro Sula, the Special Rapporteur visited two centres run by IHNFA, one for abandoned children 
and one for adolescent girls.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.13-10225 
</p>
<p><b> B. Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Honduras is organized into 18 departments and 298 municipalities. According to the 
National Institute of Statistics, the country&#8217;s population in 2012 is 8.2 million, and 44.5 per 
cent of the population is under the age of 18.3 The country is frequently hit by earthquakes, 
floods and hurricanes, and this acute environmental vulnerability hampers its development. 
</p>
<p>5. Honduras is currently still undergoing a period of stabilization after the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat 
of 28 June 2009. From the start of its term, the current Government has taken positive steps 
in the field of human rights. It has, for example, established the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights and the Ministry for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Peoples, and in 2010 it 
set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to clarify the events surrounding the coup.  
</p>
<p>6. As a result of the coup and the fall in foreign investment, among other factors, the 
economic situation in the country has worsened considerably. According to the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in 2011, 61.9 per cent of the population was 
living in poverty and 41.6 per cent in extreme poverty. Honduras has one of the largest 
inequality gaps in economic terms in the continent. In human development terms, it ranks 
121st out of 187 countries.4 Studies performed by the National Institute of Statistics and 
UNICEF show that there were 3.4 million children under the age of 18 in Honduras in 
2009.5 The poverty indicators show that 2.5 million children were living below the poverty 
line.  
</p>
<p>7. The high incidence of crime, including violent murders, is particularly worrying. 
According to the 2011 global study of homicide carried out by the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime, Honduras has the highest rate of violent deaths in the world, with 6,239 
homicides being recorded in 2010. According to the Monitoring Centre for Violence, at the 
Autonomous National University of Honduras, 6,723 violent deaths were recorded in 2011, 
which raised the country&#8217;s annual homicide rate to 88.1 per 100,000 inhabitants.    
</p>
<p><b> II. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>8. Given the clandestine and often transnational nature of the sale and sexual 
exploitation of children and the lack of centralized, disaggregated data, it is difficult to 
measure the true scale of these phenomena. Although the figures provided during the visit 
were variable, all the stakeholders that the Special Rapporteur met with acknowledged that 
trafficking in children for the purposes of sexual exploitation, child labour, child 
prostitution and child pornography was on the rise. The stakeholders also all acknowledged 
that the extent of the sexual exploitation of girls in prostitution was particularly worrying.  
</p>
<p>9. The Inter-Agency Commission to Combat the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents has found that the commercial sexual exploitation of children 
takes three basic forms: the use of boys and girls in paid sexual relations; the use of boys

<p>and girls in pornography and public or private sex shows, both as part of child-trafficking 
operations and by local and national exploiters; and sex tourism.  
</p>
<p>10. Of the three, trafficking has received the most attention in recent years owing to the 
ties between commercial sexual exploitation in Honduras and the trafficking networks 
operating at the Latin American level, in which Honduras plays a major part on account of 
its geographical location. Honduras has been identified as both a transit country and a 
country of origin for victims of commercial sexual exploitation who are taken north. 
According to civil society organizations, since 2000, Honduran child victims of sexual 
exploitation have been found in several countries &#8211; mainly in Guatemala, but also in 
Mexico, El Salvador and the United States. 
</p>
<p>11. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights reported that 61 complaints had been 
filed with its Human Trafficking Unit between 2009 and April 2012. They all involved 
children aged between 6 and 18 years (52 girls and 6 boys).6 Of the 61 complaints, 24 were 
investigated and 35 were prosecuted, but only one case resulted in a conviction. Of the 
1,327 complaints received by the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children between 
January and November 2011 in Tegucigalpa, several were linked to trafficking and sexual 
exploitation (6 to child pornography, 10 to procuring children for prostitution, 4 to paid sex 
with minors and 14 to child trafficking). The Special Rapporteur regrets that she was not 
given more precise data and that the statistics provided were not more clearly broken down 
by type of exploitation.  
</p>
<p>12. Casa Alianza, one of the organizations most deeply involved in the fight against 
sexual exploitation in Honduras, has estimated that there could be as many as 10,000 
victims in the country. According to the COIPRODEN children&#8217;s rights network, which 
comprises 29 civil society organizations, the majority of victims of sexual exploitation are 
female. Most of the research conducted in the field by civil society shows that victims are 
on average between 14 and 15 years old. Cases of child victims of sexual exploitation as 
young as 12 have been detected, however, and, exceptionally, cases of victims aged 10 
have been reported in San Pedro Sula.7 
</p>
<p>13. The large discrepancies in the figures reported by the different stakeholders 
highlight the lack of reliable data available for gauging the scale of the problem. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that the information that is available is incomplete and that the 
definitions and classification schemes used by the institutions in their information 
management systems seem to vary from one to the other. The discrepancies in the current 
data arise because there is no centralized, standardized information system for analysing 
trends that can be used by all relevant institutions. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to 
learn that a national system of information on trafficking in persons is to be developed by 
the Inter-Agency Commission to Combat the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children 
and Adolescents. She insists, however, that disaggregated data must be collected on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>14. The real extent of the sale and sexual exploitation of children is difficult to 
determine for other reasons as well: few accusations and complaints are filed for fear of 
stigmatization or reprisal; citizens have little confidence in public institutions; there is a 
certain degree of tolerance of these phenomena in society; people are ignorant of the law 
and the rights of the child; local and regional organized crime networks are involved; and it

</p>
<p>is difficult to access the complaints mechanisms that guarantee swift action to protect 
children and ensure they will be safe and not re-victimized. The lack of data is also due to 
the inadequate monitoring of high-risk localities, such as brothels, places where children 
work, border blind spots, Internet caf&#233;s, etc. Sex tourism involving children and online 
pornography are also, in general, not adequately controlled.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes and risk factors  
</b></p>
<p>15. The sale and sexual exploitation of children are multifaceted phenomena driven by 
many different, interrelated factors. Demand and other factors increase children&#8217;s 
vulnerability to being sold and sexually exploited. These factors include poverty, 
unemployment, inequality, social exclusion, a lack of opportunities, at-risk and 
dysfunctional families, sexual abuse in the home, gender-based discrimination, street living, 
insecurity (gangs), child labour, migration, addictions (alcohol and drugs), social tolerance,8 
violence against women and the transnational dimension of the sale and sexual exploitation 
of children. Other drivers include easy access to information and communications 
technologies, the expansion of the market for sex tourism involving children, impunity and 
the failure to consistently seek out and apprehend those who sell and sexually exploit 
children.  
</p>
<p>16.  According to UNICEF, 18 per cent of the Honduran population lack access to basic 
health care, 10 per cent do not have access to drinking water, and one third are not 
connected to a sewage system. Those living in rural areas have, on average, barely 4.3 years 
of schooling, while those in urban areas have, on average, only 7.  
</p>
<p>17.  The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern about the failures of the 
Honduran education system: the quality of education is highly unsatisfactory. Of those over 
15 years of age, 15.2 per cent are illiterate.9 Only 32 per cent of the population manages to 
complete primary school.10 Of the 200 days of classes that Honduran children should, by 
law, receive each year, only 120 days were actually delivered because of the frequent 
teachers&#8217; strikes. The situation is compounded by the precarious condition of the facilities 
in many schools.11 The lack of access to education has a serious negative impact, not only 
on the economic situation, but also on the safety of many children who spend their days in 
the streets where there is a greater risk of sexual violence and recruitment by gangs.  
</p>
<p>18.  The violence that is present everywhere in Honduras is the result of multiple factors, 
including a permissive law that allows citizens to possess up to five firearms12 and the rise 
in transnational organized crime, mainly drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and arms-
smuggling.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 A large portion of society considers the morals of the victim or of the victim&#8217;s family to be 
</p>
<p>responsible for the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, a view that fails to take into account the 
social complexity of the problem. The exploiter in the equation has also somehow been rendered 
&#8220;invisible&#8221;.

<p>19.  According to UNICEF, over 4,700 girls, boys and young persons belong to a gang in 
Honduras.13 Some authorities and civil society organizations report that there are over 
20,000 children living or working in the streets. The household survey conducted in 
September 2010 by the National Institute of Statistics shows that over 412,122 children 
aged between 5 and 17 work in farming, mining, construction, domestic service and other 
types of manual labour.  
</p>
<p>20.  Many Honduran children leave the country in search of a better life. Most who do so 
travel alone or are sent by human traffickers and thus run numerous risks, including the risk 
of being sold and exploited sexually or economically. According to the Directorate-General 
for Migration, between 2003 and 2006, almost 8,000 minors were deported overland to 
Honduras through the border at Aguas Calientes.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>21.  Honduras is a party to most of the main international human rights instruments, 
including: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocol on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography and its Optional Protocol on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women; the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the 
Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO); and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, that supplements that Convention. The Convention on Protection of 
Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption is in the process of being 
ratified. Honduras has also undertaken to promote the ratification of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure and the ILO 
Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189).  
</p><p>22.  Honduras is not a party to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>23.  At the regional level, Honduras is a party to the American Convention on Human 
Rights, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of 
Violence against Women, the Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in 
Minors, and the Ibero-American Convention on Young People&#8217;s Rights.

</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal and regulatory framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework for child protection  
</b></p>
<p>24.  Honduras has a number of laws and statutes that aim to protect the rights of the 
child. Title III of chapter IV of the 1982 Constitution of Honduras, which is entitled &#8220;Rights 
of the Child&#8221;, contains several articles outlining the State&#8217;s obligation to protect children 
and guarantee their welfare and their access to education, an appropriate system of justice 
and protection against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation (arts. 119&#8211;124).  
</p><p>25.  The 1996 Code on Children and Adolescents establishes the fundamental principles 
for guaranteeing the welfare of children. The Code sets forth the rights and fundamental 
freedoms of children; establishes and regulates the State prevention and protection system 
instituted to ensure the integral development of the child; establishes the agencies and 
procedures required to ensure the protection children need; facilitates and guarantees 
children&#8217;s access to justice; and sets out the guiding principles for national policies on 
children. 
</p>
<p>26.  The 1997 Act on the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family establishes the 
Institute and defines its objectives, which are to: formulate and implement State policies on 
children, adolescents and families; promote respect for the rights of the child in society at 
large; coordinate the participation of State and private-sector institutions in the planning 
and implementation of measures to ensure the comprehensive protection of children and 
families; establish a system of alternative measures and services to avoid the 
institutionalization of children and adolescents for social reasons; and promote and support 
the involvement of citizens and communities in the construction of a system of 
opportunities for children and families. The passing of the bill on the Office of the 
Children&#8217;s Advocate (<i>Defensor&#237;a Nacional de la Ni&#241;ez</i>) would result in the closing of the 
Honduran Institute for Children and the Family and the establishment of the Office as the 
new State agency responsible for overseeing public policy and harnessing the efforts of 
public bodies and civil society organizations in national plans and programmes for children. 
The bill has been drawn up in response to the constant internal crises affecting the Institute. 
These have prevented it from fulfilling its role as the lead agency for child and family 
welfare policies and programmes. The problem stems in part from its limited coverage: the 
Institute has offices in only 36 of the country&#8217;s 298 municipalities, and its services benefit 
only a small proportion of the target population (5,366 of the 3.7 million children in the 
country). 
27.  The Framework Act on the Comprehensive Development of Young People (2006) 
establishes the legal, political and institutional framework for promoting the full 
development of young persons and for developing youth policies.  
</p>
<p>28.  Several other legal instruments related to child protection could be mentioned, such 
as the Domestic Violence Act (1997), the Act on Migration and Foreign Nationals (2003), 
the National Register of Persons Act (2004), the bill to overhaul national legislation on the 
rights of children, adolescents and families (September 2012) and the draft bill on 
Honduran migrants and their families.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution  
</b></p>
<p>29.  Article 148 of the Criminal Code states: &#8220;Anyone who encourages, induces, helps, 
recruits or forces others to engage in activities associated with commercial sexual 
exploitation shall be guilty of the offence of procurement and shall be punished with 6 to 10 
years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 100 to 200 times the minimum wage. The 
aforementioned penalties shall be increased by half in the following cases: when the victims 
are minors under the age of 18 &#8230;&#8221; </p>

<p>30.  The 2005 reform of Title II of the Second Book, a special part of the Criminal Code 
that defines commercial sexual exploitation offences, updated the provisions on sexual 
abuse to establish the underage status of the victim as an aggravating circumstance for 
sexual abuse offences. A chapter specifically on commercial sexual exploitation and 
trafficking was also introduced. Article 149-A establishes: &#8220;Anyone who induces or allows 
persons under the age of 18 to be exposed to the activities carried out in places that promote 
commercial sexual exploitation shall be punished with 3 to 6 years&#8217; imprisonment and a 
fine of 50 to 100 times the minimum wage.&#8221; Article 149-B states: &#8220;Anyone who uses 
persons under the age of 18 in public or private shows or spectacles of a sexual nature shall 
be punished with 4 to 8 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 100 times the minimum wage.&#8221; 
Article 149-C provides that: &#8220;Sexual intercourse or acts of lechery committed with minors 
aged over 14 and under 18 years in exchange for payments in cash or kind made to the 
minor or a third person shall be punished with 6 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>31.  Article 149-D of the Criminal Code of Honduras states: &#8220;Anyone who by any 
means, whether directly, mechanically or through digital, electronic or any other media, 
finances, produces, copies, distributes, imports, exports, offers, sells or disseminates 
material using a person or the image of a person under the age of 18 in pornographic or 
erotic acts or activities shall be guilty of the offence of pornography and shall be punished 
with 10 to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 200 to 300 times the minimum wage. 
Possession of pornographic materials containing images of children or adolescents shall be 
punished with 4 to 6 years&#8217; imprisonment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32.  Article 95 of the Code on Children and Adolescents states: &#8220;The public display of 
magazines or any other kind of publication that violate the rights of the child is prohibited. 
Any violation of this provision shall be punished as stipulated in the Criminal Code.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>33.  CONATEL regulates the television industry and the Internet but does not have the 
mandate to control and regulate their content. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of a joint initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Information and 
Communication and the International Telecommunication Union to regulate the media.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Trafficking in children 
</b></p>
<p>34.  To complement the 2005 reform of the Criminal Code that established the offences 
of commercial sexual exploitation, in 2012 the National Congress discussed and passed the 
Trafficking in Persons Act. The purpose of the Act is to lay the basis for the formulation of 
public policies to prevent trafficking in persons; establish the legal framework required for 
increasing the penalties for trafficking in persons; establish a specific, complementary 
framework for protecting and assisting victims of human trafficking; facilitate the 
restitution and promotion of victims&#8217; rights; and structure, boost and facilitate national and 
international cooperation in the fight against trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>35.  The Organic Act on the National Police establishes mechanisms for international 
cooperation with the police forces of other States and with international law enforcement 
bodies, and &#8220;particularly with the other Central American countries in order to combat 
crime, especially that associated with the trafficking of women and children, the smuggling 
of people and arms, and offences of an international nature&#8221; (art. 39, para. 28).  </p>

<p><b> 5. Sex tourism 
</b></p>
<p>36.  Article 149-E of the Criminal Code states: &#8220;Anyone who, in order to attract tourists, 
promotes or conducts advertising programmes or publicity campaigns of any kind, via any 
medium, to project the country nationally or internationally as a tourist destination that 
offers access to sexual activities with persons of either sex shall be punished with 8 to 12 
years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 150 to 250 times the minimum wage. The penalties shall 
be increased by half &#8230; when the victims are persons under the age of 18 &#8230;&#8221; Article 5 of 
the Criminal Code establishes the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Honduran courts.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Adoption of children 
</b></p>
<p>37.  The regulatory framework for adoptions is based on the Constitution, the Code on 
Children and Adolescents, the Family Code, the Act on the Honduran Institute for Children 
and the Family and the Honduran regulations on adoption. A bill on international child 
abduction and another on adoption have been drafted; both were to have been submitted for 
discussion by Congress in 2012. The 2005 reform of the Criminal Code also reflected an 
effort to combat illegal adoptions.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Juvenile justice 
</b>38.  The primary objective of a juvenile justice system must be to rehabilitate and 
reintegrate young offenders in the light of their special needs and vulnerability. The Special 
Rapporteur was concerned by the level of non-compliance with international norms on 
juvenile justice.14 She concurs with the findings of a study on juvenile criminal justice in 
Honduras that highlights the major shortcomings in the practical application of the laws and 
statutes established to regulate and monitor the juvenile criminal justice system.15 The Code 
on Children and Adolescents, for example, is a sound tool in theoretical terms, but it is not 
effectively applied in practice to safeguard the rights it establishes.  
</p>
<p>39.  The Special Rapporteur also noticed the lack of investment in efforts to address the 
needs of young persons, the failure to understand that repression is neither the only nor the 
best way to handle young people, the failure to implement the programmes included in the 
laws on the subject and the absence of an effective restorative justice mechanism. 
</p><p>40.  Honduras has a number of laws and statutes that aim to protect the rights of the 
child. Despite efforts to harmonize national legislation, however, there are still gaps in 
certain areas. The definition of pornography, for example, has yet to be brought into line 
with that used in the pertinent Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Furthermore, the sale of children (for organ trafficking, child labour, sexual 
exploitation, illegal adoption, etc.) is not classified as an offence in the Criminal Code, 
which results in a lack of clarity on the issue. The current provisions are not broad or clear 
enough to address the problem properly and to punish those who commit such crimes 
against children.

</b></p>
<p>41.  Neither the Code on Children and Adolescents nor the other domestic laws are fully 
concordant with the principles and provisions of the Convention. There are also legal 
loopholes and inconsistencies that legitimize exceptions to the minimum working age, and 
this could be encouraging practices that increase the exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p>42.  Also, the draft bill on the establishment of the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate is 
still pending approval by Congress. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the news that the bill 
proposing a complete reform of the legislation on families and children was recently 
adopted on first reading by Congress.  
</p>
<p>43.  Honduras still faces numerous problems in the area of law enforcement, such as 
impunity, lengthy and ineffective investigation procedures, a lack of skills and training for 
those working in the justice system, and insufficient resources.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>44. Numerous institutions in Honduras are involved in the protection of children. 
</p>
<p>45. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, established in 2010, is responsible for 
coordinating, developing, promoting, harmonizing, implementing and assessing human 
rights policy. It has the task of drawing up human rights policy and a national human rights 
action plan which, with regard to the rights of the child, coordinates the work of institutions 
dealing with education, health and child labour. It is also responsible for reviewing existing 
policies to ensure they comply with the international human rights commitments 
undertaken by Honduras. 
</p>
<p>46. The Honduran Institute for Children and the Family was established as an 
independent social development agency, with the primary goal of providing comprehensive 
protection for children and promoting full family integration within the framework of the 
Constitution, the Code on Children and Adolescents and the Family Code. During the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, it was decided to reorganize the Institute in response to an audit 
that showed up serious shortcomings in management and the quality of care provided to 
children. The Special Rapporteur visited two facilities run by the Institute, where she 
witnessed the appalling conditions in which children were kept. The Institute had 
considerable difficulty in fulfilling its mandate, which had led to repeated internal crises. In 
the latest of these, in 2011, it was discovered that more than 90 per cent of its budget was 
being used to pay wages and salaries. The Institute thus found itself in the midst of a 
profound budgetary, administrative and operational crisis requiring urgent across-the-board 
reforms to ensure that children were properly cared for. Under a new draft bill, the 
organization and running of programmes and comprehensive childcare centres would be 
devolved to municipalities and responsibilities would be assigned to the corresponding 
agencies.16 The Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate would be a decentralized body attached 
to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights with a mandate to encourage the creation of 
local comprehensive care programmes for children, especially for those whose rights have 
been violated. The Office would operate through a network of regional branches, enabling 
it to establish a presence in every municipality.

 The National Institute for Vocational Training for vocational workshops; the Directorate-General of

Social Reintegration Programme for educational centres for teenage offenders. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.13-10225 
</p>
<p>47. The Public Prosecution Service, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor for 
Children, is responsible for drawing up and implementing State policy on the criminal 
prosecution of offences involving children. It works with the police, the Honduran Institute 
for Children and the Family and other institutions to eradicate commercial sexual 
exploitation, punish those responsible for it, and rescue and protect victims.  
</p>
<p>48. In 2004, the Office of the Special Prosecutor set up a unit to process complaints 
related to commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking. The unit employs various 
approaches to tackle serious cases, including surveillance and the infiltration of criminal 
groups by police officers.  
</p>
<p>49. Operations designed to shut down businesses and rescue children often prove futile 
because they are carried out too late, when circumstances have changed. The Office of the 
Special Prosecutor needs more logistical support and investigators if it is to combat the 
sexual exploitation of children effectively. 
</p>
<p>50. A new system of juvenile courts was established under the Code on Children and 
Adolescents. In theory, the courts should be key players in dealing with the commercial 
sexual exploitation of children. However, the Special Rapporteur noted that some of them 
were poorly informed about the subject. She also noted that resources were clearly lacking 
and that staff needed training.  
</p>
<p>51. The Inter-Agency Commission to Combat the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents (CICESCT) was established in 2002 to tackle this problem in 
Honduras. It is responsible for directing, planning and monitoring, and providing technical 
and financial support for, the implementation of legal and administrative measures to 
combat commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking. In the wake of the recent adoption 
of the Trafficking in Persons Act, it was decided that CICESCT would be a decentralized 
branch of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>52. The Human Trafficking Unit of the National Police (under the Ministry of Security) 
carries out investigations and reports to the Directorate-General of Special Investigation 
Services and to the Special Crimes Unit, which in turn reports to the Directorate-General of 
Criminal Investigation. Four agencies of the National Police are working to build capacity 
in the areas of prevention, investigation and training.17 The obstacles to timely intervention 
include a slowness to act and a scarcity of resources, as well as a lack of awareness of the 
issues and relevant training. 
</p>
<p>53. The Directorate-General for Migration and Foreign Nationals (part of the Ministry 
of the Interior and Population Affairs) is responsible for the effective management of 
migration. It regulates the flow into and out of the country of Honduran and foreign 
nationals and the stay of foreign nationals in Honduras, and monitors the hotspots for 
commercial sexual exploitation. Officials follow the procedures outlined in a manual on 
how to prevent trafficking in children and adolescents for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>54. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been involved in projects designed 
to tackle child labour, including the drafting of national policy on child labour and a 
roadmap for the prevention and eradication of the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2

<p>GE.13-10225 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Ministry of Social Development implements social protection policy by 
providing comprehensive services as a priority to the social groups identified as vulnerable, 
marginalized or at risk, including child and adolescent victims of violence, trafficking, and 
sexual and economic exploitation.  
</p>
<p>56. The Ministry of Education has put together manuals on sexual orientation for use by 
the Special Programmes Unit in its courses for teachers. The Education and Careers 
Guidance Unit is tasked with developing and proposing strategies, standards and 
procedures that will allow children and adolescents to reach their full potential at school. It 
has also, with international support, developed a five-year action plan designed to improve 
the accessibility and quality of schools. 
</p>
<p>57. The Honduran Tourist Board (made up of 20 regional boards) has, in conjunction 
with the Ministry of Tourism and the Tourism Institute, drawn up a programme to prevent 
sex tourism involving children and adolescents by raising awareness and providing 
information, training and a code of conduct. 
</p>
<p>58. The National Institute for Women has a violence prevention unit, which runs 
seminars on human trafficking and related issues. 
</p>
<p>59. The Children&#8217;s Rights Observatory was launched in 2008 by the Honduran Institute 
for Children and the Family, with the technical and financial support of UNICEF, in order 
to get an overall picture of the extent to which the rights of Honduran children are upheld 
and to produce up-to-date information. 
</p>
<p>60. Municipal councils have local children&#8217;s advocates who work to prevent commercial 
sexual exploitation and trafficking and provide assistance to victims.  
</p>
<p>61. The University Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security, through its Monitoring 
Centre for Violence, monitors and reports on acts of violence, including violence against 
women and children. 
</p>
<p>62. Special teams in the Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights &#8212; the 
national human rights institution in Honduras &#8212; process and follow up on complaints of 
violations of individual rights, including children&#8217;s rights, anywhere in the country. The 
Office&#8217;s special programme on the human rights of children and adolescents, however, fails 
to meet the criteria for a specialized mechanism for the protection of the rights of the child 
as set forth in general comment No. 2 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
especially with regard to consulting children and in terms of geographical and physical 
accessibility for all children, especially the most vulnerable among them.18 
</p>
<p>63. Many NGOs make a significant contribution to the protection of children. They run 
many of the centres that provide assistance and care for children in difficulty. Not all of 
these organizations are registered, however, and some of them are unmonitored and 
substandard. 
</p>
<p>64. Although there are many child protection institutions in Honduras, they have neither 
the funding nor the trained personnel needed in order to be effective.  
</p>
<p><b>  Inter-agency coordination 
</b></p>
<p>65. The work of CICESCT can be considered an example of good practice in terms of 
coordination between government agencies and civil society organizations. Thanks to this 
coordination, progress has been made in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children 
in the areas of prevention, prosecution and victim support.

<p>66. The Integrated Centre for Justice in La Ceiba is also a model of coordination, 
bringing together under one roof police officers, court officials, psychologists, physicians 
and social workers to help children and families. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur observed, however, that there is a need for closer 
coordination between all the agencies working to protect children. No umbrella body exists 
to coordinate and monitor work at the national and local levels. The recurring problem of a 
lack of resources also has an adverse effect on the effectiveness of all these institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Policies and programmes to combat the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policies, plans and strategies  
</b></p>
<p>68. The Action Plan to Combat the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and 
Adolescents (2006&#8211;2011) was drawn up by CICESCT. Its main goals are to improve legal 
protection and provide comprehensive care for children and adolescents in the area of 
commercial sexual exploitation, with a focus on the restoration of their rights; forestall risks 
at the local and national levels; to work towards the elimination of commercial sexual 
exploitation in Honduras; to encourage children and adolescents to become actively 
involved in the activities set out in the plan; and to help implement regional initiatives to 
prevent and eliminate commercial sexual exploitation. The adoption of the action plan 
constituted a major step forward for Honduras. However, its future is uncertain because of 
the failure to provide adequate funding for its implementation. 
</p>
<p>69. The Second Action Plan on the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labour (2008&#8211;
2015), under which the competent authorities receive guidance on action to prevent and 
eliminate child labour, is another indication of the progress being made in efforts to tackle 
the sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>70. The Opportunities Plan for Children and Adolescents (2005&#8211;2015) combines the key 
sectoral strategies aimed at promoting all-round personal development and social protection 
for children and adolescents in Honduras, as enshrined in the goals and targets of the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2004&#8211;2008.19  
</p>
<p>71. A youth policy was put in place in 2010 to coordinate the efforts of the Government 
and civil society aimed at improving the living conditions of young people by guaranteeing 
the full exercise of their civic rights, developing their skills and fostering a sense of 
solidarity so as to build a participatory, inclusive democracy. 
</p>
<p>72. A pilot project for the social reintegration of victims of commercial sexual 
exploitation and human trafficking was launched in June 2011 in the south of the country 
under an agreement between CICESCT, the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM), the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Choluteca and the 
National Institute for Women. 
</p>
<p>73. The Government has drawn up a series of policies and plans that deal with the 
protection of children, including: the National Policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health 
(1999); the Policy on Food and Nutrition Security (2005&#8211;2011); the National Policy on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19
 The primary goals of the plan are: the provision of equal access to quality health-care services; the 
</p>
<p>reduction of levels of HIV/AIDS infection; the provision of broader access to higher quality 
preschool, primary and secondary education; the prevention of and protection from violence and the 
worst forms of child labour; the protection and development of children with disabilities; and the 
promotion of participatory rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10225 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Social Protection (2007&#8211;2015); the National Plan for Human Development, Children and 
Youth (1991&#8211;2000); the National Plan to Discourage Gang Membership and Rehabilitate 
and Reintegrate Gang Members (2002); the National Plan for Children and Adolescents 
(2004&#8211;2010); the Opportunities Plan for Children and Adolescents (2005&#8211;2015); and the 
Vision for the Country and Plan for the Nation initiative (2009). 
</p><p>74. Despite the profusion of policies and plans, the Special Rapporteur noted a lack of 
the kind of multi-year budget planning that would ensure their effective implementation. 
The absence of mechanisms for monitoring and measuring their impact also hampers the 
implementation of proposed policies, which tend to be sector-specific and fragmented. 
There is no integrated policy on the protection of children.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rehabilitation programmes and support services 
</b></p>
<p>75. Providing assistance and effective protection to victims of the sale, trafficking, or 
sexual abuse or exploitation of children is a complex process requiring an interdisciplinary 
and holistic approach, from the moment the child is identified, to care (which may take the 
form of placement in a centre or home), medical, legal and psychological support, and 
rehabilitation, with proper monitoring throughout the process.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Identification and complaint mechanisms  
</i>76. The police and the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children, in coordination 
with the Directorate of Forensic Medicine, deal with complaints in cases where the victim 
or another minor may have been subjected to sexual violence (incest, rape, sexual 
exploitation for commercial purposes, trafficking and related offences). 
77. The Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights accepts complaints, in 
any form and for up to one year after the incident, from anyone who might have been 
affected by human rights violations. If the complaint is admissible, an informal summary 
investigation is launched. Various sources told the Special Rapporteur that the Office of the 
National Commissioner does not fully discharge its duties as a complaints mechanism. 
</p>
<p>78. In 2010, a national complaints hotline (111) known as &#8220;Breaking the Silence&#8221; was 
established under the auspices of the Office of the First Lady in conjunction with 
HONDUTEL (the national telecommunications company), the Honduran Institute for 
Children and the Family and the Special Prosecutor for Children to deal with complaints of 
abuse or violations of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>79. In 2008, a 24-hour hotline staffed seven days a week by specially trained personnel 
of the Directorate-General of Special Investigation Services was established to assist 
victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>80. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited the Integrated Centre for Justice 
established by the Public Prosecution Service, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office and the 
Ministry of Security to remove obstacles to access to justice for victims of violence and 
sexual exploitation by bringing together under one roof all the relevant institutions. The 
Special Rapporteur advocates the development of similar centres throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>81. The Government, supported by UNICEF, the NGO &#8220;Plan&#8221; and other partners, has 
taken various measures to prevent the re-victimization of victims and to assist with their 
psychological recovery. For example, it has distributed a manual on commercial sexual 
exploitation and trafficking to the police, the Public Prosecution Service and other bodies 
that come into contact with victims of these crimes, and encouraged the use of Gesell 
domes (rooms with one-way mirrors). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.13-10225 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur noted the absence at the local or municipal level of suitable 
complaints and reporting mechanisms that would allow children to report violations in 
private and in confidence. She also noted that there was considerable distrust of the police 
and the justice system, a reluctance to report offences and a lack of security and protection 
for victims and witnesses. Civil society organizations report that the level of re-
victimization of children within the judicial protection system is alarming and that little is 
done to investigate offences in rural areas. In most cases, the sexual exploitation of children 
goes unpunished and nothing is done to protect children in rural areas. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Assistance/rehabilitation  
</i>83. In Honduras, there are few State-run institutions to protect or care for children in 
difficulty. The Honduran Institute for Children and the Family runs eight therapeutic 
centres around the country. Four of them provide temporary shelter to guarantee the 
protection of children&#8217;s rights, while the remaining four have an educational function. Two 
State-run psychiatric centres cater for child victims. 
</p>
<p>84. According to the Institute&#8217;s latest records (2010), there are 199 NGO-run homes for 
the protection and care of children, of which 72 deal with child victims of sexual 
exploitation. However, only one of these centres, Hogar Querubines, is specifically set up 
to deal with victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking. In recent years, Casa Alianza&#8217;s 
Hogar Querubines project, which the Special Rapporteur visited, has set the standard for the 
provision of direct assistance to child victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking.  
</p>
<p>85. The key to effective assistance and support is that programmes should be 
comprehensive and integrated. Medical, psychological and legal assistance and assistance 
with housing, education and training will fail if not coordinated. In order to work in the best 
interests of victims, effective coordination and collaboration are needed in the planning and 
provision of services, thereby helping the children build a life for themselves. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur noted that when children are rescued, few real options 
(except Hogar Querubines) are available to help with their rehabilitation, given that, in her 
view, the centres run by the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family do not meet 
minimum standards. The psychological and social rehabilitation of child victims of sexual 
exploitation is mostly undertaken by civil society organizations without State support. No 
standards have been set for centres and shelters, which are not supervised or monitored. 
Follow-up is also inadequate.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Prevention and training  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>87. The regulatory framework provides for measures to combat commercial sexual 
exploitation and trafficking. Article 94 of the Code on Children and Adolescents, for 
example, sets out measures for raising awareness and disseminating information in order to 
prevent threats to children or violations of their rights.  
</p>
<p>88. The partnership between CICESCT and UNICEF is of prime importance in terms of 
prevention. They have launched a communication strategy to mobilize public opinion 
against the ill-treatment, abuse, sexual exploitation and trafficking of children and 
adolescents. The strategy involves a television programme entitled <i>Rompiendo el Silencio</i> 
(&#8220;Breaking the Silence&#8221;), which aims to raise awareness while stressing the idea of 
comprehensive protection for children. Government officials, representatives of NGOs and 
other experts are invited to appear on the programme.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10225 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>89. Information about international and national standards relating to the commercial 
sexual exploitation of adults, children and adolescents has been disseminated with the 
support of the ILO International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), 
Save the Children, IOM and ECPAT International.  
</p>
<p>90. The Government has also worked with UNICEF and civil society organizations to 
foster a culture of non-violence. 
</p>
<p>91. There are significant gaps in the area of children&#8217;s safety on the Internet. Further 
efforts are needed to promote sex education and social norms that take greater account of 
the rights of the child and counter gender discrimination. Measures to eradicate poverty, 
support families and communities living in straitened circumstances, help vulnerable 
children (street children and children who work) and combat drug and alcohol addiction 
need to be strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Training 
</b></p>
<p>92. CICESCT has developed various training activities for judicial officials, school 
teachers and administrative staff, members of the Armed Forces, police officers, 
immigration officials and others to make them aware of the measures to prevent and 
combat sexual exploitation and to rehabilitate victims. 
</p>
<p>93. Commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking are now covered in the curriculum of 
the Police Training Centre, thereby ensuring that police trainees acquire specialized 
knowledge on the prevention of such offences and the protection of victims. 
</p>
<p>94. The Honduran Tourist Board has already provided training for 90 police officers and 
has requested that a further 150 be trained. 
</p>
<p>95. In conjunction with ILO, work has been done in the area of capacity-building to 
strengthen labour inspectorates and the justice system in order to combat the worst forms of 
child labour. 
</p>
<p>96. The issue of the sexual exploitation of children was covered in seven national 
courses on tourism, which included a purpose-designed diploma for the course teachers. 
Similar training is provided in tourism enterprise centres in Islas de la Bah&#237;a, La Ceiba, 
Cop&#225;n Ruinas and Choluteca. 
</p>
<p>97. However, some justice officials complained of the scarcity of training opportunities 
for officials outside the capital and added that little training of any sort had been 
forthcoming in the past two years. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur noted that the prevention and training initiatives are 
fragmented and unsustainable, and that they are not part of an integrated system for the 
protection of children. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Participation of children 
</b></p>
<p>99. The young journalist networks of Honduras are part of a communication project 
supported by UNICEF. Through the media (print, radio, television and other media such as 
popular theatre), children and young people themselves disseminate information on their 
rights and the problems affecting children in their communities. The networks have a high 
profile in Honduras thanks to the television programme <i>TVC Infantil</i>, which they produce 
with the support of UNICEF and which is shown on Televicentro, one of the country&#8217;s 
main channels. The programme&#8217;s choice of subjects promotes a constructive approach to 
life and a healthy lifestyle, with a focus on preventing HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancies 
and creating awareness of civil rights. </p>

</p>
<p>100. The Children&#8217;s Congress, which is held on 10 September (Children&#8217;s Day in 
Honduras), brings together boys and girls elected by school councils around the country. 
Interviews with them and the proceedings of their meetings and main agreements are 
broadcast. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Corporate social responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>101. A code of conduct on preventing and combating the sexual exploitation of children 
and adolescents in the context of travel and tourism has been adopted by 458 companies 
around the country, including more than 300 hotels and other places of accommodation.20 
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur noted that Internet-providers and other telecommunications 
companies were notable by their absence in efforts to combat child pornography on the 
Internet. She urged CONATEL to take the necessary steps in this regard and underlined the 
need for guidelines and self-regulation in order to protect children from online sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> H. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Honduran Ministry of Foreign Affairs promotes multilateral, regional and 
bilateral agreements to combat the sale and trafficking of children. 
</p>
<p>104. Honduras is one of seven Central American countries represented on the Central 
American Commission of Directors of Migration Departments, which receives assistance 
from UNICEF. 
</p>
<p>105. Honduras and Colombia have signed a memorandum of understanding to provide 
assistance and protection to victims of trafficking, and to investigate, prosecute and punish 
traffickers.  
</p>
<p>106. In 2010, Honduras signed a memorandum of understanding with Mexico to ensure 
that the repatriation of unaccompanied children and adolescents is carried out in a dignified, 
orderly, efficient and safe fashion. 
</p>
<p>107. Numerous projects have been developed within the framework of bilateral 
cooperation (G16 countries)21 and/or in conjunction with United Nations agencies, in 
particular UNICEF. However, the Special Rapporteur noted that there are significant 
problems in terms of the sustainability of projects and coordination between the various 
parties.

 The code, which was finalized in September 2005, draws on the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism, 
</p>
<p>an international initiative of the World Tourism Organization and ECPAT International that focuses 
on children&#8217;s rights and on responsible and sustainable tourism. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 The main goal of the G16 under its initial mandate was to help the Government of Honduras to 
</p>
<p>implement the Plan for National Reconstruction and Transformation through the adoption of the 
Declaration of Stockholm in 1999. </p>

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Government of Honduras has made significant efforts to improve the 
situation of children in the country, but they remain insufficient. Although Honduras 
has numerous policies and plans in place to protect children and to prevent and 
combat the sexual exploitation and trafficking of children, sufficient funding has not 
been made available for their implementation. The lack of an overall strategic child 
protection framework makes it difficult to implement policy effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The establishment of the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate will be a great step 
forward, but it must be allocated adequate resources if it is to be effective. These 
efforts must go hand in hand with a strengthening of State institutions, municipal 
authorities and civil society. Above all, much more needs to be done to improve 
prevention through sizeable investment in the education system, which has some 
significant weaknesses, and in measures to combat poverty and violence.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and collaboration, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following recommendations to the Government of Honduras with a view to 
strengthening measures designed to guarantee effective protection for all children in 
Honduras without distinction. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>With regard to legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Carry out a comprehensive reform of all civil and criminal legislation 
and regulations related to the protection of children with a view to bringing them into 
line with international standards for the protection of children&#8217;s rights: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Update the definition of pornography to reflect the wording of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Eliminate the inconsistencies and gaps in legislation that legitimize 
exceptions to the minimum age for child labour;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Expedite the process for passing new laws such as those on the Office of 
the Children&#8217;s Advocate and comprehensive reform of legislation on 
families and children; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Introduce legislation to control the content of websites;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Require the private sector (telephone companies and Internet service 
providers) by law to report violations in their networks and to block 
access to sites; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement regulations to protect the rights of children in conflict with 
the law and strengthen restorative justice for such children; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that current legislation is enforced; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Allocate adequate resources to the administration of justice; 
 (c) Improve and expedite investigation procedures; </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that the justice system is adapted to the needs of children 
through the more widespread use of Gesell domes and integrated centres for justice; 
 (e) Ensure that information on laws protecting children is widely 
disseminated in a suitable format for children and persons working with children;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Step up efforts to combat corruption and impunity. 
</b>112. <b>With regard to the institutional framework, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government should:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Clearly define the responsibilities and tasks of all those involved in the 
protection of children on the basis of their sphere of competence, and establish 
mechanisms to ensure accountability in every area of their work; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen the relevant institutions so as to ensure a consistent approach 
to the punishment of perpetrators and protection of victims: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate as quickly as possible; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Extend the coverage of the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children to 
avoid leaving thousands of children with no effective expert follow-up to their 
cases; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen the Special Crimes Unit of the criminal investigation directorate to 
improve the quality of its investigations and give it a greater presence, with 
more staff, particularly in rural areas;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Set up special units staffed by trained and experienced officers in police 
stations;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish effective mechanisms to coordinate between the various entities; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen the Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights to make 
it more accessible to children and to improve monitoring of children&#8217;s rights. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government should conduct a 
general survey of current policies with a view to identifying the main gaps in child 
protection in Honduras and establishing a comprehensive system of child protection 
based on the rights of the child (see figure below), and that it should: 
 (a) Drop the current sector-by-sector, piecemeal approach to policy and 
action in order to facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive strategy for the 
protection of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide adequate funding and the necessary human, material and 
technical resources for the full implementation of child protection policies at the 
national and local levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish a centralized and standardized system for the collection of data 
disaggregated by sex, age, type of offence and legal action taken;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Develop monitoring mechanisms to measure the impact of the 
implementation of policies. </b></p>

<p><b> (b) Strengthen the justice system to ensure that child victims and witnesses 
receive appropriate and timely protection adapted to their age, maturity, vulnerability 
and special needs, thereby avoiding greater difficulties and trauma;

 (f) Devote greater efforts and more funding to programmes that propose 
alternative measures for children in conflict with the law, in order to avoid the abuse

</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Strengthen measures to raise awareness of the importance of promoting 
a culture of children&#8217;s rights in order to counter society&#8217;s tolerance of the sexual 
exploitation of children and gender discrimination; encourage people to report

by providing them with greater opportunities to discuss issues and exchange 
information and to be consulted and participate in the development of policies, 
measures and prevention strategies related to the promotion and protection of their 
rights.

<p>117. <b>With regard to corporate responsibility, the Government should foster closer 
cooperation with the private sector, especially Internet service providers,
