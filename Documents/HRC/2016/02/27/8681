<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 16th meeting, the delegation of Belarus, headed by the Ambassador 
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Permanent Representative of Belarus to the United 
Nations Office and other International Organizations at Geneva, Mikhail Khvostov, began 
its presentation of the national report. It expressed its view that the universal periodic 
review process had successfully fulfilled its purpose of ensuring the objective review of the 
human rights situation in all countries. According to the delegation, consultations had been 
held with a maximum number of interested actors, including civil society, during the 
preparation of the national report. The delegation stressed that it had no intention of 
ignoring the challenges and shortcomings in the protection and promotion of human rights, 
while noting that the pace and conditions of the development and capabilities of 
Governments differed.   
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that Belarus had managed to accomplish a series of 
achievements under difficult conditions, including, inter alia, the accident at the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station in 1986, and that those achievements were a basis for confidence that 
human rights in Belarus were in the process of sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation referred to the United Nations Human Development Report 2009, 
according to which Belarus ranked 68th in the human development index and was included </p>


<p>in the group of countries with high human development. As noted by the delegation, 
Belarus had implemented the Millennium Development Goals related to poverty 
eradication, equality between men and women, and access to primary education prior to the 
deadline.   
</p>
<p>8. According to the delegation, the literacy rate of the Belarusian population was 
among the highest in the world, standing at 99.7 per cent for adults and 99.8 per cent for 
minors.   
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that the country&#8217;s unemployment rate was the lowest in 
Eastern Europe. Belarus had the second highest gross domestic product per capita in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States and one of the lowest poverty rates in the world. 
Approximately 85.4 per cent of State support was allocated to the needs of the social sector, 
which was the highest level in the region. The delegation referred to the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development, which ranked Belarus 44th in terms of expenditure 
on health and education, quality of education and adult literacy, life expectancy, good 
governance, level of corruption, sanitation and clean water supply. It noted that Belarus was 
among the world leaders in overcoming economic inequalities. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation highlighted the fact that Belarus was party to nearly all core human 
rights instruments of the United Nations. The Constitution recognized the universally 
recognized principles of international law and ensured that the country&#8217;s legislation was 
consistent with them. According to the delegation, universally recognized human rights 
standards were reflected in the relevant national legislation, including, inter alia, laws on 
political parties, voluntary organizations and trade unions, national minorities, and religious 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>11. As noted by the delegation, the President, as the guarantor of the Constitution and of 
human rights and freedoms, adopted measures to defend and implement citizens&#8217; rights by 
issuing laws and deciding on specific issues, coordinating action on human rights with the 
three branches of Government. It also noted that the National Assembly (Parliament) 
adopted laws, established legal mechanisms, ensured the observance and protection of 
citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms, and had a Standing Commission for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that a network of specialized State-public institutions, 
including, inter alia, the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, the National 
Council on Gender Policy and the Inter-Ethnic Advisory Council, operated in the country to 
promote and protect various categories of human rights.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation noted that the Act on Citizens&#8217; Appeals obliged Government bodies 
and officials to adopt the measures necessary to restore citizens&#8217; rights that had been 
violated and to oversee their implementation. In 2009, a total of 40,000 appeals had been 
submitted by citizens on issues involving human rights and policies. 
</p>
<p>14. According to the delegation, there were currently 2,200 non-governmental 
organizations and 15 political parties. Belarus had an effective and independent judiciary; it 
noted that this was an important factor for human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation referred to the data of both the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, according to which Belarusian women enjoyed a high level 
of civil liberties, and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, according to which Belarus ranked 19th 
in the world in terms of the level of representation of women in Parliament. It stated that 36 
women&#8217;s organizations operated in the country. According to the delegation, women held 
19.3 per cent of senior positions in State bodies and 46.4 per cent of judgeships.    
</p>
<p>16. As noted by the delegation, Belarus devoted special attention to ensuring 
opportunities for children&#8217;s self-expression, and there were 23 children&#8217;s organizations and 
141 youth associations receiving financial support from the State. The number of adoptions </p>


<p>by foreigners had decreased, and 72.7 per cent of orphans were under alternative forms of 
guardianship. 
</p>
<p>17. At the United Nations, the President had launched the initiative to intensify 
international efforts to combat human trafficking, as a result of which a global plan of 
action was expected to be adopted at the United Nations. Owing to effective measures, the 
number of crimes involving human trafficking had decreased. Belarus had established an 
International Training Centre on Migration and Combating Human Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>18. According to the delegation, people from more than 130 ethnic groups lived in 
Belarus, and conflicts on ethnic, racial, cultural, linguistic or religious grounds had 
traditionally been non-existent. There were 123 voluntary organizations representing ethnic 
and cultural communities that received financial support from the Government. Persons 
belonging to a number of ethnic groups studied their mother tongue in educational 
institutions.  Newspapers were published, and radio and television programmes were 
broadcast, in Polish, Ukrainian and Lithuanian.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation mentioned the increase in the number of religious communities from 
765 to 3,262 and the increase in the number of religious denominations from 8 to 25. 
Registered religious organizations were exempt from taxes and received State assistance for 
the restoration of religious buildings.   
</p>
<p>20. The delegation highlighted the active cooperation of Belarus with international 
organizations.  Belarus had taken measures for the implementation of recommendations 
made by the special procedures mandate holders on freedom of expression and opinion; an 
independent judiciary and lawyers; the trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children; and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which had visited Belarus. 
Furthermore, Belarus had sent invitations to eight special procedures mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council to visit the country. Belarus had also actively cooperated with 
treaty-based bodies and had submitted its periodic reports to five of those bodies in 2009. 
At the initiative of Belarus, representatives of OHCHR had visited the country in 2009 to 
discuss possible assistance or support for Belarus in protecting and promoting human 
rights. The delegation noted that the implementation of a joint project to strengthen human 
rights capacities had been planned. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 53 delegations made statements. An additional 31 
statements, which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time 
constraints, will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available.1

</p>
<p>22. A number of delegations thanked Belarus for its cooperation with the universal

</p>
<p>32. Egypt welcomed the dissemination of human rights education and the establishment 
of a national action plan. It lauded the efforts of Belarus to ensure the right to work and its 
ability to achieve a number of development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration. It 
requested elaboration on the country&#8217;s efforts, achievements and challenges in combating 
human trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Singapore commended Belarus for steps taken to further advance women&#8217;s and 
children&#8217;s rights through respective plans of action. It congratulated Belarus on its low 
unemployment rate and stated that the country had done well in the areas of housing, health 
and education. Singapore made a recommendation. </p>


<p>34. Malaysia was encouraged to note the ongoing engagement with the international 
human rights system in terms of capacity-building and technical assistance, as well as the 
partnership between the Government and civil society in establishing a specialized network 
of public institutions. It made recommendations.  
</p>

freedom of expression, opinion, assembly and association. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to the death penalty, the delegation explained that the issue of its 
abolition was very sensitive. When a universal referendum had been held on the issue in 
1996, more than 80 per cent of the population had voted in favour of retaining this form of </p>


<p>punishment. The Constitution and the Penal Code set out the temporary and exclusive 
nature of the application of the death penalty, as provided for in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. The delegation noted that the death penalty was applied 
extremely rarely and that the law regulated the procedure for amnesty for those sentenced 
to death.  
</p>
<p>54. The delegation noted that Belarus understood and respected the position of countries 
asking for the abolition of the death sentence, and that it was indeed considering ways and 
means to achieve its abolition. A parliamentary working group had been established for that 
purpose. Efforts had also been made to influence public opinion through the mass media 
and awareness-raising campaigns. However, a decision to abolish the death penalty or 
adopt a moratorium could not be taken without bearing in mind the outcome of the 
referendum. A decision should be made in full awareness and should be 
irrevocable.  Belarus would continue its cooperation with the international community on 
this matter. In that regard, Belarus recalled that it had not voted against the General 
Assembly resolutions promoting a moratorium. 
</p>
<p>55. With regard to the right to engage in peaceful demonstration, Belarus provided the 
assurance that it was guaranteed by law as long as demonstrations did not violate public 
order or the rights of other citizens.  Public security and order had to be maintained in the 
conduct of demonstrations. The procedures established by law were designed to ensure the 
realization of the freedoms of citizens as well as public security. The delegation noted that 
this was entirely consistent with its international obligations, including those under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>56. Concerning the question of torture, Belarus noted that it was party to the Convention 
against Torture.  In order to ensure criminal responsibility for acts of torture, the definition 
set out in article 1 of the Convention was fully applied. The Penal Code described all such 
acts as serious crimes punishable by 3 to 10 years of imprisonment, in addition to a 
provision prohibiting perpetrators from holding public posts. Persons subjected to torture 
could submit complaints to the prosecutor&#8217;s office or the judiciary, which had to respond to 
such complaints without delay, and the law also provided for means of public oversight.   
</p>
<p>57. According to the delegation, Belarus also devoted special attention to the issue of 
human detention conditions. No person could be detained other than on the basis of law, all 
detentions had to respect human dignity, and all cruel or degrading treatment was 
prohibited. The Government had allocated considerable resources to the improvement of 
correctional institutions.    
</p>
<p>58. The delegation noted that its legislation on freedom of association was based on the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Political parties and public 
organizations could freely pursue their activities in accordance with their statutes and 
programmes. The elimination of political parties or public organizations for political 
reasons was prohibited by law.  The laws on political parties and on public organizations 
set out the requirements and procedures for their establishment, and the requirements were 
of a uniform nature and did not depend on the nature of the activities pursued by the 
organization concerned. There was also an easily accessible appeals mechanism.  
</p>
<p>59. The delegation stated that, while some of the requirements for the establishment of 
associations might appear rigid, they were justified in practice.  Belarus was one of the few 
countries in which the activities of non-governmental organizations did not include 
extremism, xenophobia or religious or racial hatred.  The delegation noted that there was a 
favourable environment for the activities of such organizations. More than 2,200 public 
associations and 15 political parties were registered. According to the delegation, the 
number of associations was constantly rising.   </p>


<p>60. The delegation noted that a similar situation prevailed with regard to trade union 
activity. Belarus had been a member of the International Labour Organization since 1954 
and had ratified 49 of its conventions.  
</p>
<p>61. Belarus stated that the monopolization of the media by the State or by private 
individuals or entities was prohibited. According to the delegation, the State did not 
regulate Internet media. Equal economic conditions existed for the development of all 
media, irrespective of their ownership. The 2009 Law on Mass Media had established the 
legal mechanisms for independent professional media activity and simplified the procedure 
for establishing media.    
</p>
<p>62. The delegation noted that its legislation enshrined and ensured the conduct of 
elections in accordance with the international treaties to which it was a party. Thus, Belarus 
followed the generally recognized standards for the preparation and conduct of elections, 
although there were, unfortunately, no universal criteria by which to evaluate the 
democratic nature of elections. According to the delegation, the law on elections was being 
constantly improved, and the Electoral Code had recently been amended to extend the 
rights of participants in election campaigns as well as those of observers.  Belarus followed 
the principle that elections should be observed, and elections in Belarus were monitored not 
only by a large number of national observers, but also by foreign observers, including 
representatives of international organizations.   
</p>
<p>63. Nicaragua emphasized that Belarus had developed a democratic State and had 
attained the poverty eradication objective set out in the Millennium Declaration. Nicaragua 
made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>64. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted that Belarus had brought its national legislation 
into line with human rights instruments. Libya praised the introduction of human rights 
education in primary schools and similar awareness-raising measures. Libya made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Oman noted the commitment of Belarus to human rights protection, as demonstrated 
by its achievements in eradicating poverty and reducing unemployment rates and maternal 
and child mortality rates, as well as achievements in education and other areas. Oman made 
recommendations.    
</p>
<p>66. Bangladesh noted that the economic success of Belarus had led to a steady reduction 
in poverty, helped to foster the enjoyment of human rights and made progress in the health 
sector. It noted the significant efforts made in combating human trafficking, and its 
commitment to engage constructively with the United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Spain thanked Belarus for the presentation of its national report and made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>68. Uzbekistan noted that Belarus was implementing measures to protect human rights. 
It observed that Belarus had transposed their provision in its national legislation. 
Uzbekistan commended efforts in the areas of health and education and in combating 
human trafficking. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted that Belarus had extended constructive 
cooperation to the international human rights machinery. It highlighted achievements 
regarding most of the Millennium Development Goals, including those related to poverty 
eradication, illiteracy and infant and maternal mortality. Iran made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Indonesia commended Belarus for its measures to ensure the right to education and 
achieve a high literacy rate. It referred to the country&#8217;s attention to the educational needs of </p>


<p>disabled children and of non-Belarus nationals, and noted the increasing acknowledgement 
of the role of civil society. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>71. Iraq sought clarification regarding the programme on human trafficking and illegal 
migration for the period 2008-2010, inquiring whether the Government intended to extend 
it. Iraq urged Belarus to cooperate with the Human Rights Council with regard to the 
special procedures.  Iraq made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72. Tajikistan stated that Belarus had worked consistently to extend mechanisms for 
safeguarding, in particular, the right of citizens to work and the right to social security, 
together with the rights of children and women and the right to education, including human 
rights education. It asked about the country&#8217;s efforts to combat human trafficking. 
Tajikistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Ireland welcomed the establishment of the European Union-Belarus Human Rights 
Dialogue and the introduction of a plan for gender equality. It asked questions about human 
rights defenders and the law on mass events. It expressed concern about reports concerning 
the arbitrary application of registration standards, the harassment and closure of non-
governmental organizations, the right to freedom of association, and the continuing
