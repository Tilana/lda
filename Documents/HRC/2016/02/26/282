<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, as well as other relevant human rights instruments, including the 
</p>

</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
</p>
<p>Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 and General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 69/156 of 18 December 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the commitment to the full and effective implementation of and follow-up 
</p>
<p>to all other relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly, the 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as the 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the 
</p>

<p>Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review 
</p>
<p>conferences, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the relevance and importance of regional instruments and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, 
</p>
<p>including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Optional Protocols 
</p>
<p>thereto, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the African Charter on the 
</p>
<p>Rights and Welfare of the Child, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
</p>
<p>Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;) 
</p>
<p>and the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention), 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> regional initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, such as the Campaign to End Child Marriage in Africa of the African Union, the 
</p>
<p>Regional Action Plan to End Child Marriage in South Asia and the Kathmandu Call for 
</p>
<p>Action to End Child Marriage in South Asia, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also</i> the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage,1 and 
</p>
<p>taking note of its summary report on the panel discussion on preventing and eliminating 
</p>
<p>child, early and forced marriage, held during the twenty-sixth session,2 and the summary 
</p>
<p>report of the panel discussion held by the General Assembly on 5 September 2014, during 
</p>
<p>its sixty-eighth session, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of joint general recommendation No. 31 of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women/general comment No. 18 of the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child on harmful practices3, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates, 
</p>
<p>abuses and impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices 
</p>
<p>and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative 
</p>
<p>impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments of States to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>of women and girls and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that, according to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, 
</p>
<p>approximately 15 million girls are married every year before the age of 18, and more than 
</p>
<p>700 million women and girls alive today were married before their eighteenth birthday, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to 
</p>
<p>multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but 
</p>
<p>not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, 
</p>
<p>frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p>obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as 
</p>
<p>increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, and that every girl and woman at risk of or 
</p>
<p>affected by these practices must have equal access to quality services such as education, 
</p>
<p>counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health-care services and medical care, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that child, early and forced marriage is itself a barrier to 
</p>
<p>sustainable development and contributes to perpetuating the cycle of poverty and that the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/26/22 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/27/34. 
</p>
<p> 3 CEDAW/C/GC/31-CRC/C/GC/18. </p>


<p>risk of child, early and forced marriage is also highly exacerbated in conflict and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian crisis situations, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> by the impact of deep-rooted gender inequalities, norms and 
</p>
<p>stereotypes and of harmful practices, perceptions and customs that are obstacles to the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, in particular of women and girls, and are among the primary 
</p>
<p>causes of child, early and forced marriage, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> <i>also</i> that poverty and lack of education are also among the drivers 
</p>
<p>of the practice of child, early and forced marriage, and recalling the fact that child, early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriage is a significant obstacle to access to and/or completion of women&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; education, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that child, early and forced marriage remains an impediment not only to 
</p>
<p>the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development 
</p>
<p>of society as a whole, and that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation of girls in all decisions that affect them, and women&#8217;s full, equal 
</p>
<p>and effective participation at all levels of decision-making are a key factor in breaking the 
</p>
<p>cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical for, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic 
</p>
<p>growth, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that the complex and challenging nature of child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage necessitates the collective efforts of Governments, lawmakers, judicial authorities, 
</p>
<p>law enforcement officials, traditional and religious leaders, civil society, the media, the 
</p>
<p>private sector and other relevant stakeholders to address the root causes of this practice that 
</p>
<p>exists in different economic, social and cultural settings, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> the need for national action plans, strategies and policies to end 
</p>
<p>child, early and forced marriage, and coordination mechanisms and multi-sectoral 
</p>
<p>interventions that aim to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, including through national comprehensive strategies to prevent and respond to all 
</p>
<p>forms of violence against children and women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that birth registration, and marriage, divorce and death registration, are 
</p>
<p>part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital 
</p>
<p>statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies 
</p>
<p>intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development 
</p>
<p>goals, and that the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious marriages 
</p>
<p>is a major stumbling block for the implementation of existing legislation and other 
</p>
<p>initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that awareness-raising on the harmful consequences of child, early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriage, including among men and boys, often contributes to promoting social 
</p>
<p>norms that support efforts by girls and their families to delay the age of marriage, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recognizes</i> that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse 
</p>
<p>or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living 
</p>
<p>their lives free from all forms of violence, and that it has wide-ranging and adverse 
</p>
<p>consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, such as the right to education and the 
</p>
<p>right to the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>girls, women, religious and community leaders, civil society and human rights groups, men 
</p>
<p>and boys, and youth organizations to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and 
</p>
<p>coordinated responses, strategies and policies to prevent and eliminate child, early and 
</p>
<p>forced marriage, and to support already married girls, adolescents and women, including 
</p>
<p>through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms, such as safe </p>


<p>shelters, access to justice and legal remedies and the sharing of best practices across borders 
</p>
<p>in full compliance with international human rights obligations and commitments; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies 
</p>
<p>aimed at preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk 
</p>
<p>and supporting already married women and girls, and to ensure that marriage is entered into 
</p>
<p>only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women have 
</p>
<p>equality with men in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the 
</p>
<p>economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to exercise due diligence in investigating, prosecuting and 
</p>
<p>punishing violence against all children, paying particular attention to child- and gender-
</p>
<p>sensitive approaches, and to provide protection and universal access to comprehensive 
</p>
<p>social, physical, mental and reproductive health, and legal services and counselling for all 
</p>
<p>victims and survivors and to ensure their full recovery and reintegration into society; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to 
</p>
<p>child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse or abduction to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in 
</p>
<p>particular by repealing or amending relevant laws; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing 
</p>
<p>and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, including by informing women and girls 
</p>
<p>about their rights under relevant laws, training law enforcement officers and monitoring 
</p>
<p>how they handle cases of child, early and forced marriage, improving legal infrastructure 
</p>
<p>and removing all barriers to access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Further urges</i> States to strengthen their efforts to ensure free birth 
</p>
<p>registration, including free or low-fee late birth registration, by means of universal, 
</p>
<p>accessible, simple, expeditious and effective registration procedures, without discrimination 
</p>
<p>of any kind, and marriage, divorce and death registration as part of the civil registration and 
</p>
<p>vital statistics systems, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, including 
</p>
<p>by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers 
</p>
<p>that impede access to registration and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>registration of customary and religious marriages; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Affirms</i> the need for States to improve gender disaggregated data collection, 
</p>
<p>research and dissemination of evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention 
</p>
<p>and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, as well as the use of quantitative and 
</p>
<p>qualitative data on harmful practices, disaggregated by sex, age, disability, geographical 
</p>
<p>location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, and to strengthen 
</p>
<p>monitoring and impact assessment of existing policies and programmes as a means of 
</p>
<p>strengthening them, ensuring their effectiveness and implementation, including in the 
</p>
<p>context of the post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to promote the meaningful participation and active 
</p>
<p>consultation of children and young people in all issues affecting them, and to create 
</p>
<p>awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks that provide girls and boys 
</p>
<p>with information, life skills training and the opportunities to be empowered and become 
</p>
<p>agents of change within their communities; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Urges</i> States to promote awareness-raising and to engage in dialogue within 
</p>
<p>communities on the health implications of child, early and forced marriage, and to improve 
</p>
<p>equal access to health-care facilities and sexual and reproductive health information, 
</p>
<p>education and services, including modern forms of contraception; </p>


<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> States to promote and protect the rights of women and girls to 
</p>
<p>education through enhanced emphasis on quality education, including human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training, and catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received 
</p>
<p>formal education, including in remote areas, while recognizing that education is one of the 
</p>
<p>most effective ways to prevent and end child, early and forced marriage and to help already 
</p>
<p>married women and men, girls and boys to make more informed choices about their lives; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Urges</i> Governments to promote and protect the human rights of all women 
</p>
<p>and girls, including their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on 
</p>
<p>matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence, and to adopt and accelerate the implementation of laws, 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes that protect and enable the enjoyment of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, including reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing 
</p>
<p>Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States, with the support of humanitarian partners, and in full 
</p>
<p>collaboration with concerned communities and other stakeholders, to strengthen monitoring 
</p>
<p>and interventions to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian 
</p>
<p>settings and fragile situations, including by integrating and harmonizing such interventions 
</p>
<p>into efforts focused on conflict prevention, protection of civilians, and access to 
</p>
<p>information and services; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Urges</i> States to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 
</p>
<p>improving safety of girls at, and on the way to and from school, including by establishing a 
</p>
<p>safe and violence-free environment by improving infrastructure, such as transportation, and 
</p>
<p>providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, improved lighting, playgrounds and 
</p>
<p>safe environments, and adopting policies to prohibit, prevent and address violence against 
</p>
<p>children, especially girls, including sexual harassment and bullying and other forms of 
</p>
<p>violence, through measures such as conducting violence prevention activities in schools and 
</p>
<p>communities and establishing and enforcing penalties for violence against girls; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> States and encourages other stakeholders to address social norms, 
</p>
<p>gender stereotypes and harmful practices that contribute to the acceptance and continuation 
</p>
<p>of the practice of child, early and forced marriage, including by raising awareness of its 
</p>
<p>harm to the victims and the cost to society at large and by providing opportunities for 
</p>
<p>discussion among others, within communities, including with the involvement of unmarried 
</p>
<p>girls and already married girls, adolescents and women, religious, tribal and community 
</p>
<p>leaders, men and boys, and families on the benefits of delaying marriage and ensuring that 
</p>
<p>girls receive education; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon </i>States and the international community to create an environment 
</p>
<p>in which the well-being of women and girls is ensured by, inter alia, cooperating, 
</p>
<p>supporting and participating in efforts for the eradication of poverty, and reaffirms that 
</p>
<p>investment in women and girls and the respect, protection and fulfilment of their rights are 
</p>
<p>among the most effective ways to end the harmful practice of child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle 
</p>
<p>poverty and lack of economic opportunities for women and girls as drivers of child, early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriage, including by ensuring women and girls inheritance and property 
</p>
<p>rights, equal access to social protection, including direct financial support and microcredit 
</p>
<p>for girls, families and guardians to encourage girls to continue their education; to develop 
</p>
<p>livelihood opportunities and life skills education; and to promote women&#8217;s equal access to 
</p>
<p>full and productive employment and decent work, as well as equal political participation 
</p>
<p>and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive resources; </p>


<p>18. <i>Also urges</i> Governments to take measures to support girls and women who 
</p>
<p>have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and calls upon States and all 
</p>
<p>relevant actors to strengthen, inter alia, the development, enactment, implementation and 
</p>
<p>monitoring of relevant legislation and protection mechanisms, such as safe shelters, 
</p>
<p>counselling and other support services, as well as empowerment programmes focusing on, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, education, health, livelihood, autonomy and decision-making; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Welcomes</i> the inclusion of a target on eliminating all harmful practices, such 
</p>
<p>as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, in the outcome document 
</p>
<p>of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, recognizes child, early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriage as a barrier to development and to the full realization of women&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; human rights, and recognizes the need to give due consideration to the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>the target in the post-2015 development agenda in order to help to ensure progress towards 
</p>
<p>the elimination of child, early and forced marriage; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Encourages</i> relevant United Nations entities, regional and subregional 
</p>
<p>organizations, civil society and other relevant actors and human rights mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>continue to collaborate with and support Member States in developing and implementing 
</p>
<p>strategies and policies at the national, regional and international levels to prevent and 
</p>
<p>eliminate child, early and forced marriage, and to support already married girls, adolescents 
</p>
<p>and women, including within the framework of relevant national action plans; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Encourages</i> States and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that child, early and 
</p>
<p>forced marriage is given due attention in the work of the Human Rights Council, including 
</p>
<p>relevant Council processes, debates and mechanisms, including the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Invites</i> relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council and relevant 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies to give due consideration to the issue of child, early and forced marriage 
</p>
<p>within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>organize an expert workshop before the thirty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council 
</p>

<p>international community towards the full implementation of human rights obligations in 
</p>
<p>this regard;
