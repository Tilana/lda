<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations High 
 Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (<i>g</i>) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p>in which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the 
</p>
<p>staff of the Office of the High Commissioner,1  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>management review of the Office of the High Commissioner2 and on the funding and 
</p>
<p>staffing of the Office,<footnote name="3">JIU/REP/2007/8.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
</p>
<p>culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> its concern that, in spite of stated efforts by the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, the situation whereby one region accounts for 47.3 per cent remains, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
 1 A/HRC/22/69. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1. 
</p>

<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
</p>
<p>regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p>most notably in senior management positions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
</p>
<p>the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
</p>
<p>account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
</p>
<p>conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>serious concern</i> at the fact that, despite the measures reported by 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
</p>
<p>the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
</p>
<p>single region occupies overall 473 per cent of posts in the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes with concern </i>the fact that, in 2012, only two out of four regions 
</p>
<p>increased their representation in the percentage of staff, and that no change was recorded in 
</p>
<p>the overrepresentation status of one region; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report that 
</p>
<p>achieving geographical balance in the staff of her Office remains one of her priorities, and 
</p>
<p>requests her to redouble her efforts with a view to redressing the current imbalance in 
</p>
<p>geographical distribution of the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner, in this regard, to establish specific and 
</p>
<p>public targets and deadlines to be achieved; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographical 
</p>
<p>diversity of her staff by strengthening the measures aimed at achieving a better 
</p>
<p>representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
</p>
<p>particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a cap on the 
</p>
<p>representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the General Assembly to considering introducing a temporary 
</p>
<p>ceiling in the recruitment of new directors and chief of branch from the overrepresented 
</p>
<p>region until such time as geographical balance has been reached; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
</p>
<p>the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
</p>
<p>issue; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue to enhance the ongoing 
</p>
<p>efforts made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
</p>
<p>recruitment and promotion at the Professional level and, in particular, in senior 
</p>
<p>management positions, as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
</p>
<p>national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/L 17

</p>
<p>protection of the universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution of staff in each and every department, and also recalls the request that he 
</p>
<p>submit to the Assembly proposals for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable 
</p>
<p>ranges, with a view to establishing a more effective tool to ensure equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution in relation to the total number of staff of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> the General Assembly to consider further measures to promote 
</p>
<p>desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner representing national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural 
</p>
<p>and religious backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Invites</i> the High Commissioner, while expressing its concern at the fact that 
</p>
<p>the budget of the Office of the High Commissioner for 2013 has been reduced by 12 per 
</p>
<p>cent (approximately $17 million), to turn this contingency into an opportunity to address 
</p>
<p>the current imbalance in geographic distribution of the staff of the Office;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 14.<b> </b><i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
</p>
<p>importance that the Assembly continue to provide support and guidance to the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance in the 
</p>
<p>composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Joint Inspection Unit to undertake a comprehensive follow-up 
</p>
<p>review of the management and administration of the Office of the High Commissioner in 
</p>
<p>particular with regard to its impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the 
</p>
<p>staff, and to submit a report thereon and containing concrete proposals for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the present resolution to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh 
</p>
<p>session;

</p>
<p>report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session following the structure 
</p>
<p>and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures taken to correct the
