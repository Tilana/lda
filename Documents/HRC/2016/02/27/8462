<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011. The review of Niger was held at the 13th 
meeting on 1 February 2011. The delegation of Niger was headed by Abdoulaye Djibo, 
Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Keeper of the Seals. At its 17th meeting, held on 4 
February 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Niger. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Niger: Angola, Russian Federation and Saudi 
Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Niger: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/NER/1 and Corr.1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/NER/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/NER/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Niger through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Abdoulaye Djibo, Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Keeper of the Seals, said 
that since the establishment of the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy on 
18 February 2010, Niger&#8217;s supreme authorities had been endeavouring to meet the three 
basic commitments made to the Nigerian people: restoration of democracy, reform of 
public finances and national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>6. The first commitment was being met by adhering to the electoral timetable: holding 
of a constitutional referendum on 31 October 2010; adoption of a new Constitution; 
regional and municipal elections on 10 and 11 January 2011; and, since 31 January 2011, 
first round of the presidential and legislative elections. Action with regard to the other two 
commitments depended on the commissions set up to that end. 
</p>
<p>7. The Universal Periodic Review process had been conducted in a participatory and 
inclusive fashion and the national report was divided into seven chapters some of which 
had been drawn up by the delegation. 
</p>
<p>8. Niger placed a human-rights based approach at the centre of all its political 
strategies and development projects and programmes, and it was supported in that process 
by civil society organizations and its development partners. 
</p>
<p>9. Niger had ratified most of the basic international human rights instruments and, in so 
doing, the State had agreed to respect the obligations arising from them and to give </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.11-12306 
</p>
<p>practical expression to its commitment in domestic law. Niger was developing strategies for 
approval of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty. Moreover, it had just begun the process of ratifying the African Charter on 
Democracy, Elections and Governance. 
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of Niger proclaimed the country&#8217;s commitment to the values of 
pluralistic democracy and human rights as defined by the international and regional 
instruments mentioned above. The Constitution also guaranteed human rights, including the 
right to life, security of the person and privacy.  
</p>
<p>11. The representative of Niger said that those rights were also subject to specific laws, 
relating in particular to possible restrictions of those rights which might justify recourse to 
certain measures. Nevertheless, following the re-establishment of peace and stability in the 
country, the current authorities had set up a High Authority for National Reconciliation and 
the Consolidation of Peace. 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution also guaranteed freedom of religion, expression and association, 
and exercise of those rights was governed by various laws and regulations. The right to 
information was guaranteed by law. The Transition Authorities had adopted a charter on 
access to public information and an order decriminalizing press offences, and the High 
Commissariat for Computer Science and New Information and Communication 
Technologies had been established. 
</p>
<p>13. Participation in public and political life was guaranteed under the Constitution 
subject to laws governing the conditions under which it was exercised. Access to justice 
was open and free of charge. Niger was endeavouring, in cooperation with its technical and 
financial partners, to make that access effective and to bring the courts closer to citizens by 
reducing litigation costs and improving the legal framework and the judicial system. 
</p><p>14. In the field of education, Niger had made great sacrifices in order to increase the 
enrolment rate at different levels of instruction. A ten-year educational development 
programme had been implemented to achieve Millennium Development Goal No. 2 and 
was demonstrating increasingly good results. The right had been enshrined in the 
Constitution, but the effectiveness of the commitments mentioned above was undermined 
by sociocultural constraints, inadequate financial resources, a weak infrastructure and a lack 
of qualified teaching personnel.  
</p>
<p>15. Niger had ratified 36 International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, 
including the 8 basic conventions, and had endorsed the ILO decent work country 
programmes. Freedom of association was also guaranteed in Niger, which had some 10 
trade union federations and 2 employers&#8217; organizations. Niger had adopted a national 
employment policy framework document. 
</p>
<p>16. Niger had endorsed the health-related Millennium Development Goals. It had also 
adopted a health policy declaration, a health development plan and a road map for 
combating maternal and neonatal mortality. 
</p>
<p>17. In response to its repeated food crises, Niger had taken the innovative step of 
guaranteeing the right to food and access to potable water in its Constitution. Its goal was to 
achieve an 80 per cent rate of access to potable water by 2015. 
</p>
<p>18. The representative of Niger also reviewed the many activities designed to implement 
the specific rights of women, children and the disabled. In respect of women, the 
representative mentioned the 2008 national policy on gender, the 1999 national social 
development policy, specific measures criminalizing some forms of violence against 
women (slavery, female genital mutilation, trafficking in persons) and free-of-charge </p>


<p>GE.11-12306 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>services including Caesarean deliveries, cancer detection and care for women, prenatal care 
and family planning. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to children, the representative drew attention to the law on civil status, 
in particular the provision on universal and free-of-charge registration at birth of children 
aged 0 to 15; laws relating to juvenile courts and the orientation of the Niger education 
system; the national child protection policy and the policy of free care for children aged 0 
to 5. Other child protection measures had been integrated into the Criminal Code and in 
other specific texts. 
</p>
<p>20. Disabled persons were exempt from all hospital costs by virtue of legislative and 
regulatory provisions. 
</p>
<p>21. Niger had taken several measures to improve its citizens&#8217; living conditions, but their 
impact was dependent on the State&#8217;s limited resources. Niger had many expectations. Its 
representative had focused solely on those relating to capacity-building for human rights 
stakeholders and to technical assistance, which was one way for Niger to achieve its 
objectives, namely, development and implementation of a human rights action plan, support 
for report preparation, and socio-political management of conflicts. 
</p>
<p>22. The head of the delegation thanked all Niger&#8217;s bilateral and multilateral partners, 
which had always supported it in its efforts to consolidate the rule of law and promote good 
governance. 
</p>
<p>23. Niger remained aware of the scope of the problems it was facing, the obligations 
arising from its human rights commitments and the related expectations and difficulties. 
Niger called on the international community to support it in its determination to combat 
poverty and impunity and to carry out the reforms needed to consolidate the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>24. During the interactive dialogue, 32 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the participative approach taken to the drafting of the national report 
and the comprehensiveness of the report, as well as the commitment shown by Niger to the 
universal periodic review mechanism. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to 
be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>25. Saudi Arabia noted that the National Observer for Human Rights operates in 
compliance with national legislation and international standards to which Niger is party. 
Saudi Arabia also noted that Niger has signed a significant number of international 
conventions and that its national report showed significant efforts in the field of education, 
in particular obligatory primary education. Additionally, Niger has stressed protection of 
children, preschool education, and education of girls to improve their situation. Niger has 
many projects on the dissemination of knowledge and information on human rights; some 
of which are in Arabic language. Saudi Arabia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Belgium deplored the fact that the current legislation in Niger retained the death 
penalty although it had not been applied since 1975. Belgium also expressed concerns at 
various types of discrimination against women and girls, in particular traditional practices, 
such as the <i>Wahaya</i> or female genital mutilation, which are widespread in the country in 
spite of their criminalization. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Canada welcomed the Transitional Government&#8217;s engagement with human rights, 
emphasized by the decriminalization of press offences, respect for freedom of expression, 
association and assembly, and certain reforms of the Criminal Code. Canada expressed 
concern over Niger&#8217;s food crisis that. It noted the Transitional Government has recognized 
the seriousness of the crisis and works together with the international community to find a </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.11-12306 
</p>
<p>solution. While hoping that the new Government, which will start its works in April 2011, 
will pursue efforts in favour of an increased protection of human rights and democracy, 
Canada noted the persistence of challenges such as impunity, gender equality, violence 
against women, and child trafficking and low level of literacy. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Turkey supported Niger&#8217;s efforts in re-establishing democracy and constitutional 
order and welcomed the timeline for transition to democracy. It welcomed the new 
Constitution and that the death penalty had not been applied since 1975 but encouraged 
Niger to take the necessary measures to abolish it. It welcomed women&#8217;s education and 
participation and saluted Niger&#8217;s Penal Code which severely punishes FGM, slavery and 
procurement of prostitution. It expressed concern that Niger suffered drought, famine and 
malnutrition and underlined the need for the international community&#8217;s support. Turkey 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. Slovenia commended Niger for the introduction of new provisions, in June 2010, 
into the Penal Code of 2003 abolishing FGM and asked the Government about concrete 
measures to put those new provisions in practice. It also asked whether the mentioned 
changes in the Penal Code include the elimination of the practice known as <i>Wahaya</i>, girls 
serving as concubines of wealthy or eminent persons, and what measures have been taken 
to eliminate this practice. Noting that Niger was party to most of the core universal human 
rights instruments, Slovenia asked Niger about the envisaged timeline for reporting to treaty 
bodies. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. France noted the de facto moratorium on executions put in place since 1976 but that 
Niger had not yet formally abolished capital punishment. France further noted that the 
national report did not address human rights training of law enforcement officials or 
provisions in order to punish possible human rights violations committed by them. While 
acknowledging the efforts made by Niger, France noted that women were still victims of 
discriminatory and harmful traditional practices. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Brazil was encouraged by the improvement of access to education. It noted the role 
of school canteens in increasing the number of students in nomadic areas. It welcomed 
Niger&#8217;s cooperation with OHCHR and that no special rapporteurs&#8217; visits were pending. 
Brazil expressed concern over gender-related crimes, including female genital mutilation 
and noted efforts to prevent this violence. It highlighted the human rights impact of 
transnational companies&#8217; operation and hoped Niger would follow up on the issue. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Spain recognized the evolution of human rights protection in Niger and welcomed 
the new Constitution. It also welcomed the fact that the death penalty had not been applied 
since 1976. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Cuba highlighted the fact that despite Niger&#8217;s important natural resources, its 
population faces challenges aggravated by the global crisis and international plunder and 
exploitation, the principal causes of Niger&#8217;s underdevelopment. It welcomed Niger&#8217;s 
accelerated 2008&#8211;2012 development strategy, highlighting that education was free. Cuba 
also welcomed several programmes to improve access to health, which led to the 
improvement of various health indicators. It noted Niger&#8217;s measures to fight food insecurity 
and improve access to drinking water. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland asked whether the 
Government was considering extending an open invitation to the United Nations human 
rights special procedures. It appreciated the efforts made to implement peace agreements 
and democracy and welcomed the peaceful conclusion of the first round of elections. It also 
welcomed steps taken to improve the participation of women in political life and the 
revision of the Criminal Code so that FGM, slavery and rape are punishable by law. The </p>


<p>GE.11-12306 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>United Kingdom stated that violence and customs such as forced marriage remain part of 
everyday life for many women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Norway took note of the political and institutional challenges facing Niger after 
February 2010. It encouraged Niger to take further measures to secure that the rights of 
women are protected. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Germany asked Niger to provide figures on the number of trails opened and 
sentences passed on such offences as sexual harassment, FGM, slavery and rape. Germany 
also asked for information on the efforts undertaken or planned to increase the number of 
lawyers; and for an assessment on the coexistence of codified law and traditional law. 
Germany wished to know about steps taken to improve the working situation of women in 
all areas of the country, and not exclusively in the capital. Germany made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Argentina inquired about measures to strengthen legislative, judicial and assistance 
mechanisms to combat sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and to punish these conducts. 
It asked about regulating the right to family providing for equal rights for men and women 
and about literacy for women and girls. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. While expressing appreciation for the effort made by Niger in the field of promotion 
and protection of human rights, Poland stated that, as indicated in the reports by the 
CEDAW, CRC and ILO Committees, issues of great importance remain to be addressed. 
Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Azerbaijan stated that technical assistance from the international community was 
important to improve existing capabilities in the sphere of human rights. While noting that 
Niger was party to the main international treaties, Azerbaijan highlighted that cooperation 
between Niger and special procedures mechanism was ongoing, as the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to food visited Niger twice. Azerbaijan commended the steps taken to decrease 
the national poverty rate and to tackle food scarcity and poverty. It also stated that Niger is 
on the path of achieving Millennium Development Goal 2 on providing universal primary 
education through the implementation of a 10-year educational development programme. 
Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p><p>40. Pakistan stated that poverty alleviation remains a major challenge for Niger, and 
noted the strategy prepared to accelerate development and reduce poverty (2008&#8211;2012) 
aimed at improving social indicators. Historical data reveal that Niger continues to confront 
shortfalls in domestic production of main crops, on average once every three years, leading 
to a food crisis. Pakistan was pleased to note that the Government had established the Food 
Crisis Unit and the Early Warning System Coordination Unit to assess food crisis risk in 
advance. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Slovakia noted that institutions relevant to freedom of expression had not fulfilled 
their role. It welcomed the decriminalization of press offences. It noted CRC&#8217;s concern over 
the limitations on civil-society organizations and about the fact that human rights activists 
face threats and ill-treatment. It noted CEDAW&#8217;s concern over patriarchal ideologies. It 
was concerned that ILO had observed an archaic form of slavery in nomadic communities, 
where slave status was transmitted by birth in certain ethnic groups. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Denmark noted Government&#8217;s steps towards reintroducing democracy, but was 
worried about the prevailing culture of impunity, which is perpetuated by amnesties. 
Denmark welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death penalty, in effect since 1976, but 
it was disappointed by the refusal of the National Consultative Council to endorse a 
Transitional Government&#8217;s proposal for the complete abolition of the death penalty. 
Denmark made recommendations. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.11-12306 
</p>
<p>43. Niger welcomed the delegations&#8217; questions and recommendations. With regard to 
the death penalty, the representative of Niger said that the country had a de facto 
moratorium on the death penalty. The National Consultative Council (CCN) had issued an 
unfavourable opinion on the existing draft order concerning the death penalty in the hope of 
launching a major public debate and gaining public support. A three-pronged strategy for 
the adoption of the reform had already been approved, as had a timetable under which the 
death penalty was to be abolished before the end of the transition period. Despite the 
Council&#8217;s negative opinion, the process had been carried out in accordance with the 
timetable.  
</p>
<p>44. Niger had ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment but not the Optional Protocol relating to it. The new 
Constitution prohibited torture and the Criminal Code provided for sanctions against 
perpetrators of acts of torture. There was consequently no obstacle to adopting a law 
criminalizing torture. The matter had been brought before a commission tasked with reform 
of civil and penal law, within the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. Discussions would 
be held as a means of launching the process of ratifying the Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>45. With regard to acts of violence committed by the police, the Constitution of Niger 
guaranteed the right to life, health and physical integrity. The Criminal Code penalized 
intentional injury to individuals and crimes committed by public officials and dealt 
specifically with abuse of authority. Niger was striving to establish the rule of law, under 
which impunity would not be tolerated. Each time human rights violations had been 
reported to the authorities, an investigation had been conducted. A professional code of 
ethics for police was ready for adoption. 
</p>
<p>46. Citizens had open and guaranteed access to the justice system but the distances 
required to get to court and litigation costs had made such access difficult. Steps had been 
taken to implement a staff training plan and to establish courts throughout the country. A 
legal and judicial assistance mechanism for vulnerable groups had been piloted with 
success. Draft legislation to that end had been drawn up for adoption. 
</p>
<p>47. An inter-ministerial committee had been set up to deal with delays in submitting 
reports to treaty bodies. Three reports should be submitted in the near future.  
</p>
<p>48. As for efforts to combat the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), a law 
criminalizing that practice had been adopted in 2003. The State and non-governmental 
organizations, principally the Nigerian Committee on Harmful Traditional Practices 
(CONIPRAT), had implemented programmes to combat such practices, and CONIPRAT 
had also conducted awareness-raising and training activities. Those efforts, which had 
helped to reduce the prevalence of FGM, were part of efforts to reach the goal of &#8220;FGM 
zero tolerance&#8221; by 2015. 
</p>
<p>49. A national ethics committee had been set up in anticipation of the adoption of the 
personal status code and the holding of a national popular consultation. A national 
validation workshop would be held with a view to adoption of the code. With the adoption 
of the code, Niger&#8217;s reservations with regard to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women would become obsolete. Once adopted, the code 
would regulate inheritance, divorce, repudiation, polygamy, early and forced marriage and 
violence against women and girls. 
</p>
<p>50. In 2008 the Government had adopted a national gender policy with four strategic 
action lines, which included reinforcing the effective application of the rights of women 
and young girls, combating gender-based violence and ensuring equitable participation of 
men and women in the administration of power. Specific steps had been taken by the 
Government, backed by its technical and financial partners and non-governmental 
organizations, to combat violence against women. Those steps had included the </p>


<p>GE.11-12306 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>development of a coordination framework for the stakeholders involved and the 
establishment of legal clinics. An annual 16-day campaign against such violence had also 
been conducted. 
</p>
<p>51. In its efforts to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in addition to 
setting up an appropriate legal framework for the purpose of combating all forms of child 
exploitation, the Government had instituted several other measures. It had, in particular, set 
up a national child protection office, implemented a national action plan for child survival, 
protection and development (2006&#8211;2010) and finalized the draft children&#8217;s code. 
</p><p>52. Niger had always cooperated with special procedures mandate holders. It had sent 
invitations to some of them and was open to the idea of inspections by other United Nations 
bodies. It was committed to inviting special rapporteurs each time the need arose. 
</p>
<p>53. In 1985, Niger had ratified the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>54. Niger had a legal and institutional framework that guaranteed freedom of the press, 
which was also enshrined in the new Constitution. Laws relating to press offences had been 
repealed. A communication observatory and a fund to assist privately-supported media had 
been set up. In addition, a charter on access to public information had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>55. The practice of <i>Wahaya</i> persisted because marriage was principally governed by 
customary law. Adoption of a family code would make it possible to eliminate that practice. 
Niger had adopted a law on quotas, under which administrative offices were obliged to 
appoint a fixed number of women or risk legal proceedings. An evaluation would be 
conducted soon. 
</p>
<p>56. In 2007, Niger had adopted a national literacy and non-formal education policy 
aimed at raising the literacy rate in rural areas and among women. The 1998 Education Act 
guaranteed education for girls aged 4 to 18 despite the disparities between regions and 
between boys and girls. There was currently a national office for the promotion of young 
girls&#8217; education. 
</p>
<p>57. The United States of America commended measures taken to improve human rights 
despite enormous challenges. It welcomed the alignment of national legislation with 
international obligations but noted it had not ensured that all Niger&#8217;s residents enjoyed 
fundamental freedoms. It expressed concern over trafficking in persons and asked about the 
status ordinance No. 2010-86 in this regard. It noted Niger&#8217;s efforts for labour code reform 
and asked about legislation to combat child labour. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Malaysia appreciated Niger&#8217;s candid recognition of the various political and 
institutional challenges faced by the Government in its effort to improve the social 
development and to promote and protect human rights. It was convinced that with strong 
commitment, persistent efforts and continuous constructive engagement with the 
international community, Niger will be able to make progress in many areas that will 
contribute to the overall improvement of the standard of living of the people in the country. 
Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Switzerland congratulated Niger for its progress in human rights promotion and 
protection despite its political and institutional upheavals. Switzerland noted that Niger 
continued to sentence offenders to death, although the last execution was carried out in 
</p><p>1976. Switzerland was concerned at confirmed excessive use of force, torture and 
extrajudicial executions and referred to the rights of the child. Switzerland made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Australia welcomed progress made by the Transitional Government in returning 
Niger to democracy. It noted that, in spite of a de facto moratorium, the death penalty 
remains in Niger&#8217;s law and that death sentences continue to be imposed by courts. Australia </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.11-12306 
</p>
<p>was concerned by continuing reports of violence against women and children including 
forced and early marriage, FGM, sexual abuse and exploitation, child trafficking and the 
phenomenon of child soldiers. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Ecuador welcomed Niger&#8217;s commitment to the UPR particularly the inter-ministerial 
Committee and national consultation carried out. It recognized the importance of financial 
and technical assistance on the part of United Nations. It hoped for the reestablishment of 
democracy and made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Chile noted Niger had achieved important progress in spite of institutional and 
political upsets. It welcomed the creation of the Ministry for Women, the poverty reduction 
strategy, reforms to the Criminal Code, which abolished female genital mutilation, and 
advances in education for girls. It noted challenges in food security, access to drinking 
water and health. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. China noted that Niger ratified several international and regional human rights 
treaties and adopted many concrete measures to increase and promote agriculture 
production, improve medical care, enhance school enrolment of children and employment 
of youth. China understood that Niger, as a developing country, in developing its economy 
and promoting human rights, was indeed facing special difficulties and challenges. China 
called upon the international community to continue to provide necessary financial and 
technical assistance to Niger. 
</p>
<p>64. Luxembourg expressed concerns at the situation related to growing malnutrition and 
hunger, as it particularly affected children. Luxembourg inquired on measures taken by 
Niger to address this issue. Luxembourg was particularly concerned at the situation of 
women in rural areas relating to access to basic services. Luxembourg was concerned by 
slavery practices. Luxembourg wished to resume its cooperation with Niger once rule of 
law will be restored. Luxembourg made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Sweden closely followed Niger&#8217;s reform process and stressed that the transition to 
civilian rule should continue in a free and transparent way. It expressed concern over 
restrictions to freedom of expression and assembly. It noted that journalists, human rights 
defenders and activists have been harassed and arrested and demonstrations have been 
repressed. It noted Niger maintains the death penalty and expressed concern over 
widespread impunity, including for security forces. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Latvia thanked the delegation of Niger for the comprehensive presentation of its 
national report and its constructive engagement in the UPR process. Latvia made one 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. Thailand commended Niger for significant progress in protecting human rights 
despite development challenges and constraints. It welcomed that Niger was party to 
virtually all international human rights instruments and its efforts to ensure access to health 
care for vulnerable groups. It noted with concern violence against and exploitation of 
vulnerable groups. Thailand expressed its readiness to share with Niger its best practices 
and provide technical assistance, for example in prison administration and in assisting 
people with disabilities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Indonesia welcomed the fact that the Transitional Government would soon be 
holding legislative and presidential elections and commended the building of human rights 
infrastructure, raising awareness and trainings in human rights for, inter alia, armed and 
security forces, and prison personnel. In this connection, Indonesia noted the current effort 
taking place under the guidance of the National Observatory for Human Rights. Indonesia 
noted that the national report honestly admits Niger&#8217;s shortcomings and the current lack of 
normative legislation to support the development and implementation of the human rights 
programme. Indonesia made recommendations. </p>

</b></p>
<p>69. Italy welcomed that Niger has signed and ratified the majority of universal and 
regional human rights instruments and welcomed the fact that civil society was 
progressively more mobilized on human rights issues. It noted that the condition of women 
and children needed improvements and was concerned over human trafficking. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. The Central African Republic expressed its support for Niger and congratulated it 
for its efforts. It encouraged Niger in the different reforms undertaken as well as the 
measures taken to improve the living conditions of the people of Niger. It asked for the 
support of the international community to accompany Niger in this dynamic and so that its 
initiatives could achieve the desired results. 
</p>
<p>71. The representative of Niger said that the country had promulgated in December 
2010 an order concerning the combat against trafficking in persons, which penalized 
trafficking, slavery and related practices. Implementing legislation would be adopted and 
institutional structures set up. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to the combat against food insecurity, the representative had referred to 
numerous measures, including the setting up of a national mechanism for the prevention 
and management of food crises, the recent establishment of a high authority for food 
security and an agricultural bank, the construction of the Kandadji dam and the guarantee of 
the right to food under the Constitution. A policy document on nutrition had also been 
drawn up for the period 2007 to 2015. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to child labour, Niger had pledged to promote a national policy to 
combat child labour, to improve child labour regulation and to raise the minimum working 
age progressively. A unit to combat child labour had been set up to that end as had a 
national steering committee to combat child labour. A draft national action plan to combat 
the worst forms of child labour, for the period 2011 to 2015, would be adopted shortly. 
</p>
<p>74. By law, the Transition Authorities could not take part in elections. An open-ended 
consultative council, serving as a transition parliament, had drawn up the election schedule, 
which had been approved by an independent national electoral commission. Participation in 
the referendum on the adoption of the Constitution had been high. Local elections had been 
conducted in a transparent manner, and the presidential and legislative elections had begun 
calmly on 31 January 2011. The task of ensuring that the elections were carried out 
properly had been entrusted to the judiciary. Freedom of the press had been guaranteed in 
order to put a stop to previous practices. 
</p>
<p>75. A total of 48 women who had had excision performed on their daughters had been 
fined and given a suspended prison sentence in January 2010. Another trial had taken place
