Our Drilling & Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig
services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services.
Our Drilling & Rig Services business consists of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig
Services.
On March 24, 2015, we completed the merger (the “Merger”) of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J
Energy Services, Inc. (“C&J Energy”). In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion &
Production Services business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, C&J Energy Services
Ltd. (“CJES”), and has been accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate as of the acquisition date. As a result of the
Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our
condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). See further discussion in Note 3 — Investments in Unconsolidated
Affiliates. Prior to the Merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the
completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of wells in the United States and Canada. These
services include stimulation, coiled-tubing, cementing, wireline, workover, well-servicing and fluids management. As we no
longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion & Production Services business, our results of
operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015 are not directly comparable to the six months ended June 30, 2016. On
July 20, 2016, CJES voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
On May 24, 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia Company
Limited (“Nabors Arabia”), our joint venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The effects of the
acquisition and the operating results of Nabors Arabia are included in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date, and are reflected in our International drilling segment.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Nabors” mean Nabors
Industries Ltd., together with our subsidiaries where the context requires, including Nabors Industries, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Nabors Delaware”), our wholly owned subsidiary.
Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Interim Financial Information
The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of Nabors have been prepared in conformity
with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the rules and
8
Table of Contents
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted. Therefore, these financial
statements should be read along with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended
(“2015 Annual Report”). In management’s opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all
adjustments necessary to state fairly our financial position as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations,
comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity for the periods presented herein. Interim results for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 may not be indicative of results that will be realized for the full year ending December 31,
2016.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nabors, as well as all majority owned and non-
majority owned subsidiaries required to be consolidated under GAAP. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in operating entities where we have the ability to exert significant influence, but where we do not control
operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method.  Our share of the net income (loss) of these
entities is recorded as earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our condensed consolidated statements of income
(loss). The investments in these entities are included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our condensed
consolidated balance sheets. We record our share of the net income (loss) of our equity method investment in CJES on a
one-quarter lag, as we are not able to obtain the financial information of CJES on a timely basis. See Note 3 — Investments
in Unconsolidated Affiliates.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out or weighted-
average cost methods and includes the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.  Inventory included the
following:

Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill and intangible assets exceed their fair value.
We initially assess goodwill for impairment based on qualitative factors to determine whether to perform the two-step annual
goodwill impairment test, a Level 3 fair value measurement. After our qualitative assessment, step one of the impairment
test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair
value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step compares the implied fair value
of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
Our estimated fair values of our reporting units incorporate judgment and the use of estimates by management. Potential
factors requiring assessment include a further or sustained decline in our stock price, declines in oil and natural gas prices,
a variance in results of operations from forecasts, a change in operating strategy of assets and additional transactions in the
oil and gas industry. Another factor in determining whether impairment has occurred is the relationship between our market
capitalization and our book value. As part of our annual review, we compare the sum of our reporting units’ estimated fair
value, which includes the estimated fair value of non-operating assets and liabilities, less debt, to our market capitalization
and assess the reasonableness of our estimated fair value. Any of the above-mentioned factors may cause us to re-
evaluate goodwill during any quarter throughout the year.
9
Table of Contents
Based on our annual review during the second quarter of 2016, we did not record a goodwill impairment. However, a
significantly prolonged period of lower natural gas or oil prices could continue to adversely affect demand for and prices of
our services.  This could result in future impairment charges, particularly in our U.S. Drilling and Rig Services segments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-
09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, relating to the revenue recognition from contracts with customers that creates
a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS. The core principle will require recognition of revenue to represent the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration, including costs incurred, to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year
deferral of this standard, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently
evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall, relating to the recognition and
measurement of financial assets and liabilities. This standard enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which
includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. This guidance is
effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, relating to leases to increase transparency and
comparability among companies. This standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on
the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. Additionally, this standard will require disclosures designed to give
financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This
guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is
permitted. This standard requires an entity to separate lease components from nonlease components within a contract.
While the lease components would be accounted for under ASU No. 2016-02, nonlease components would be accounted
for under ASU No. 2014-09. Therefore, we are evaluating ASU No. 2016-02 concurrently with the provisions of ASU No.
2014-09 and the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to simplify the
transition to the equity method of accounting. This standard eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity
method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Instead, the equity
method investor should add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s
previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for the equity
method of accounting. This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation, to simplify the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on
our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates
On March 24, 2015, we completed the Merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy.  We
received total consideration comprised of approximately $693.5 million in cash ($650.1 million after settlement of working
capital requirements) and approximately 62.5 million common shares in the combined company, CJES, representing
approximately 53% of the outstanding and issued common shares of CJES as of the closing date. Because we have
significant influence over CJES, but not a controlling financial interest, we have accounted for our investment in CJES
under the equity method of accounting.
Our condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2015 consolidates the operating
results of our Completion & Production Services business through the closing date of the Merger. As a result
10
Table of Contents
of the Merger, CJES became an unconsolidated affiliate and we no longer consolidate the operating results of our
Completion & Production Services business. Therefore, subsequent to the closing date of the Merger, our share of the net
income (loss), as adjusted for our basis difference, of our equity method investment in CJES is recorded as earnings
(losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Our policy is to record
our share of the net income (loss) of CJES on a one-quarter lag as we are not able to obtain the financial information of
CJES on a timely basis. The equity in earnings from CJES, which is reflected in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated
affiliates in our condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) is as follows:

2015
During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized an estimated gross gain of $102.2 million in connection with the Merger
based on the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our
Completion & Production Services business. This gain was partially offset by $49.6 million in transaction costs related to
the Merger.
We record our investment in the equity of CJES in the Investment in unconsolidated affiliates line in our condensed
consolidated balance sheet. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever certain impairment
indicators exist including the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the
investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. A loss in value of an
investment that is other than a temporary decline should be recognized.
During the first quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value of our investment was other than temporarily impaired,
which resulted in an impairment charge of $153.4 million to reduce our carrying value to its estimated fair value of $93.8
million, determined principally based on the average share price over a specified period. Additionally, we recognized a
$23.8 million charge to reserve certain other amounts associated with our CJES holdings including affiliate receivables.
Throughout the second quarter of 2016, CJES issued multiple statements regarding a potential restructuring of the
company in response to its failure to satisfy covenants set forth under its credit agreements. On July 8, 2016, CJES
announced a restructuring plan that it agreed to with lenders under its credit agreement in which it expects to voluntarily
commence a reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under this restructuring plan, existing common
shareholders would not receive any of the new common shares of the company.  On July 20, 2016, CJES voluntarily filed
for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, we determined our investment was other than
temporarily impaired and recorded a charge of $39.0 million to write off substantially all of the remaining net book value of
our investment. In anticipation of CJES’s bankruptcy filing, we recognized an additional $3.9 million in professional fees
incurred in connection with our efforts to preserve the value of our CJES holdings. These charges are reflected in other
expense (income), net in our condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016. See Note 9 – Supplemental Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Information. Beginning in the third
quarter of 2016, we expect to no longer report our investment in CJES as an equity method investment.
The following table presents summarized income statement (loss) information for CJES for each of the three months ended
December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, which is reflected in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our

Note 4 Fair Value Measurements
Our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 consist of
available-for-sale equity and debt securities. Our debt securities could transfer into or out of a Level 1 or 2 measure
depending on the availability of independent and current pricing at the end of each quarter. During the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, there were no transfers of our financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2 measures. Our financial
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The majority of our short-term investments are categorized as Level 1 and had a fair value of $22.1 million as
of June 30, 2016.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
We applied fair value measurements to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis, which
consist of measurements primarily to assets held for sale, goodwill, equity method investments, intangible assets and other
long-lived assets, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and our pipeline contractual
commitment.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP. The fair value of our long-term debt,
revolving credit facility and commercial paper is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third-party
financial institutions. The fair value of our debt instruments is determined using Level 2 measurements. The carrying and
fair values of these liabilities were as follows:

(1)The 2.35% senior notes due September 2016 have been classified as long-term because we have the ability and intent
to repay this obligation utilizing our revolving credit facility.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased $154.1 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes
(all of which is now held by a consolidated affiliate) at various maturities for approximately $150.4 million in cash, reflecting
principal and approximately $2.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest. The discount represents the gain on the debt
buybacks and is included in other expense (income), net in our condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Commercial Paper Program
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $6.5 million of commercial paper outstanding.  The weighted average interest
rate on borrowings at June 30, 2016 was 1.10%.  Our commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt
because the borrowings are fully supported by availability under our revolving credit facility, which matures as currently
structured in July 2020, more than one year from now.
Revolving Credit Facility
As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility, which matures in July 2020. The weighted
average interest rate on borrowings during the period ended June 30, 2016 was 1.79%. The revolving credit facility
contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make
investments or loans and create liens and require us to maintain a net funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio, as
defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement at June 30, 2016. If we fail to
perform our obligations under the covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated, and any outstanding
borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable.
Term Loan Facility
On February 6, 2015, Nabors Delaware entered into an unsecured term loan facility for $300.0 million with a three-year
maturity, which was fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. Under the new term loan facility, we were required to
prepay the loan upon the closing of the Merger, or if we otherwise disposed of assets, issued term debt, or issued equity
with net proceeds of more than $70.0 million, subject to certain exceptions. The term loan agreement contained customary
representations and warranties, covenants and events of default for loan facilities of this type.  On March 27, 2015, we
repaid the $300.0 million term loan according to the terms of the agreement, using a portion of the cash consideration
received in connection with the Merger and the facility was terminated.
13
Table of Contents
On September 29, 2015, Nabors Delaware entered into a new five-year unsecured term loan facility for $325.0 million,
which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. The term loan facility contains a mandatory prepayment of $162.5
million due in September 2018. As of June 30, 2016, we had $325.0 million of borrowings outstanding under this
facility.  The weighted average interest rate on borrowings at June 30, 2016 was 1.70%. Borrowings under this facility will
bear interest for periods of one, two, three or six months, at an annual rate equal to LIBOR, plus the applicable interest
margin. The interest margin is based on our long-term unsecured credit rating for debt as in effect from time to time.
Note 6 Common Shares
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 0.3 million of our common shares in the open market for $1.7
million, all of which are held in treasury.
On April 29, 2016, a cash dividend of $0.06 per share was declared for shareholders of record on June 10, 2016. The
dividend was paid on July 1, 2016 in the amount of $17.0 million and was charged to retained earnings in our condensed
consolidated statement of changes in equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies
Income Tax
We operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to
review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions
we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully
challenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain
countries, if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose
a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could change substantially.
We have received an assessment from a tax authority in Latin America in connection with a 2007 income tax return. The
assessment relates to the denial of depreciation expense deductions related to drilling rigs. Similar deductions were taken
for tax years 2009 and 2010. Although Nabors and its tax advisors believe these deductions are appropriate and intend to
continue to defend our position, we have recorded a partial reserve to account for this contingency. If we ultimately do not
prevail, we estimate that we would be required to recognize additional tax expense in the range of $3 million to $8 million.
Self-Insurance
We estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our condensed
consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based on the facts and circumstances specific to existing claims and
our past experience with similar claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims
have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid and are actuarially supported. Although we
believe our insurance coverage and reserve estimates are reasonable, a significant accident or other event that is not fully
covered by insurance or contractual indemnity could occur and could materially affect our financial position and results of
operations for a particular period.
We self-insure for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, general liability, automobile liability
and property damage. Effective April 1, 2016, some of our workers’ compensation claims, employers’ liability and marine
employers’ liability claims are subject to a $3.0 million per-occurrence deductible; additionally, some of our automobile
liability claims are subject to a $2.5 million deductible.  General liability claims remain subject to a $5.0 million per-
occurrence deductible.
In addition, we are subject to a $5.0 million deductible for land rigs and for offshore rigs. This applies to all kinds of risks of
physical damage except for named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which we are self-insured.
14
Table of Contents
Litigation
Nabors and its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of
business. We estimate the range of our liability related to pending litigation when we believe the amount and range of loss
can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. When a liability is probable
and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related
to the lawsuits or claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our
pending litigation and claims and revise our estimates. Due to uncertainties related to the resolution of lawsuits and claims,
the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates. For matters where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and
significant, we disclose the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at
the time of disclosure. In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided, our ultimate exposure with
respect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our condensed
consolidated financial position or cash flows, although they could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations for a particular reporting period.
In 2009, the Court of Ouargla entered a judgment of approximately $13.0 million (at June 30, 2016 exchange rates) against
us relating to alleged customs infractions in Algeria.  We believe we did not receive proper notice of the judicial
proceedings, and that the amount of the judgment was excessive in any case. We asserted the lack of legally required
notice as a basis for challenging the judgment on appeal to the Algeria Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”). In May 2012,
that court reversed the lower court and remanded the case to the Ouargla Court of Appeals for treatment consistent with the
Supreme Court’s ruling. In January 2013, the Ouargla Court of Appeals reinstated the judgment. We again lodged an
appeal to the Supreme Court, asserting the same challenges as before. While the appeal was pending, the Hassi
Messaoud customs office initiated efforts to collect the judgment prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in the case. As a
result, we paid approximately $3.1 million and posted security of approximately $1.33 million to suspend those collection
efforts and to enter into a formal negotiations process with the customs authority. The customs authority demanded 50% of
the total fine as a final settlement and seized additional funds of approximately $3.6 million. We have recorded a reserve in
the amount of the posted security. The matter was heard by the Supreme Court on February 26, 2015, and on March 26,
2015, that court set aside the judgment of the Ouargla Court of Appeals and remanded the case to that court for further
proceedings. A hearing was held on October 28, 2015 in the Ouargla Court of Appeals and on November 4, 2015, the court
affirmed the Supreme Court’s decision that we were not guilty. We have filed an application to the Conseil d’Etat in an effort
to recover amounts previously paid by us. A portion of those amounts has been returned, and our efforts to recover the
additional $4.4 million continue.
In March 2011, the Court of Ouargla entered a judgment of approximately $25.5 million (at June 30, 2016 exchange rates)
against us relating to alleged violations of Algeria’s foreign currency exchange controls, which require that goods and
services provided locally be invoiced and paid in local currency. The case relates to certain foreign currency payments
made to us by CEPSA, a Spanish operator, for wells drilled in 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the total contract amount
was paid offshore in foreign currency, and approximately $3.2 million was paid in local currency. The judgment includes
fines and penalties of approximately four times the amount at issue. We have appealed the ruling based on our
understanding that the law in question applies only to resident entities incorporated under Algerian law. An intermediate
court of appeals upheld the lower court’s ruling, and we appealed the matter to the Supreme Court. On September 25,
2014, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict against us, and the case was reheard by the Ouargla Court of Appeals on
March 22, 2015 in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion. On March 29, 2015, the Ouargla Court of Appeals reinstated the
initial judgment against us. We have appealed this decision again to the Supreme Court. While our payments were
consistent with our historical operations in the country, and, we believe, those of other multinational corporations there, as
well as interpretations of the law by the Central Bank of Algeria, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a loss of
up to $17.5 million in excess of amounts accrued.
In 2012, Nabors Global Holdings II Limited (“NGH2L”) signed a contract with ERG Resources, LLC (“ERG”) relating to the
sale of all of the Class A shares of NGH2L’s wholly owned subsidiary, Ramshorn International Limited, an oil and gas
exploration company.  When ERG failed to meet its closing obligations, NGH2L terminated the transaction on March 19,
2012 and, as contemplated in the agreement, retained ERG’s $3.0 million escrow deposit. ERG filed suit the following day
in the 61st Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, in a case styled ERG Resources, LLC v. Nabors Global Holdings
II Limited, Ramshorn International Limited, and Parex Resources, Inc.; Cause No. 2012-16446, seeking injunctive relief to
halt any sale of the shares to a third party, specifically naming as defendant Parex Resources, Inc. (“Parex”). The lawsuit
also seeks monetary damages of up to $750.0 million based on an alleged breach of contract by NGH2L and alleged
tortious interference with contractual relations by Parex. We successfully
15
Table of Contents
defeated ERG’s effort to obtain a temporary restraining order from the Texas court on March 20, 2012. We completed the
sale of Ramshorn’s Class A shares to a Parex affiliate in April 2012, which mooted ERG’s application for a temporary
injunction. The defendants made numerous jurisdictional challenges and on April 30, 2015, ERG filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the civil actions are currently subject to the bankruptcy stay
and the claims in the suit are assets of the estate. Nabors is monitoring the bankruptcy proceeding closely to determine how
it will affect the pending litigation. The lawsuit was stayed, pending further court actions, including appeals of the
jurisdictional decisions.  On June 17, 2016, the Texas Supreme Court issued it opinion on the jurisdictional appeal holding
that jurisdiction exists in Texas for Ramshorn, but not for Parex Bermuda or Parex Canada.  ERG retains its causes of
action for monetary damages, but we believe the claims are foreclosed by the terms of the agreement and are without
factual or legal merit. Although we are vigorously defending the lawsuit, its ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this
time.
On July 30, 2014, we and Red Lion, along with C&J Energy and its board of directors, were sued in a putative shareholder
class action filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”). The plaintiff alleges that the
members of the C&J Energy board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, and that Red
Lion and C&J Energy aided and abetted these alleged breaches. The plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendants from
proceeding with or consummating the Merger and the C&J Energy stockholder meeting for approval of the Merger and, to
the extent that the Merger was completed before any relief was granted, to have the Merger rescinded. On November 10,
2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, and, on November 24, 2014, the Court of Chancery entered a
bench ruling, followed by a written order on November 25, 2014, that (i) ordered certain members of the C&J Energy board
of directors to solicit for a 30 day period alternative proposals to purchase C&J Energy (or a controlling stake in C&J
Energy) that were superior to the Merger, and (ii) preliminarily enjoined C&J Energy from holding its stockholder meeting
until it complied with the foregoing. C&J Energy complied with the order while it simultaneously pursued an expedited
appeal of the Court of Chancery’s order to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Supreme Court”). On
December 19, 2014, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned the Court of Chancery’s judgment and vacated the order.
This case remains pending. Nabors and the C&J Energy defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a hearing was held April
26, 2016 and we await the Court’s ruling.  Preliminary settlement discussions are underway.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)
We are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as “off-balance sheet
arrangements” that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital
resources.  The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations under which
we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including
standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers’ compensation insurance
program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve
as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer
agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due
under our indemnification guarantees.
Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated
with any of these guarantees is remote. The following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees
issued by Nabors:

Note 8 Earnings (Losses) Per Share
ASC 260, Earnings per Share, requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings (losses) per share.  We
have granted and expect to continue to grant to employees restricted stock grants that contain nonforfeitable rights to
dividends.  Such grants are considered participating securities under ASC 260.  As such, we are required to include these
grants in the calculation of our basic earnings (losses) per share and calculate basic earnings (losses) per share using the
two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an earnings allocation formula that determines
earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and
participation rights in undistributed earnings.
Basic earnings (losses) per share is computed utilizing the two-class method and is calculated based on the weighted-
average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
Diluted earnings (losses) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the periods utilizing the two-class method for stock options and unvested restricted stock.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (losses) per share computations is as
follows:
BASIC EPS:
Net income (loss) (numerator):
Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax
Less: net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest
Less: (earnings) losses allocated to unvested shareholders
Numerator for basic earnings per share:
Adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax - basic
Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax
Weighted-average number of shares outstanding - basic
Earnings (losses) per share:
Basic from continuing operations
Basic from discontinued operations

For all periods presented, the computation of diluted earnings (losses) per share excludes outstanding stock options with
exercise prices greater than the average market price of Nabors’ common shares, because their inclusion would be anti-
dilutive and because they are not considered participating securities. For periods in which we experience a net loss from
continuing operations, all potential common shares have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares
outstanding, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The average number of options that were excluded from diluted
earnings (losses) per share that would potentially dilute earnings per share in the future were as follows:

In any period during which the average market price of Nabors’ common shares exceeds the exercise prices of these stock
options, such stock options will be included in our diluted earnings (losses) per share computation using the if-converted
method of accounting. Restricted stock is included in our basic and diluted earnings (losses) per share computation using
the two-class method of accounting in all periods because such stock is considered participating securities.

Note 10 Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $86.6 million and $75.7 million, respectively. These
assets consisted primarily of our oil and gas holdings which are mainly in the Horn River basin in western Canada of $78.5
million and $73.6 million as of the periods noted above and the operating results have been reflected in discontinued
operations. The remainder represents assets that meet the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale, but do not
represent a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has
or will have a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.
We have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and
processing regarding our oil and gas properties classified as discontinued operations.  At June 30, 2016, our undiscounted
contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $21.4 million and we had liabilities of $15.2 million, $5.6 million
of which were classified as current and were included in accrued liabilities.  At December 31, 2015, our undiscounted
contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $23.3 million and we had liabilities of $16.1 million, $5.2 million
of which were classified as current and were included in accrued liabilities. These amounts represent our best estimate of
the fair value of the excess capacity of the pipeline commitments calculated using a discounted cash flow model, when
considering our disposal plan, current production levels, natural gas prices and expected utilization of the pipeline over the
remaining contractual term.  Decreases in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to
excess pipeline commitments.
Discontinued Operations
Our condensed statements of income (loss) from discontinued operations were as follows:
Operating revenues (1)
Income (loss) from Oil & Gas discontinued operations:

(1)All periods present the operating activities of most of our wholly owned oil and gas businesses as discontinued
operations.
(2)Includes our other services comprised of our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig
instrumentation and software services.
(3)Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions.
(4)Adjusted operating income (loss) is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative
expenses, research and engineering expenses and depreciation and amortization from operating revenues. Adjusted
operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts
reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our operating segments and
the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss),
because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability and performance. In
addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze our
performance. Other companies in our industry may compute these measures differently. A reconciliation of this non-
GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided
in the above table.
(5)Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses, assets and capital
expenditures
(6)Represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis difference, of our unconsolidated affiliates
accounted for by the equity method including losses of $54.8 million and $221.9 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.8 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, related to
our share of the net loss of CJES, which we report on a one-quarter lag.
(7)Represents our investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, including our investment in CJES.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
We often discuss expectations regarding our future markets, demand for our products and services, and our performance in
our annual, quarterly and current reports, press releases, and other written and oral statements. Statements relating to
matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of
Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). These “forward-looking statements” are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and
economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and
actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this
document, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,”
“predict” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
You should consider the following key factors when evaluating these forward-looking statements:
·fluctuations and volatility in worldwide prices of and demand for oil and natural gas;
·fluctuations in levels of oil and natural gas exploration and development activities;
·fluctuations in the demand for our services;
·competitive and technological changes and other developments in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries;
·changes in the market value of and other events affecting our investments accounted for using the equity method of
accounting;
·our ability to complete, and realize the expected benefits of, strategic transactions;
·the existence of operating risks inherent in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries;
·the existence of operating risks inherent in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries;
·the possibility of changes in tax and other laws and regulations;
·the possibility of political or economic instability, civil disturbance, war or acts of terrorism in any of the countries in which
we do business; and
·general economic conditions, including the capital and credit markets.
The above description of risks and uncertainties is not all-inclusive, but highlights certain factors that we believe are
important for your consideration. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please refer to Part I, Item 1A. — Risk
Factors in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management Overview
This section is intended to help you understand our results of operations and our financial condition. This information is
provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and
the accompanying notes thereto.
We own and operate the world’s largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform,
workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Our Drilling & Rig Services business is
comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment
manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services. Our Drilling & Rig Services
business consists of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services.
On March 24, 2015, we completed the Merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy. In the
Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Service business was
35
Table of Contents
exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, CJES, and is now accounted for as an unconsolidated
affiliate as of the acquisition date. See further discussion in Note 3—Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. As a result of
the Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in
our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). CJES provides well construction, well completions, well support
and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America.
As we no longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion & Production Services business, our
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015 are not directly comparable to the six months ended June 30,
2016. On July 20, 2016, CJES voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
On May 24, 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia, our joint
venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The effects of the acquisition and the operating results of
Nabors Arabia are included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements beginning on the
acquisition date, and are reflected in our International drilling segment.
Financial Results
Operating revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $571.6 million, representing a decrease of $291.7
million, or 34%, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, and $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30,
2016, representing a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 49%, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss from
continuing operations and adjusted operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $186.6 million ($0.65
per diluted share) and $53.4 million, respectively, representing decreases of $144.7 million and $123.7 million,
respectively, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss from continuing operations and adjusted
operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $583.2 million ($2.06 per diluted share) and $107.2 million,
respectively, representing decreases of $665.7 million and $264.4 million, respectively, compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015.
Persistently low oil and gas prices have had a significant impact on the number of rigs working, particularly in the U.S. and
Canada although our International Drilling segment has also felt the effect. The decline in global oil prices, and the
extended duration of lower prices for both oil and gas, have resulted in dramatic reductions in capital spending on the part
of our customers. Together, these trends led to continued reductions in the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas
industries on a worldwide basis and had a corresponding adverse impact on our results of operations. In the U.S., our
customers' reaction to the decrease in commodity prices resulted in a roughly equal impact on both the number of rigs that
are working and the dayrates that we can obtain. We believe the U.S. market has started to stabilize, although we expect
our customers to react cautiously to the environment throughout the remainder of 2016 and into early 2017. Internationally,
spending cuts have resulted in lower activity levels, as reflected in a reduction in the number of rigs working and resulted in
lower operating results for the quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We anticipate activity levels to decline
further within the International Drilling segment throughout the remainder of 2016. Additionally, the Canada market's typical
seasonal uptick in the first quarter failed to materialize this year due to market conditions, which was further intensified this
quarter by the decline we normally see in the second quarter.

(3)Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions.
(4)Adjusted EBITDA is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative expenses and research
and engineering expenses from operating revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used
in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the
performance of our operating segments and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted
EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect our
ongoing profitability and performance. In addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the
metrics on which they analyze our performance. Other companies in our industry may compute these measures
differently. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes,
which is a GAAP measure, is provided in the above table.

GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided
in the above table.
(7)Represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis difference, of our unconsolidated affiliates
accounted for by the equity method, including losses of $54.8 million and $221.9 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.8 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, related to
our share of the net loss of CJES, which we report on a one-quarter lag.
(8)Excludes well-servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs
owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represent a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a
given period. For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarterly period represents 0.5 rig years.
(9)Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well-servicing rig fleet operated during the year. This fleet was
included in the Completion & Production Services business that was merged with C&J Energy in March 2015 and we
will therefore no longer report this performance metric.

U.S.
Our U.S. Drilling segment includes land drilling activities in the lower 48 states, Alaska and offshore operations in the Gulf
of Mexico.
Operating results decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015
periods primarily due to the continued decline in drilling activity in the lower 48 states, reflected by a 55% reduction in the
average number of rigs working during the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in our operating results
was primarily driven by lower customer demand for drilling rigs as well as generally lower day rates for rigs. Partially
offsetting the decrease in drilling activity was a favorable resolution of negotiations for one of our rigs in the Gulf of Mexico,
which resulted in partial recovery of standby revenues for past quarters.
Canada
Operating results decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015
periods due to a decline in both drilling rig activity and dayrates. These declines were the direct result of lower industry
activity and pricing pressure from customers resulting from the decline in oil and gas prices. The lower activity is evidenced
by a 57% reduction in rig years during the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, the Canadian dollar
weakened approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar year-over-year, which also negatively impacted margins, as both
revenues and expenses for this segment are denominated in Canadian dollars.

Table of Contents
International
Operating results decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015
periods primarily due to a decline in drilling activity, reflected by a 20% reduction in rig years during the second quarter of
2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in our operating results was primarily driven by additional pricing pressure and
diminished demand as customers released rigs in response to the significant drop in oil prices. Partially offsetting the
decrease in activity was an early termination payment received on a drilling contract in Kazakhstan.
Rig Services
Operating results decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015
periods primarily due to a broad-based decline in revenue-producing activities, including lower top drive and catwalk unit
sales as well as the continued decline in our directional drilling businesses due to generally lower drilling activity and
intense competition, all of which is driven by the current low prices of oil and gas.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
corresponding 2015 periods. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was partially attributable to the fact that
we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger,
which accounted for approximately $27.9 million of the decrease. The balance of the decrease was primarily attributable to
our recent efforts to achieve reductions in workforce as well as the continued cost-reduction efforts across our remaining
operating units and our corporate offices. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are
slightly higher in 2016 due to the reductions in revenues across all of our various operating units.
Research and engineering
Research and engineering expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
corresponding 2015 periods. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction
efforts across the various operating units. Also contributing to the decrease was the reduction in drilling related projects as a
result of the decline in overall activity.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 periods. The decrease for the
41
Table of Contents
six months ended June 30, 2016 was due primarily to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our
Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger, which accounted for $53.7 million of the decrease.
The remainder of the decrease primarily relates to an increased number of rigs on standby during the period, which results
in a lower inactive depreciation rate.
Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates
Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis
differences, of our equity method investments, primarily composed of our investment in CJES. We account for our
investment in CJES on a one-quarter lag. Accordingly, the six months ended June 30, 2016 includes our share of the net
income (loss) of CJES from October 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016, resulting in a loss of $221.9 million, inclusive of
charges of $138.5 million representing our share of CJES’s fixed asset impairment charges for the period. The operating
losses of CJES for each of the three months ended December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 are primarily due to reduced
activity levels resulting from the extended downturn in oil prices. On July 20, 2016, CJES voluntarily filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Interest expense
Interest expense was essentially flat during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding
2015 periods as our average outstanding debt balances remained consistent during each of these periods. In addition, we
have curtailed spending on major projects, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest recognized
during the period.
Investment income
Investment income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 included realized gains of $0.2 million and $0.6
million, respectively, attributable to interest and dividend income.
Investment income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 included realized gains of $1.1 million and $1.6
million, respectively, attributable to interest and dividend income.
Other expense (income), net
Other expense (income), net for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $74.6 million of expense, the majority of which,
or $42.9 million, is attributable to impairments associated with our CJES holdings. During the second quarter of 2016, we
determined our investment was other than temporarily impaired and recorded a charge of $39.0 million to write off the
remaining value of our investment. The balance of the impairment was attributable to professional fees incurred in
connection with defending our interests related to CJES filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on
July 20, 2016. Further contributing to the expense for the quarter were net losses on sales and disposals of assets of
approximately $28.7 million, inclusive of a $19.7 million charge related to a reserve for amounts associated with our
retained interest in the oil and gas properties located on the North Slope of Alaska, and foreign currency exchange losses
of approximately $2.8 million.
Other expense (income), net for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $257.0 million of expense. This was primarily
composed of impairments associated with our CJES holdings in the amount of $220.1 million resulting from declines in the
fair value of our investment including other than temporary impairment charges of $192.4 million and other charges
culminating from litigation expenses surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings and the reserve of certain other amounts
associated with our CJES holdings, including affiliate receivables of $27.7 million. Further contributing to the expense for
the period were net losses on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $34.0 million, inclusive of $22.4 million in
write downs to our oil and gas properties located on the North Slope of Alaska, and foreign currency exchange losses of
approximately $7.0 million, partially offset by a net gain on debt buybacks of approximately $6.0 million.
Other expense (income), net for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $1.3 million of expense, which included
increases to our litigation reserves of $2.1 million and foreign currency exchange losses of approximately $1.8 million.
These losses were partially offset by a $2.3 million gain associated with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Nabors
Arabia.

Table of Contents
Other expense (income), net for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $54.5 million of income, which included a net
gain of $52.6 million related to the Merger, decreases to our litigation reserves of $1.9 million and foreign currency
exchange gains of approximately $0.5 million. These gains were partially offset by net losses on sales and disposals of
assets of approximately $2.7 million.

The change in our worldwide effective tax rate during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
corresponding 2015 period was attributable to the effect of the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings (losses), including
greater losses in high-tax jurisdictions. Further contributing to the change was an impairment to our CJES holdings as well
as our share of the net loss of CJES during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was attributable to the effect of the geographic mix of pre-
tax earnings (losses), along with the cumulative impact to the effective tax rate of our change in the annual forecasted
amount of pre-tax earnings (losses), including the forecast of greater losses in high-tax jurisdictions.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $86.6 million and $75.7 million, respectively. These
assets consisted primarily of our oil and gas holdings which are mainly in the Horn River basin in western Canada of $78.5
million and $73.6 million as of the periods noted above and the operating results have been reflected in discontinued
operations. The remainder represents assets that meet the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale, but do not
represent a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has
or will have a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.
We have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and
processing regarding our oil and gas properties classified as discontinued operations.  At June 30, 2016, our undiscounted
contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $21.4 million and we had liabilities of $15.2 million, $5.6 million
of which were classified as current and were included in accrued liabilities.  At December 31, 2015, our undiscounted
contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $23.3 million and we had liabilities of $16.1 million, $5.2 million
of which were classified as current and were included in accrued liabilities. These amounts represent our best estimate of
the fair value of the excess capacity of the pipeline commitments calculated using a discounted cash flow model, when
considering our disposal plan, current production levels, natural gas prices and expected utilization of the pipeline over the
remaining contractual term.  Decreases in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to
excess pipeline commitments.
The amounts at each balance sheet date represented our best estimate of the fair value of the excess capacity of the

in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to excess pipeline commitments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and
sales of investments, as well as issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and
are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. We discuss our cash flows for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 below.
Operating Activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $336.7 million during the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $517.4 million during the corresponding 2015 period. Operating cash flows are our primary source of
capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the same as those that impact net
earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, impairments, share-based
compensation, deferred income taxes and our proportionate share of earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates. Net
income (loss) adjusted for non-cash components was approximately $222.2 million and $578.8 million during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decline is primarily due to reduced operating results in the U.S.,
Canada and International drilling segments. Additionally, changes in working capital items such as collection of
receivables, other deferred revenue arrangements and payments of operating payables are significant factors affecting
operating cash flows. Changes in working capital items provided $114.4 million and used $61.4 million in cash during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Investing Activities.  Net cash used for investing activities totaled $179.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to net cash provided of $62.4 million during the corresponding 2015 period. Our primary use of cash for investing
activities is for capital expenditures related to rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as
sustaining capital expenditures. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we used cash for capital
expenditures totaling $193.2 million and $566.7 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we
received net proceeds related to the Merger of $660.1 million.
Financing Activities.  Net cash used for financing activities totaled $178.4 million during the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $639.2 million during the corresponding 2015 period. This was primarily due to the repurchase of $148.0
million in long-term debt coupled with the payment of $16.9 million in dividends to shareholders.
Future Cash Requirements
We expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to be less than $0.5 billion, unless the current oil price environment
improves. Purchase commitments outstanding at June 30, 2016 totaled approximately $142.1 million, primarily for rig-
related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures, other operating
expenses and purchases of inventory. We can reduce planned expenditures if necessary or increase them if market
conditions and new business opportunities warrant it. The level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our
expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months represent a number of capital programs that are currently
underway or planned. These programs will result in an expansion in the number of land drilling rigs, upgrades
44
Table of Contents
to our offshore rigs and additions to the technology assets that we own and operate. In light of the prolonged decline in
crude oil prices, we have already undertaken many cost cutting initiatives in an effort to minimize the negative impact to our
business. We have undertaken efforts to reduce capital expenditures, operating costs and administrative expenses. Since
the last downturn in 2009, we have strengthened our financial flexibility by streamlining operations, shedding non-core
businesses and reducing net debt and interest expense.
We have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or
businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of debt or our
common shares. Future acquisitions may be funded using existing cash or by issuing debt or additional shares of our stock.
Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors.
See our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows in future periods included below under “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)”.
There have been no material changes to the contractual cash obligations table that was included in our 2015 Annual
Report.
On August 25, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “program”) under which we may
repurchase, from time to time, up to $400 million of our common shares by various means, including in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to
repurchase any of our common shares. Through June 30, 2016, we repurchased 10.9 million of our common shares for
approximately $101.3 million under this program. As of June 30, 2016, the remaining amount authorized under the program
that may be used to purchase shares was $298.7 million.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for
equity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or
exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Financial Condition and Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and investments, availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial
paper program, and cash generated from operations. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and short-term investments of
$255.9 million and working capital of $0.3 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and short-term investments of
$274.6 million and working capital of $0.5 billion. At June 30, 2016, we had $2.24 billion of availability remaining under our
$2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.
We had 11 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of June 30, 2016. Availability under these facilities as of June 30,
2016 was as follows:

Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt
ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access these
markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future, we believe
that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligation that
might arise upon exchange or purchase of our notes and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash
obligations, would not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. A ratings downgrade
could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially
require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.

Our gross debt to capital ratio was 0.49:1 as of June 30, 2016 and 0.46:1 as of December 31, 2015. Our net debt to capital
ratio was 0.47:1 as of June 30, 2016 and 0.44:1 as of December 31, 2015. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by
dividing (x) total debt by (y) total capital. Total capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders’ equity. Net debt is defined
as total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Neither the gross debt to capital ratio
nor the net debt to capital ratio is a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Our interest coverage ratio was 4.4:1 as of June 30, 2016 and 6.2:1 as of December 31, 2015. The interest coverage ratio is
a trailing 12-month quotient of the sum of (x) adjusted EBITDA divided by (y) interest expense. The interest coverage ratio is
not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures presented by other companies.
Our current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations, possible dispositions of non-core assets, revolving
credit facility and commercial paper program are expected to adequately finance our operations, purchase commitments,
capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the
next 12 months.

will require recognition of revenue to represent the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration, including costs incurred, to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall, relating to the recognition and
measurement of financial assets and liabilities. This standard enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which
includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. This guidance is
effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, relating to leases to increase transparency and
comparability among companies. This standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on
the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. Additionally, this standard will require disclosures designed to give
financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This
guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is
permitted. This standard requires an entity to separate lease components from nonlease components within a contract.
While the lease components would be accounted for under ASU No. 2016-02, nonlease components would be accounted
for under ASU No. 2014-09. Therefore, we are evaluating ASU No. 2016-02 concurrently with the provisions of ASU No.
2014-09 and the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to simplify the
transition to the equity method of accounting. This standard eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity
method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Instead, the equity
method investor should add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s
previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for the equity
method of accounting. This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation, to simplify the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for public

companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact this will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)
We are a party to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as “off-balance sheet arrangements”
that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The
most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations under which we provide
financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby
letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers’ compensation insurance program
and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as
guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by us to our share transfer agent and
our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our
indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur
any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.
The following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors:

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We may be exposed to market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as
discussed in our 2015 Annual Report.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We have investments in certain unconsolidated entities that we do not control or
manage. Because we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to these
entities are necessarily more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Nabors and its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of
business. We estimate the range of our liability related to pending litigation when we believe the amount and range of loss
can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. When a liability is probable
and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related
to the lawsuits or claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our
pending litigation and claims and revise our estimates. Due to uncertainties related to the resolution of lawsuits and claims,
the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates. For matters where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and
significant, we disclose the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at
the time of disclosure. In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided, our ultimate exposure with
respect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our condensed
consolidated financial position or cash flows, although they could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations for a particular reporting period. See Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies for a description of such
proceedings.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this report, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2015
Annual Report should be carefully considered when evaluating us. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional
risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
We withheld the following shares of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with grants of
stock awards during the three months ended June 30, 2016 from the distributions described below. These shares may be
deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item, but were not purchased
as part of a publicly announced program to purchase common shares:

(1)Shares were withheld from employees and directors to satisfy certain tax withholding obligations due in connection with
grants of stock under our 2003 Employee Stock Plan and 2013 Stock Plan. The 2013 Stock Plan, 2003 Employee Stock
Plan and 1999 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors provide for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax
obligations, but do not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. These shares were
not purchased as part of a publicly announced program to purchase common shares.
(2)In August 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to
$400 million of our common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Through June 30, 2016,
we repurchased 10.9 million of our common shares for approximately $101.3 million under this program. As of June 30,
2016, we had $298.7 million that remained authorized under the program that may be used to purchase shares.
