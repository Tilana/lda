ITEM 1: BUSINESS
History and General Development of our Business
PART I
The Company was incorporated as Equinox International, Inc. on November 5, 2008 in the state of Nevada. Originally, the Company
planned to commence operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in North America. However, as previously
reported,  on  May  5,  2010,  with  the  goal  of  becoming  a  marketing  and  licensing  company  that  would  market  certain  regenerative
medical  procedures  and  products  and  license  its  brand  and  technologies  to  a  network  of  medical  providers  (who  would,  in  turn,
provide medical procedures to their patients based on the Company’s technologies), the Company acquired from Biostem US LLC, a
privately  held  Florida  limited  liability  company  (the  “LLC”),  certain  assets  (the  “Acquired  Assets”)  related  to  hair  transplant
procedures (the “Asset Transfer”). Specifically, the Acquired Assets consists of a hair transplant process and protocols known as the
“Biostem Method” that involves the injection of autologous platelet rich plasma containing stem cells from the patient to the scalp of
the  patient  in  combination  with  an  oral  nutriceutical  and  the  concomitant  use  of  low-level  laser  therapy,  which  combination  the
Company believes helps support the healing of transplanted area and increases the success of the hair transplant surgery.

Prior  to  the  Asset  Transfer,  Biostem  US  LLC  acquired  the  Biostem  Method  from  Dr.  Markou,  who  owns  and  operates  a  hair
restoration medical clinic in Clearwater, FL, which he operates as Markou Medical, P.A. Prior to the Asset Transfer, Dr. Markou
provided many procedures for his patients at his clinic, including (but not limited to) hair transplants based upon the Biostem Method.
Since the Asset Transfer, Dr. Markou continues to provide many procedures at his clinic, including (but not limited to) hair transplants
based upon the Biostem Method. However, since the Asset Transfer, any hair transplants that he conducts based upon the Biostem
Method are pursuant to a medical affiliate arrangement between Dr. Markou and the Company, pursuant to which the Company grants
Dr. Markou the right to use the processes and protocols related to the Biostem Method, as well as the Biostem tradename, and markets
the hair transplant procedure on Dr. Markou’s behalf, and, in consideration thereof, Dr. Markou pays to the Company licensing and
marketing fees ranging from $400 to $500 per hair transplant depending on the number of grafts in such transplant. Pursuant to the
medical  affiliate  agreement,  all  hair  transplants  and  related  procedures  are  to  be  provided  by  Dr.  Markou  (or  other  medical
professionals under his supervisions), through his clinic and under his supervision, and to his patients. The agreement does not prevent
Dr. Markou from providing other procedures at his clinic, and Dr. Markou does not pay the Company any licensing or marketing fees
for these other procedures.  The Company does not provide hair transplants or practice medicine or manage Dr. Markou’s practice, but
instead  licenses  the  Biostem  Method  and  name  to  Dr.  Markou  and  provides  marketing  (including  radio,  television  and  internet
campaigns) relating the Biostem Method to help drive patients to Dr. Markou’s practice.
 
During the year ended February 29, 2012, Dr. Markou was the Company’s only medical affiliate. Dr. Markou terminated his written
contract with the Company. However, the Company believes that Dr. Markou will continue to accept referrals from the Company on a
case by case basis. Furthermore, the Company plans to enter into arrangements with other medical providers and to grow its affiliate
network  throughout  the  country  and  eventually  in  international  markets  as  well.  The  Company  will  not  provide  any  medical
procedures directly, including hair transplants, but instead through a network of qualified medical providers, such as Dr. Markou, who
will perform the medical procedures on their patients, using the Company’s protocols and procedures. It is expected that each such
affiliated medical provider, will, among other things: (1) be granted the right to use the Company’s procedures, protocols and trade
names and the right to hold itself out as a Biostem provider; (2) receive certain training and ongoing support regarding the Company’s
procedure and protocols; (3) be supplied with certain support products, lasers and other equipment necessary to undertake the medical
procedures  using  the  Company’s  procedures  and  protocols;  and  (4)  receive  the  benefit  of  the  Company’s  marketing  efforts.  In
consideration thereof, the affiliated medical providers will pay to the Company certain licensing, marketing and leasing fees. For the
reasons discuss below, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful at increasing its network of affiliated medical
providers.
 
The Company did not acquire any tangible assets from Biostem US LLC or Dr. Markou, only the intangible assets related to the
Biostem Method and name.
 
In consideration for the Acquired Assets, the Company, at the direction of the LLC, issued 244,800,000 shares of common stock to the
11  owners  of  the  Biostem  US  LLC,  which  resulted  in  the  change  of  control  of  the  Company,  as  the  owners  of  the  LLC  owned
approximately 95% of the 300,480,000 shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately after the Asset Transfer. As the
seller of the Acquired Assets retained control of the assets through their control of the Company, the Acquired Assets were recorded at
the seller’s basis of $0.
 
In  connection  with  the Asset  Transfer,  effective  May  5,  2010,  the  Company  changed  its  name  to  Biostem  U.S.  Corporation  and
increased its authorized stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. On April 27, 2012 the Company the
Company undertook a three for one stock split and increased its authorized shares to 600,000,000.

Since the Asset Transfer, the Company has discontinued its former oil and gas business and instead has begun to pursue its marketing
and  licensing  business  focused  on  regenerative  medicine.  To  this  end,  in  June,  2011,  the  Company  hired  a  new  Chief  Executive
Officer, Dwight Brunoehler, and appointed a new board of directors. Mr. Brunoehler devotes substantially all of his business time and
efforts to the Company. Among other things, since being hired, Mr. Brunoehler has reviewed the Company’s systems, protocols and
processes and renegotiated the Company’s agreements with its former management. As a result, 144,159,144 shares issued as part of
the Asset Transfer have been returned to the Company and cancelled.
 
As  a  result  of  the  forgoing  review  of  the  Company’s  protocols  and  processes  related  to  the  Biostem  Method,  the  Company  has
concluded that while the Biostem Method, in the form acquired by the Company, is effective and achieves positive results in hair
transplants, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to patent the current Biostem Method protocols and procedures because, while
the current Biostem Method is a unique arrangement and conglomeration of several discrete procedures (such as the use of low-level
laser treatments and PRP injections to the affected scalp areas), no individual procedure is novel and each has previously been used in
hair transplant procedures. As a result, the Company does not believe it can patent the Biostem Method in its current form and that it
may not be able to prevent others from using the same or similar protocols and procedures for hair transplants. In such a case, the
Company’s ability to develop a significant network of medical affiliates and its ability to charge those affiliates appropriate marketing
and licensing fees could be materially negatively impacted. The Company believes its success in (a) developing a robust network of
medical  affiliates,  (b)  developing  brand  recognition  for  Biostem  services  and  products  and  (c)  its  ability  grow  its  regenerative
medicine  business  depends,  in  part,  on  the  value,  uniqueness,  protectability  and  effectiveness  of  its  processes,  procedures  and
knowhow. As such, the Company is pursuing additional protocols and procedures that could be incorporated into the Biostem Method
that would not only continue to improve its effectiveness in hair transplants and other regenerative procedures, but that also would
make it unique and exclusive to the Company, thus allowing it to patent and protect its proprietary property. Until such time, so that
the Company can conserve cash and focus on so improving its protocols and procedures, the Company has chosen to suspend its
marketing efforts and its efforts to expand its medical affiliate network.
 
The Company’s officers and directors have been involved in private negotiations with certain foreign hair-transplant clinics interested
in licensing the Company’s current hair-transplant protocols and procedures. There can be no assurances that these foreign licenses
will ever come to fruition.
 
Until a patent is issued, the Company has been informed that its original Biostem Method can most effectively be protected with
confidentiality and other appropriate agreements. The Company has entered into confidentiality or other similar agreements with each
of its material suppliers and the other parties who, to its knowledge, have had access to its protocols and procedures, and it intends to
continue  to  enter  into  such  agreements  when  appropriate  and  necessary  to  protect  its  confidential  information.  Furthermore,  the
Company intends to file applications to register its trademark (Biostem) and any new protocols and procedures as they are developed
and as cash flow allows.

Most of the Company’s products purchased during this period were purchased by Dr. Markou’s patients. In the future, the Company
hopes to generate revenues both through direct sales of products to consumers and from sales made through its medical affiliates, as
well as from licensing, marketing and leasing fees charged to its medical affiliates. However, until the Company resumes its marketing
efforts, including through radio, television and internet campaigns, it expects its sales to remain small and to be limited to the sale of
products primarily through its website.
 
In addition to expanding and improving its hair treatment protocols and procedures, the Company also currently is working on (a)
studying, exploring and pursuing other regenerative medicine opportunities, (b) protecting its intellectual property through trademark
and  patent  registrations  and  (c)  negotiating  the  potential  acquisition  of  a  non-U.S.  healthcare  company  in  the  stem  cell  sciences
business.  If  the  Company  is  successful  with  the  forgoing  objectives,  the  changes  to  its  current  products  and  services  could  be
significant since not only will it have improved its existing products and services, but broadened its product and service offering.
 
The  other  regenerative  medicine  opportunities  the  Company  is  exploring  include  the  use  of  nano-technology  in  hair  transplant
procedures  and  the  use  of  autologous  platelet  rich  plasma  containing  stem  cells  for  joint  and  ligament  repair.  To  the  Company’s
knowledge, written protocols applying these technologies to these uses do not yet exist. The Company currently is negotiating with an
R&D laboratory associated with a U.S. university to undertake the testing necessary to enable the Company (using its internal staff
and  resources  as  well  as  the  assistance  of  the  laboratory)  to  develop  written  protocols  to  put  this  technology  to  use  in  practical
applications for hair transplants and joint and ligament injections. The forgoing testing is not a clinical trial and the Company is not
currently  undertaking  any  clinical  trials,  including  any  that  would  require  FDA  approval.  The  Company  may  license  certain
technology from the R&D lab associated with the forgoing university and the parties are in discussion regarding the terms of any such
license. The Company intends to pay for the referenced license either with stock of the Company, cash or a combination of both. Any
such cash used in this regard is included in the estimate-we anticipate requiring in the next 12 months, as discussed further below.
There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in bringing these applications to market.
 
The Biostem Method does not require FDA approval and doctors providing hair transplants using the Biostem Method do not require
FDA approval to provide such procedures. Furthermore, the Company does not intend, at this time, to license to medical affiliates or
to develop or otherwise pursue any products or services that require FDA approval.
 
To assist the Company with the forgoing business plans and objectives, on July 14, 2011, the Company entered into a Consulting
Agreement with NVO, LLC, a California limited liability company, pursuant to which NVO will assist the Company with its business
objectives,  including  (i)  identifying,  analyzing,  structuring  and/or  negotiating  business  sales  and/or  acquisitions,  (ii)  assisting  the
Company  in  its  corporate  strategies,  (iii)  assisting  the  Company  in  the  implementation  of  its  business  plan,  and  (iv)  assisting  the
Company in the negotiation, documentation and closing of strategic alliances, partnerships and joint ventures. In consideration thereof,
the Company is making certain cash payments to NVO and issued 12,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to NVO which vests
at 500,000 shares per month.

The Company has depleted its cash and will require significant additional financing to achieve it business plans and objectives. Over
the next 12 months, the Company anticipates it will require approximately $2,000,000 for operations and business expansion. The
Company’s ability to effectuate its business plans and objectives are subject to various risks. See “Risk Factors.”

ITEM  7:  MANAGEMENTS  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANICAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF
OPERATION
 
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated as Equinox International, Inc. on November 5, 2008, in the state of Nevada. Since inception, the
Company has been in the development stage as defined under Statement on Accounting Standards Codification No.915, Development
Stage Enterprises (“ASC 915-15”) with a plan to commence operations in oil & gas exploration and production industry in North
America.
The Company’s name was changed to “Biostem U.S. Corporation” on May 5, 2010, in furtherance of a transaction consummated on
May 11, 2010, pursuant to which control of the Company was acquired by the members of Biostem US L.L.C. (Biostem LLC”), a
Florida  limited  liability  company,  pursuant  to  an Asset  Purchase Agreement  between  the  Company  and  Biostem  LLC,  and  under
which the Company acquired certain Biostem medical technology from Biostem LLC.
As  a  consequence  of  such  control  change,  the  Company  discontinued  its  former  oil  and  gas  business  and  instead  is  pursuing
commercial exploitation of the biotechnology acquired from Biostem LLC.
The Company has not been a party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding at any time since inception of the Company.
The  Company’s  involvement  in  biotechnology  commenced  on  May  11,  2010,  as  a  result  of  its  acquisition  from  Biostem  LLC  of
certain proprietary technology and processes that have proven successful in human hair regeneration and other medical treatments.
The goal of the Company is to develop a worldwide network of affiliations with existing medical practitioners throughout the world
that  would  benefit  from  introducing  the  Company’s  technology  and  proprietary  processes  into  their  treatment  methodologies. The
Company’s  principal  treatment  technology  utilizes  a  patient’s  own  stem  cells,  extracted  from  the  patient’s  blood,  to  assist  in  the
regeneration of hair on the patient’s scalp.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, the Company’s most significant change in liquidity or capital resources or stockholders’ equity has been receipts of
proceeds  from  offerings  of  its  capital  stock.  However,  the  Company’s  balance  sheet  as  of  February  29,  2012  reflects  greatly
diminished assets increased liabilities from the previous year principally from increased general and administrative costs.  An increase
expenses  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  Company’s  liquidity  and  the  Company  will  not  be  able  to  fund  itself  without  outside
sources of capital.

The Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Elco Securities Ltd. (“Elco”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to
sell to Elco, and Elco agreed to purchase from the Company, 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company for an aggregate
purchase price of $5,000,000, which amount is payable in six equal monthly installments. The stock purchase agreement provides that
the closing of the forgoing transaction will occur on July 1, 2012 or at such other time as the parties may agree.
 
There is no assurance the Company will be able to obtain additional financing in the future. In the past, officers and directors of the
Company have lent or advanced monies to the Company to fund operations, there are no formal agreements or arrangements for them
to continue to do so.
The  Company  anticipates  expanding  its  business  in  2012.  The  Company’s  plans  may  be  limited  by  its  ability  to  finance  such  a
proposed expansion of its business.  If the revenues are not generated sufficient to finance continued operations, then the Company
will have to scale back its proposed operations.  The Company’s ultimate success will be based upon whether or not there continues to
be a demand for the services that the Company anticipates providing, which is also very dependent on the economy.  There can be no
assurance  that  there  will  be  a  demand  for  the  Company’s  services  in  the  future  or  that  the  Company  will  become  profitable  in
providing these services.
At February 29, 2012, the Company had negative working capital of $74,414 which consisted of current assets of $15,904 and current
liabilities of $90,318. The current liabilities of the Company are composed primarily of accounts payable and accrued expenses of

$195,901 for the same period in 2011. This represents a negative change of $550,170. The primary factor for the change was due to

the year ended February 29, 2012.The stock based compensation was paid to an officer of the company as part of his contract and a

financing it expects to receive from it sale of stock will be sufficient to carry out its business plan. The Company may need additional

ITEM 9A: DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 9A includes information concerning the
controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management,  including  the  Principal  Executive  Officer  and  the  Principal  Financial  Officer,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding
required disclosures.

In  connection  with  the  preparation  of  this  report,  our  management,  under  the  supervision  and  with  participation  of  our  Principal
Executive  Officer  and  Principal  Financial  Officer  (the  “Certifying  Officers”)  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 29, 2012. Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that there is a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. The material weakness
results  from  a  lack  of  written  procedures  which  effectively  documents  the  proper  procedures  and  descriptions  of  the  duties  of  all
persons involved in the disclosure controls of the Company. The Company hopes to implement plans to document the procedures and
internal controls of the Company. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in disclosure control
over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim
financial  statements  will  not  be  prevented  or  detected  on  a  timely  basis.  This  does  not  include  an  evaluation  by  the  Company’s
registered public accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
 
We have not made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report
on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined  in  Rules 13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  system  was  designed  to  provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes,  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  due  to  change  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or
procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as  of  February  29,  2012.  The  Company’s  management  based  its  evaluation  on  criteria  set  forth  in  the  framework  in  Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of theTreadway Commission. Based on that
assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of February
29, 2012.Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The primary factors contributing to the material weakness, which relates to our financial
statement close process, were:
compensation
• Lack of proper segregation of duties due to limited personnel
 
• Lack  of  a  formal  review  process  that  includes  multiple  levels  of  review,  resulting  in  adjustments  related  to  shared  based
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
Biostem U.S. Corporation
Clearwater, FL
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Biostem U.S. Corporation (“Biostem”, “we”,  “our”, or the “Company”) as of
February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for
the  years  then  ended  February  29,  2012  and  February  28,  2011.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  Biostem’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial  reporting.  Our  audits  included  consideration  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit
procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Biostem as of
February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Biostem will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 1 to the financial statements, Biostem has suffered recurring losses from operations, which raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS and GOING CONCERN
 
Biostem US Corp. (“we”, “our”, or, “the Company”) was incorporated as Equinox International, Inc. on November 5, 2008 in the state
of Nevada. Originally, the Company planned to commence operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in North
America. However, as previously reported, on May 5, 2010, with the goal of becoming a marketing and licensing company that would
market certain regenerative medical procedures and products and license its brand and technologies to a network of medical providers
(who would, in turn, provide medical procedures to their patients based on the Company’s technologies), the Company acquired from
Biostem US LLC, a privately held Florida limited liability company (the “LLC”), certain assets (the “Acquired Assets”) related to hair
transplant  procedures  (the  “Asset Transfer”).  Specifically,  the Acquired Assets  consists  of  a  hair  transplant  process  and  protocols
known as the “Biostem Method” that involves the injection of autologous platelet rich plasma containing stem cells from the patient to
the  scalp  of  the  patient  in  combination  with  an  oral  nutriceutical  and  the  concomitant  use  of  low-level  laser  therapy,  which
combination  the  Company  believes  helps  support  the  healing  of  transplanted  area  and  increases  the  success  of  the  hair  transplant
surgery.
 
Going Concern
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Biostem has an accumulated deficit of $3,546,238 as of February 29, 2012 and
incurred a net loss of $3,337,419 for the year ended February 29, 2012. Unless profitability and increases in stockholders’ equity
continues,  these  conditions  raise  substantial  doubt  as  to  Biostem’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern. The  February  29,  2012
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Biostem is unable to continue as a going concern.
Biostem continues to review its expense structure reviewing costs and their reduction to move towards profitability. The Company’s
expenses are planned to decrease as a percent of revenue resulting in profitability and increased shareholders’ equity.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-6
Source: BIOSTEM U.S. CORP, 10-K, June 01, 2012
Powered by Morningstar® Document Research℠
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Biostem considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Revenue Recognition
Biostem’s  revenue  is  recognized  pursuant  to  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”) Accounting  Standards  Codification
(“ASC”) 605 “Revenue Recognition.” The Company recognizes its revenue from services after the services have been performed and
the payment has been received.  Biostem also sells products to its clients and the revenue is recognized at the point of sale when the
product is given to the client and the payment is made by the client.
 
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
Basic  and  diluted  net  loss  per  share  calculations  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares
outstanding during the year. They include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income. Basic and diluted
net income per share is the same due to the absence of common stock equivalents and the fact that the Company generated net losses
during the years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011.
 
Income Taxes
Biostem recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered.
Biostem provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more
likely than not.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value method.
Accordingly, share-based compensation is measured at grant or vesting date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as
expense  over  the  requisite  employee  service  period.  The  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  share-based  payments  using  the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and the closing price of the Company’s common stock for common
share issuances.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Biostem does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on their financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3 – ADVANCES
A former director advanced the Company money for operating expenses during fiscal year 2011. The director has resigned due to the
change in control of the Company and is no longer a related party. As of February 29, 2012, the outstanding balance due on this
advance was $7,164. The advance is unsecured, bears no interest and is due on demand.
NOTE 4 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
On May 11, 2010 the Company issued 244,800,000 at $0.001 per share for a value of $244,800 for the acquisition of intellectual
property  in  a  share  exchange  agreement.  Due  to  the  seller  of  the  intellectual  property  retaining  control  of  the  assets  through  their
control of the Company, the assets were recorded at the seller’s basis of $0.
On September 23, 2010 the Company issued 48,000,000 shares of common stock to two officers and directors of the company to
reduce advances by officers of $40,000 which was accounted for as contributed capital.
On October 20, 2010 the Company issued 12,000,000 shares of common stock for $400,000 cash.
On June 11, 2011, the Company entered into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and issued
19,200,000 shares to the CEO per his agreement. The shares issued are vested over a 36-month period beginning on June 11, 2011 at
the rate of 533,333 shares per month. The issued shares have full voting rights. The Company recognized compensation expense in the
amount of $1,199,600 as of February 29, 2012 in connection with such share issuance. As of February 29, 2012, 14,400,000 shares
have not been vested and company has unrecognized expense of $3,600,400 to be amortized over the next 27-month period.
On July 14, 2011, the Company entered into a Consulting Agreement with NVO, LLC, and issued 12,000,000 shares of restricted
common  stock  to  NVO  3,000,000  of  which  vested  immediately  on  July  14,  2011  and  the  balance  of  which  vests  in  18  monthly
installments of 500,000 commencing on January 14, 2012. The 3,000,000 shares which vested on July 14, 2011 were measured and
recognized as expense during the quarter ending August 31, 2011, The remaining 9,000,000 shares will be measured and expensed at
the completion of each month during the remaining 18-month vesting period based on the price of the Company’s stock price during

operating loss and tax credit carryforward and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary
differences  are  the  differences  between  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  tax  bases.  Deferred  tax  assets  are
reduced  by  a  valuation  allowance  when,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  some  portion  or  all  of  the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.

Company  planned  to  commence  operations  in  the  oil  and  gas  exploration  and
production industry in NorthAmerica. However, as previously reported, on May
5,  2010,  with  the  goal  of  becoming  a  marketing  and  licensing  company  that
wouldmarket certain regenerative medical procedures and products and license its
brand  and  technologies  to  a  network  of  medical  providers(who  would,  in  turn,
provide  medical  procedures 
the  Company’s
technologies),  the  Company  acquiredfrom  Biostem  US  LLC,  a  privately  held
Florida 
(the
“AcquiredAssets”)  related  to  hair  transplant  procedures  (the  “Asset  Transfer”).
Specifically,  the  Acquired  Assets  consistsof  a  hair  transplant  process  and
protocols  known  as  the  “Biostem  Method”  that  involves  the  injection  of
autologousplatelet rich plasma containing stem cells from the patient to the scalp
of the patient in combination with an oral nutriceuticaland the concomitant use of
low-level laser therapy, which combination the Company believes helps support
the  healing  of  transplantedarea  and  increases  the  success  of  the  hair  transplant
surgery.
 
Going Concern
 
As shown in the accompanying financialstatements, Biostem has an accumulated
deficit  of  $3,546,238  as  of  February  29,  2012  and  incurred  a  net  loss  of
$3,337,419  forthe  year  ended  February  29,  2012.  Unless  profitability  and
increases  in  stockholders’  equity  continues,  these  conditionsraise  substantial
doubt as to Biostem’s ability to continue as a going concern. The February 29,
2012 financial statementsdo not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if Biostem is unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Biostem  continues  to  review  its  expensestructure  reviewing  costs  and  their
reduction to move towards profitability. The Company’s expenses are planned to
decreaseas  a  percent  of  revenue  resulting  in  profitability  and  increased
shareholders’ equity.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
12 Months Ended

Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statementsin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimatesand assumptions that affect the reported
amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  balance  sheet.  Actual  results  coulddiffer  from  those
estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Biostem considers all highly liquidinvestments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Biostem’srevenue  is  recognized  pursuant  to  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
(“FASB”)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (“ASC”)605  “Revenue  Recognition.”
The  Company  recognizes  its  revenue  from  services  after  the  services  have  been
performedand the payment has been received.  Biostem also sells products to its clients
and the revenue is recognized at the pointof sale when the product is given to the client
and the payment is made by the client. 
 
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
 
Basic and diluted net loss per sharecalculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. They includethe dilutive effect of common stock equivalents
in years with net income. Basic and diluted net income per share is the same dueto the absence of common
stock  equivalents  and  the  fact  that  the  Company  generated  net  losses  during  the  years  ended  February
29,2012 and February 28, 2011.
 
Income Taxes
 
Biostem recognizes deferred tax assetsand liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enactedtax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
when the differences are expected to be recovered. Biostem provides a valuationallowance for deferred tax
assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
The  Company  adopted  the  provisions  ofASC  718  requiring  employee  equity  awards  to  be  accounted  for
under the fair value method. Accordingly, share-based compensationis measured at grant or vesting date,
based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite employeeservice period.
The  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  share-based  payments  using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing
model for commonstock options and the closing price of the Company’s common stock for common share
issuances.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
Biostem does not expect the adoptionof any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant
impact on their financial position, results of operationsor cash flows.
