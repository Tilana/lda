</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate on the situation of human rights in Myanmar was 
established in 1992 by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1992/581 and 
extended in resolution 2005/10.  
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur is expected to be reviewed by the Human Rights 
Council at its seventh session. The present report, submitted in accordance with Council 
resolution 5/1, covers the period from February 2007 to February 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. Since his nomination in December 2000, the Special Rapporteur has been authorized by 
the Government of Myanmar to visit the country seven times. Between November 2003 and 
November 2007, the Government did not allow the Special Rapporteur to conduct missions to 
Myanmar. Following the special session of the Council on 2 October 2007, the Special 
Rapporteur was invited by the Government to conduct a 5-day fact-finding mission to Myanmar 
in November 2007. His findings were reported to the Council (A/HRC/6/14).  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he was not permitted to return to Myanmar for a 
follow-up mission, as was requested by the Council.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur continued to discharge his mandate to the best of his ability on the 
basis of information on grave violations of human rights collected from a variety of independent, 
reliable sources. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges receipt of the responses concerning the 
situation of a number of detainees. He would also like to point out that the absence of substantive 
responses to the majority of his and other special procedures mandate-holders&#8217; communications 
makes it difficult for him to discern a genuine commitment on the part of the Government to 
address these human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur continued to have regular contacts with the Permanent Missions 
of Myanmar to the United Nations at Geneva and New York. He held consultations with 
representatives of Member States, officials of United Nations agencies and programmes, 
representatives of civil society organizations and members of the academic community. He 
presented his annual report (A/62/223) to the General Assembly in New York on 
14 October 2007. He also shared his findings and had regular contacts with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Executive Office of the Secretary-General, the 
Department of Political Affairs, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar, 
Ibrahim Gambari, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and 
Armed Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the 
appointment of the special envoy on Myanmar of the European Union, Piero Fassino, with 
whom he met following his appointment.  
</p>
<p>7. From 11 to 15 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur visited Myanmar at the invitation 
of the Government, pursuant to Council resolution S-5/1. His report on that visit (A/HRC/6/14) 
was submitted separately to the Council in November 2007. On 16 and 17 November 2007, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur held consultations in Bangkok with, inter alia, the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs of Thailand, representatives of the diplomatic community and non-governmental 
organizations operating in Myanmar, Thailand and on the Thai-Myanmar border.  
</p>
<p>8. Pursuant to Council resolution 6/33, in his letter of 30 January 2008, the Special 
Rapporteur communicated to the Government his wish to conduct a follow-up mission prior to 
the seventh session of the Council in March. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he has not been 
granted access to the country for a follow-up mission as requested by the Council. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his gratitude to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in particular to its Regional 
Office for South-East Asia for the support provided in the implementation of his mandate. He 
would like also to praise the collaboration with United Nations Resident Coordinator and 
Humanitarian Coordinator, Charles Petrie, and the entire United Nations country team in 
Myanmar.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>10. Changes are taking place in the country as a result of political and economic developments, 
including the future adoption of a new constitution that will redefine the political structures of 
the country as well as a number of ongoing development projects. Whether these changes will be 
positive depends on the ease of the political transition and the involvement of the international 
community. Lack of access to conflict areas by United Nations human rights mechanisms and 
other relevant international agencies exacerbates an already difficult human rights situation.  
</p>
<p>11. The establishment by the Secretary-General of a Group of Friends of Myanmar, whose first 
informal format meeting was held on 19 December 2007, is an important effort by the 
international community to continue calling for immediate action to improve the human rights 
situation of the people of Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur has observed with satisfaction that the United Nations system has 
established mechanisms to facilitate communication among the political, humanitarian and 
human rights sectors to address the situation in Myanmar. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
supports the good offices of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar and 
welcomes the announcement on 21 February of his forthcoming visit scheduled for early 
March 2008. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Myanmar and all relevant parties 
to the national reconciliation process to continue to cooperate with the Special Adviser in the 
discharge of his good offices.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  National convention and way forward 
</b></p>
<p>13. The reform process proposed in the 7-step road map for national reconciliation and 
democratic transition, after some initial signs of openness and inclusiveness, has been further 
limited and delineated. In addition, the delays and the obstacles preventing the participation of 
all sectors observed in the past few years have held back the pace of the reforms required for 
democratization. The Special Rapporteur notes that the process is already 14 years old and is 
open-ended.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. On 18 October, the State Peace and Development Council formed a 54-member 
Commission for drafting the State Constitution under announcement No. 2/2007. 
On 19 February, the Government announced the finalization of the draft constitution. 
</p>
<p>15. During his mission in November 2007, the Special Rapporteur met with 
Brigadier General Kyaw Hsan, Minister for Information, who informed him of the formation of 
the constitution drafting commission, the third step in the road map for national reconciliation, 
culminating in the finalization of the draft constitution. The Minister stated that the fourth step 
would be completed when the majority of the people approved the constitution through a 
national referendum. During the fifth step, which is holding general elections, the Minister 
informed the Special Rapporteur that everyone would have the right to vote and to be elected, 
including those described by the Minister as opposing the 7-step road map. They would also 
have the right to establish political parties and launch election campaigns at the appropriate time. 
As the sixth step, a new <i>Hluttaw</i> or Government would be formed. The Minister described the 
seventh step as a continuing process to build a new democratic State. 
</p>
<p>16. The Minister informed the Special Rapporteur that the national convention had 
managed to adopt the fundamental principles and detailed basic principles that would guide the 
drafting of the future constitution. These principles, according to the Minister, guaranteed 
justice, freedom and equality in the country for all citizens to enjoy equal rights before the law; 
non-discrimination based on race, gender or wealth; and freedom of faith. The Minister also 
pointed out that, in accordance with the law, every citizen would have the right to freedom of 
speech, expression, peaceful assembly and association. The rights of the ethnic nationalities to 
preserve and develop their languages, literature, art and culture were also guaranteed in the 
principles. In the new constitution, the State would be made up of seven regions, seven states 
(Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Shan, Chin, Mon and Rakhine), one self-administered division for 
Wa nationals and five self-administered zones for Pa-o, Danu, Palaung, Kokang and 
Naga nationals. Additional measures would be taken to ensure the enjoyment of the rights of the 
minorities, whose populations would lack a self-administered division or a self-administered 
zone. Those minorities whose populations represent at least 0.01 per cent of the nation&#8217;s total 
population would get one seat at their respective region or state <i>Hluttaw</i>.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government announced on 9 February 2008 that it would hold a referendum on the 
new constitution in May 2008 and multiparty democratic elections in 2010. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to join the Secretary-General in his call to the Myanmar authorities to 
engage without delay in a substantive and time-bound dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
and other relevant parties to the national reconciliation process. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that, for democracy to be sustainable, any draft constitution must be broadly 
representative of the views of all the people of Myanmar. He deeply regrets that, despite the 
above-mentioned declaration of good intentions, the detention of political opposition leaders 
continues. On 13 February, the Special Rapporteur was dismayed to learn that the house arrest of 
Tin Oo, 80 years of age and deputy to the General Secretary of the National League for 
Democracy (NLD), had been extended for an additional year and that legal provisions in the new 
constitution might prevent the General Secretary of NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi, from being a 
candidate in the proposed general elections. In October 2007, the Special Rapporteur also 
received allegations of the use of force on citizens to participate in pro-Government rallies in 
support of the constitutional process. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur expressed concerns regarding the role of the Union Solidarity and 
Development Association, established by the State Peace and Development Council in 1993 as a 
political party in the future elections. Over the years, the Special Rapporteur has received 
allegations of the Association&#8217;s involvement in acts of political and criminal violence, the latest 
being the violent crackdown on demonstrators following the fuel crisis, as documented in his 
report to the Council at its sixth session. Many observers believe that the Association may be 
used to legitimize a transition from a military regime to a civilian Government. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Establishment of a national human rights body 
</b></p>
<p>19. In November 2007, Major General Maung Oo, Minister for Home Affairs, informed the 
Special Rapporteur that a 20-member national human rights group had been established. The 
group, chaired by the Minister for Home Affairs, includes representatives from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Judge Advocate&#8217;s Office and the Chief Justice&#8217;s Office. The body divides its 
work among nine thematic subgroups focusing on a wide range of human rights issues. During 
his meeting with 18 male and 2 female members of the group in November, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that it was hoped that the group would become the future national 
human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>20. While expressing concerns that the group was composed almost entirely of Government 
representatives, the Special Rapporteur would like to acknowledge the importance of the 
establishment of a specific national body addressing human rights situation in the country. In his 
view, national human rights institutions are the best mechanism at the country level to ensure the 
implementation of international human rights norms. However, to be effective, they must comply 
fully with the Paris Principles, particularly in terms of their independence.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  ASEAN charter and other political efforts  
</b></p>
<p>21. The ASEAN charter was signed by Heads of State at the thirteenth ASEAN summit 
on 20 November 2007, in Singapore.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the ASEAN charter, in particular the 
commitment to establish an ASEAN human rights body, as stated in article 14 of the charter, 
which would provide for a stronger regional framework to address the human rights situation in 
Member States, including Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur believes that this process provides 
a vehicle for ASEAN Member States and their partners to further encourage the Government of 
Myanmar to speed up democratic reforms with due respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the ASEAN Chairperson&#8217;s statement of September 2007 
and consequent statements by Member States highlighting the absence of progress in democracy 
and human rights in Myanmar. He also notes with satisfaction that China supports continuing 
efforts on the part of the Government of Myanmar aiming at inclusive dialogue and national 
reconciliation and commends the latest efforts made by other countries, such as India, to ensure 
the continued collaboration of Myanmar with the United Nations.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Right to health, education and food 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to reports, there have been marked signs of deterioration in the economic and 
social sectors, which could aggravate the humanitarian situation. According to a poverty profile 
published by the Government in June 2007, food expenditure represents 73 per cent of all 
consumption expenditure. According to United Nations agencies present in the country, one 
child in three under the age of 5 suffers from malnutrition, and less than 50 per cent of children 
are able to complete their primary education.  
</p>
<p>25. The burdens of communicable diseases in Myanmar remain very high, but with assistance 
from United Nations agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and non-governmental organizations, the public health sector has seen 
progress in combating malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. However, the delivery of 
disease-control services, particularly in remote, hard-to-reach townships, including those in the 
border areas, remains a serious challenge owing to several factors, such as insufficient resources 
for health, limitations to access to these areas and high turnover of staff.  
</p>
<p>26. The latest estimates from WHO and UNAIDS indicated that, in 2007, a total 
of 242,000 people in Myanmar lived with HIV/AIDS, one of the worst epidemics in Asia. 
According to the United Nations, 75,000 people, including 2,000 children, were in need of 
anti-retroviral treatment in 2007. By December 2007, only 10,500 were reported to have started 
such treatment. Non-governmental organizations reportedly provide 85 per cent of treatment. 
The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern following the announcement made by the 
Government-run Yangon Infectious Diseases Hospital (Wai Bar Gi) that new regulations 
introduced in January 2008 stopped free medical services, such as clinical and laboratory 
services, from being provided to persons living with HIV/AIDS. These services had formerly 
been supported by a non-governmental organization and were not continued by the Government 
after that support had to be ended. Most people living with HIV/AIDS who come to the hospital 
for testing or treatment can only afford transportation, food and basic living costs. The 
NLD-affiliated welfare group has traditionally provided support for a number of people living 
with HIV/AIDS who would not otherwise have access to services. Following the crackdown on 
the demonstrations, it is reported that much of that assistance was discontinued, leaving an 
unknown number of people living with HIV/AIDS without services. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur takes the opportunity to commend the important work of the 
Mae Tao Health Centre in Mae Sot, Thailand, which, since 1988, provides free health care to 
refugees, migrant workers and other individuals who cross the border into Thailand.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur received information that, in January 2008, officials from the 
Ministry of Health had summoned aid workers from international non-governmental 
organizations to the new capital Naypyidaw, warning them to follow strictly the rules and to 
report details of their field trips to the Government. Travel permits for international aid workers 
for international non-governmental organizations to work in the field are now issued for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>one month only, as opposed to the previous period of three months. The new tightened rules also 
require foreigners working for those organizations to be accompanied by a ministry liaison 
officer when travelling around the country. The new rules prohibit the collection of information 
other than that related to public health. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur also denounces the serious violations of medical neutrality brought 
to his attention since the establishment of the mandate. Late in 2007, two health workers were 
reportedly kept by the State Peace and Development Council and the community that the doctors 
were servicing had to pay for their release. One doctor in charge of a clinic was allegedly killed 
by soldiers of the State Peace and Development Council in October 2007 near Bu Thaw Plaw 
clinic. Seven health workers have died since 1998.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur takes notes of the positive news issued in January 2008 by World 
Food Programme (WFP) that its food assistance activities in the country would expand in 2008. 
At the end of the first year of its 3-year programme, WFP has reached 500,000 beneficiaries, 
thereby allowing vulnerable communities to overcome chronic food shortages. The Special 
Rapporteur noted with satisfaction that the Government of Myanmar facilitates the work of WFP 
by granting access to several of the most marginalized areas of the country. Recently, in 
North Rakhine, the authorities eased procedures to help speed up the delivery of food to returned 
communities. It is hoped that this initiative will be replicated elsewhere and that the Government 
will also address restrictions imposed on some categories of the population in Rakhine State, 
such as the restriction of movement outside their village tract, which affects food security in the 
area as well as being a violation of the basic human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Forced labour 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Government of Myanmar has acceded to a number of International Labour 
Organization (ILO) conventions, including the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and 
the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87). 
Although the Government issued in 2000 an order outlawing the practice of forced labour, there 
have been serious shortcomings when it comes to effectively enforcing it. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the conclusion, in February 2007, of a supplementary 
understanding between ILO and the Government to establish a mechanism for victims of forced 
labour to seek redress. He noted that some of the cases had been resolved successfully, 
demonstrating the value of the complaint mechanism. While the Special Rapporteur is aware of 
the current limitations of the mechanism in the present context, he strongly encourages the 
Government to collaborate with the liaison officer to strengthen its effectiveness. He notes with 
satisfaction the agreement reached on 26 February 2008 to extend the supplementary 
Understanding for a further 12-month trial period subject to its submission to the ILO Governing 
Body at its March meeting. 
</p>
<p>33.  One major development is that the authorities are apparently no longer requisitioning 
labour for national infrastructure projects. Nonetheless, forced labour continues to be widely 
imposed by local authorities for public infrastructure and services work. The situation remains 
most serious in border areas, where the army continues to impose forced labour on a widespread 
and systematic basis for a range of military and infrastructure-related purposes, including the use </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of civilians as porters for the army during patrols and military operations. Major obstacles to the 
elimination of forced labour include the apparent lack of political will to seriously address the 
problem or to develop acceptable alternatives, and the continued impunity of the Government 
officials and army officers responsible. Another problem is the lack of public information on, 
and awareness of, the Government&#8217;s orders, which prohibit the use of forced labour and the 
mechanisms which exist to seek redress.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Freedom of expression, movement and peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>34. The authorities have continued to impose severe restrictions on the freedoms of movement, 
expression, association and assembly. The Special Rapporteur has received several reports 
alleging that the Government is involved in crackdowns on initiatives by individuals; even those 
for non-political purposes, such as the fight against HIV/AIDS. He has also received allegations 
concerning the prosecution of individuals who have conveyed public information to 
organizations and individuals inside and outside the country. The Special Rapporteur remains 
concerned at the severe restrictions on freedom of movement that prevail in general in the 
country, and in particular at those imposed on specific minority groups. 
</p>
<p>35. The established legal framework is used to silence the voices of opposition. The Press 
Scrutiny and Registration Division of the Ministry of Information examines every publication for 
anything perceived to be anti-regime. Similar censorship boards exercise tight control over art, 
music, film and all other forms of artistic expression. All authors, publishers, journalists and 
poets must submit a personal biography to the board of literary censorship. The board then 
investigates whether these individuals have any association with opposition political parties or 
connections to other people or groups deemed threatening by the regime. Anyone proved or 
suspected of having undesirable connections is placed on a blacklist and their work is not 
allowed to be published. 
</p>
<p>36. Reporters Sans Fronti&#232;res placed Myanmar 164 on its press freedom index, five places 
from the bottom, and the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Myanmar second on its list of 
10 most censored countries. While a number of new publishing licences have reportedly been 
granted in recent years, very few of them have resulted in the establishment of viable 
publications because of the excessive restrictions and bureaucratic demands of the Government. 
In order to have access to information on what is really happening in their country and the rest of 
the world, many citizens are forced to rely on sources of information such as Myanmar-language 
radio broadcasts from abroad, which are prohibited by the national authorities. Meanwhile, the 
Government continues to crack down on other forms of outside communication. The military 
allegedly raided a number of areas across Myanmar as part of a campaign to confiscate cheap 
mobile phones smuggled in from neighbouring countries. The Internet also continued to be 
censored and extensive efforts are made to block e-mail services.  
</p>
<p>37. The freedoms of assembly and association are also significantly curtailed by the 
Government. The Unlawful Associations Act of 1908 (later amended) prohibiting unauthorized 
outdoor assemblies of more than five people is enforced selectively. Despite obligations under 
domestic law and international treaties to recognize and respect the rights of workers, the 
authorities have banned trade unions and labour organizations in Myanmar.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in 1955, the Government ratified ILO Convention 
No. 87 on Freedom of Association and the Right to Organize. The Government has not fulfilled 
its obligations under that Convention. A complaint against the Government regarding six people 
recently sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment for organizing a meeting of workers is 
currently being considered by the ILO Freedom of Association Committee. He also notes that 
ILO has already called on the Government to review and revoke the convictions and release the 
people concerned. 
</p>
<p>39. The political parties and social organizations that are allowed to exist have been denied the 
ability to operate freely and securely. In particular, the regime has targeted its political 
opponents. The Government has continued to pressure members of NLD and the Shan 
Nationalities League for Democracy to resign and has arbitrarily renewed the house arrest of 
NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo. In general, freedom of association exists only for 
Government-approved organizations, including trade associations, professional bodies and 
Government-organized groups, such as the Union Solidarity and Development Association, 
which rely on coercion for their membership.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Administration of justice and fair trials 
</b>40. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the long-standing culture of 
non-accountability in many cases of human rights violations, which is deeply rooted in the 
structures of the regime and national institutions, seriously obstructing the rule of law and the 
administration of justice.  
41. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the judiciary lacks independence and that it has 
provided a legal basis for abuses of power, arbitrary decision-making and exoneration of those 
responsible for human rights violations. The capacity of law enforcement institutions and the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary must be addressed by the Government urgently. 
This situation has reinforced inequality and increased the gap between the poor and the rich.  
</p>
<p>42. Impunity is deeply entrenched and cannot be attributed to lack of institutional capacity 
alone.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Political prisoners and conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is dismayed to see that, as at January 2008, 1,850 political 
prisoners were reported in prison. He noted that, instead of stopping unlawful arrests, the 
Government had accelerated them. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive credible reports 
on arrests of political and human rights activists, journalists and civilians in relation to the 
demonstrations of August and September 2007, which are covered in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
report to the Council at its seventh session (A/HRC/7/24). According to the information 
received, at least 70 individuals were arrested, and some 62 of them have been detained since the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission in November 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur has also received allegations of poor conditions of detention, death 
in custody, inadequate food and medical treatment, arbitrary arrests without warrants, 
incommunicado detention, ill-treatment in pretrial detention and defendants who have been 
denied the right to legal counsel. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to carry out 
prompt, full, independent and impartial investigations into these serious allegations.  
</p>
<p>45. As Myanmar embarks upon new steps of the road map towards democracy, the Special 
Rapporteur believes it is of the utmost importance to address urgently the issue of political 
prisoners, whose release would be seen as a gesture of good faith that would help to pave the 
way to democratization and reconciliation. While, as a matter of principle, the Special 
Rapporteur continues to advocate for the release of all political prisoners, the Government may 
wish to consider this question in phases, as suggested by the Special Rapporteur in a letter to the 
Government in July 2007 and in his latest report to the General Assembly (A/62/223). As a first 
step, he urges the Government to release all political prisoners at risk, including female political 
prisoners and those who are elderly or ill.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the continued imprisonment of 78-year-old poet 
and journalist U Win Tin, imprisoned since 1989 and serving a 20-year sentence for 
&#8220;anti-government propaganda and other offences&#8221;, for whom the Special Rapporteur expresses 
serious concern regarding his health; U Win Tin was admitted to the Yangon general hospital 
on 22 January 2008 for a hernia operation. The Special Rapporteur appeals once more to the 
Government to release the country&#8217;s longest-serving political prisoner, who should have been 
released in July 2005. According to reports, at least 36 detainees in Myanmar are aged over 60, 
including NLD members Hla Myint Than, Kyaw San and Maj-Gen Sao Hso Ten, president of 
the Shan State Peace Council. To date, prisoners have not received any visits from 
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) since the beginning 
of 2006. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur deplores the continued detention of NLD and other leaders still 
serving draconian arrest terms, such as the NLD General Secretary Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, 
under house arrest, for whom he reiterates his request for immediate and unconditional release. 
The Special Rapporteur would like to express his concerns regarding the deteriorating health 
conditions of Shan NLD leader Khun Htun Oo, arrested in 2003 and sentenced to 96 years of 
imprisonment, suffering since December 2007 from hepatitis B without proper access to medical 
treatment. His family is allowed to visit him every three months in Putao prison. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the authorities to release him, and pending his release to supply medical 
treatment at the hospital and transfer him to the jail in Yangon, where his family lives. 
</p><p>48. The terms of detention of other prominent NLD leaders, including Tin Oo, Than Nyein and 
May Win Myint, were also extended. Several leaders of ethnic political parties have been 
detained and sentenced to extraordinarily severe prison terms of 100 years or more.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Implementation of anti-terror laws 
</b></p>
<p>49. The authorities have for many years justified the imprisonment of hundreds of students, 
politicians, doctors, lawyers, housewives, farmers and others on the basis that they were seeking 
to cause &#8220;unrest&#8221;. Such arrests and sentences have been made possible by vaguely worded 
security laws, which allow excessively broad interpretation by the authorities of what constitutes </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a threat to security, and by legislation that criminalizes the circulation of any written 
information, whether or not it is published, without the permission of the official censor. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Act and other 
similar laws, which have been used to imprison many political prisoners, places far greater 
restrictions on rights and freedoms than would be necessary to meet the requirements of national 
security, public order or morality. The Act requires all books, magazines, periodicals, song lyrics 
and film scripts to be approved by censors prior to publication or distribution; anyone breaching 
it may be punished by up to seven years of imprisonment and a fine. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to ensure that humanitarian agencies 
can operate in a mutually agreeable environment, in accordance with the guiding principles 
provided by the United Nations country team in March 2006. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the provision of humanitarian assistance to Myanmar and believes that there must be 
transparency and accountability in the monitoring of that assistance to ensure that it is not 
misused for personal gain. Myanmar nationals employed by agencies working in the country 
must be afforded protection against any form of threat or intimidation for their work in 
humanitarian and development programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  International human rights and humanitarian obligations 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Government of Myanmar has an obligation under the Charter of the United Nations, 
which provides for the promotion of &#8220;universal respect for human rights and for fundamental 
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion&#8221;. Under international 
law, the Government has an obligation to thoroughly investigate grave violations of human 
rights, to prosecute those responsible for their perpetration and, if their guilt is established, to 
punish them. Those responsible for human rights violations must stand trial and their victims 
must obtain reparation. 
</p>
<p>52. Myanmar is party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Slavery Convention, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. It has not 
signed the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>53. Myanmar has not signed the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949 and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts 
(Protocol I) the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and Relating 
to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflict (Protocol II) and the Protocol 
Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Adoption of an 
Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III).  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>54. On 29 June 2007, ICRC issued a public statement denouncing major and repeated 
violations of international humanitarian law committed against civilians and detainees, including 
the use of convicts as porters. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern over these 
violations and his frustration at the restrictions on the movement of ICRC staff in the affected 
areas and on entry into places of detention in accordance with their standard procedures. ICRC 
has consequently failed to adhere to the requests of family members of political prisoners to 
continue prison visits, as there has been no breakthrough in negotiations with the authorities 
despite the willingness of ICRC to dialogue. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is particularly pleased to note that Myanmar submitted its 
combined second and third reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women in June 2007, which will be considered by the Committee at its 
forty-second session in October 2008. The pre-sessional working group of the Committee met in 
February 2008 to hold a preliminary review of the report and adopt a list of issues in relation to 
the country. The Special Rapporteur believes that this effort would have benefited from a larger 
consultation process within the country as to better reflect the advances and the challenges, 
including through the support of the expert views in the United Nations agencies and 
programmes in the country. The Special Rapporteur also believes that the Government will 
benefit from the expertise of Committee members in view of the widespread sexual violence 
against women and girls reported in the country. He encourages the Government to seek 
international assistance to implement the Committee&#8217;s recommendations meaningfully and also 
commends the efforts of women&#8217;s associations inside and outside the country to prepare 
documentation for the Committee.  
</p>
<p>56. The initial and second periodic reports under the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
have been submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child; the combined third and fourth 
periodic report is due in August 2008. This represents an opportunity for the Government to 
work with civil society, the United Nations system and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, to engage in a discussion on sexual violence against girls and on the recruitment of child 
soldiers with a view to submitting its report in the best possible conditions.  
</p>
<p>57. Both committees have examined the reports submitted by Myanmar and adopted 
recommendations and concluding observations, providing guidance to the Government on how 
to fulfil its international human rights obligations. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the 
recommendations of treaty bodies are an important tool for policymakers and development 
practitioners. It is therefore important for the Government and its partners to follow up on these 
recommendations. They will help to measure political will, obstacles encountered and progress 
made, to identify new trends and to complement the efforts made by the Government towards the 
protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Systematic human rights violations, impunity and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>58. The culture of impunity remains the main obstacle to securing respect for human rights in 
Myanmar and to creating a favourable environment for their realization. Throughout his 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur has received reports of widespread and systematic human rights 
violations, including summary executions, torture, forced labour practices, sexual violence and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the recruitment of child soldiers. These violations have not been investigated and their authors 
have not been prosecuted. Victims have not been in a position to assert their rights and receive a 
fair and effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>59. As noted by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports, the above-mentioned serious 
human rights violations have been widespread and systematic, suggesting that they are not 
simply isolated acts of individual misconduct by middle- or low-ranking officers, but rather the 
result of a system under which individuals and groups have been allowed to break the law and 
violate human rights without being called to account.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur also believes that impunity and non-accountability are among the 
main underlying causes of the degrading economic and social conditions of rural farmers, who 
represent the majority of the population of Myanmar. The militarization of rural areas has 
contributed to the impoverishment of villagers as the military relies on local labour as the result 
of the incapacity of the Government to deliver support for its activities. The Special Rapporteur 
has received allegations that villagers have been severely punished because they refused to 
perform forced labour or have been subject to unlawful appropriation of their land, livestock, 
harvest and other property. A number of internally displaced people from several villages in 
Bago Division and Karen State informed the Special Rapporteur that they fled from their villages 
because they had been harassed to provide free labour force for the construction of roads to 
newly established camps. Myanmar has increased the number of its battalions nationwide 
since 1988, and the implementation of self-reliance policies by the local military over the past 
decade has undermined the rule of law and damaged the livelihood of local communities. 
</p>
<p>61. Concerns have also been expressed by the Special Rapporteur on various occasions over 
the use of excessive force in the country linked to the alleged participation of groups, such as the 
Swan Ah Shin and other militias in violent attacks against civilians. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned at the continued misuse of the legal system, 
which denies the rule of law and represents a major obstacle to securing the effective and 
meaningful exercise of fundamental freedoms. The Special Rapporteur regrets to observe that the 
lack of independence of the judiciary has provided a &#8220;legal&#8221; basis for abuses of power, arbitrary 
decision-making and the examination of those responsible for serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Land confiscation, natural resources, forced displacements and migration 
</b></p>
<p>63. Access to and control over land and natural resources have long been central to the 
political economy of Myanmar. In many ethnic minority-populated areas, repeated incidents of 
forced displacement have been a fact of life for generations. Some 75 per cent of the population 
is engaged in agriculture (including fisheries, forestry and livestock), which accounts 
for 40 per cent of the gross domestic product.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur notes the increasing recognition among human rights, 
humanitarian and development groups of the need to document issues related to land and natural 
resource management in Myanmar. Arbitrary land confiscations throughout the country are 
another illustration of the culture of impunity prevailing in Myanmar. While the Government 
claims that land is &#8220;State-owned property&#8221;, on the basis of the Land Nationalization Act </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of 26 October 1953 conferring land ownership on the State, these confiscations appear to have 
several aims, including relocating civilian populations deemed to be sympathetic to the armed 
opposition; anchoring a military presence in disputed areas; and opening the way for 
infrastructure development projects. 
65. The <i>New Light of Myanmar</i> reported in May 2007 that seven hydropower projects on the 
Irrawaddy River had been designed to double production of electricity in the country by 2009. 
The projects are being implemented under an agreement signed in late 2006 with the 
State-owned China Power Investment Corporation. During construction, a number of human 
rights abuses in the local areas has been reported following the arrival of Light Infantry 
Battalion 121. The army is reportedly forcing villagers to pave the routes and is extorting money 
from local merchants, taking materials from shops and farms without paying. According to an 
environmental organization, the natural heritage of the Kachin people in the Myitsone area will 
be destroyed and more than 40 villages near the construction site will be flooded when the dam 
is built. 
</p>
<p>66. The extraction of natural resources, notably offshore gas, is providing various interest 
groups, including the military and foreign companies, with business opportunities. Economic 
concessions, including some for logging and mining, have been granted. This policy has led to 
numerous forced evictions, relocations and resettlements, especially in rural areas but also in 
urban areas, particularly in connection with the move of the capital from Yangon to 
Nay Pyi Taw. The Special Rapporteur views the ongoing large-scale confiscation of land as a 
matter of grave concern that will continue to have a dramatic impact on the environmental, 
political and economic stability of the country if not addressed. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any provisions in the draft constitution that provide 
for secure land and housing rights of citizens, protect the rights to fair and just compensation as a 
result of legal or illegal land or property expropriation or guarantee traditional practices of ethnic 
minorities in relation to land and natural resource management, such as collective property rights 
and swidden agriculture, an important element of sustainable livelihood strategies. 
</p>
<p>68. Protection from land confiscation depends on settlement of the conflicts that have wracked 
the country for more than half a century. Nevertheless, some inspiring projects have been 
implemented by civil society groups in Myanmar. These examples show that it is not necessary 
to wait for fundamental democratic reform before the issue of land confiscation is addressed and 
transitional justice is introduced. 
</p><p>69. The majority of new incidents of internal displacement and forced migration were 
concentrated in north-east Karen State and adjacent areas of Pegu Division, still subject to armed 
conflict. In October 2007, sources estimated that the total number of internally displaced persons 
in eastern Myanmar was estimated at 503,000. These included 295,000 people in ceasefire 
zones, 99,000 in hiding in the jungle and 109,000 elsewhere in Myanmar, including in relocation 
sites. Assistance to displaced people from neighbouring countries is by definition illegal, as it 
challenges the sovereignty of Myanmar. Cross-border activities carried out include low-profile 
medical assistance and training of local non-governmental organizations staff, to the benefit of 
resettled internally displaced persons and other communities in Kachin and Wa ceasefire areas 
along the China border.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70. The Government does not recognize the existence of internally displaced persons within 
the borders of Myanmar, let alone its responsibility in preventing and addressing such a situation 
according to recognized international standards, and restricts access to them, especially in the 
eastern border zones, by United Nations agencies and other humanitarian actors. Most assistance 
to internally displaced persons is provided through local non-governmental organizations. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent initiative of the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Assistance to map assistance activities and to promote coordinated and effective 
ways to provide humanitarian aid to internally displaced persons in eastern Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>71. The causes of population movements within Myanmar (internal migration) and beyond its 
borders (external migration) are closely linked to the serious and systematic abuses of basic 
rights, and are therefore considered to be a form of forced migration. Their reasons for moving 
are often similar to those of internally displaced persons or, in the case of cross-border migrants, 
refugees.<b> </b>The Government has reportedly continued its attempts to limit and regulate 
international travel through punitive measures imposed on illegal migrants and regular closures 
of official border crossings. Borders with China, Thailand, Bangladesh and India remained 
permeable throughout the year and significant undocumented migration and commercial travel 
regularly take place. Foreigners, including humanitarian agencies seeking entry and access to 
certain areas of the country to deliver much-needed aid supplies, are also faced with significant 
restrictions on their freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p><b>D.   Military operations in ethnic areas and discrimination against minorities  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur has been very concerned about the intensified military campaigns 
in ethnic areas and their impact on the humanitarian and human rights situation, especially of 
civilians who are either victims of collateral damage or direct targets. This situation is in 
connection with the widespread practice of land confiscation throughout the country, which is 
seemingly aimed at anchoring military control, especially in ethnic areas. It has led to forced 
evictions, relocations and resettlements, forced migration and internal displacement. After 
half-a-century of  low intensity civil war, many ethnic minorities in Myanmar living along areas 
bordering with Thailand are highly vulnerable; most armed ethnic groups have either agreed to 
ceasefires with the Government or been reduced to exhausted remnants in the jungle. The 
Government and non-State armed groups have the obligation under international humanitarian 
law to take appropriate measures to protect the civilian population against the effects of conflict. 
The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that the norms of international customary law 
provide, in particular, that attacks must not be directed against civilians.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur believes that the formal engagement of the humanitarian sector of 
the United Nations provides stronger, essential support in ensuring the integrity and 
independence of ongoing assistance efforts. He therefore welcomes the engagement of the Office 
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which appointed a humanitarian coordinator for 
Myanmar and implemented a number of operational and policy measures agreed upon in the 
course of a mission by the Assistant Secretary-General in April 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. Violations of the human rights of ethnic nationalities continue to be reported in 
Kayin State, in eastern Myanmar (Mon, Shan and Kayah) and in northern Rakhine State. These 
violations have been perpetrated by military agents and non-State armed groups. The 
Government severely restricts access to them by United Nations agencies and other humanitarian 
actors.  
</p>
<p>75. In addition to direct relocation or eviction orders issued by the military and civil 
authorities, internal displacement results from a combination of coercive measures, such as 
forced labour, extortion and land confiscation, which drive down incomes to the point that the 
household economies collapse and people have no choice but to leave their homes. The conflict 
and the reported abuses result in large numbers of individuals and entire families seeking refuge 
in neighbouring countries following their internal displacement.  
</p>
<p>76. As at 15 February 2008, the population of refugees from Myanmar in Thailand, including 
the registered population, asylum-seekers waiting for action by the Thailand Provincial 
Admission Board and students was estimated by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at 130,241. This excludes some 14,182 refugees resettled 
in third countries. According to UNHCR, 123,663 Myanmar refugees temporarily residing in 
nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border have been registered. A total of 228 individuals 
allegedly fleeing Myanmar as a result of the crackdown on the demonstrations held in August 
and September 2007 have also been registered. 
</p>
<p>77. It has been reported that, in Karen State, over 40,000 villagers have been internally 
displaced. At least 10 villagers in Karen State are said to have been killed and thousands 
rendered homeless owing to an increased army presence over the past months. According to 
reports in December 2007, there were 187 army battalions in Karen State, including the 
three districts, with at least 120 to 150 soldiers in each battalion.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in the Northern Rakhine State<b> </b>(Arakan), the Sunni 
Muslim returnees are subjected to political, economic, religious and social repression by the 
authorities. The total number of Muslim residents/stateless (Rohingyas) is estimated by 
non-governmental sources at 728,000. They have been denied citizenship under the 1982 
citizenship law, which renders them de facto stateless. They are subject to systematic 
discrimination and abuse, which, according to various sources, have worsened, especially with 
regard to the restriction of movement, arbitrary taxation,<b> </b>forced labour,<b> </b>confiscation, forced 
eviction and<b> </b>arbitrary arrest<b> </b>(including harassment and violence by police forces, death in 
custody and sexual violence). In addition, people are often harassed (house searches, 
confiscation of assets) or beaten by police forces, mainly during controls or at checkpoints. 
Cases of rape of young women and children, perpetrated by different police forces, have been 
reported.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur praises the Government of Myanmar for having included 
Muslim residents as part of its national documentation programme and by initially 
providing 35,000 persons in northern Arakan State with identity documents (temporary 
registration certificates). While noting the importance of this process, which can be considered a 
first step to a decent legal status for this population, and hoping that the pace can be accelerated </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>so as to include all residents within a reasonable time frame, the Special Rapporteur would also 
like to express his concern that the temporary registration certificates can neither be used to 
claim citizenship nor can they be seen as a long-term solution. In this context, he encourages the 
Government to repeal or amend the 1982 Citizenship Law and ensure the compliance of its 
legislation with the country&#8217;s international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at recent reports of human rights violations in 
Kayin<b> </b>State, which include extrajudicial killings, attacks on civilians and forced displacement. 
These follow the 2006-2007 military offensives in Kayin State perpetrated by the armed forces 
against civilians. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to provide full details of alleged 
crimes and to press for the cessation of hostilities by all parties. Widespread violence increased 
in 2007 in mountain areas outside military control in the Toungoo, Nyaunglebin and Papun 
Districts and in eastern Bago Division. For reliable observers, this is the worst humanitarian 
situation since the 1996-1997 military campaign. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Situation of children 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned regarding the figures reported by UNICEF 
in its annual report, entitled &#8220;The state of the world&#8217;s children&#8221;, that every day hundreds of 
children under the age of 5 die from preventable diseases in Myanmar. The mortality rate is a 
critical indicator of the well-being of children. The main cause of child deaths is acute 
respiratory infection, followed by pneumonia, diarrhoea and septicaemia. According to the 
report, there has been a drop in child mortality of 1.6 per cent per year in the country 
between 1990 and 2006.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction that the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict visited Myanmar in the framework of her 
mandate (Security Council resolution 1612 (2005)) in June 2007. The Special Rapporteur 
commended the report of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict in Myanmar 
presented to the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict (S/2007/666), 
noting that the issue of recruitment and use of children continues to be a problem in Myanmar 
both with regard to the Government and various non-State actors, including the Karen National 
Union, the Karenni National Progressive Party, the Wa State Army and the Shan State 
Army-South. The work of the Working Group and the mechanism set in place by 
Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) have led to the commitment by some parties to stop 
this practice. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8217;s communication 
of 14 February 2008 addressed to him, in which the Government highlighted the measures it had 
taken to address the situation of the recruitment of child soldiers in the country.  
</p>
<p>83. According to a recent report, 968,000 children do not attend primary school. While this 
figure includes children in a number of areas, it presumably also includes displaced children. 
According to Government statistics, 97.58 per cent of primary school-age children are enrolled 
in school.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Situation of women  
</b></p>
<p>84. The sudden rise in fuel prices on 15 August 2007 demonstrated the already harsh 
conditions and the everyday struggle to meet basic needs for millions of women and girls in the 
country. Palaung women, for example, reported to the Special Rapporteur that their purchasing 
power fell to a record low following the hike in fuel prices, since household budgets were 
basically allocated to the purchase of food staples such as rice, rather than other products, such 
as tea, which is their reported main production. 
</p>
<p>85. The health conditions of female inmates is also an issue of concern. When the Special 
Rapporteur visited Insein prison in November, he had the opportunity, at his request, to meet in 
private with Su Su Nway, who had been arrested during the visit of the Special Rapporteur to 
Myanmar. Su Su Nway reportedly received medical treatment during the month following the 
visit. It is reported that, since then, she has not had access to her daily medication, resulting in 
the worsening of her health.  
</p>
<p>86. The situation of women caught in conflict in ethnic areas is appalling. The Special 
Rapporteur received reports and testimonies from women who were forced to flee their villages 
following the burning of their houses and the stealing of their cattle. Although some have sought 
refuge in neighbouring countries, their living conditions remain desperate.    
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any Government initiative to address the consistent 
and continuing pattern of impunity by members of the military involved in the high number of 
allegations of sexual violence against women and girls. The failure to investigate, prosecute and 
punish those responsible for rape and sexual violence has contributed to an environment 
conducive to the perpetuation of those acts against women and girls in Myanmar.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
</b></p>
<p>88. The human rights concerns enumerated in the present report are largely the same as those 
highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in his reports since 2001. It should be noted that the 
crackdown of the demonstrations of August and September 2007, the increased army 
deployment in certain ethnic areas and the implementation of major development projects are 
also opening new fronts in the patterns of human rights abuses observed since the establishment 
of the mandate.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur deplores the fact that the apparent willingness of the Government 
to address these problems when the Special Rapporteur first took up his mandate seven years ago 
has disappeared. The recommendations formulated by the General Assembly (the latest being 
resolution 62/222), the Security Council, the Human Rights Council (notably resolutions S-5/1 
of the special session of 2 October 2007 and 6/33), the Commission on Human Rights, the 
Secretary-General and his Special Adviser, the thematic special procedures mandate-holders, as 
well as those advocated by the Special Rapporteur and relevant human rights treaty bodies have 
regrettably not been implemented. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that Myanmar would benefit from more active 
cooperation with his mandate. He insists that, though it is his obligation to go public about 
allegations of human rights violations, that does not exclude a constructive and continuous 
dialogue with the Government. These two elements of his mandate can contribute to a new 
dynamic for the improvement of the situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>91. In this last opportunity to address the Council as Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar, he would like to share some reflections on his experiences of the last 
seven years.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur has made every effort to convince the Government of Myanmar to 
work towards the protection and promotion of human rights and to fulfil its international 
obligation of cooperation in the field of human rights. The representatives of Myanmar, despite 
their urbane treatment of the Special Rapporteur, have preferred to denounce his findings as 
inaccurate or biased instead of investigating the allegations reported by him. Combating 
impunity is essential for the promotion and protection of human rights. The investigation of 
reported abuses and punishment of perpetrators is necessary for the restoration of democracy and 
the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms that he has maintained his independence, impartiality 
and objectivity in weighing up the information provided by various sources. He has reported in 
an honest manner on the progress made and obstacles faced by the Government in promoting and 
protecting human rights. He is distressed to conclude that the Government of Myanmar refuses 
to cooperate with both his mandate and the Council. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur warmly thanks all the Member States, United Nations Resident 
Coordinators and United Nations country teams, in particular his colleagues in Myanmar, 
international and regional organizations as well as civil society organizations and scholars who 
have supported his mandate. 
</p>
<p>95. It is hoped that the ASEAN human rights mechanism, if established in accordance with 
international standards and norms, will assist Myanmar in fulfilling its international human rights 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur would like to reaffirm what he has previously stated to the 
Council: humanitarian assistance cannot be a hostage to politics. Any decision on humanitarian 
assistance must be guided solely by the best interests of children, women, vulnerable groups and 
minority communities. It would be a terrible mistake to wait for the political normalization of 
Myanmar to help the population and to empower communities and their representatives. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur would like to conclude by praising all human rights defenders 
inside and outside the country for their courage and commitment in the promotion and protection 
of the human rights of the people of Myanmar.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur believes it is important that Member States support effective 
initiatives to deal with common concerns of society in Myanmar and in the region. Joint 
initiatives on issues of common concern, such as the environment, economic growth and 
development, educational modernization, medical research and engineering and technology, 
which could prove to be paths to progress, should be explored. All these initiatives must have as 
their goal the encouragement of an effective democratic transition and the promotion of higher 
standards of living and the protection of human rights of the people of Myanmar.
