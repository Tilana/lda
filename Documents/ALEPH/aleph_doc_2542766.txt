CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION
During interim periods, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (the Company) follows the same accounting policies used in its
Annual Report to Stockholders and its Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. People using financial information produced for interim periods are encouraged
to refer to the footnotes in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 when reviewing
interim financial results. In management’s opinion, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial
statements contain all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
for the entire year.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has performed a review of these condensed consolidated interim
financial statements in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Pursuant to Rule 436(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, this report should not be considered a part
of a registration statement prepared or certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP within the meanings of Sections 7
and 11 of the Act.
On February 28, 2005, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had declared a 3-for-2 split of the
Company’s Common Stock in the form of a stock distribution. The stock dividend was distributed on March 31, 2005
to stockholders of record on March 18, 2005. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company paid cash based on the
closing price of the Common Stock on the record date. All common stock accounts and per share data have been
retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 3-for-2 split of the Company’s Common Stock.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” This Interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of
conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” A conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be
outside the control of the Company. FIN 47 states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional
asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable. This Interpretation is intended to
provide more information about long-lived assets, more information about future cash outflows for these obligations
and more consistent recognition of these liabilities. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2005. The Company does not believe that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be impacted by
this Interpretation since the Company currently records all asset retirement obligations.
In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-a replacement
of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” In order to enhance financial reporting consistency between
periods, SFAS 154 modifies the requirements for the accounting and reporting of the direct effects of changes in
accounting principles. Under APB Opinion 20, the cumulative effect of voluntary changes in accounting principle was
recognized in Net Income in the period of the change. Unlike the treatment previously prescribed by APB Opinion 20,
retrospective application is now required, unless it is not practical to determine the specific effects in each period or
the cumulative effect. If the period specific effects cannot be determined, it is required that the new accounting
principle must be retrospectively applied in the earliest period possible to the balance sheet accounts and a
corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or another equity account. If the
cumulative effect cannot be determined, it is necessary to apply the new accounting principles prospectively at the
earliest practical date. If it is not feasible to retrospectively apply the change in principle, the reason that this is not
possible and the method used to report the change is required to be disclosed. The statement also provides that
changes in accounting
Table of Contents
6
for depreciation, depletion or amortization should be treated as changes in accounting estimate inseparable from a
change in accounting principle and that disclosure of the preferability of the change is required. SFAS 154 is effective
for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123(R) revises SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and focuses on accounting for share-based payments for services
provided by employee to employer. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock
options and other equity-based compensation at the grant date. The statement does not require a certain type of
valuation model, and either a binomial or Black-Scholes model may be used. During the first quarter of 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this
standard. In April 2005, the SEC took further action to amend Regulation S-X to state that the provisions of SFAS
123(R) are now effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year
beginning on or after June 15, 2005 for all non-small business issuers. As a result, the Company will not adopt this
SFAS until the first quarter of 2006. The Company plans to use the modified prospective application method as
detailed in SFAS 123(R). The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the Company’s operating results. Future
cash flows of the Company will not be impacted by the adoption of this standard. See “Stock-Based Compensation”
below for further information.
In September 2005, the FASB also issued Proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123(R)-c which provides a
simplified, more practical transition election relating to the calculation of the “APIC pool.” The APIC pool is defined as
the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies occurring after the adoption of SFAS 123(R).
Under this Proposed FSP, companies can elect to perform simpler computations to derive the beginning balance of
the APIC pool as well as the impact on the APIC pool of fully vested and outstanding awards as of the SFAS 123(R)
adoption date. The beginning balance can be computed by taking the sum of all tax benefits incurred prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123(R) from stock-based compensation plans less the tax effected (using a blended statutory rate)
pro forma stock-based compensation cost. In addition, increases to the APIC pool for fully vested awards can be
calculated by multiplying the tax rate times the tax benefit of the deduction. The calculation of any awards that are
partially vested or granted after the SFAS 123(R) adoption date will not be affected by this Proposed FSP and will be
calculated in accordance with SFAS 123(R) which requires that only the excess tax benefit or deficiency of the tax
deduction over the tax effect of the compensation cost recognized should be considered for the APIC pool. Also
under the Proposed FSP, all tax benefits recognized on fully vested awards and the excess tax benefits for partially
vested and new awards will be reported on the Statement of Cash Flows as a component of financing activities.
Companies will have up to one year after adopting SFAS 123(R) to decide to elect and disclose whether they plan to
use the alternative method or the original method prescribed in SFAS 123(R) for the calculation of the APIC pool. If
finalized, the Company will adopt this Proposed FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123(R).
In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-2, “Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as
defined in FASB Statement No. 123(R).” This FSP provides guidance on the definition and practical application of
“grant date” as described in SFAS No. 123(R). The grant date is described as the date that the employee and
employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award. The other elements of the
definition of grant date are: 1) the award must be authorized, 2) the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or
distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and 3) the employee is
affected by changes in the company’s stock price. To determine the grant date, the Company is allowed to use the
date the award is approved in accordance with its corporate governance requirements so long as the three elements
described above are met. Furthermore, the recipient cannot negotiate the award’s terms and conditions with the
employer and the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short
time period from the approval date. The Company will adopt this FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS
123(R).

Stock-Based Compensation
7
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value based method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under the
intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the
grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” outlines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or
similar equity instruments.
The following table illustrates the effect on Net Income and Earnings per Share if the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The Earnings per Share amounts
for prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 split of the Company’s Common Stock effective
March 31, 2005.

(1) Compensation expense is defined as expense related to the vesting of stock grants, net of tax. Compensation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 also includes $1.5 million and $0.9 million,
respectively, net of tax related to performance shares. Compensation expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005 and 2004 also includes $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, net of tax, related to
performance shares.
(2) Calculated using the Black-Scholes fair value based method.
(3)
There were no stock options issued in the third quarter of 2004 or in the first nine months of 2005.
On October 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
acceleration, to December 15, 2005, of the vesting of 200,299 unvested stock options awarded in February 2003
under the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan and 24,500 unvested stock options
awarded in April 2004 under the Company’s 2004 Incentive Plan.
The 200,299 shares awarded to employees at an exercise price of $15.32, would have vested in February 2006. The
24,500 shares, awarded to the non-employee directors at an exercise price of $23.32, would have vested 12,250 in
April 2006 and April 2007, respectively. Of the 200,299 shares, 91,500 were awarded to the named executive officers.
The decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options, which the Company believes to be in the best
interest of its shareholders and employees, was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative
burden associated with the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R),
“Share Based Payment (revised 2004).” The accelerated vesting of the options will not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company currently accounts for stock-based compensation using
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” under
which the Company has not recognized any compensation expense for its stock option grants. SFAS 123(R) will
require the Company to recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of all equity-based compensation
over the vesting period of each such award beginning on January 1, 2006. The acceleration of vesting will reduce the
Company’s compensation expense related to these options by an estimated $0.2 million for the year 2006.

As of September 30, 2005, we did not have any significant changes from year-end in our amount of capitalized well
costs that have been capitalized for greater than one year after drilling was suspended.
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of approximately $3.5 million on a two-well field
in south Louisiana resulting from production performance issues related to water encroachment. This impairment
charge was recorded due to the capitalized cost of the fields exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows. This
charge was reflected in the quarterly results and was measured based on discounted cash flows utilizing a discount
rate appropriate for risks associated with the related field. There were no impairments of proved oil and gas properties
during the nine months ended September 30, 2005.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we spent $60.4 million on producing property acquisitions. Of this
amount, $59.4 million was spent in the third quarter of 2005. During the quarter, the Company closed on two large
producing property acquisitions for interests in fields in the Gulf Coast. For the McCampbell field acquisition, we spent
$41.2 million. The Vernon field acquisition was $18.0 million.

5. LONG-TERM DEBT
10
At September 30, 2005, the Company had $10 million of debt outstanding under its Revolving Credit Agreement
(Credit Facility), which provides for an available credit line of $250 million, which can be expanded up to $350 million,
either with the existing banks or new banks. To expand the credit line, the Company must seek prior approval from
the administrative agent and the bank whose commitment is increasing. The term of the Credit Facility expires in
December 2009. The Credit Facility is unsecured. The available credit line is subject to adjustment from time to time
on the basis of the projected present value (as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer) of estimated future net
cash flows from certain proved oil and gas reserves and other assets of the Company. While the Company does not
expect a reduction in the available credit line, in the event that it is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings,
the Company has a period of six months to reduce its outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line available with a
requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one-sixth of the excess during each of the six
months.
In addition to the $10 million of debt outstanding on the Credit Facility, the Company has the following debt
outstanding at September 30, 2005:
•  $100 million of 12-year 7.19% Notes to be repaid in five annual installments of $20 million beginning in November
2005
•  $75 million of 10-year 7.26% Notes due in July 2011
•  $75 million of 12-year 7.36% Notes due in July 2013
•  $20 million of 15-year 7.46% Notes due in July 2016
6. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic Earnings per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing Net Income (the numerator) by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period (the denominator). Diluted EPS is similarly calculated using the treasury
stock method except that the denominator is increased to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding
stock options and stock awards outstanding at the end of the applicable period were exercised for common stock.
The following is a calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies
The Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. All known
liabilities are accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss. While the outcome and impact of
such legal proceedings on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution
of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or cash flow. Operating results, however, could be significantly impacted in
the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved.
Wyoming Royalty Litigation
In January 2002, 13 overriding royalty owners sued the Company in Wyoming federal district court, as reported in
previous filings. The plaintiffs made claims pertaining to deductions from their overriding royalty and claims
concerning penalties for improper reporting. As a result of several decisions by the Court favorable to the Company,
the case was settled in September 2005 with no payment from the Company and a dismissal with prejudice of all
claims by plaintiffs. The settlement included provisions for reporting and payment going forward. Management has
reversed the reserve it had recorded regarding this case.
West Virginia Royalty Litigation
In December 2001, the Company was sued by two royalty owners in West Virginia state court for an unspecified
amount of damages. The plaintiffs have requested class certification and allege that the Company failed to pay
royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas, that it had taken improper deductions from the royalty and
failed to properly inform royalty owners of the deductions. The plaintiffs also claimed that they are entitled to a 1/8th
royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that the Company reached with Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation in 1995 bankruptcy proceedings.
Discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been
ongoing. The court entered an order on June 1, 2005 granting the motion for class certification. The parties have
negotiated a modification to the order which, if entered by the court, would result in the dismissal of the claims related
to the gas sales contract settlement in connection with the Columbia Gas Transmission bankruptcy proceedings. Trial
has been set for April 17, 2006. The Company intends to challenge the class certification order by filing a Petition for
Writ of Prohibition with the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.
The Company is vigorously defending the case. A reserve has been established that management believes is
adequate based on its estimate of the probable outcome of this case.
Texas Title Litigation
On January 6, 2003, the Company was served with Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Original Petition in Romeo Longoria,
et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, et al. in the 79th Judicial District Court of Brooks County, Texas. Plaintiffs filed
their Second Supplemental Original Petition on November 12, 2004 and their Third Supplemental Original Petition on
February 22, 2005 (which added Wynn-Crosby 1996, Ltd. and Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production,
Inc.). Plaintiffs allege that they are the owners of a one-half undivided mineral interest in and to certain lands in
Brooks County, Texas. Cody Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired certain leases and wells in 1997
and 1998.
The plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all
improvements on the lands on which the Company acquired these leases. The plaintiffs also assert claims for
trespass to try title, action to remove a cloud on the title, failure to properly account for royalty, fraud, trespass,
conversion, all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages. Plaintiffs claim that
Table of Contents
12
they acquired title to the property by adverse possession. Plaintiffs also assert the discovery rule and a claim of
fraudulent concealment to avoid the affirmative defense of limitations. The Company has not had the opportunity to
conduct discovery in this matter. The Company estimates that production revenue from this field since its
predecessor, Cody Energy, LLC, acquired title is approximately $15.2 million, and that the carrying value of this
property is approximately $33.7 million.
Although the investigation into this claim continues, the Company intends to vigorously defend the case. Should the
Company receive an adverse ruling in this case, an impairment review would be assessed to determine whether the
carrying value of the property is recoverable. Management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable
outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable. Accordingly, there has been no reserve
established for this matter.
Raymondville Area
In April 2004, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cody Energy, LLC, filed suit in state court in Willacy County,
Texas against certain of its co-working interest owners in the Raymondville Area, located in Kenedy and Willacy
Counties. In early 2003, Cody had proposed a new prospect under the terms of the Joint Operating Agreement. Some
of the co-working interest owners elected not to participate. The initial well was successful and subsequent wells have
been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well.
The working interest owners who elected not to participate notified Cody that they believed that they had the right to
participate in wells drilled after the initial well. Cody contends that the working interest owners that elected not to
participate are required to assign their interest in the prospect to those who elected to participate. The defendants
have filed a counter claim against the Company, and one of the defendants has filed a lien against Cody’s interest in
the leases in the Raymondville area.
Cody has signed a settlement agreement with certain of the defendants representing approximately 3% of the interest
in the area. Cody and the remaining defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment. In August, 2005, the trial
judge entered an order granting Cody’s Motion for Summary Judgment requiring the remaining defendant to assign to
Cody all of its interest in the prospect and to remove the lien filed against Cody’s interest. The defendant has filed a
Motion for Reconsideration and Opposition to Proposed Order. The court is scheduled to consider these two motions
in December 2005.
Commitment and Contingency Reserves
The Company has established reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve involves an
estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. While
management believes these reserves to be adequate, it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur
approximately $14.9 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established.
Future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of
loss and amounts accrued.
While the outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the
resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or cash flow of the Company. Operating results, however, could be significantly
impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved.

8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITY
The Company periodically enters into derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on
natural gas and crude oil production. At September 30, 2005, the Company had 20 cash flow hedges open: 11 natural
gas price collar arrangements, 2 crude oil price collars and 7 natural gas price swap arrangements. Additionally, the
Company had 2 crude oil financial instruments open at September 30, 2005, that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
At September 30, 2005, a $114.8 million ($70.8 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, along with a $114.6 million short term derivative liability and an $8.9 million long term
derivative liability, which is included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value of
derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in
fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and
Crude Oil and Condensate revenue.
Assuming no change in commodity prices, after September 30, 2005 the Company would reclassify to the Statement
of Operations, over the next 12 months, $65.4 million in after-tax expenditures associated with commodity hedges.
This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at
September 30, 2005 related to remaining anticipated 2005 production and a portion of anticipated 2006 production.
From time to time, the Company enters into natural gas and crude oil swap arrangements that do not qualify for hedge
accounting in accordance with SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet
date. At September 30, 2005, the fair value of the Company’s two open crude oil swap arrangements was $7.3 million,
and is reported as a component of Derivative Contracts in the liability section of the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total loss related to these arrangements was $2.9 million and $12.2 million for the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, and has been reported as a component of
Operating Revenues in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company does not have any required minimum funding obligations for its qualified pension plan in 2005. The
Company, however, has made a $2.0 million discretionary contribution in the first nine months of 2005. Management
has not determined if any additional discretionary funding will be made in the fourth quarter.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation:
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its
subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2005, and the related condensed consolidated statement of
operations for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 and the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. These interim
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and
making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an
audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not
express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We previously audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004; and in our
report dated March 2, 2005, which included an explanatory paragraph related to the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, we expressed unqualified opinions
thereon. The consolidated financial statements and management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting referred to above are not presented herein. In our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated in all material
respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following review of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 should
be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in this Form 10-
Q and with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in the
Cabot Oil & Gas Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Overview
Natural gas revenues increased by $61.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase is due to increased realized natural gas prices as well as
increased production. Oil revenues increased by $22.4 million for the first nine months of 2005 as compared to the
first nine months of 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in oil prices of 40% in the first nine months of
2005 as compared to the first nine months of 2004. Additionally, the unrealized loss on crude oil derivatives
decreased by $11.4 million in the first nine months of 2005 from the comparable prior year period. Somewhat
offsetting the crude oil price increase and the decrease in the unrealized loss was the decrease in crude oil production
in the first nine months of 2005.
In the first nine months of 2005, natural gas prices were higher than the comparable period of the prior year and our
financial results reflect their impact. Our realized natural gas price was $6.16 per Mcf, 21% higher than the $5.10 per
Mcf price realized in the same period of the prior year. These realized prices are impacted by realized losses resulting
from commodity derivatives. For information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices, refer to the
“Results of Operations” section. Commodity prices are determined by factors that are outside of our control.
Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are
affected by changes in market demands, overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, storage
levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, NGLs and
crude oil prices, and therefore, cannot accurately predict revenues.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we produced 62.9 Bcfe compared to production of 63.5 Bcfe for the
comparable period of the prior year, reflecting the deferral of approximately 1.0 Bcfe of expected production from the
two hurricanes that impacted the Gulf Coast in the third quarter of 2005. Natural gas production was 54.8 Bcf and oil
production was 1,346 Mbbls. Natural gas production increased slightly when compared to the comparable period of the
prior year, which had production of 54.2 Bcf. We increased production in all regions except our Gulf Coast region. Our
East region increased production with the success of the increased drilling program in 2004 and 2005. In the West
region, we have had a successful drilling and recompletion program this year. In addition, production in Canada
increased as a result of having a full nine months of production in the current year. These increases are partially
offset by reduced production in our Gulf Coast region as a result of the hurricanes experienced in Louisiana during the
third quarter of 2005 as well as the natural decline of gas production in south Louisiana. Oil production decreased by
186 Mbbls from 1,532 Mbbls in the first nine months of 2004 to 1,346 Mbbls produced in the first nine months of 2005.
The decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the continued natural decline of the CL&F lease in south
Louisiana and decreased production from properties, which are currently producing below capacity, after the impact of
the hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter in Louisiana, including non-operated offshore properties that are
currently shut-in.
We had net income of $89.9 million, or $1.84 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to
net income of $56.2 million, or $1.15 per share, for the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income
is primarily due to increased natural gas and oil production revenues, as discussed above. This increase is partially
offset by an increase in total operating expenses of $30.0 million and an increase in income tax expense of $19.1
million in the first nine months of 2005 as compared to the first nine months of 2004.
In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and
natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. In 2005, we expect to spend
approximately $400 million in capital and exploration expenditures, which includes a layer of investment for new
projects that may arise during the remainder of 2005. This figure has increased by $70 million from $330 million
previously reported in order to reflect increased drilling as well as new projects. During the third quarter of 2005,

we closed on two large producing property acquisitions for interests in fields in the Gulf Coast. For the McCampbell
field acquisition, we spent $41.2 million. The Vernon field acquisition was $18.0 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, $299.7 million of capital and exploration expenditures have been invested in our exploration and
development efforts.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we drilled 229 gross wells (207 development, 18 exploratory and 4
extension wells) with a success rate of 95% compared to 205 gross wells (190 development and 15 exploratory wells)
with a success rate of 97% for the comparable period of the prior year. For the full year, we plan to drill approximately
330 gross wells compared to 256 gross wells in 2004.
We remain focused on our strategies of balancing our capital investments between acceptable risk and strongest
economics, along with balancing longer life investments with impact exploration opportunities. In the current year we
have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions. We
believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value
over the long term.
On February 28, 2005, we announced that the Board of Directors had declared a 3-for-2 split of the Company’s
Common Stock in the form of a stock distribution, distributed on March 31, 2005 to stockholders of record on
March 18, 2005. All common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the
3-for-2 split of our Common Stock.
The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward-looking information. See
“Forward-Looking Information” on page 33.
Financial Condition
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our primary source of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was from funds generated from
operations, as well as borrowings on our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options
under our stock plans. We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations
are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural
gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the
winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties, as described in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K, have influenced prices throughout the recent years. During the third quarter, approximately 1.0 Bcfe of
expected production in our Gulf Coast region was deferred due to the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These
events in Louisiana did not have a material adverse impact on our capital resources or liquidity. Working capital is
substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our
capital and exploration expenditures. See “Results of Operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on
sales. Cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development
expenditures, pay dividends and purchase treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005 we
purchased 19,700 shares of Cabot stock at a weighted average purchase price of $28.99. See below for additional
discussion and analysis of cash flow.

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2005 increased $31.2
million over the comparable period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key
components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs.
Average realized natural gas prices increased 21% over the 2004 period, while crude oil realized prices

increased 40% over the same period. Production volumes decreased slightly with a 1% decline in equivalent
production in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the comparable period in 2004. We are unable to predict future
commodity prices, and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating
activities.
Investing Activities. The key components of cash used by investing activities are capital spending and exploration
expense. We establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices. Due
to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used
in investing activities increased by $97.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to the
same period in 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to proved property acquisitions in the third
quarter and, to a lesser extent, an increase in drilling activity as a result of higher commodity prices.
Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $34.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005. Cash flows used by financing activities were $1.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2004. Cash flows provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2005 were the result of an
increase in book overdrafts, borrowings under the Credit Facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options,
partially offset by dividend payments and the purchases of treasury stock.
At September 30, 2005, we had $10 million of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, which provides for an
available credit line of $250 million, which can be expanded up to $350 million, either with the existing banks or new
banks. It is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil
and gas reserves (as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer) and other assets. The revolving term of the Credit
Facility ends in December 2009. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to
maintain excess borrowing capacity. Management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or
equity offerings, if necessary, our capital requirements, including potential acquisitions.
On August 13, 1998, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our
Common Stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. Subsequent to this announcement, there was a 3-
for-2 split of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result of this stock split, this figure has been adjusted to three
million shares. During the first nine months of 2005, we repurchased 19,700 shares of our Common Stock. All
purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. There is no expiration date associated with
the authorization to repurchase our securities. The approximate number of shares that may yet be purchased under
the plan is 1,918,750. See “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 2 “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds” for additional information.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we paid dividends of $5.3 million on our Common Stock. A regular
dividend of $0.04 per share of Common Stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company
in 1990. We expect to pay additional incremental dividends of approximately $2.0 million in 2005 as a result of the 3-
for-2 stock split.
Capital and Exploration Expenditures
On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas
property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, our revolving Credit Facility. We
budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.

We plan to drill approximately 330 gross wells in 2005. This drilling program includes approximately $400 million in
total capital and exploration expenditures. See the “Overview” discussion for additional information regarding the
current year drilling program. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or
decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon condensed
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted and adopted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. There have
been no changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in the 2004 Form 10-K. See the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, for further discussion.
Results of Operations
Third Quarters of 2005 and 2004 Compared
We reported Net Income in the third quarter of 2005 of $33.8 million, or $0.69 per share. During the corresponding
quarter of 2004, we reported Net Income of $17.8 million, or $0.37 per share. Operating Income increased $24.7
million compared to the prior year, from $34.3 million in the third quarter of 2004 to $59.0 million in the third quarter of
2005. The increase in current year Operating Income was substantially due to an increase in natural gas and oil
production revenues partially offset by an increase in total Operating Expenses. Net Income increased in the current
quarter by $15.9 million due to an increase in Operating Income partially offset by an increase of $9.0 million in
Income Tax Expense.

Natural Gas Production Revenues
Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative
instruments, was $6.77 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $5.07 per Mcf for the
comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced
these prices by $1.26 per Mcf in 2005 and $0.59 per Mcf in 2004. The following table excludes the unrealized loss
from the change in derivative fair value of $0.4 million and the unrealized gain of $0.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the

The increase in Natural Gas Production Revenue is due substantially to the increase in natural gas sales prices.
Partially offsetting this increase was the decrease in production due to decreases in the Gulf Coast region as a result
of the hurricanes in the third quarter as discussed above and natural production declines. The increase in the realized
natural gas price partially offset by the decrease in production resulted in a net revenue increase of $26.1 million,
excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments.

The decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the decreased Gulf Coast production. This is a result of
continued natural decline of the CL&F lease in south Louisiana, as well as the impact of hurricanes which includes the
shutting in and deferring of production at the Breton Sound offshore lease. The increase in the realized crude oil price
combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of $3.4 million, excluding the unrealized
impact of derivative instruments.

Other operating revenues decreased by $1.4 million between the third quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004
primarily due to a decrease in cash received for net profits interest. This variance also results, to a lesser extent, from
changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year third quarter period.
Operating Expenses
Total costs and expenses from operations increased $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the same
quarter of 2004. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•  Exploration expense increased by $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of increased
dry hole expense as well as an increase in other land expenses partially offset by decreased spending for
geological and geophysical costs. During the third quarter of 2005, we incurred $8.9 million more dry hole
expense, mainly as a result of an increase in the Gulf Coast and to a lesser extent in the West region,
compared to the third quarter of 2004.
•  Brokered natural gas costs increased by $4.9 million from the third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2005.
See the preceding table labeled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis.
•  Taxes Other Than Income increased by $4.8 million, or 48%, from the third quarter of 2004 compared to the
third quarter of 2005, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices.
•  Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties decreased by $3.5 million as we incurred no impairment expense during
the current quarter. The costs incurred in the third quarter of 2004 related to a field in south Louisiana. Further
analysis of this impairment is discussed in Footnote 2 “Properties & Equipment” to the financial statements.
•  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization decreased by $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. This is
primarily due to decreased production for the quarter partially offset by an increase in the DD&A rate
associated with the commencement of offshore production in late 2004.
•  Impairment of Unproved Properties increased by $1.0 million over the comparable three months of 2004. This
is due to increased amortization related to unproved property additions both offshore and onshore, including
an increase in our Canadian additions.
•  Direct Operations expense increased by $0.9 million over the third quarter of 2004. This is primarily the result
of an increase over the prior year quarter in expenses for outside operated properties, increased workover
costs and an increase in employee related expenses.
•  General and Administrative expense increased by $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. This increase is
primarily due to increased stock compensation costs of $1.8 million, mainly related to the accrual associated
with the 2004 and 2005 performance share awards. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in
miscellaneous expenses, primarily the reversal of the reserve attributable to litigation that was settled in the
quarter.
25
Table of Contents
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease is the result of increased
interest income on our short term investments. Interest expense related to borrowings under the Credit Facility was
higher in the current quarter due to higher average borrowings. Average borrowings based on month end balances for
the third quarter of 2005 were approximately $52 million compared to approximately $31 million in the third quarter of
2004.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased by $9.0 million due to a comparable increase in our pre-tax income.
Nine Months of 2005 and 2004 Compared
We reported Net Income in the first nine months of 2005 of $89.9 million, or $1.84 per share. During the corresponding
period of 2004, we reported Net Income of $56.2 million, or $1.15 per share. Operating Income increased by $52.0
million in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the prior year. The increase in current year Operating Income was
substantially due to an increase in natural gas and oil production revenues partially offset by an increase in total
Operating Expenses. Net Income increased in the first nine months of 2005 by $33.7 million due to an increase in
Operating Income partially offset by an increase of $19.1 million in Income Tax Expense.
Natural Gas Production Revenues
Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative
instruments, was $6.16 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $5.10 per Mcf for the
comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced
these prices by $0.73 per Mcf in 2005 and $0.57 per Mcf in 2004. The following table excludes the unrealized loss
from the change in derivative fair value of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005
and 2004, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Natural Gas Production
Revenues line item in the Statement of Operations.

The increase in Natural Gas Production Revenue is due substantially to the increase in natural gas sales prices. In
addition, the increase in production was due to the successful drilling programs in the West and East as well as the
commencement of Canada natural gas production late in 2004. Partially offsetting this was the decrease in the Gulf
Coast production. The increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the increase in production resulted in a
net revenue increase of $61.2 million, excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments.

Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues
Our average total company realized Crude Oil Sales Price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments,
was $43.92 per Bbl for the first nine months of 2005 and $31.36 per Bbl for the comparable period of the prior year.
These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $8.93 per Bbl in
2005 and $7.11 per Bbl in 2004. The following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair

The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase
of $11.1 million, excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments. The decrease in oil production is primarily
the result of the decrease in the Gulf Coast region production due to the continued natural decline of the CL&F lease
in south Louisiana, as well as the impact of hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at
the Breton Sound offshore lease.

Other operating revenues decreased $1.9 million from the first nine months of 2004 to the first nine months of 2005.
This change was primarily a result of an increase in our payout liability, associated with the reduction of our interest
due to reversionary interest owned by others, which correspondingly decreased other operating revenues. This
variance also results, to a lesser extent, from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous nine month
period.
Operating Expenses
Total costs and expenses from operations increased $30.0 million in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the
comparable period of 2004. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•  Exploration expense increased $14.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased dry hole expenses
partially offset by decreased spending on geological and geophysical expenses. During the first nine months
of 2005, we spent $6.8 million less on geological and geophysical activities and incurred an additional $20.0
million in dry hole expense. The increase in dry hole expense is mainly due to expenses incurred in Canada
as well as in the Gulf Coast.
•  Taxes Other Than Income increased by $6.9 million from the first nine months of 2004 compared to the first
nine months of 2005, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices.
•  Direct Operations expense increased by $4.7 million over the first nine months of 2004. This is primarily the
result of increased expenses for outside operated properties and workovers. In addition, there was an increase
over the prior year in employee related expenses.
•  Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties decreased by $3.5 million as we incurred no impairment expense in the
current year. The costs incurred in the third quarter of 2004 related to a field in south Louisiana. Further
analysis of this impairment is discussed in Footnote 2 “Properties & Equipment” to the financial statements.
•  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $2.8 million in the first nine months of 2005. This is
primarily due to an increase in offshore DD&A rates associated with the commencement of offshore
production in late 2004 and increased production during the first half of 2005.
•  Impairment of Unproved Properties increased $2.8 million over the comparable quarter of 2004. This is due to
increased amortization related to unproved property additions both offshore and onshore, including an increase
in our Canadian additions.
30
Table of Contents
•  General and Administrative expense increased by $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2005. This increase
is primarily due to increased legal expenses in the first nine months of 2005 over the first nine months of 2004
as well as increased stock compensation expense relating to performance share awards and higher employee
related expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in miscellaneous expenses, primarily
the reversal of the reserve attributable to litigation that was settled in the 2005 period.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2005. This variance is mainly a result of
increased income on our short term investments.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased $19.1 million due to a comparable increase in our pre-tax income.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” This Interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of
conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” A conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be
outside the control of the Company. FIN 47 states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional
asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable. This Interpretation is intended to
provide more information about long-lived assets, more information about future cash outflows for these obligations
and more consistent recognition of these liabilities. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2005. We do not believe that our financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be impacted by this
Interpretation, since we currently record all asset retirement obligations.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-a replacement of APB
Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” In order to enhance financial reporting consistency between periods,
SFAS 154 modifies the requirements for the accounting and reporting of the direct effects of changes in accounting
principles. Under APB Opinion 20, the cumulative effect of voluntary changes in accounting principle was recognized
in Net Income in the period of the change. Unlike the treatment previously prescribed by APB Opinion 20,
retrospective application is now required, unless it is not practical to determine the specific effects in each period or
the cumulative effect. If the period specific effects cannot be determined, it is required that the new accounting
principle must be retrospectively applied in the earliest period possible to the balance sheet accounts and a
corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or another equity account. If the
cumulative effect cannot be determined, it is necessary to apply the new accounting principles prospectively at the
earliest practical date. If it is not feasible to retrospectively apply the change in principle, the reason that this is not
possible and the method used to report the change is required to be disclosed. The statement also provides that
changes in accounting for depreciation, depletion or amortization should be treated as changes in accounting estimate
inseparable from a change in accounting principle and that disclosure of the preferability of the change is required.
SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123(R) revises SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and focuses on accounting for share-based payments for services
provided by employee to employer. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock
options and other equity-based compensation at the grant date. The statement does not require a certain type of
valuation model, and either a binomial or Black-Scholes model may be used. During the first quarter of 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this
standard. In April 2005, the SEC took further action to amend Regulation S-X to state that the provisions of SFAS
123(R) are now effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year
beginning on or after June 15, 2005 for all non-small business issuers. As a result, we will not adopt this SFAS until
the first quarter of 2006. We plan to use the modified prospective application method as detailed in SFAS 123(R). We
are currently evaluating the impact on our operating results. Our future cash flows will not be impacted by the adoption
of this standard. See “Stock-Based Compensation” below for further information.
Additionally, in September 2005, the FASB issued Proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123(R)-c which provides
a simpler, more practical transition election relating to the calculation of the “APIC pool.” The APIC pool is defined as
the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies occurring after the adoption of SFAS 123(R).
Under this Proposed FSP, companies can elect to perform simpler computations to derive the beginning balance of
the APIC pool as well as the impact on the APIC pool of fully vested and outstanding awards as of the SFAS 123(R)
adoption date. The beginning balance can be computed by taking the sum of all tax benefits incurred prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123(R) from stock-based compensation plans less the tax effected (using a blended statutory rate)
pro forma stock-based compensation cost. In addition, increases to the APIC pool for fully vested awards can be
calculated by multiplying the tax rate times the tax benefit of the deduction. The calculation of any awards that are
partially vested or granted after the SFAS 123(R) adoption date will not be affected by this Proposed FSP and will be
calculated in accordance with SFAS 123(R) which requires that only the excess tax benefit or deficiency of the tax
deduction over the
Table of Contents
32
tax effect of the compensation cost recognized should be considered for the APIC pool. Also under the Proposed
FSP, all tax benefits recognized on fully vested awards and the excess tax benefits for partially vested and new
awards will be reported on the Statement of Cash Flows as a component of financing activities. Companies will have
up to one year after adopting SFAS 123(R) to decide to elect and disclose whether they plan to use the alternative
method or the original method prescribed in SFAS 123(R) for the calculation of the APIC pool. If finalized, we will
adopt this Proposed FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123(R).
In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-2, “Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as
defined in FASB Statement No. 123(R).” This FSP provides guidance on the definition and practical application of
“grant date” as described in SFAS No. 123(R). The grant date is described as the date that the employee and
employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award. The other elements of the
definition of grant date are: 1) the award must be authorized, 2) the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or
distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and 3) the employee is
affected by changes in the company’s stock price. To determine the grant date, we are allowed to use the date the
award is approved in accordance with its corporate governance requirements so long as the three elements described
above are met. Furthermore, the recipient cannot negotiate the award’s terms and conditions with the employer and
the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short time period
from the approval date. We will adopt this FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity
Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil
markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our
hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These
hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines.
Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the
hedges. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements.
Hedges on Production – Swaps
From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk
associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price
swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable
price based on a market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under our Revolving Credit
Agreement, which had borrowings of $10 million outstanding at September 30, 2005, the aggregate level of commodity
hedging must not exceed 100% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these
cash flow hedges. During the first nine months of 2005, natural gas price swaps covered 15,375 Mmcf, or 28%, of our
gas production, fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of $5.14 per Mcf.

From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting
in accordance with SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At
September 30, 2005, the fair value of our two open crude oil swap arrangements was $7.3 million, and is reported as a
component of Derivative Contracts in the liability section of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The total loss related to these arrangements was an increase of $2.1 million and a decrease of $1.8 million for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, and has been reported as a component
of Operating Revenues in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Hedges on Production – Options
From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk
associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar
arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index falls below the
floor price, the counterparty pays us. During the first nine months of 2005, natural gas price collars covered 11,753
Mmcf, or 21%, of our 2005 gas production, with a weighted average floor of $5.67 per Mcf and a weighted average
ceiling of $8.68 per Mcf.

We are exposed to market risk on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and
oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized
upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged.
The preceding paragraphs contain forward-looking information concerning future production and projected gains and
losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy
commodities. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 33.
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the current reported period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based
upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective, in all material respects, with respect to the recording, processing, summarizing
and reporting, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, of information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act.
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

On August 13, 1998, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of two million
shares of the Company’s Common Stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. Subsequent to this
announcement, on February 28, 2005, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had declared a 3-for-2 split
of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result of this stock split, this figure has been adjusted to three million shares.
All purchases executed have been through open market transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the
authorization to repurchase securities of the Company. All common stock accounts and per share data have been
retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 3-for-2 split of the Company’s Common Stock.
ITEM 5. Other Information
On October 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
acceleration, to December 15, 2005, of the vesting of 200,299 unvested stock options awarded in February 2003
under the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan and 24,500 unvested stock options
awarded in April 2004 under the Company’s 2004 Incentive Plan.
The 200,299 shares awarded to employees at an exercise price of $15.32, would have vested in February 2006. The
24,500 shares, awarded to the non-employee directors at an exercise price of $23.32, would have vested 12,250 in
April 2006 and April 2007, respectively. Of the 200,299 shares, 91,500 were awarded to the named executive officers.
The decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options, which the Company believes to be in the best
interest of its shareholders and employees, was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative
burden associated with the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R),
“Share Based Payment (revised 2004).” The accelerated vesting of the options will not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company currently accounts for stock-based compensation using
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” under
which the Company has not recognized any compensation expense for its stock option grants. SFAS 123(R) will
require the Company to recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of all equity-based compensation
over the vesting period of each such award beginning on January 1, 2006. The acceleration of vesting will reduce the
Company’s compensation expense related to these options by an estimated $0.2 million for the year 2006.
